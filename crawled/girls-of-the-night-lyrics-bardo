We're getting bored of the nightlife 
Gonna move this night up to where we want it to be 
When I'm down and the girls come 'round, gotta shake the town 
Cause we're feeling kinda funky tonight Look over there (where?), see the guy with the bad hair 
He thinks he's hotti, but he's notti, do we really care 
We hear the club is pumpin', and the bass is really thumpin' 
See the queue (oh no!) we're jumpin'! 
We are the girls of the night, feeling high Me and the girls just wanna have fun tonight 
Feelin' hot, feeling fun with the girls all night 
Takin' time out is what it's all about tonight 
Cause we're feelin' kinda funky x 2 We take the town on without a care, sexy underwear 
Gonna cause some trouble out there 
Lipstick's on and we jump in the car, acting like a star 
Got a feeling this party's alright Look over there (there!) I think I've found the club I swear 
That club is movin' yeah it's groovin', gotta go in there 
With the girls, feels so right Me and the girls just wanna have fun tonight 
Feelin' hot, feeling fun with the girls all night 
Takin' time out is what it's all about tonight 
Cause we're feelin' kinda funky Bridge (To LA) 
We are the girls of the night, feeling high 
We are the girls of the night, feels so right Me and the girls just wanna have fun tonight 
Feelin' hot, feeling fun with the girls all night 
Takin' time out is what it's all about tonight 
Cause we're feelin' kinda funky (repeat to fade)
