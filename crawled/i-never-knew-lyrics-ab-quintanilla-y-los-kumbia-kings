I never knew a love like this before 
I never knew a love like this before For once in my life 
I believed in my heart that I had it all 
A love I can trust 
That would never ever let me fall When suddenly my heart started feeling 
Stares of love that were burning 
Building walls, building walls 
Closing all my doors to love I never knew a love like this before 
How it's burning inside me 
I never knew a love like this before 
How I wish she would know this 
I never knew a love like this before 
She's just killing me slowly 
I never knew a love like this before 
Oh no no no babe Closing my eyes I just think to myself 
Will this nightmare end 
How many tears will I have to cry 
Till her heart does change But I don't want to wait 
I don't need to feel this way 
I just made a big mistake, big mistake 
Taking all her lies again I never knew a love like this before 
How it's burning inside me 
I never knew a love like this before 
How I wish you would know this 
I never knew a love like this before 
She's just killing me slowly 
I never knew a love like this before 
Oh no no no babe Now she's gone 
Cause I'm letting her go 
Now she's gone Now I'm all alone 
Now she's gone 
Away I never knew a love like this before 
How it's burning inside me 
I never knew a love like this before 
How I wish you would know this 
I never knew a love like this before 
She's just killing me slowly 
I never knew a love like this before 
Oh no no no babe (I never knew a love like this) 
I never knew a love like this before 
How it's burning inside me 
(I never knew a love like this) 
I never knew a love like this before 
How I wish you would know this 
(I never knew a love like this) 
I never knew a love like this before 
She's just killing me slowly 
(I never knew a love like this) 
I never knew a love like this before 
Oh no no no babe ........
