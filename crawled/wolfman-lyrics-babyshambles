Listen hard and close 
Why are you morose 
Did you take an overdose 
To the winner's post 
Can you make the chase? 
Internet database 
Webpage, you're outta your face 
I'm in and out of space 
Wolfman 
It's giving me the hump, man 
It's coming like a swamp, man 
I jump when you say jump, man The spitz's on you 
So what you gonna do 
You got a junkie for a mother 
Your dad drank special brew 
From the estate 
You got enough on your plate 
There was a gang in the shadow 
I made the getaway Wolfman 
It's giving me the hump, man 
It's coming like a swamp, man 
I jump when you say jump, man Jump 
Jump 
Jump Get into the vibe 
Slam in a megadrive 
Arcade, the fire denied 
I pulled my flick knives 
Sent into kingdom come 
Alley-cat got your tongue 
Schizoid it's fame on the run 
Wanted by the sun Wolfman 
It's giving me the hump, man 
It's coming like a swamp, man 
I jump when you say jump, man Wolfman
