Last night, as I was walking home 
I passed a tree I could hear Caroline 
Going on somewhere way up on top of the tallest branches 
The solitude 
So I stretch it fill me up 
Through and through 
The solitude 
So I stretch 
If fill me up 
Through and through This morning as I was waking up 
I thought you 
Said some words into my ears 
Burred dress[?] 
My computer [?] 
We're alone 
In your ear 
For connection 
Is it real? 
(We're alone) the silence here some 
(Please fix some of my mistakes)
