Well you were having your fun 
Just lying in the sun 
Now you can stand like a man 
But if you're smart enough you're gonna turn and run 
I can feel it in my heart 
They're gonna feed you to the sharks 
Well it's hard to believe 
You're not the only mouth to feed 
And your sense of adventure's gonna fade 
When you see yourself bleed 
I can feel it in my heart 
They're gonna feed you to the sharks Well take a deep breath 
While you still have one left 
Cause you'll be walking on water 
In the valley of the shadow of death 
And I can feel it in my heart 
They're gonna feed you to the sharks Well you were having your fun 
Just lying in the sun 
Now you can stand like a man 
But if you're smart enough you're gonna turn and run 
I can feel it in my heart 
They're gonna feed you to the sharks
