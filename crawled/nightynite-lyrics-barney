When the sun goes down 
And the stars twinkle 
You're snugly and cuddly and warm in your nest 
It's always nice to say goodnight 
To the nighty-nite things that we'd like best Nighty-nite to little socks 
You fit so snug and you warm our toes 
Nighty-nite to the big clocks 
When it's time for bed, you're the one that knows 
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, shh Nighty-nite to the bright light 
You're the one we need when it's time to read 
But now it's time for bed 
So we'll turn you off instead Oh, bedtimes just wouldn't be the same 
If a nighty-nite things weren't here 
Say goodnight and we close our eyes 
When we wake up they appear Nighty-nite to rocking chair 
For rockabyes you're always there 
Nighty-nite soft cuddly friends 
To zebras, duck and teddy bears They make funny sounds Nighty-nite to play shoes 
When we run and jump you're on our feet 
Nighty-nite to Blankey 
Our snugly friends so warm and sweet 
Oh, if we could we'd sing nighty-nite to everything Oh, bedtimes just wouldn't be the same 
If a nighty-nite things weren't here 
Say goodnight and we close our eyes 
When we wake up they appear When the sun goes down 
And the stars twinkle 
You're snugly and cuddly and warm in your nest 
It's always nice to say goodnight 
To the nighty-nite things that we'd like best
