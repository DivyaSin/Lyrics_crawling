Sinking into myself 
I think that you play 
No, don't dulcify me 
Never known hasty pain 
There was a burnin' twilight in your glance 
There was a shy and womanlike excitation 
Shy white butterfly 
Why can't you fly?! 
No, don't crucify me 
On the crossword of blind 
N' all sighting jealousy 
Other way let you find 
There was a vision: silver lancet in my flesh 
There was a lancet really in you and me too 
It was a vile "not" 
From you I got 
Cry for my smile 
I won't be alive 
Cry more cold lady 
Perhaps we can find yet our lost life 
By sounds of your body 
I'll draw from the nude 
Taking off the silky 
Veil of hell's sisterhood? 
I'm gonna miss your womanlike excitation 
I'm gonna kiss all of your secretest evils 
I open your ill 
Oh, sex-appeal 
Cry for my smile 
I won't be your tears 
Cry more cold lady 
Perhaps we can find yet our lost years 
Deprived all your duties 
As a shred, silver snood 
I feel your smile could be 
Bewitching in the nude 
You should rather kill me 
Never be merciful 
Allsighting jealousy 
Won't take me for a fool 
Who said 
She could make fun of my herself again? 
Nevermore she will do it! Nevermore fan my flame! 
Confess your beauty 
To the powers above 
Why are you unable 
To Love the Love?!
