I want your world to shake 
Your ground moving 
Look into my eyes 
It's like you see right through me 
You'll need a seismograph to measure heartbeats 
I'm an earthquake and I'll tear you apart I live invisible 
Can't possibly control me 
I'm here to shake things up 
I'm making love to a hot beat I bottle it up, I bottle it up 
Always unfulfilled 
I bottle it up, I bottle it up 
Let the pressure build I want your world to shake 
Your ground moving 
Look into my eyes 
It's like you see right through me 
You'll need a seismograph to measure heartbeats 
I'm an earthquake and I'll tear you apart I'm a catastrophe 
You'll notice this about me 
Beautifully wrecked 
I'm unforgettably surrounding I bottle it up, I bottle it up 
Always unfulfilled 
I bottle it up, I bottle it up 
Let the pressure build I want your world to shake 
Your ground moving 
Look into my eyes 
It's like you see right through me 
You'll need a seismograph to measure heartbeats 
I'm an earthquake and I'll tear you apart There are so many pieces to me 
That you carry around in your heart 
We're both so incomplete 
But we fit together perfectly I want your world to shake 
Your ground moving 
Look into my eyes 
It's like you see right through me 
You'll need a seismograph to measure heartbeats 
I'm an earthquake and I'll tear you apart I want your world to shake 
Your ground moving 
Look into my eyes 
It's like you see right through me 
You'll need a seismograph to measure heartbeats 
I'm an earthquake and I'll tear you apart
