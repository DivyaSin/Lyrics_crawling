Combufree: 
At Notre Dame 
The sections are prepared! 
Fuelly: 
At rue de Bac 
They're straining at the leash! 
Couferac: 
Students, workers, everyone 
There's a river on the run 
Like the flowing of the tide 
Paris coming to our side! 
Enjolras: 
The time is near... 
So near. it's stirring the blood in their veins! 
And yet beware... 
Don't let the wine go to your brains! 
For the army we fight is a dangerous foe 
With the men and the arms that we never can match 
Oh, it's easy to sit here and swat 'em like flies 
But the national guard will be harder to catch. 
We need a sign 
To rally the people 
To call them to arms 
To bring them in line! 
Marius, you're late. 
Jean Provaire: 
What's wrong today? 
You look as if you've seen a ghost. 
Grantaire: 
Some wine and say what's going on! 
Marius: 
A ghost you say... a ghost maybe 
She was just like a ghost to me 
One minute there, and she was gone! 
Grantaire: 
I am agog! 
I am aghast! 
Is Marius in love at last? 
I have never heard him 'ooh' and 'aah' 
You talk of battles to be won 
But here he comes like Don Ju-an 
It's better than an o-per-a! 
Enjolras: 
It is time for us all 
To decide who we are... 
Do we fight for the right 
To a night at the opera now? 
Have you asked of yourselves 
What's the price you might pay? 
Is it simply a game 
For rich young boys to play? 
The color of the world 
Is changing 
Day by day... 
Red - the blood of angry men! 
Black - the dark of ages past! 
Red - a world about to dawn! 
Black - the night that ends at last! 
Marius: 
Had you been there tonight 
You might know how it feels 
To be struck to the bone 
In a moment of breathless delight! 
Had you been there tonight 
You might also have known 
How the world may be changed 
In just one burst of light! 
And what was right 
Seems wrong 
And what was wrong 
Seems right... 
Grantaire: 
Red... 
Marius: 
I feel my soul on fire! 
Grantaire: 
Black... 
Marius: 
My world if she's not there... 
Chorus: 
Red... 
Marius 
The color of desire! 
Chorus: 
Black... 
Marius: 
The color of despair! 
Enjolras 
Marius, you're no longer a child 
I do not doubt you mean it well 
But now there is a higher call 
Who cares about your lonely soul 
We strive toward a larger goal 
Our little lives don't count at all! 
Enjolras and Chorus: 
Red - the blood of angry men! 
Black - the dark of ages past! 
Red - a world about to dawn! 
Black - the night that ends at last!
