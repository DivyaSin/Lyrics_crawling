Well, I'd like to think I'm the mess you'd wear with pride 
Like some empty dress on the bed you've laid out for tonight 
Maybe I'll tell you sometime 
Time 
Sometime 
And you were right 
Right You were right 
Outside by your doorstep 
In a worn-out suit and tie 
I'll wait 
For you to come down 
Where you'll find me 
Where we'll shine 
Oh
