There's always tomorrow to bring us a smile 
Maybe we should borrow that thought for a while 
For then we'll both remember that life is but a game 
We'll fan the dying ember and coax it into flame Tomorrow we'll borrow a thought from a song 
To capture the rapture of days that are gone 
For when we're reunited we'll have a bit to say 
Tomorrow was yesterday Tomorrow was yesterday
