Stay awake 
And look into our future 
Just breathe my name 
And let the music come alive We get into shkraps 
Wherever we go 
Hold onto your girls 
Before we grab them bro We party it up 
Till last call 
We dont give a fuck 
We came to brawl All i wanna do is party 
Feel up your body 
Fist pump like pauly d 
Were growing up gotti Shes looking so hot hot 
Gotta get them some shots shots 
Bring her back to my spot 
Show her what i got All i wanna do is party 
Feel up your body 
Fist pump like pauly d 
Were growing up gotti Dance like you fuck 
Strange love
