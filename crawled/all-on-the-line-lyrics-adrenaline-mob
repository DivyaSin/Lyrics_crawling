I feel Im not the same. Im alive but somethings changed. 
Like every leaf that is falling to the ground. 
It's still alive, but not the same. Oh no oh no 
These are the times we all feel pain. 
A helping hand would be nice to feel again. 
For a simple man who's down on his knees so Im begging you please 
Wont you help me understand 
Come on and shine your light on me, I need a friend to help me see 
Cause every time I open my eyes 
I know I dont wanna wake up and make the same mistakes. 
It happens to me all the time. 
If I lie, I lose it all. If I stand or if I fall, Ive got to lay it all on the line. 
I see a child at play. I feel her struggle through each and every day. 
Even though I know that you are miles away 
Im just dying to hear you say hello. 
I get so lost in my disease. Im missing precious memories. 
Every time I open my eyes. 
I know I dont wanna wake up and make the same mistakes 
It happens to me all the time. 
If I lie, I lose it all. If I stand or if I fall, Ive got to lay it all on the line. 
And I swear this time, Ill get it right. 
And I swear this time, Im gonna lay it all out on the line, on the line. 
Oh, we get so lost in what to bes 
We live and die. We try to please. 
But every time I open my eyes. 
I know I dont wanna wake up and make the same mistakes. 
It happens to me all the time. 
If I lie, I lose it all. If I stand or if I fall, Ive got to lay it all on the line.
