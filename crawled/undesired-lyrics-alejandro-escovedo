We fought in Paris, fought in Rome 
Beneath the lights of the Astrodome 
Baby, didn't we now Drank to peace, to ourselves 
Poured the poison, drank a toast to health 
Baby, didn't we now Sailed the island in a fishing boat 
Share our secrets and we held them close 
Baby, yeah you know we did Pledged our hearts, drank the tears 
Stood up to every monster there 
Baby, yeah you know we did Sing a song for the undesired 
Send this out to the lonely lovers 
Sing a song for the undesired 
For all young lovers who walk beside her 
It ain't easy Broke the needle, the microphone 
Betrayed our love 
A million miles from home 
Baby, didn't we know Sing a song for the undesired 
Send this out to the lonely lovers 
Sing a song for the undesired 
For all young lovers who walk beside her 
It ain't easy 
It ain't easy, no it ain't easy 
It ain't easy 
It ain't easy 
It ain't easy
