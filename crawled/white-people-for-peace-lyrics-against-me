East and West could not agree 
So their generals gave call, gathered troops at the border 
With guns at ready, drawn and aimed 
Each side was praying to a God to bless them with strength and courage 
It was in His name artillery lit the sky on fire 
The people sang protest songs to try and stop the soldier's gun Protest songs in response to military aggression 
Protest songs to try and stop the soldier's gun 
But the battle raged on Sirens filled the air, and the ground shook with war 
Civilian casualties had been a cost that was predetermined 
When interviewed for report, victims pleaded in frustration 
Their claim: that this was a war without reason 
And bureaucrats engaged in debate to try and reach a resolution 
The people sang protest songs to try and stop the soldier's gun Protest songs in response to military aggression 
Protest songs to try and stop the soldier's gun 
Protest songs in response to military aggression 
Protest songs to try and stop the soldier's gun 
But the battle raged on While the broadcast, like their prayers, went unanswered and ignored 
God, like the rest of the world, just watched in silence 
There was purpose to be served, there were fortunes to be earned 
Before a peace could be called to stop the fighting, they sang... Protest songs in response to military aggression 
Protest songs to try and stop the soldier's gun 
Protest songs in response to military aggression 
Protest songs to try and stop the soldier's gun 
Protest songs in response to military aggression 
Protest songs to try and stop the soldier's gun 
Protest songs in response to military aggression 
Protest songs to try and stop the soldier's gun 
But the battle raged on
