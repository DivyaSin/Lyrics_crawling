When we broke up, I acted sad 
I made pretend that you had hurt me bad 
You ate my heart, I grinned, I held up my chin 
Because I knew someday we're gonna love again 
Someday we're gonna love again 
(scat singing alternating with title) I didn't know you got it when you left 
I knew that I could take care of myself 
You wouldn't be gone long, nothing could go wrong 
Because I knew someday were' gonna love again 
Someday we're gonna love again 
(scat singing alternating with title) You just told me that your love had changed 
& that's why I'd love to arrange 
To see you again, I don't know when 
But I do know someday we're gonna love again 
Someday we're gonna love again 
(scat singing alternating with title, fading out)
