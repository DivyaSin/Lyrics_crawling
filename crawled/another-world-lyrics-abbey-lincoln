Within some walls of stone 
Another world is waiting for it's own 
Another time, another world, another world The magic that is shown 
Is or for another world 
Dimensions still unknown 
Beyond the pale, horizoned veil 
A world unknown A technologic sphere 
With tones and music's chords to hear 
For conversations far away 
With ships that fly and lights that play The years that come and go 
Are bringing us another world to know 
Maybe a laugh, perhaps a frown 
A way to go, a common ground, another world Another time has come 
Another world is here to meet the sun 
A digit here, a circle there, a life to share Another time is here 
Another dawn that whispers in my ears 
A different sound, a point of view, a shade of blue The strangest thing to see 
Are things with you and me 
Lost somewhere in the night 
A song of love, the guiding light A time has come and gone 
Some memories are captured in a song 
Some stories told, an artist's hand 
Something to find among the sand 
Something to hold, remembering 
Another world, another world, another world
