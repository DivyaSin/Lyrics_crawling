There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up 
You said everything you'll ever say 
There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring 
Anxiety's calling in my head Is it back again? 
Are you back again? Don't wake me up before you leave 
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed (woah oh oh oh) 
I feel your hand unlock the door 
Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil (woah oh oh oh) What's the point of saying sorry now 
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (while fighting my way out)
