They say I make too much money, to fit in my pocket 
Everyone wants to but no one can top it 
I meet more people in a week on the line 
Than one man can dream of in his whole lifetime [Chorus] 
Can you understand, I'm an average man 
Tryin' to make a livin' do the best that I can 
Can you understand, I'm an average man 
But my name is in lights, lights, lights They stop and stare at our houses and farms 
They settled for less, we reached for the stars 
They're wishin' not workin' and that's not the way 
For what comes too easy is thrown away [Chorus] We got the future to win, nothing to lose 
What's done is behind us, we live how we choose 
Everyone's different, but one thing's the same 
You can't be a winner if you don't play the game Can you understand, I'm an average man 
Tryin' to make a livin' do the best that I can 
Can you understand, I'm an average man 
But my name is in lights
