I grew up in Orange County 
In the shadow of a mouse 
Watched the sky light up 
From the rooftop of my house Things seemed so subtle 
Off Katella Avenue 
Living in a city 
With so many things to do This is a town where nothing goes 
This is a town where a mind can't grow 
This kind of town gets in your face 
This is a town like any other place Again, I'm losing again I went to a shrink, I was so messed up 
10 hours of therapy, 1500 bucks 
I asked him, doctor whats the matter with me? 
He said, you're an addict, it's so plain to see This is a town where they kiss and tell 
This is a town that I know too well 
This kind of town gets in your face 
This is a town like any other place Again, I'm losing again This is a town where they kiss and tell 
This is a town that I know too well 
This kind of town gets in your face 
This is a town like any other place 
This is a town where nothing goes 
This is a town where a mind can't grow 
This kind of town gets in your face 
This is a town like any other place
