In the middle of the night 
When the angels scream 
I don't wanna live a life 
That I believe 
Time to do or die I will never forget 
The moment, the moment 
I will never forget 
The moment And the story goes on, on, on That's how the story goes You and I'll never die 
It's a dark embrace 
In the beginning was a life 
Of a dawning age Time to be alive I will never forget 
The moment, the moment 
I will never forget 
This night we sing we sing on, on, on That's how the story goes 
That's how the story goes 
That's how the story goes 
That's how the story goes 
Let it go
