Candellabras light your ancient eyes 
Well hope may live but passion lies 
Upon your lips scratched out in blue 
All loves lies are impromptu 
But all of the stars in the darkness- 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Twenty thousand midnight trains will run 
Past your window, tears will come, do you 
Whose eyes refuse to see, pass the test of history 
But all of the stars in the darkness- 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
The heavens are spinning, they're shooting down at us across the sky 
But still you are looking, and pointing 
You don't know why, the signs are in the sky, that's love! 
But all of the stars in the darkness 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Give me a sign, a sign of love 
Give me a sign, a sign of love....
