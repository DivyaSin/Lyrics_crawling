Piggy Roy was a sugar trader, living on the brink 
Couldn't make enough of it, dealing on King street 
It was a hard hard time, near the store that named a town 
It was a hard hard time, on the dark side of Newtown 
On the dark side of Newtown 
Jessie she married Fred in April across from Newtown station 
They took the horse-drawn tram right up to the celebration 
Together nearly 40 years when Fred he departed 
Jessie dressed in widow's weeds round Newtown thereafter 
It was a hard hard time, near the store that named a town 
It was a hard hard time, on the bad side of Newtown 
On the bad side of Newtown 
Tommy died in the infirmary, he was buried by a tree 
Near the track of the Eora, in a grave that can't be seen 
There's paupers in a graveyard, on the city surround 
You know poverty is spreading, there's an epidemic in Newtown 
Chop a load 'baker's wood', with a felling axe, 
load it on a donkey dray, with a pile of knickknacks 
Make a pound note bet at a dishlicker meet 
Watch the coat-tugger lose if its a dead-heat 
Chorus 
It was a hard hard time, near the store that named a town 
It was a hard hard time, on the bad side of Newtown 
On the bad side of Newtown 
On the bad side of Newtown
