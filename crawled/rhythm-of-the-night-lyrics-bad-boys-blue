I watched the sun beating down on the boulevard 
Neon light shining so bright on hot melted tar 
This is the certain place where I love to stay 
Street life is calling to me, till the break up day 
I am waiting for you with your sexy eyes 
While the people are passing by 
Feel the rhythm of the night 
Feel the heat 
Feel the rhythm of the night 
Feel the heat 
Celebration, celebration time 
Keep on dancing, it's celebration time 
Beautiful people are ready to meet in the heat 
Body to body vibrations are over the street 
I am waiting for you with your sexy eyes 
While the people are passing by 
Feel the rhythm of the night 
Feel the heat 
Feel the rhythm of the night 
Feel the heat 
Celebration, celebration time 
Keep on dancing, it's celebration time 
I am waiting for you with your sexy eyes 
While the people are passing by 
Feel the rhythm of the night 
Feel the heat 
Feel the rhythm of the night 
Feel the heat 
Celebration, celebration time 
Keep on dancing, it's celebration time 
Feel the rhythm of the night 
Feel the heat 
Feel the rhythm of the night 
Feel the heat...
