Just like mercury jones 
Styles change 
I stay the same 
Just like mercury jones 
Message fly 
Through the door 
And just like mercury jones 
Breathing all the evil to your mother's bones 
Now he's knocking at your door 
Better come back to the giver of the loan Just like mercury jones 
Trap door 
And the troubadours 
Just like mercury jones 
I'm making the myth 
Spirits split 
Just like mercury jones 
Tingling spine 
And the razor lips 
Now he's knocking at your door 
Better come back to the giver of your loan Now he's dreaming of the daisies 
Falling back to the cages of runs
