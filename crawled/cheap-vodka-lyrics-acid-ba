I blew my last five on a cheap fifth of vodka 
Gonna kill somethin' there ain't nothin' gonna stop us tonight 
I know about confusion 
Let's start a riot let's start a war 
Everybody that you know is a whore 
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it I don't care 
If there's gonna be blood we'll be there 
I know about confusion 
Turn all the lights 
So I can watch it die 
I'm gonna taste some blood 
Before they close my eyes 
Cause I got the answer 
One bullet 
I know how you feel 
Cut out my eyes so I can't see 
This cold thing that's swallowing me 
We're meat and that's it so let's fuck it
