Time can make lonely a fools paradise 
Thought I was in heaven, alone every night 
Before I met you I was perfect 
Perfectly Blue Change doesnt come easy for the good or the bad 
Honey youre the best thing that Ive ever had 
Before I met you I was perfect 
Perfectly blue I used to cry out in the sun 
To the dark side of a love I was accustomed 
Then you came along 
And turned my whole world 
Upside down, upside down Im lost in your sweet love, aint cried for days 
Its so hard to be lonesome with a smile on my face 
Before I met you I was perfect 
Perfectly blue Chorus Oh, before I met you I was perfect 
Perfectly blue
