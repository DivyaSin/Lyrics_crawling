Oh my heart 
That you stole so long ago 
Has returned to me this day 
So full and empty 
Oh this dream 
That we shared through all extremes 
In a hunt for what it means 
To heal by fire 
Endless eyes 
The immovable did bend 
In the presence of your strength 
In the gifted joy of your intent 
It's killing me that I must go on living 
Just to fill this cup of promise 
With meaning 
It's tearing me apart we're so connected 
It's the you in me 
Each day I'm resurrected 
Truth and lies 
Melt away when something's real 
To be blinded by your eyes 
That is so twisted 
Never swayed 
Look at all the seeds you layed 
Shamelessly so unafraid 
To face the devil 
Endless eyes 
The immovable did bend 
In the presence of your strength 
In the gifted joy of your intent 
It's killing me that I must go on living 
Just to fill this cup of promise 
With meaning 
It's tearing me apart we're so connected 
It's the you in me 
Each day I'm resurrected
