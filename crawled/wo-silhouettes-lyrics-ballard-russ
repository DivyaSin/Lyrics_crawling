It's been too clear for so long, I knew that there was something going on 
Wanted to know what it's about, walked to your door, so we could talk it out 
And as I got to your door that night, what did I see through the bedroom light Chorus: 
Two silhouettes, standing at the window 
Two silhouettes, standing face to face 
I turned away, didn't want to see, there ain't no more sadder sight to me 
Than two silhouettes, yeah, ain't stopped crying yet, no 
Still can't believe it yet, no, two silhouettes The sight it stayed in my head, and through the night, as I lay on my bed 
I wonder what do I do, just tell me how will I make it through 
Somehow I wish that we'd never met, I'm telling you that I won't forget [Chorus] I will be waiting, if you decide that you want me 
I will come running, if that's the way you want it to be, yeah Two silhouettes, standing at the window - standing at the window 
Two silhouettes, standing face to face - face to face out of place 
I turned away, didn't want to see, there ain't no more sadder sight to me, ooh 
Than two silhouettes, yeah, ain't stopped crying yet, no Still can't believe it yet, no 
Two silhouettes, yeah - baby what you doin' to me 
Ain't stopped crying yet, no - baby won't you set me free 
Still can't believe it yet, no - don't wish you'd feel the same about me 
Two silhouettes, yeah, ain't stopped crying yet, no 
Still can't believe it yet, no
