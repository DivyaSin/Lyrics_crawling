Time makes its incision, 
The night is bound to fall. Everything oozes, edge of a razor, check it and bleed. The moon will shed its shadow, 
And look just like the sun. Everything oozes, edge of a razor, check it and bleed. The dark one has a light spot, 
That's how they can relate. Everything oozes, edge of a razor, check it and bleed.
