I've been so many places in my life and time 
I've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad rhyme 
I've acted out my love on stages, with millions people watching me 
Now we're alone and now I'm singin' this song to you I love you in a place where there's no space and time 
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine 
And when my life is over, remember when we were together 
We were alone and I was singin' this song to you You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin' 
You came out in front and I was hide, hiding 
But now I'm so much better, if my words don't come together 
Listen to the melody, because my love is in there hiding I know your image of me is not what I hoped to be 
I treated you unkindly baby, oh can't you see? 
There's no one more important to me, please can't you see through me? 
Now we're alone and I'm singin' this song to you Now we're alone and I'm singin' this song to you 
Now we're alone and I'm singin' this song, I'm singin' it to you 
Yes I am, I'm singin' to you, baby Singin' to you, baby, only you baby 
Ohh yeah, I'm singin' this song for you
