How Y'all Doing Out There Tonight? 
Yes, I Love You Too. 
I Just Wanna Talk To The Ladies Tonight. 
For All You Ladies, That Done Had Your Heart Broken, 
I Done Had My Heart Broken To, So I Can Relate, Ya Know. 
So If Its OK Wit You, I'm Just Gonna Break It Down For The Fellas, 
That Don't Know That They Cant Just Break A Women's Heart. 
Alright? So Check It Out. I Gave You All Of My Love, All To You. 
And You Don't Appreciate The Things That I Do. 
I Gave You All Of My Time, Cause You Blew My Mind. 
I Let You Do Me Wrong, Cause Love Had Me So Blind. I Was So Strong, But I'm All Grown Up 'N', 
I'm Dumb By Love 'N', I Used To Love You. 
You Tried To Play Me And Then Persuade me. 
I Still Remember The Pain You Gave Me. 
I Cant Believe You, I Gotta Leave You. 
I'm Packing Up 'N' You Can Hit The Road Jack. 
You Can Take These Things That You Gave Me, 
Cause I'm Never Coming Back. All I Wanted, Was A Little Love. 
But You Chose To Hang Out All Night With The Boys. 
So What Are You Saying?(Quit Wasting My Time) 
Trying To Claim Something That Ain't Even Mine. I Was So Strong, But Im All Grown Up 'N', 
I'm Dumb By Love 'N', I Used To Love You. 
You Tried To Play Me And Then Persuade me. 
I Still Remember The Pain You Gave Me. 
I Cant Believe You, I Gotta Leave You. 
I'm Packing Up 'N' You Can Hit The Road Jack. 
You Can Take These Things That You Gave Me, 
Cause I'm Never Coming Back. [Repeats] 
Why You Hurt Me? 
Why You Hurting Me So Bad? 
Gave You My Time, You Played With My Mind. 
Why You Wanna Make Me Sad?
