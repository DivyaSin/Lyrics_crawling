Let there be a volume, that cannot, be denied. 
Let there be an emotion, that you cannot fake. 
Greatness, unanimously acknowleged. 
Or a lie, that you just cannot tell. 
Let them know hatred, fear, and war. 
Let there be peace for us all. 
With our goals one day met, 
let us know a feeling of great accomplishment, 
with our failures complete, 
let us learn to survive. Oh, your body will know, 
if it's not the right way to go. 
Just listen closely, to your heart and follow. 
You must be willing, to abandon it all; 
You must be willing to starve. Let us challenge, the wait, for a day of reckoning. 
Let us deny, shame and guilt. 
Let us know with absolute certainty, 
that we were fools to ever second, guess ourselves. 
Let us know a feeling of invincibility. 
As real, as our, fragile bones. 
There's a truth to be learned, you know I'm sure of it. 
Just like I know, there is nothing at all. Oh, your body will know, 
if it's not the right way to go. 
Just listen closely, to your heart and follow. 
You must be willing, to abandon it all; 
You must be willing to starve.
