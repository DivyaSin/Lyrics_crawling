Passion in my eyes, I lived it everyday, but how could you go throw it all away? 
In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true 
As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do (finish you) I feel it burn inside, burn like the rising sun 
Lifted into the sky, took away the only thing I loved 
I know after tonight all your power crumbles in my arms 
So don't worry, I'll be fine, when my life ends, I'll leave this scar A smoking gun in your hand, now don't you realize what you've done 
Put a bullet in his back, your hero since you were so young 
How could you kill the man who brought salvation through your pain 
He must mean everything to end it all this shameful way I started here so young and helped you get along 
Just did it for the love, and people healed through us 
Don't live your life in vain, don't take it out on me 
You're cracked, so just remember, I'm not your enemy 
I don't deserve to fall this way, by a man who felt betrayed
