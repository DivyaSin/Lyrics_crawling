Come gather round me people, here's a story you never heard 
'bout me and my friends and some things that occurred 
We thought we'd get some money, we thought that we might go 
Spend a weekend pleasant down in mexico I was workin at mcdonalds, doin' the latenight run 
When a car pulled up the drive through and pointed out a gun 
Said give us all your money and three big macs to go 
I stuffed them all in a bag and I ducked down below Well the boss got angry when he found out I didn't call the police 
I guess I was kinda nervous, there was a warrant out on me 
Concernin' some jaywalkin tickets I couldn't afford to pay 
Needless to say I got the axe that same day Well me bein' outta work just then I didn't wanna go home 
My mom said if I lost this job I'd have to go out on my own 
So I went over to dave's house and got really stoned 
Called up some girls but none o' them were home Steve came over and he brought some alcohol 
We're all gettin really depressed just starin' at the wall 
Thought we'd get some money, we thought that we might go 
Spend a weekend pleasant down in mexico Steve's dad had a huntin' rifle and we went and picked it up 
And we stopped into the 7-11 to try our luck 
We raised up that huntin' rifle but the counter guy just laughed 
As he pulled out an uzi we turned and hauled ass We were runnin so fast 'til we came to the mcdonalds where I used to work 
We walked up to the drive through and gave my boss a jerk 
Said give us all your money and three big macs to go 
And suck on this you weasel we're goin to mexico Down south we all got really wasted, dave got a case of the runs 
We're all really hungover and gettin low on funds 
Dave and steve called their parents and took the bus back home 
Me, I got a job at mcdonalds down in mexico
