Back in the days, I never snatched pocket books 
I just snatch your mind up with the flow and the hook 
That's right, be on alert, comin' faster 
Corny MC's, body snatcher with the rapture 
Dismember your body like I was a raptor 
Pluck your eyes out, so you can't see my laughter Don't care how many gold and platinum plaques you got 
I put my foot in your ass up in the spot 
A beast break necks, that's right, you couldn't sit through 
I'm bone crushin' on the mic like a Pitbull 
Foamin' at the mouth, ferocious to start again Rockin' hard body cardigan with the Timberlands 
PF drop the beat, Afu drop the grammar 
Was swift with the gift, old school like cold bangers 
The five mic slangin', head bangin', chitty, chitty bang bangin' 
Name your whole rap crew like I'm gang bangin' You ain't no gangsta rapper, you'se an amateur 
I seen you back in the days, they used to laugh at you 
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a poser 
I grab the mic and do it like it's supposed to You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a wanksta 
I schooled you back in the days, you just a prankster 
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur 
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at you Am I brother's keeper? Don't get swept beneath the rug 
Stomp these posers out like they water bugs 
Tired of these rappers with these ice mugs 
Claimin' that they spitting slugs but they spitting duds Tired of these fake thugs, that's lighter than feathers 
With all that nonsense, they puttin' together, screamin', "Murder, murder" 
I thought they would of learned from Biggie and 2Pac 
That you can bring to life, what you spittin' in your art You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you'se a wanksta 
I schooled you back in the days, you just a prankster 
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur 
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at ya It's Mr. Spectacular, tacular 
'Bout to swat that ass out the sky like he gammara 
The flex of ego on your little pedestals 
In front of your people, now what you wanna do? You ain't no gangsta rapper, you'se an amateur 
I seen you back in the days, they used to laugh at you 
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a poser 
I grab the mic and do it like it's supposed to You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a wanksta 
I schooled you back in the days, you just a prankster 
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur 
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at you You can't stop this hard rock, rock, ready to rock this 
I got lyrical ability to bring you hot shit 
I swat so many cats, it's rainin' birds 
'Cause I'm cold as ice, forget the ice in ya watch, kid Spit more flames than the back of a rocket 
Mic check, one, two, linin' up my targets 
I be the mad man in front of the cam 
That be stealin' ya fans, yup, up on the red carpet Make more connections than Nextel, ring the bell 
My first connection, make you fuckin' lips swell 
Make more noise than a terrorist attack 
I'm dangerous like anthrax, my voice burn up the wax Against the way, I put myself up on the map 
I'm a dope MC, I put the squeeze on the dope tracks 
Body care free on the dope tracks 
A hundred 'round banana clip, leave you where you at You ain't no gangsta rapper, you'se an amateur 
I seen you back in the days, they used to laugh at you 
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a poser 
I grab the mic and do it like it's supposed to You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a wanksta 
I schooled you back in the days, you just a prankster 
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur 
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at you
