You've got to let it go 
You say you know more then you want to know 
Feeling traumatized 
The way she put it down was not for your eyes 
It was just another letter after all you should know better 
You've got to let it slide I just want to love you 
Think its time you finally realize [Chorus] 
I didn't do it 
She only wants to get between you and me 
I cant believe it 
There's no reason for this jealousy 
Don't say its to late to set the record straight 
I didn't do it, no I didn't do it 
Its just a letter Your misconception plays 
You let her words just take us separate ways 
Don't over analyze 
Shes just somebody trying to get you with her lies 
Its just another letter you should know better 
You're still my everything 
So I've met her baby that don't mean a thing [Chorus] She made up this one sided rendezvous 
I'm sorry it had to come back to you 
The flowers the pictures I cant explain 
I'm trying my best so don't turn away [Chorus]
