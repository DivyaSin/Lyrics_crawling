What 
Toss it, toss it- toss it- toss it up What 
Throw yo hands up 
All of the open mics to all worldwide clubs 
Toss it up 
MC's Bomb the Blocks say 
Toss it up, what 
Breakbeat pops a lock say (x2) So, this is where the party at 
I need room 
Move a little bit and groove cos' honeydew 
Can you serve it up like cups of gin and juice 
Don't slap me cos' I'm not in the mood 
(??) in the ladies' room 
Got to keep the game on tight, yes I do 
Uubahda ah da hallabag 
Take me to a telly and rocks a watta What 
Throw yo hands up 
All of the open mics to all worldwide clubs 
Toss it up 
MC's Bomb the Blocks say 
Toss it up, what 
Breakbeat pops a lock say (x2)
