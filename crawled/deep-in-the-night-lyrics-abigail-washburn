Deep in the night 
I hear the darkness 
Bones tell the body 
Rest in its arms I hear the calling 
Of life's sweet embrace 
Resting too soon Deep in the night 
I feel the stardust 
Blue tells the heavens 
Fall from the sky I feel the shadows 
Of time's own longing 
Falling away Deep in the night 
I pray a candle 
To tell the snowfall 
Wait for sunrise I pray a halo 
Of man's cold morning 
Holds to the light I pray a halo 
Of man's cold morning 
Holds through the night
