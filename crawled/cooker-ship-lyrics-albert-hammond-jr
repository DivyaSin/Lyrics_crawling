EVERYONE GOES WHEN THEY 
TELL YOU TO LEAVE 
AND THEY WANT YOU TO KNOW 
BUT THEY WANT YOU TO BE 
WHEN THEY ASK YOU TO SIT 
AND THEY TOLD YOU TO STAND 
BUT YOU COULDN'T GET UP 
CAUSE YOU COULDN'T HAVE RAN 
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE TIME 
HASN'T COME 
THAT THE BULLDOZER BIZ THAT 
THEY ASKED ME TO FUND 
WAS JUST TO STEAL YOUR DIVIDENDS GREAT COOKER SHIP 
HOW DID I GET IN A JAM LIKE THIS EVERYONE WALKS WHEN THEY 
TELL YOU TO RUN 
WHEN THEY WANT YOU TO STAND 
BUT THEY MEAN THAT YOU WON 
WHEN THEY ASKED YOU TO BE 
WHAT THEY TOLD YOU TO SEE 
WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO BE 
BUT I COULDN'T BELIEVE 
EVERYONE SAW THAT THE THING 
WASN'T RIGHT 
BUT THE THINGS THAT YOU DO 
WHEN YOU WANT ME AT NIGHT 
AND I KNOW THAT YOUR THING 
WASN'T DRAGGING A BIT 
WHEN YOU ASKED ME FOR A GREAT COOKER SHIP.
