Rap para 1 (Dijaay Aadi) : 
When a kid screams 
he has a message and a dream 
and when he cries he do have a vision 
and some needs 
and when a bosnian child cry 
no one can help dah growin seed 
and what we did 
we jus ate and drank 
spend hundreds and thousands from 
the huge big banks 
and we dont see when our fellows are 
undergoin through explosion of 
atomic big bang 
if i would have sung these words no 
one would have understand 
as now everywhere i see the drunks 
so um spittin it in my way 
ive chosen hiphop as my way so i 
can jus yell and tell how do i feel 
when a fire ray strikes the land and 
breaks it into states and thats 
what they do 
hire some f**** mates to change 
the fates of the countries and blowin 
the green trees into hot steam 
they are the meanest shit hidden eve 
n on the main stream 
they are the one who have flourished 
by takin muslim cream 
we dont need any payback jus do a favour 
and stop the unbroken screams 
Chorus) Ahsan) When i see i see 
the shattered dreams 
when i listen i listen to unbroken screams 
screams screams unbroken screams

Rap 3 ) (Dijaay Aadi) : 
And when you want peace in the world 
you ought to break the bones 
and to break the bones you have to use ur 
furious f** drones 
they will fire the bomb wether its mornin or 
the dawn and 
when the people stand up they rebel and 
throw the stones. 
they are considered as the villain of the film and UN mournes 
And um sayin it swearly the word peace 
is now meanin less and its gone 
and they just lie about the friendship when 
they spittin on the phone 
i could have done freestyle but ive chosen 
a flow and a tone 
Enough is enough and please just dont kill 
the young ones who are born,, we can 
tolerate everything but how to burry our own 
young broken corns 
Chorus (Ahsan)
