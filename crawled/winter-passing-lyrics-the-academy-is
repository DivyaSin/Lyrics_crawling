Its winter again, 
a white washed and frozen sky. 
I came to the door, 
eyes maladjusted from the light. 
But your voice rang clear. 
You said, "For all I thought Id ever need, 
its hard to face the holidays without..." Well Ive left my last message on your machine. 
Its hard to face the holidays when youre looking for the words to say. 
When youre looking for the words to say. So you found a friend 
to spend all your cold nights with him.

with traces of my scent. And Id say "For all I thought Id ever need, 
its hard to face the holidays without." Well Ive left my last message on your machine. 
Its hard to face the holidays when youre looking for the words to say. So stay with me here, 
nose to nose, 
cold enough to see as our breath 
slowly escapes and exchanges 
from my lungs to yours, 
from your mouth to mine.

nose to nose, 
cold enough to see as our breath, 
looking for the words to say, 
when youre looking for the words to say....
