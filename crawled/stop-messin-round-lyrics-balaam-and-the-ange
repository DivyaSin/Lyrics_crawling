I may be crazy 
I may be blind enough to be 
The kind of fool that 
Can never see 
Beyond persuasion 
Behind the mask of your deceit 
But that's no reason 
For hurting me 
Cos there you stand 
As cold as ice 
I'm sick and tired 
Of all your lies 
So stop 
We took the days yeah 
And all the nights so endlessly 
But now the trust has 
Gone in me 
So if it's over 
There's no need to cry no more 
Just take your clothes and 
Get out the door 
Cos there you stand 
As cold as ice 
I'm sick and tired 
Of all your lies 
So stop messin' round 
With my heart 
There is no answer 
To all the hurt I feel inside 
My heart is empty 
Our love has died
