I am a living machine 
I like my competition clean 
Whoa, whoa, whoa 
And if you put up a fight 
I ain't got nothing tonight 
No, no, no Don't play so innocent innocent 
Why be so innocent innocent innocent? Put your black magic over me 
I never gave up so easily 
'Cause every insult is an injury 
When you put your black magic over me You did whatever you could 
Nobody likes it when you're good 
No, no, no 
Why does it take you so long? 
You haven't started and I'm gone 
Whoa, whoa, whoa Don't be so innocent innocent 
Why be so innocent innocent innocent? Put your black magic over me 
I never gave up so easily 
'Cause every insult is an injury 
When you put your black magic over me, over me Put your black magic over me 
I never gave up so easily 
'Cause every insult is an injury 
When you put your black magic over me Oh 
How do I go? 
Oh 
How do I go? Put your black magic over me 
I never gave up so easily 
'Cause every insult is an injury 
When you put your black magic over me 
Over me Put your black magic over me 
I never gave up so easily 
'Cause every insult is an injury 
When you put your black magic over me
