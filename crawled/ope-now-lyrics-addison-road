If everything comes down to love 
Then just what am I afraid of 
When I call out your name 
Something inside awakes in my soul 
How quickly I forget I'm yours I'm not my own 
I've been carried by you 
All my life Everything rides on hope now 
Everything rides on faith somehow 
When the world has broken me down 
This love sets me free When my life is like a storm 
Rising waters all I want is the shore 
You say I'll be ok 
And make it through the rain 
You are my shelter from the storm Everything rides on hope now 
Everything rides on faith somehow 
When the world has broken me down 
This love sets me free I'm not my own 
I've been carried by you 
All my life Everything rides on hope now 
Everything rides on faith somehow 
When the world has broken me down 
Your love sets me free Everything rides on hope now 
Everything rides on faith somehow 
When the world has broken me down 
Your love sets me free You have become my heart's desire 
I will sing your praises higher 
'Cause your love sets me free 
Your love sets me free 
Your love sets me free
