I've separated my life from truth 
This cold air taste real 
I've stumbled back, I'm back My lamp is almost burned 
Reminds me of your eyes 
When you calmly said we've no more space 
For all your tired and dirty past 
And I believe it all to be true 
Beyond this time, you'll pull through I woke up shaking, I'm not too late 
'Cause I'm running back towards 
The space we met and laughed You couldn't let me go 
My breath had all gone out 
When you said let's try we've no more space 
For all your tired and dirty past 
And I believe it all to be true 
Beyond this time, you'll pull through we've no more space 
For all your tired and dirty past 
And I believe it all to be true 
Beyond this time, you'll pull through My lamp has almost burned 
Reminds me of your eyes 
When you calmly said we've no more space 
For all your tired and dirty past 
And I believe it all to be true 
Beyond this time, you'll pull through we've no more space 
For all your tired and dirty past 
And I believe it all to be true 
Beyond this time, you'll pull through 
You'll pull through
