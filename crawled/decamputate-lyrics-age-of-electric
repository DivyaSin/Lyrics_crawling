Pull my chord and I speak, I'll roll over and beg 
I'll fall down and play dead for you 
Crack your whip and I'll serve, Raise your voice and 
I cower, Plug my ears, I can't hear you no more 
Cut out my eyes, I can't see your face 
Cut off my ears, I can't hear your voice and 
Cut out my tongue, I can't call your name 
Cut out my heart 
I'm your beautiful fool, Your disposable hero 
Press my buttons, And I'm your toy 
Don't know how to complain, You just wear me like jewelry 
Turn my back, I won't follow you no more 
Cut out my eyes, I can't see your face 
Cut off my ears, I can't hear your voice 
Cut out my tongue, I can't call your name 
Cut off my arms, I can't reach for you 
Cut out my brain, I can't think of you 
Cut off my skin, I can't feel your touch 
Cut off my legs, I can't run to you 
Cut out my heart
