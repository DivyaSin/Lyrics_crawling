Father owned the dating bar so mother ran the store 
We all lived there together with the army at the door 
No one to do my laundry or to tell me that they're sure 
But there really is no me and there's no army at the door I hustle my way to your bedside 
I ride on your body like a cab ride 
I carry refreshments to the good guys 
I made the good guys some home fries Pardon me anyone where is the nearest shore 
We're all in this together and the police are at the door 
Someone do my laundry or smash through the floor 
To the tropical vacation buried underneath the store And I was your favorite bullfighter 
Whose looks were new to your eyes 
And I fell apart in that bullfight 
Where the dress was the sky to your thighs She said that she had an hour 
Her father he was in the shower 
And she took me to her little tower 
And she showed me her little flower And just when I thought it was safe to put down my pen 
She said maybe I will let you fall in love with me again 
Maybe I will let you fall for loving me again 
Then she showed me her badge and I think she said then That I don't have the heart to tell you not to come 
And everyone has hands just to use someone 
And it makes me feel just like old gum 
To ride a fake horse into town 
To ride a lame horse into town 
To ride a dead horse into town 
To ride your big fucking fake fucking lame fucking dead horse into town
