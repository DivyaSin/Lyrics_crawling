I woke up this morning on a bed on nails 
All that I saw moving, it was leaving trails 
They said I could plug in the batteries, if all else fails 
But here I am sleepin' under the stars.. 
I ain't got a quarter for the evening news 
And there is no help around I can kindly refuse 
I can't even find an old cup to drink from and reuse 
Here I am sleepin' under the stars.. 
All down the line it's been heaven sent 
And there are no sins that I would want to repent 
All I know is that my will has not been bent 
So here I am sleepin' under the stars.. 
The night is growing cold, tonite it's gonna rain 
But that's alright now 'cause I can feel no pain 
I will still be here the day the sun comes back again 
Till then I'll be sleepin' under the stars.. 
Till then I'll be sleepin' under the stars..
