Officer, I swear that I'm licensed to drive 
Flyin' down the freeway breakneck fast, an' 
Officer, I swear that I'm legal, no lie 
But lookin' guilty is the role I'm cast in They say my truck and my life are a wreck 
All the cops in town know my reputation 
Everybody thinks that I'm goin' to heck 
Everybody thinks I'm beyond salvation I'm no scoundrel sir 
That's just what you heard My name is Billy, and I don't believe in bein' good 
That's what they say cuz I don't act the way they think I should 
They shake their heads cuz I live a life that breaks the mold 
Callin' me wicked but I'm not, I'm just 16 years old 
But I guess someone's gotta wear the black hat 
My name is Billy, I'm bad, bad, bad, bad Principal, I swear I'm not tryin' to brag 
And you're the kind of guy that I admire 
Yeah I was makin' out in chemistry lab 
But I wasn't there when it caught on fire 'K, that was me, but you ain't got the facts 
Really didn't mean to burn down the school, yeah 
Kids startin' crazy rumors behind my back 
I'm the one they say is a troubled fool, But How they judge is strange 
They want me to change My name is Billy, and I don't believe in bein' good 
That's what they say cuz I don't act they way they think I should 
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout the laws or what you 'xpect of me 
I'm just a boy who knows things aren't always what they seem 
But I guess someone's gotta wear the black hat 
My name is Billy, I'm bad, bad, bad, bad Reverend, I swear there ain't no need to fear 
Clearly you can see my heart's in the right place 
I'm sure they warned you this would be kinda queer 
Like chattin' up the devil face to face But let me tell ya somethin' - You have been played 
I'm a good boy, really deep down I am 
People say mean things when they are afraid 
Lyin' when they just don't understand, Some Folks just don't feel strong 
'Til they call someone wrong 
They need an enemy 
It might as well be me My name is Billy, and I don't believe in bein' good 
That's what they say cuz I don't act the way they think I should 
They shake their heads cuz I live a life that breaks the mold 
Callin' me wicked but I'm not, I'm just 16 years old 
But I guess someone's gotta wear the black hat 
My name is Billy, I'm bad, bad, bad, bad My name is Billy, and I don't believe in bein' good 
That's what they say cuz I don't act they way they think I should 
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout the laws or what you 'xpect of me 
I'm just a boy who knows things aren't always what they seem 
But I guess someone's gotta wear the black hat 
My name is Billy, I'm bad, bad, bad, bad Things ain't always what they seem Bad, bad, bad, bad 
But for now, I'll be Bad, bad, bad, bad
