I know that I should be Fallen branches and abandoned cabins

What I've honed on the path alone 
making my way home 
making my way home Following the trails into the woods 
Far behind the meadow where I stood 
I'm dithering in circles by myself 
I call for you to find me but you've 
found somebody else I'm refined 
But you're just fine Moving on like the lifting dawn 
dark inside the trees 
deeper in, going faster than 
I know that I should be 
I know that I should be
