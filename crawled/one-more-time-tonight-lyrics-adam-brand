Touch me like I touch you 
Hold me like I hold you 
Kiss me like I kiss you 
One more time tonight Please say you won't leave me 
Say you still need me 
Say you still love me

I'll do all you want me to 
I'll show you my love is true 
One more time tonight Touch me like I touch you 
Hold me like I hold you 
Kiss me like I kiss you 
One more time for all time 
Till' the end of time, tonight
