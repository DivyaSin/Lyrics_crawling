Hide your eyes 
Don't let them see, don't let them know 
Don't you know 
That they are everywhere around us Stay awake 
Don't let them hear you talking while you sleep 
Have you heard 
Stories of how people disappear Don't let them win the game 
Don't let them fool you again 
Don't let them dig into your head 
Don't let them change your point of view 
Don't let them take you away 
Don't let them put you in a cage 
Don't be afraid of what you are 
Just find a way out of this maze They can hear 
Every word we say and what we think 
So hide away 
The sadness without hope that's in your eyes Don't let them win the game 
Don't let them fool you again 
Don't let them dig into your head 
Don't let them change your point of view 
Don't let them take you away 
Don't let them put you in a cage 
Don't be afraid of what you are 
Just find a way out of this maze That guy is looking so unquiet 
That one is hiding from our eyes 
He's playing music way too loud 
So we can't hear a word he says 
How silly they all look 
But in the end they're all the same 
How silly they all look 
But in the end they're all the same
