[Verse 1] Did you think 
You'd ever recover 
From the storms you brewed 
And tides you turned 
On all of your friends 
Just to come back 
And make amends [Verse 2] Unhappiness 
Is your part-time lover 
You threw up your walls 
So you never discovered 
The life you could leave 
Apart from the buffoons 
You've entertained [Chorus] Still this stupid city skyline 
Ain't the same without your smile 
Silhouetted by the sunset 
Of some ever-changing style 
We turned on Grand 
And I said 
I will love you 
I will love you 
I will love you 
Like I always have [Verse 3] You came and went 
And nothing happened 
Questions were asked 
And my answers were at risk 
Of showing my hand 
Woe be the willful ignorance 
Of some gamblin' man [Chorus] Still this stupid city skyline 
Ain't the same without your smile 
Silhouetted by the sunset 
Of some ever-changing style 
I took your hand 
And I said 
I will love you 
I will love you 
I will love you 
Like I always have And I said 
I will love you 
I will love you 
I will love you 
Like I always have And I said 
I will love you 
I will love you 
I will love you 
Like I always have
