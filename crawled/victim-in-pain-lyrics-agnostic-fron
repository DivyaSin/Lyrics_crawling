People say that I'm insane a victim of society just in pain society's rules has made me cruel I'm just the opposite, ain't no fool the way I act or way I dress doesn't make me strong or make me 
Soon they'll find my reasons why I'm open minded and not blind but why am I going insane why am I the one to blame open your eyes, don't tell me lies I'll be the one to live and rise I'll think 
Yself and I'm sure to find that society's rules won't change my mind
