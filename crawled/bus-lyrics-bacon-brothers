Written by Kevin Bacon "Finally broke down and wrote a road song. Or is it a love song to a Prevost?" KB She comes from Nashville, Tennessee 
But she's not too country, not too me 
She's got a Janis Joplin heart and Aretha Franklin soul 
I love to feel her rock and I love to feel her roll 
When I'm standing in the rain she takes me for a ride 
She's says you don't need that raincoat baby you can come inside 
I've known a hundred thousand boys who are just like you 
You don't need to say a word 
Just let me do like I do, like I do, like I do I got a good woman 
God knows nothing's gonna come between the two of us, yeah 
I love that woman, god knows, I love that bus CD, DVD, VCR, and a satellite dish and an open bar 
She don't even care if my homies hang out 
Doesn't bitch doesn't moan, doesn't whine, doesn't pout 
And all the wannabees wanna date her 
All the bluemen and the space invaders 
She's got a Graceland sparkle and a Vegas style 
She looks like she's ready to roll mile after mile I got a good woman 
God knows nothing's gonna come between the two of us, yeah 
I love that woman, god knows, I love that bus Well I thought I'd seen the world and I thought that I was wise 
But she showed me other colors just by looking through her eyes 
There's thunder in the west and there's lightening in the east 
In the eye of the storm in the belly of the beast 
Where she gonna take us to today 
It don't really matter, if we get a chance to play 
Something that was lost has now been found 
She can keep those worn out wheels goin' round and around I got a good woman. God knows nothing's gonna come between the two of us, yeah 
I love that woman?God knows, step up baby 
It's just you and me honey and the twelve of us 
Yeah, I love that woman, God knows, I love that bus February, 2001: For the band and crew, a pivotal moment in history on the bus somewhere in Indiana.
