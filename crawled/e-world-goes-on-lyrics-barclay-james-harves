See the gambler make a stand 
Holds a lifetime in his hand 
Win the game or lose control 
But the world goes on forever 
Life's a circle, I recall 
Shadows played upon the wall 
You pay the piper to call the tune 
And the song goes on forever And when all the words have gone 
There's the thought to carry on 
Just like a bird that sings 
Leave it all behind and spread your wings 
You can leave it all behind - spread your wings Lay me down 
Saw the road move on before me 
Times when I was tired and lost my way 
Looking at life and strangely for the first time 
Thinking that I could stay here 
But the world moves on forever And when all the words have gone 
There's the thought to carry on 
Just like a bird that sings 
Leave it all behind and spread your wings 
You can leave it all behind - spread your wings
