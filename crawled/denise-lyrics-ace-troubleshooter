Waiting for a sign that never came 
Waiting, pinching nerves to stay sane 
Denise, can't erase the time, forget the past 
Knowing good times come and go so fast Denise, it's not all set back in time 
Denise, just lay it down and you'll find 
You've changed Nowhere girl, a cage you've come to know 
Still wondering, "Where did they all go?" 
Denise, plan a recluse life down to the day 
While you have chains to lose and a whole world to gain Denise, it's not all set back in time 
Denise, just lay it down and you'll find 
You've changed Denise, Denise, it's time 
Time to seize the world 
Denise, it's time Denise, it's not all set down in stone 
Denise, just lay it down and you're home 
You've changed
