In the rhythm of the street 
The steam is rising 
You can feel the heat 
She puts on her make-up 
Puts shoes on her feet 
She's going down tonight 
You can feel it from a distance 
Like a nuclear bomb 
She knows she's looking good 
With the new dress on 
And all the guys with the X-ray eyes 
Check her out as she walks on by 
She's a primitive girl 
No jewel like money's buyin' 
A slave to the rhythm 
A rhythm machine 
I want to make that girl 
Make that scene 
There's a heatwave on the floor tonight 
Watch her move 
Watch her melt the ice 
She's in ecstasy 
She spins and she whirls 
Dancing off the edge 
Off the edge of the world 
I'm looking for a hot romance 
How am I gonna get that girl 
When she's dancing off the edge of the world 
Dancing off the edge 
Watch her move 
In the rhythm of the beat 
She motions her body 
She becomes complete 
With the rock 'n roll music 
It's indiscrete 
It's sexual 
You'd better cut her some space 
Give her some air 
You can try if you like 
But I wouldn't dare 
She don't know it yet 
But this is a love affair 
She's mine 
All mine 
She's a primitive girl 
No jewel like money's buyin' 
A slave to the rhythm 
A rhythm machine 
I want to make that girl 
Make that scene 
There's a heatwave on the floor tonight 
Watch her move 
Watch her melt the ice 
She's in ecstasy 
She spins and she whirls 
Dancing off the edge 
Off the edge of the world 
I'm looking for a hot romance 
How am I gonna kiss that girl 
When she's dancing off the edge of the world 
Just look at that girl 
Watch her move, yeah 
Watch her groove 
Everyone sees me smile 
From a million miles away 
All the gigolos try and try their best move 
She just walks on by 
There's a heatwave on the floor tonight 
Watch her move 
Watch her melt the ice 
She's in ecstasy 
She spins and she whirls 
Dancing off the edge 
Off the edge of the world 
Dancing off the edge 
The edge of the world yeah 
Dancing off the edge 
The edge of my world 
Dancing off the edge
