She sits alone and sheds a single tear 
She'd rather be anywhere but here 
He cries, and aches on the inside. 
He wonders if anythings gonna be alright. You see him and her are the ones that we dont recognize, 
Cause they smile on the outside, but cry inside. Who are you to say anything to her? 
Who are you to put her down? 
Do you not see the frown upon her face? 
Little girl, little girl, 
It'll be okay. He sits alone and has no one to tell 
That all these boys are putting him through hell 
She puts on a smile and walks outside 
Wondering if anyone knows what she has to hide. You see him and her are the ones that we dont recognize, 
Cause they smile on the outside, but cry inside. Who are you to say anything to him? 
Who are you to put him down? 
Do you not see the frown upon his face? 
Little boy, little boy, 
It'll be okay. And I know that it is hard on you, 
But dont let it put you down... Who are you to say anything to them? 
Who are you to put them down? 
Do you not see the frown upon their faces? 
Hey you, hey you, 
It'll be okay. 
Hey you, it'll be okay.
