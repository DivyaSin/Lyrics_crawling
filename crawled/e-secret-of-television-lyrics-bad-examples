You and me - let's join the enemy 
Fly to paris, plan a bank robbery 
I've got the tickets, let's pick up some cigarettes 
Grab your jacket, the wind is blowing cold 
I've got this contact, he's ready for action 
We've got to cut while the knife is still sharp 
Crime does not pay, but this time it's different 
One week in france and count your money in the dark 
(chorus) 
Don't try to tell me you never dreamed about it 
Don't try to tell me you never wondered how it felt 
The world is full of dreamers... it's the secret of television 
I don't want your television I want real bullets Just our luck -- we were born in suburbia 
Raised on sunshine and white bread sin 
I think it's time we got some dirt under our fingernails 
I think it's time we got some blood under our skin 
I got this cancer burning inside of me 
9 to 5, income tax, taking their toll 
Get you some heroin, get me a prostitute 
We'll sleep much easier with evil in our souls Chorus What if we die? that'd be a pity 
It's been years since I saw you this young 
Maybe we'll take our share, run to venezuela 
Buy a fleet of jaguars, race 'em in the sun
