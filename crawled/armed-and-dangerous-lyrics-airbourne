With a cocked and loaded gun and the girl of my dreams 
I can't control myself, know what I mean? 
I had one too many pills; now I'm high on sextasy 
Yeah, I'm a supercharged, hot-blooded sex machine Armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight 
I'm armed and dangerous 
All through the night 
Armed and dangerous 
Oh, feel my snake bite, yeah 
I'm armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight, all right I'm just checking her oil and stirring up her cream 
Bringing her to the boil, making her jump and scream 
Say, the longer I go, honey, the longer I get 
And if I run out of ammo, I just use my bayonet Armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight 
I'm armed and dangerous 
All through the night 
Armed and dangerous 
Oh, feel my snake bite, yeah 
I'm armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight, all right, all right I'm armed and dangerous 
I'm armed and dangerous 
I'm armed and dangerous 
Like a bullet, like a bomb I'll take you on Armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight 
I'm armed and dangerous 
All through the night 
Armed and dangerous 
Oh, feel my snake bite, yeah 
I'm armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight, all right 
'Cause I'm armed 
I'm armed, I said, I'm armed 
I said, I'm armed and dangerous, all right Armed and dangerous 
Better hold on tight 
I'm armed and dangerous 
All through the night
