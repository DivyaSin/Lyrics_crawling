Goodness gracious Mrs Smith's a very lucky lady. 
Paints her toe nails rainbow colours and her hair is green. 
She won the lottery and shared her fortune with a sailor. 
They're so happy on their little island made of dreams. All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. God all mighty Mr Brown his money drives him crazy. 
He's got so much he doesn't have a care. 
He sits alone on his throne his castle is so empty. 
He used to work in a factory in the square, he was so happy there. All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. Bloody hell sweet little Daisy's got all Daddy's cash. 
She blew it on bubblies and yellow puppy dogs. 
She lost the mansion, lost the roller, lost the chauffer too. 
She took off with her jewelry and trimmed her curly locks. 
She trimmed her curly locks. All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
Living in their dreams. 
All the lucky people. 
I wonder where they've been. 
All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
All the lucky people. 
I'm on of the lucky people.
