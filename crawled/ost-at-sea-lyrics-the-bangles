Can we try to salvage what we can 
From the weight of water and sand 
And lifts us up again 
Well this world is spinning out of control 
I'm bracing just to keep hold As the clouds move in 
With a driving wind so strong 
Could it be that we're lost at sea 
And we're drowning under the stars 
Up to me I would ride this wave Before we drift too far 
What a lonely way to be 
Lost at sea 
Like a star in a night filled with tears 
Make the sadness disappear 'Cause you're all that I hold dear 
Well you walk 
Never ever looking back 
One defends and one attacks 
There's a thousand reasons to begin again Could it be that we're lost at sea 
And we're drowning under the stars 
Up to me I would ride this wave 
Before we drift too far 
Take my hand, come to me Save a life, rescue you, rescue me 
Could it be that we're lost at sea 
And we're drowning under the stars 
Up to me I would ride this wave 
Before we drift too far Could it be that we're lost at sea 
And we're drowning under the stars 
Up to me I would ride this wave 
Before we drift too far
