(Turn the lights off) 
Those kisses never seem to fade away 
I can feel em on my face 
They still feel perfect 
That's why I can't go another day 
Love it when I see you smile 
Happy just to be there 
Even when you're down girl 
I've been needing you around girl yeah yeah But you been missing for too long 
And I ain't ready to move on 
I'm calling all your friends to 
Help me find you baby She got me laying here by the phone 
I can't keep spending the night alone 
I've got all I could ever want 
But it just ain't enough if it ain't you baby She got me laying here by the phone 
I can't keep spending the night alone 
I've got all I could ever want 
But it just ain't enough if it ain't you baby Ain't enough 
When it ain't you baby Driving past your mama's house 
Hoping just to catch a 
Short glimpse of you 
And I'll be hoping that you don't find out 
How much it's killing me girl 
Please girl, my heart can't take another day, no no no no But you been missing for too long 
And I ain't ready to move on 
I'm calling all your friends to 
Help me find you baby She got me laying here by the phone 
I can't keep spending the night alone 
I've got all I could ever want 
But it just ain't enough if it ain't you baby She got me laying here by the phone 
Can't keep spending the night alone
