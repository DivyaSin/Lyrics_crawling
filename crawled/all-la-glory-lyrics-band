I want to hear pitter patter 
Climb up your ladder now It's time for you to dream away, 
For what a big day you've been through. 
You've done all the things that you wanted to do. 
All la glory, I'm second story, 
Feel so tall like a prison wall. I'm lookin' for a star bright 
To shine down your light now 
And keep the little one safe and warm, 
'Cause to her it's just a fantasy 
And to me it's all a mystery. 
All la glory, I'm second story, 
Feel so tall like a prison wall. And before the leaves all turn brown, 
Before they fall to the ground, 
You will find the harmony,
