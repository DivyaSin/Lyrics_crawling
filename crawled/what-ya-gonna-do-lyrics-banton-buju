Oh what a feeling 
The rude boy is feeling 
I'm so lonely inside 
This rude boy feel like screaming 
Wayne Wonder:

Girl I'm lonely for you only 
Feeling lonely lonely lonely 
Girl I'm lonely lonely lonely 
Buju Banton:

What ya gonna do 
Woman fed up, wants nothing to do with you 
Can't see through 
Me say it get together woman dem no 
Inna not a acapella fellow 
Good weather bad weather strong umbrella 
Yu back affi broad 
Mek di woman feel as if she flying on a Concord 
Yes mi bredda mi say use up cool water 
What ya gonna do to obtain this daughter 
Have the lamb in hand let it escape slaughter 
Now all over town you is a laugh 
Cho cho

Wayne Wonder: 
Was it something that I've done 
Was it something that I've said 
Tell me tell me 
What can I do to change your mind 
Lady don't let me down not this time 
No no no no 
Buju Banton: 
Lady I give you all the loving 
The affection that I have 
Undivided attention 
Never treated you bad 
Don't you leave a lonely man, I'll be literally mad 
You bring joy to this boy 
With the loving that you have 
Fantabulous smile 
Captivate me all the while 
Lonely lonely lonely like a motherless child 
You curve mi observe woman it rest upon me nerve 
Your lovin I'm missing night and day 
The ragga is reminiscing 
I sing what you gonna do
