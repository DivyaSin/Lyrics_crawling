THEY SAY THERE'S SAVAGES IN THE TREES 
I SAY THE BEASTS ARE YOU AND ME 
FOR CLOTHES AND CARS WE WORK OUR ASS 
ANIMALS ARE HAPPY IN A FEILD OF GRASS 
WE RUN AROUND FRANTIC THERE'S NO TIME 
AND ANIMALS SIT BACK AND LAUGH AT MANKIND 
THEY SAY WE AS A RACE ARE QUITE SUPERIOR 
I SAY OUR EXPLOITS MAKE US VERY INFERIOR 
FOR TRINKETS AND TOYS WE WORK OUR ASS 
BUT FOR ALL OUR FEAR AND LOATHING WE ARE TO LAUGH
