When your love rains down just like diamonds all around 
Strange and changing sound transformation in the ground 
Great and winding tree splits the earth from sea to sea 
And my lover comes to me, bids me follow endlessly 
As she laughs and starts to climb through the branches and the vines 
Through the tangle of our minds 
For this tree you see it grows, never-ending When your love flows free just the way its meant to be 
All these chains that bind I find I quickly leave behind 
And all the earth below seems a thin and fleeting snow 
And my father I concede is further up upon the tree 
And his beard is made of bees dancing wildly in the leaves 
And my lover says to me you must be blind if youre to see 
Must walk behind if youre to lead 
Must be the soil to the seed never-ending For I feel the years like distant gears may turn and come to rest 
Where they dwell within my chest 
Let my spirit coalesce 
Yes and death is dressed in colors blessed a mystery I confess I cannot see When your love rains down the sound of singing so profound 
Fills the ground so deep like a weeping mothers sleep 
As a babys breath whispers death so none can hear 
And I passed the ancient seer 
Entering the atmosphere 
In a tree that never ends with my lover and our friends 
Entering the black of space 
We replace the stars that shine never-ending
