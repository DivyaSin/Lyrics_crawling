No one resists 
The feast that is love 
It kills with a bite One taste is all 
Enough to partake 
In this deadly rite But burned by the fire 
Destroyed by your tears 
Retreat to the cold Sustained but alone 
A new light appears 
That now will take hold We all hunger 
Drawn to the fire of famine's desire 
We all suffer 
Craving the rush of "never enough" No soul can flee, no escape 
When solitude finds you awake 
For no one is destined to break 
The bonds of starvation 
The bonds of starvation Dangerous wants 
A knock at your door 
Tempting with bliss But love leaves its sting 
Though we crave for more 
In tragedy's kiss So let him go 
Don't risk your demise 
He takes so you'll give Regret you will know 
It's there in his eyes 
He dies so you'll live We all hunger 
Drawn to the fire of famine's desire 
We all suffer 
Craving the rush of "never enough" No soul can flee, no escape 
When solitude finds you awake 
For no one is destined to break 
The bonds of starvation 
The bonds of starvation 
The bonds of starvation
