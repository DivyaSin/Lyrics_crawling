A treat for all these problems 
They can't find you for the moment 
Then for all past efforts 
They're buried deep beneath your heart 
And somewhere in your stomach And hatred for all others 
When awful people they surround you Well, eh, they just like monsters 
They come to feed on me 
Giant little animals to feed Vote to say "we got much hope 
If I am lost, it's only for a little while" A treat for all these problems 
They can't find us for the moment 
Then for all past effort 
They're buried deep beneath our hearts 
And somewhere in our stomachs And hatred for all others 
Awful people, they surround you 
Eh, they just like monsters 
They come to feed on us 
Giant little animals for us Though to say "we got much hope 
If I am lost it's only for a little while" 
Though to say "we got much hope 
If I am lost it's only for a little while 
If I am lost it's only for a little while 
If I am lost it's only for a little while"
