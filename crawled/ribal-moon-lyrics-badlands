Are you ready people 
To meet your time at the crossroad, yeah? 
Healing time is heading my way now 
No devil man is gonna cast vibration down on me 
Hear me call your name 
I got not time to look back at what I've said and done 
Don't you know my baby, I was born on that rising sun 
And all the love I gave you girl I said was real 
Your backdoor lover's spinning like the wheel 
Lonely road is gonna take me down easy 
Lonely road, like a needle in the wind I ride 
Dancin' with the wolves in the midnight holy hour baby 
Troubled moon glows above my head now 
No bloody story's gonna keep this poor boy on his knee 
Gotta keep on rollin' straight ahead 
I got not time to look back at what I've said and done 
Don't you know my baby, I was born on that rising sun 
And all the love I gave you girl I said was real 
Your backdoor cyclone's spinning like the wheel 
Lonely road is gonna take me down easy 
Lonely road, like a needle in the wind I ride 
Lonely road is gonna take me down easy 
Lonely road, like a needle in the wind I ride 
Dig it!! 
Lonely road is gonna take me down easy 
Lonely road, like a needle in the wind I ride 
Lonely road is gonna take me down easy 
Lonely road, like a needle in the wind I ride 
I hide 
Lonely road is gonna take me down so easy 
Lonely road, like a needle in the wind I ride 
Yeah, tribal moon 
Glows above my head 
Is gonna take me down so easy
