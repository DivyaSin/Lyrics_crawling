There's something in the air 
That wants me to beware tonight 
There's something in the air There's music in the breeze 
I never saw the stars so bright 
There's something in the air Though I find there's danger in your eyes 
That's real as you, I've been blind 
But now I realize what love can do I feel it everywhere 
So whisper you'll be mine tonight 
There's something in the air
