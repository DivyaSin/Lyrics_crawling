The other day when we were walking by the graveyard near the house 
You asked me if I thought we would ever die 
And if life and love both fade so predictably 
We've made ourselves a kind of predictable lie And so I pictured us like corpses 
Lying side by side in pieces 
In some dark and lonely plot under a bough 
We looked so silly there all decomposed 
Half turned to dust in tattered clothes 
Though we probably look just as silly now Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye to all this dog-eared innocence 
I can't pretend that I can tell you what is going to happen next or how to be 
But you have no idea about me 
Do you? And it left me to wonder if people ever know each other 
Or just stumble around like strangers in the dark 
'Cause sometimes you seem so strange to me, I must seem strange to you 
We're like two actors playing our parts Did you memorize your lines? 'cause I did 
Here's the part where I get so mad I tell you I can't forget the past 
You get so quiet now and you seem somehow like a lost and lonely child 
And you just hope that the moment won't last Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye to all this dogged innocence 
I can't pretend that I can tell you what is going to happen next or how to be 
But you have no idea about me 
You have no idea about me 
Do you? So there's always a way around 
There's something tying our feet to the ground 
A moment passed we hear how it sounds 
Then it seems a little less profound 
Like we're all going the same way down 
Yeah we're all going the same way down 
I'm just trying to write it all down 'Cause I write songs and you write letters 
We are tied like two in tethers 
And we talk and read, and laugh and sleep 
At night in bed together 
And you wake in tears sometimes 
I can see your thoughts flash across your eyes 
They say darling will you be kind, will you be a good man and stay behind 
If I get old? And then the letters all pass through my head 
With the words that I was told 
About the fading flesh of life and love 
The failures of the bold 
I can list each crippling fear like I'm reading from a will And I'll defy everyone and love you still 
I will carry you with me up every hill 
And if you die before I die I'll carve your name out of the sky 
I'll fall asleep with your memory and dream of where you lie 
Maybe better to move on and to let life just carry on and I may be wrong Still I'll try 
'Cause it's better to love, whether you win or lose or die 
It's better to love, whether you win or lose or die 
It's better to love, and I will love you 'til I die
