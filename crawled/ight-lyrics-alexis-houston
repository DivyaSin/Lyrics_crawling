Lived life under nighttime skies 
Shroud of darkness had me blind 
Stumbled in circles, too inured to cry 
My fear of failure trumping try Too afraid to look beyond 
To see what life could truly be 
Never thinking there would ever be 
Brighter days ahead of me Now I live out in the sun 
Claiming my destiny's begun 
Going for broke, win or lose 
The path I take, is mine to choose I'm a woman... fully grown 
Stepping up to claim my thrown 
Straight trippin' not ever to feel 
The power that lives inside of me Oooo Can you see it? 
Oooo oooo Can you feel it? 
Oooo oooo Will you embrace it? 
Oooo oooo the light! INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE 
(African chanting) bgv ad libs Now I live out in the sun 
Claiming my destiny's begun 
Going for broke, win or lose 
The path I take, is mine to choose Too afraid to look beyond 
To see what life could truly be 
Straight trippin' not ever to feel 
The power that lives inside of me Oooo Can you see it? 
Oooo oooo Can you feel it? 
Oooo oooo Will you embrace it? 
Oooo oooo the light! Oooo Yes I can see it! 
Oooo oooo Oh and I can feel it! 
Oooo oooo Yes I'm living 
Surrounded by the light! (African chanting) with bgv ad libs Oooo Can you see it 
Oooo oooo Can you feel it 
Oooo oooo Will you embrace it 
Oooo oooo the light! Oooo Yes I can see it! 
Oooo oooo Oh I can feel it! 
Oooo oooo Yes I'm living 
Surrounded by the light!
