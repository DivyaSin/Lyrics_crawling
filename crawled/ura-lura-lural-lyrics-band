Over in Killarney 
Many years ago, 
Me Mither sang a song to me 
In tones so sweet and low. Just a simple little ditty, 
In her good old Irish way, 
And I'd give the world if she could sing 
That song to me this day. [Chorus] 
"Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li, 
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, hush now, don't you cry! 
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li, 
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, that's an Irish lullaby." Oft in dreams I wander 
To that cot again, 
I feel her arms a-huggin' me 
As when she held me then.
