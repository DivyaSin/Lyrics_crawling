Woo 
Don't hit me too hard 
Oh, yeah 
Give it to me, give it to me 
Give it to me, to me, to me, woo All alone you get off on your own, girl 
All alone you get off on your own 
All alone you get off on your own, girl 
Girl, girl, girl All alone you get off on your own, girl 
All alone you get off on your own 
All alone you get off on your own, girl 
Girl, girl, girl Don't you leave me standin' here 
What is it, you feel no fear 
Let me make it up to you, my dear 
I'm all alone 
Sittin' right here by the phone 
My heart is broken now, believe me, girl, ooh Wait, wait, you'll see 
You'll get used to me 
I know you'll love me, girl (If you give me a chance) 
I'm all alone 
Sittin' right here by the phone 
My heart is broken now, believe me, girl, ooh All alone you get off on your own, girl 
All alone you get off on your own 
All alone you get off on your own, girl 
Girl, girl, girl All alone you get off on your own, girl 
All alone you get off on your own 
All alone you get off on your own, girl 
Girl, girl, girl I wanna know what's on your mind 
You're back here runnin' the same old line 
You love me and you care (Whatever) 
I'm all alone 
Sittin' right by the phone 
My heart is broken now, believe me, girl 
Please come home Whatever 
Is there something wrong with you 
Or is there something wrong with me 
Tell me something 
Do I not look good enough for you 
Or maybe, baby, you just look too good for me 
Don't sweat yourself 
On the strength All alone you get off on your own, girl 
All alone you get off on your own 
All alone you get off on your own, girl 
Girl, girl, girl All alone you get off on your own, girl 
All alone you get off on your own 
All alone you get off on your own, girl 
Girl, girl, girl You make me so mad 
That you want to be on your own 
I waited for so long, I waited by the phone 
All of a sudden you want me back Ha-ha 
What's up with that, you got me on hold 
What do you think you dope on a rope 
Nope 
What am I supposed to sweat you 
You're supposed to just run all over me 
Zero on the strength 
Yo', Scott, it ain't hard to tell, right, huh All the brothers grab a girl and get out your seat 
And rock to the rhythm of this funky beat 
My name is Al B. Sure! 
Rock to the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm of the funky beat All alone, my girl 
Oh, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no All alone you get off on your own, girl 
All alone you get off on your own 
All alone you get off on your own, girl 
Girl, girl, girl All alone you get off on your own, girl 
All alone you get off on your own 
All alone you get off on your own, girl 
Girl, girl, girl
