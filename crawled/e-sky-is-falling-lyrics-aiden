I hear the sky is falling here we are, on empty 
I feel my heart is turning black tonight, safely 
If all we are are dust and shades of grey 
How are we to say are we all alone Because I'm empty 
To the fire that blinded who we are, silence 
Take a picture let it breathe alright, remindless 
All with words and the fiction in your eyes 
I'm taking off my disguise with you all alone 
Cause I'm empty, are you empty? Are you empty tonight? Now kiss me one last time 
And bring me back to life 
Bring me back to life 
Now kiss me one last time 
And bring me back to life 
Bring me back to life [Chorus] 
I know the sky is falling here we are, I'm empty 
I feel the world keeps spinning am I high? safely 
If we all we are is dust and shades of grey 
And how I wanted to say 
Are you all alone? cause I'm empty 
Are you empty? are you empty tonight? 
And all I fear tonight
