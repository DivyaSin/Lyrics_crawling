You're wide awake tossing 
And you can't even sleep 
With all these secrets you keep 
The way home is so steep And then it's midnight 
And you feel so alone 
You've got your radio on 
You don't know if you can face the dawn. [Chorus] 
And it's time to be a man 
Tell me, how does that go? 
What the hell you waiting for? 
The whole world's at your door All these lies that 
You told to yourself 
Like you don't need no one else 
Don't put your pride off the shelf [Chorus] 
And it's time to be a man 
Tell me, how does that go? 
What the hell you waiting for? 
The whole world's at your door And it's time to be a man 
For the rest of your life 
Won't you stop saying that you're lonely 
And you know that's a lie But you were never alone 
You were never alone *Amy* 
When she gave you 
All that she had to give 
You have to know what that is 
Do you even know what you did? [Chorus] 
And it's time to be a man 
Tell me, how does that go? 
What the hell you waiting for? 
The whole world's at your door And it's time to be a man 
For the rest of your life 
Won't you stop saying that you're lonely 
And you know that's a lie You just have to let it go 
You just have to let it go 
You just have to let it go
