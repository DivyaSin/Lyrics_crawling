A friend named Charlie told me a story one day 
as we were talking over a beer 
How he'd sit as kid at the stadium 
from outside the fence he would cheer 
The price of a ticket was too much to bear 
Besides, you could see the game from out there 
And now you're back and you can't help but to pretend.. 
Back to where you started once again.. 
He'd done many a hard job and wore many a scar 
it was the only life he ever knew 
That one question never really hounded him 
How could so much belong, to so few 
You have got to make due with what you can get 
There ain't no use in carryin' a load of regret 
And now you're back and you can't help but to pretend.. 
Back to where you started once again.. 
Of the worst situation he would never complain 
for what is there to say? 
In a world where judges reservations of you 
are fit to mold like clay 
His world his judges could never conceive 
All that they can see is all that they can believe 
And now you're back and you can't help but to pretend.. 
Back to where you started once again.. 
To be legit is for all you can hope to ask 
against the hard blown winds of circumstance 
Where the same one who robs you 
is from who you can steal 
The whole situation becomes cruel and unjust 
to all involved parties that just do what they must 
And now you're back and you can't help but to pretend.. 
Back to where you started once again.. 
Now it seems Charlie has dropped out of line 
on a side road he's now tired enough to pursue 
It's the road from rags to riches 
but it ain't no park avenue 
You have got so many hard years upon your soul 
You can't stop now, you're on a roll 
And now you're back and you can't help but to pretend.. 
Back to where you started once again..
