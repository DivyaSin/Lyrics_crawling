Forgot to tell you 
Sins are very hard to say 
And you know that the words are there, my love 
When I first saw you 
I didn't notice it that day 
Now you're the one I'm thinking of. [Chorus:] 
Oh, you never bring me down 
Make me sad, it's such a change, oh yeah (oh yeah) 
If I was insecure 
That was yesterday and now I'm sure 
Oh, so sure (oh so sure, so sure). When I was a little girl 
I wanted everything ideal 
Yeah, and a love I could depend on 
This is the real world 
And I believe our love is real 
And it's the only thing I'm counting on. [Chorus] 
Oh, you never bring me down 
Make me sad, it's such a change, oh yeah (oh yeah) 
If I was insecure 
That was yesterday and now I'm sure 
Oh, so sure. [Chorus] 
Oh, you never bring me down 
Make me sad, it's such a change, oh yeah (oh yeah) 
If I was insecure 
That was yesterday and now I'm sure 
Oh, so sure, oh. This is the real world 
I really want to be your girl 
This is the real world (real world) 
I really want to be your girl 
This is the real world (real world) 
I really want to be your girl.
