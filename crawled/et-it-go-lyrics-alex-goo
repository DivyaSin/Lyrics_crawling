The snow glows white on the mountain tonight not a footprint to be seen. 
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the king. 
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside. 
Couldn't keep it in,heaven knows I've tried. Don't let them in, don't let them see 
be the good boy you always have to be 
conceal don't feel, don't let them know. 
Well now they know. Let it go, let it go! I can't hold it back anymore. 
Let it go, let it go, turn my back and slam the door. 
And here i'll stand, and here i'll stay. 
Let it go, let it go, the cold never bothered me anyway. It's funny how some distance, makes everything seem small. 
The fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all. 
Up here in this cold thin air, I can finally breathe. 
I know i left a life behind, but i'm too relieved to grieve. Let it go, let it go! I cant hold it back anymore 
Let it go, let it go! Turn my back and slam the door. 
And here i'll stand, and here i'll stay. 
Let it go, let it go. 
The cold never bothered me anyway. Standin, frozen, in the life I've chosen. 
You won't, find me, the past is all behind me. 
Buried, in the snow. Let it go, let it go, I can't hold it back anymore. Let it go, let it go! Turn my back and slam the door 
and here i'll stand, and here i'll stay. 
Let it go!, let it go 
The cold never bothered me anyway! Standin, Frozen, in the life I've chosen, let it go let it go 
(You wont, find me, the past is all behind me buried in the 
snow) 
turn my back and slam the door and here i'll stand, and here i'll stay. 
Let it go, Let it go. The cold never bothered me anyway.
