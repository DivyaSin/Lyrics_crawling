Down around the corner 
Half a mile from here 
See them long trains run 
And you watch them disappear Without love 
Where would you be now? 
Without love You know I saw Miss Lucy 
Down along the tracks 
She lost her home and her family 
And she won't be coming back Without love 
Where would you be right now? 
Without love Well the Illinois Central 
And the Southern Central freight 
Gotta keep on pushing mama 
You know they're running late Without love 
Where would you be now? 
Without love Well the pistons keep on turning 
And the wheels go 'round and 'round 
And the steel rails are cold and hard 
For the miles that they go down Without love 
Where would you be now? 
Without love 
Where would you be now? Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Won't you move it down? 
I gotta keep on moving 
Gotta keep on moving Without love 
Where would you be now? 
Without love Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Won't you move it down 
I gotta keep on moving 
Gotta keep on moving Without love 
Where would you be now? 
Without love Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Won't you move it down? 
I gotta keep on moving 
Gotta keep on moving Without love 
Where would you be now?
