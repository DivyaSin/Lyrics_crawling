Something always gives 
It's the matter of the time you waste 
And here I am out of your focus 
it comes down to you 
The direction that you choose 
The choices in our lives 
And you choose to live in spite 
Far away from mine 
choose a hundred possessions you're thankful to own 
and those who atone 
discount all but one It stands to reason but I can't be by myself 
It makes no different what I have 
I'm by myself intrinsic to your world 
the benefit of doubt 
Check your messages 
through some trivial discord 
the code of silence rings 
and i can't recall the why or when, all i remember 
is now we aren't speaking It stands to reason but I can't be by myself 
It makes no different who I am 
It stands to reason and it's better left undone. 
It makes no different what I have 
I'm by myself, by myself, by myself
