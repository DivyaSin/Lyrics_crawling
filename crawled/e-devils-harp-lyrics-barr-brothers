I tuned the devils harp 
It was the last thing that I heard 
Before I walked the stretch of road between Nagoya and absurd 
I meant to find my lover there 
But I found a little bird 
She sang me how the world was made 
I hung on every word 
She told me why the rabbit cries and why some stars were red 
She told me where the doper goes to lay his weary head 
And that the world was incomplete 
And the king would soon be dead 
She offered me her wing that night 
I took the road instead 
Maybe im back, baby 
Maybe im falling from the poplar tree 
Carry me back, baby 
With borrowed pride 
I could not hide 
I grew a sailors beard 
And as I walked to my innocence 
My leaves disappeared 
Rented a room upon the hill 
Where a marble cat appeared 
Showed me where the fire was 
And I had nothing to fear 
For all gods good 
And brotherhood 
We drank til I was crowned 
Then a lady from the Everglades pulled my ass up off the ground 
She kissed me four times on the cheek 
And once upon the brow 
For a moment I believed that I had come for what I found 
Now I sit alone with all the cracks in my guitar 
For all the miles Ive put behind 
I havent come that far 
But we are all compelled to look 
For the wind inside a jar 
Maybe Im back, baby 
Maybe Im falling from the poplar tree 
Carry me back, baby
