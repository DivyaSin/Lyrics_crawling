Here they come 
Slumming their way outta the Jacuzzi 
Well, I've lived in a slum, sugarplum 
Hit and run and it did not amuse me There they go moving around on the radio 
Well I've been on that show 
Reap and sow, feed and grow 
And it did not amuse me Hey citizen, hey American 
Hey Russian, hey Citizen Beauty stab 
When the good things in life 
Have all grown bad, the cat's out the bag 
Smash and grab, burn the flag And didn't it fool me throw it out 
It's not worth the paper it's written on 
No ifs and buts, spending cuts, cheaper smut 
They say they could use me All through summer 
There's no glamour in the slammer 
No glamour in the slammer 
Until you make a run All through summer 
The splendors, pretty slender 
The splendors pretty slender 
Until you make a run Here they come 
Slumming their way out of the Jacuzzi 
Well I've lived in a slum, sugar plum 
Hit and run and it did not amuse me There they go 
Grooving around on the radio 
Well I've been on that show, reap and sow 
Feed and grow, and it didn't amuse me Hey villager, hey citizen 
Hey countryman, hey, now listen Hey Chinaman, hey European 
Hey Russian, hey American Hey cowboy, hey Indian 
Hey anyway, hey, hey, hey citizen
