When you have to look away 
When you don't have much to say 
That's when I love you 
I love you just that way 
To here you stumble when you speak 
Or see you walk with two left feet 
That's when I love you 
I love you endlessly 
And when your mad cause you lost the game 
Forget I'm waiting in the rain 
Baby I love you 
I love you anyway Cause here's my promise made tonight 
You can count on me for life 
Cause that's when I love you 
When nothing you do can change my mind 
The more I learn the more I love 
The more my heart can't get enough 
That's when I love you 
When I love you 
No matter what So when you turn to hide your eyes 
Cause the movie it made you cry 
That's when I love you 
I love you 
A little more each time 
And when you cant quite match you clothes 
Or when you laugh at your own jokes 
That's when I love you I love you 
More then you know 
And when you forgot that we had a date 
Or that look that you give when you show up late 
Baby I love you I love you anyway So here's my promise made tonight 
You can count on me for life 
Cause that's when I love you 
When nothing you do can change my mind 
The more I learn the more I love 
The more my heart cant get enough 
That's when I love you 
When I love you 
No matter what Oh that's when I love you when nothing baby, nothing you do could change my mind 
The more I learn, the more I love, the more my heart can't get enough 
That's when I love you, when I love you no matter what Oh no matter what
