[Verse 1] 
I smoked away my brain, 
I think Im going dumb 
Cocaine up on my gums, 
I think they going numb 
Im having stomach pains, 
Now Im throwing up 
Cause Im a microphone fiend, 
Give me the bass, give me the beat 
And let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream 
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King with a dream 
That one day, with my team, we can make it with this rappin 
Now we swaggin making money in Manhattan, straight was happenin 
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you 
A rebel to my death is in my flesh is in my vessels 
Fuck the clique you with, 
Im finna fuck the bitch you next to 
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, Im disrespectful 
They know the kid get it, get get sick spit 
Clip spit, quick split shit, hit kids, women 
Oh thats your girl huh that I just hit 
Its ASAP nigga live with it [Chorus: repeat 2X] 
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone These demon thoughts they start to drown me Lord don't leave me all alone 
[ASAP Rocky] {Aw, yeah... aw, yeah...} let the beat chill {*3X*} Hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel 
[Chorus]
