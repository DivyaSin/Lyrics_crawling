Well, I take off my shoes 
When I walk in her door 
And try my best to levitate 
'Cross her living room floor 
'Cause you can't leave tracks 
When you're on hallowed ground 
She'll just make you sweep 'em up 
Like you're being hunted down 
She's the queen of perfection 
Everybody knows why 
She's the queen of perfection 
And she's soon gonna die 
She says, "your body is a temple, boy 
You ought to treat it well 
But you trash the place and rent it out 
Like it's some cheap motel" 
Then she takes away my plate 
Before I've finished my meal 
And works on my hygiene 
Against my will 
She's the queen of perfection 
Everybody knows why 
She's the queen of perfection 
And she's soon gonna die 
Well, Marie Antoinette, she said, 
"Let 'em eat cake" 
While she should have been planning 
Her own damn escape 
Now I smile 'cross the table 
At my lady supreme 
Knowin' that her coffee's laced 
With Mr. Clean 
She's the queen pf perfection 
Everybody knows why 
She's the queen of perfection 
And she's soon gonna die 
She's the queen of perfection 
Everybody knows why 
She's the queen of perfection 
And she's soon gonna die
