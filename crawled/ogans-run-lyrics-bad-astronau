Be strong and you will be renewed 
I was raised in a tragedy by slaves 
where kids are drug addicts or 
they are bored and lazy still 
I return to my home town and 
it's just like going to a funeral 
and all of them are dying in love 
with paradise idle conversation makes 
them wise did you hear the one about 
Greg a rare talent he was unsung until 
the blow came no one really dies they 
just get fired our legacy to retire 
young and all of them are drowning the 
waves of apathy trust fund junkies slamming 
the debris it's a dream identify now and then 
I miss her her masochistic hands fulfilling 
empty plans and all of us 
our lying on golden shores of greed 
we're dead by thirty dead by thirty 
dead in daydream
