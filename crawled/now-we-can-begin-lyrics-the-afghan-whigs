Mother's very proud of you, son 
Come and sit upon her knee 
I've got some new denial 
I want to change my plea I've seen through alcohol 
Raise up the sheets again 
Told you that you should fear me 
I love to pretend If I was to correct you 
Every time you was wrong 
I'd be talking all the time 
And laughing at you twice as long I've seen through alcohol 
I've seen the auctioneer 
Raise up the sheets again 
Right now I need you near 
Through him with him in
