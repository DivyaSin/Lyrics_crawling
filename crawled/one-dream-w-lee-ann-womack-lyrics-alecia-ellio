Somewhere in our hearts 
Somewhere deep inside 
lives a dream 
thats worth dreaming Every now and then 
I get a glimpse of where 
he and I could fly 
but you an I 
share One dream 
One hope 
we're heading down the same road 
even though we dont know where it leads 
we follow 
the same star 
I'm in love like you are 
until he reaches out for you or me 
we share 
one dream I imagined what would be 
magical place is 
waiting for me 
its still out there our vision is the same 
even though the world through 
different eyes 
you and I 
share One dream 
One hope 
we're heading down the same road 
even though we dont know where it leads 
we follow 
the same star 
im in love like you are 
till he reaches out for you or me 
we share 
one dream One dream 
One hope 
we're heading down the same road 
even though we dont know where it leads 
we follow 
the same star 
im in love like you are 
till he reaches out for you or me 
we share 
one dream one dream
