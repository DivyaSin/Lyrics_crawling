Are you going to get it over again, 
Saying that we're just friends, 
Starting over from the start after all we've been thru' 
Are those 3 words meaningless to you? Going back to the start, 
can only remind me what we were up to, 
the memories we built with the sand the castle where our love stand 
is gone by the shores that is raging on Pre chorus: 
so I should let you go 
and I should let you know c/o 
If you wanna go away, 
Walk out the entrance of my heart, 
you'll find your way back in, 
cuz' I'm always be there, 
Holding a picture of us I should be less asking 
If our love aint de|ser|ving, 
Let the memories be washed away 
if you really cannot stay 
when i close my eyes i'll hope you'll be there Maybe its just not enough 
Your hands i held by the beach 
saying forever just too soon 
it would turn out that 
you're the one that I love 
And you love me and you leave me, so c/o: 
If you wanna go away, 
Walk out the entrance of my heart, 
you'll find your way back in, 
cuz' I'm always be there, 
Holding a picture of us Maybe all I need 
is just you and me 
Like the old times when we sail through the sea 
but now Im just 
Holding a picture of us Bridge: 
I can't lay back on the ground, 
If I cant be with you around, 
Not after all those time, 
You promised me youre mine. 
Ill turn back the time. c/o 
If you wanna go away, 
Walk out the entrance of my heart, 
you'll find your way back in, 
cuz' I'm always be there, 
Holding a picture of us Maybe all I need 
is just you and me 
Like the old times when we sail through the sea 
but now Im just 
holding the picture of us
