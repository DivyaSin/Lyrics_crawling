Im feelin, im feelin uneven and my socks dont match 
To my crew youre my team and I got yo back 
Im tired of not sleeping and but its not so bad 
Im living out my dreams and my works off for that 
Reaching out with my arms tied behind my back 
Preaching out in my heart but its time to rap 
I reminisce on last night while im loving the track 
But one light with gods stand but they running the pack 
Somebody let me know when im running on track 
Take this knife off my neck and cut me some slack 
The purest soul, hes earned em on his son and the black 
I stare at the sky feeling like the dirtiest rag 
ugly I stand, suddenly gets our and bled 
Devoured by the devil, hes a powerful man 
But fathom is my god, so I cant be beaten 
But we lack as a whole, he will deliver, CMON Yea, Im just a puzzle chu-- the missing pieces 
Called on god so he can be my completion 
Songs I faced only last for a season while it rains and pours it was he I believed in 
Evils up this earth placed in deceivement 
Many feel condemned knowing that he seems them 
Knowing that he closes his eyes when he sees sin 
Knowing hes as real as the air that we breathe in 
Missing church and getting hurt every weekend 
Knowing that the only way to heaven is to sneak in 
Its not an option no 
Understand your not alone as tears flow from your opitic oos 
Like a glass of lemonade when I squeeze the mic 
Surrounded by snakes with sharp teeth they bite 
Rejoicing my pain, 
So I sing instead of cry knowing that hes coming back like a thieve in the night CMON How can we doubt whats always been real 
Receive feelings of proof but still denied the truth 
Eaten alive, thirsty for ice livin water 
Steaks inside, a nice cold bottle of coscia 
the gospel being sold out by imposters 
Christ paid the price so my sins wouldnt lock us 
Cost us a life; knock us outa the game 
Group the kill r pain theres only one name 
Judge me for my cost but im not going to pay 
Its not long distance, hes not far away 
The ends of time tried to scared my face 
But theres no limitations living in gods grace 
Hes eat me fresh and turns my bad into good 
Hes not out to burn us just misunderstood 
Misconceptions in the minds of the mislead 
From misquoted words but thats not what it said 
You rather end the wrong contact plus never ask god to reveal what he promised (nah) 
Its not always gunna be crystal clear, working out my salvation as I tremble in fear 
tronair to the definition of love, life,from under washing my dirty dishes with this blood 
I can see past, the physical realm let god in your heart and become overwhelmed 
Still bound, by the spirit of the one (one), who shed his blood for you 
He gave us free will, and free tum (tum) but theres consequences for the things we do CMON
