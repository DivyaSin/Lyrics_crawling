With the heartbreak open 
So much you can't hide 
Put on a little make-up, make-up 
Make sure they get your good side good side If the words unspoken 
Get stuck in your throat 
Send a treasure token, token 
Write it on a pound note, pound note Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes 
Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes Don't drink don't smoke - what do you do? 
You don't drink don't smoke - what do you do? 
Subtle innuendoes follow 
There must be something inside We don't follow fashion 
That would be a joke 
You know we're gonna set them, set them 
So everyone can take note, take note When they saw you kneeling 
Crying words that you mean 
Opening their eyeballs, eyeballs 
Pretending that you're al green, al green Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes 
Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes Don't drink don't smoke - what do you do? 
You don't drink don't smoke - what do you do? 
Subtle innuendoes follow 
Must be something inside No one's gonna tell me 
What's wrong or what's right 
Or tell me who to eat with, sleep with 
Or that I've won the big fight, big fight Look out or they'll tell you 
You're a "superstar" 
Two weeks and you're an all time legend 
I think the games have gone much too far If the words unspoken 
Get stuck in your throat 
Send a treasure token, token 
Write it on a pound note, pound note Don't drink don't smoke - what do you do? 
You don't drink don't smoke - what do you do? 
Subtle innuendoes follow 
Must be something inside (he's hiding)
