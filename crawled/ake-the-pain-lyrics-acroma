Waking up most days I feel more 
Like a dead man rising 
It seems like too much energy for a bag of bones 
And for the lucky souls 
Waters wash away the cobwebs 
And for the lesser bones 
Lonely hearts and soup lines in the rain 
Take the pain And suddenly everything is only everything 
Don't mean a thing at all because finally I can breathe 
And like an ocean swell it changes everything 
I'm in your heart now and finally I can breathe Waking up most days I feel more 
Like a cold cadaver 
That's on the cutting board 
And those in line await with plates 
And for the lucky souls 
The warm ground takes away the coldness 
And for the lesser bones 
Lonely hearts and time to think remain 
Take the pain And suddenly everything is only everything 
Don't mean a thing at all because finally I can breathe 
And like a ocean swell it changes everything 
I'm in your heart now and finally I can breathe Take the pain 
Who'll take it? 
Who will take the pain, when it all goes wrong? 
Take the pain 
Who'll take it? 
Who will take the pain, when it all goes wrong? Waking up most days I feel more like a dead man rising 
It seems like too much energy for a bag of bones 
For a bag of bones
