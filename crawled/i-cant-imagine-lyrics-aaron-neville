You know I wondered where I be if not for you 
I'd still be wondering through this world without a clue 
At night I wake up and look across the bed 
And you never think that crazy things 
Were running through my head. I can't imagine 
Our journey through this world without you 
I'm loving everything about you I search my heart and 
Soul how could there ever be a greater love than ours 
I can't imagine Oh oh I want to wrap you like a present in my arms 
Give you to myself and keep you safe from harm 
My every moment devoted to your care I don't even 
Want to think how I survived without you here I can't imagine 
Our journey through this world without you 
I'm loving everything about you I search my heart and 
Soul how could there ever be a greater love than ours 
I can't imagine Shared my life with any other 
I'm making love with you I can't imagine 
I search my heart and soul how could there ever be 
A greater love than ours Let me tempt you and deliver 
Let me make you feel the open road 
I'll make your blood run like the river 
How could it be, be better than to ever 
Love you more I can't imagine 
Our journey through this world without you 
I'm loving everything about you I search my heart and 
Soul how could there ever be a greater love than ours 
I can't imagine
