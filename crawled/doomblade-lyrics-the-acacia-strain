Behold the hydra 
An endless source of blood and brain 
Lies from lies, you liar. Hang your head - Hang yourself in shame 
My heart is made of wasps and my brain is made of flies 
I can read your thoughts and I can hear your lies 
My lungs are filled with fire and my fists are filled with hate 
By the time you start running, it will already be too late 
I hope they leave you to die. I hope the rats eat you alive 
Stop chasing your dreams, they will never come true 
And when she screams, she will be screaming for you 
Reality is only as far as you can see 
Give me room to breathe, give me room to breathe 
And as youre lying face down in the dirt, I hope you felt it, I hope it 
Fucking hurt
