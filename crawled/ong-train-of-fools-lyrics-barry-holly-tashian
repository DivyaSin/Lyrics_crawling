My lonely heart was waitin' 
You came right on time 
You soon had me believin' 
True love was on your mind 
You took me straight to heaven 
I thought we had it made 
But, baby, heaven was just a stop along the way [Chorus] 
There's a long train rollin' 
And a blue moon above 
You switched me back, I jumped the track 
On that railroad of love 
You engineered my sadness 
You treated me so cruel 
Now I'm just another rider 
On your long train of fools Things kept movin' faster 
We had love to burn 
Thought we were on the same track 
But you took a different turn 
And now that it's all over 
I ask myself sometimes 
How many others have you taken down that line?
