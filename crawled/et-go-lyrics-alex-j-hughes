Come on and doubt me I dare ya, youre just too condescending 
Name me some damn reason, our names are set in stone 
My scars are finally healing, yours beg to be exposed 
My dreams live on tonight, but whats left of yours? And Ill be fine 
Take the first train no time to say goodbye 
Wish away the face I came to know 
Sometimes you gotta let go Restless now arent ya (cha), Ive realigned the stars 
You cant escape now, from your reckless heart And Ill be fine 
Take the first train no time to say goodbye 
Wish away the face I came to know 
Sometimes you gotta let go Call me crazy, hate me, love me 
No such thing as the way it should be now 
All I got ta do is break freeee And Ill be fine 
Take the first train no time to say goodbye 
Wish away the face I came to know 
Sometimes you gotta let go 
Gotta let go 
Gotta let go
