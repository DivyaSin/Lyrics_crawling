You walk alone 
A different kind of stride from what you've known 
And in your eyes there is a knowing 
The I've seen before 
It must be hard to manage such a life with such a past 
But on your face I see it showing 
Wow thats just your way 
Goodbye to day 
Goodbye to everything you say 
Goodbye to day 
Goodbye to what I thought I knew 
How your sky appeared so blue 
The sunlight falls and flickers on your hair of golden brown 
Yes I remember how it was when we were young 
We never knew the line we'd walk was closer to the edge 
But I can't stay to watch you fall 
Cause thats just my way 
Goodbye to day 
Goodbye to everything you say 
Goodbye to day 
Goodbye to what I thought I knew 
How your sky appeared so blue 
But I never really knew 
I thought I'd be the one 
To walk where angels never tread 
It's you who chose to run 
And put your fears to bed
