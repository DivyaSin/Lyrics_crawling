It's shit now you're only one hour away 
Not that that matters when I 
Couldn't stay 
Yes sir, we were almost in line 
Blinded I was 
Yet I took my time It's beautiful 
And it's beautiful Your hair is on fire 
Your lips are unscathed 
These people are nothing 
And I've got to moan It's shit now you're only one hour away
