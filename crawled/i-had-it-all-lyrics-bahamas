I had it all and my breath held tight 
She heard a call kept her up most night 
And worst of all wondering what about us was ever right I stayed at home dreamt of all we might be 
Egypt and Rome, she saw all she could see 
Then coming home wondering why she couldn't find me Now measure time 
To know what's mine 
I'm turning around 
I'm turning around 
Turning on a dime Done it before dropped it all and I ran 
I slept on the shore woke up cold and tanned 
I burst through the door like I was still, still your man Now measure time 
To know what's mine 
I'm turning around 
I'm turning around 
Turning on a dime I had it all
