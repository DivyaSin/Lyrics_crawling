I can't sleep 
Dry red eyes wide open 
Starin' at the white stucco ceiling 
Turn on the TV 
Watch music on television 
Have I heard this song before, did this already happen? Derived influence 
In style of dress 
Similar trends in camera technique and editing 
Sync up the cuts (sync up the cuts) 
To the bass drum kick (to the bass drum kick) 
All the taste-makers drinking from the same glass Is there anybody thinking what I am? 
Is there anybody thinking what I am? Are you restless like me? 
Are you restless like me? 
Are you restless like me? And all the insiders rumor 
About a decline in sales 
All the buzz is happening in the new digital market place 
FBI warning 
Printed on the flip side 
Under penalty of law piracy will be prosecuted And in MRR (and in MRR) 
Someone asks the question (someone asks the question) 
With the instant availability of information 
And content so easily obtainable 
Is the culture now a product that's disposable? 
Are the punks still singing the same song? Is there anybody thinking what I am? 
Is there any other alternative at all? Are you restless like me? 
Are you restless like me? 
Are you restless like me 
Like me?
