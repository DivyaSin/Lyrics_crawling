"Oh rose, thou art sick 
The invisible worm that flies in the night 
In the howling storm 
Has found out thy bed of crimson joy 
And his dark secret love 
Doth life destroy" 
(Wm. Blake) 
Oh fallen star of wormwood grace 
Grant me the smile of Janus face 
Give me a twin identity 
A false integrity 
To my city set upon the hill 
With a godlike view at my own will 
Give me the cure for the world's pain 
Give me the god of Cain 
For damned in forbearance I have crawled 
Half awake Ive gotten old 
I got the gum card of every sin 
Sent for the Christ to win 
Deviltry 
Some simple deviltry 
Black deviltry 
The vice of kings and knaves 
The king of kings and knaves 
Bunch of slaves 
For I got no promises to keep 
Wouldn't bother to sow even less to reap 
And I know there's sense in being sane 
There's reality to blame 
But I still got something resembling pride 
So one more time give me a ride 
Crush in my nasal bone and ride 
Rattle my spine
