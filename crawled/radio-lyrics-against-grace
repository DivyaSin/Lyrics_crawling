i can't remember the last time 
That I felt like something good happened 
You left these photographs out for me 
To see and remember the good times And I will live in the echoes of 
My song until something good happens Rainbows and butterfly kisses hold 
Me down and keep me asleep at night 
And I can't even write home about 
These things that cross my radio I won't ever let you forget 
Just what you gave and took away 
When will the thought of you fade 
Just like another song I wrote for you And I will live in the echoes of 
My song until something good happens Rainbows and butterfly kisses hold 
Me down and keep me asleep at night 
And I can't even write home about 
These things that cross my radio I can't write, write home 
Of these dark, these things 
That cross my, my radio 
I can't write, write home Rainbows and butterfly kisses hold 
Me down and keep me asleep at night 
And I can't even write home about 
These things that cross my radio (x2) 
My radio, my radio, my radio, my radio 
My radio, my radio, my radio, my radio
