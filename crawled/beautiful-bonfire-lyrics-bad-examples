I can smell your cigarettes in my dreams 
Im filling your pockets with gasoline 
Maybe Ill catch you in the dark 
What a beautiful bonfire we could start 
I got a Kawasaki with one flat tire 
Gonna fill it with air and ride all night 
I thought you could be trusted in my home 
What a beautful bonfire of my hopes 
I wish I was a little meaner, a little drunker, a man with a gun 
I might just let these feelings show 
Wouldnt you be the lucky one ... 
Theres a train coming I can see 
He isnt quite as fast as me 
Im gonna cut across the tracks in time 
Another sucker just gets by 
Another sucker just gets by 
Theres heroin tracks on the moon 
Im gonna kill somebody, wont be you 
Im so cold I cant even breath 
What a beautiful bonfire you made of me 
I wish I was a little meaner, a little drunker, a man with a gun 
I might just let these feelings show 
Wouldnt you be the lucky one ... 
I can smell your cigarettes in my dreams 
Im filling your pockets with gasoline 
Maybe Ill catch you in the dark 
What a beautiful bonfire we could start
