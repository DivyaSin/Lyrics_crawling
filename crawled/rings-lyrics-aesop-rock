Used to draw 
Hard to admit that I used to draw 
Portraiture in a human form 
Doodle of a two headed unicorn, it was soothing 
Moving his arm in a fusion of man mad tools And a muse from from beyond 
Even if it went beautifully wrong 
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong 
No name nuisance 
Stools in the bedroom Oozed in a brand new cuneiform 
Barely commune with the horde 
Got a whole gray scale ungluing his world 
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie 
Unseen hand dragging his graphite Cross contour little bit of back light 
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize 
You can imagine the rush that ensue 
When you get 3 dimensions stuffed into 2 Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do 
Being trained and observed by a capable few 
Back in New York, 5 peeps and a dog 
In a 2 bedroom doing menial jobs Plus, rhyming and stealing and being a clod 
Distractions free to maraud I left some years a deer in the light 
I left some will to spirit away 
I let my fears materialize 
I let my skills deteriorate Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing a mission that was routed in a 20 year affinity in rickety condition with an ID crisis 
Nap on the front lawn, look up at the sky its 
Shapes falling out of the fringe All heart though we would've made cowardly kinds 
They will chop you down just to count your rings 
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
And there were 
Colors pouring out of the fringe All heart though we would've made cowardly kings 
They will chop you down just to count your rings 
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
Used to paint Hard to admit that I used to paint 
Natural light on the human face 
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass 
It was blooming addiction A miss and push and a pigment 
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look 
Pinhead kids intermittent 
Drank Kool Aid from a tube of acrylic And I grew up linseed oil over linen 
Joy to the poison, voice in the resin 
Capture a map of the gesture 
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure Redo that, move that inward 
Zinc white lightening shoots from his fingers 
Studios drone with allusions of tinctures 
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures You can imagine the stars that align 
When a forearm starts foreshortening right 
Or a torso hung on a warping spine 
And proportion reads as warm and alive Routine day with a dirt cheap brush 
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched 
Then 2, then 3, then a month 
Then the rest of your life you beat yourself up I left some seasons eager to fall 
I left some work to bury alive 
I let my means of being dissolve 
I let my person curl up and die Eating up his innards in unfeasible anxiety is brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy aligning with the trials of the Anti-Midas 
Nap on the back lawn look up at the sky its 
Shapes falling out of the fringe All heart though we would've made cowardly kinds 
They will chop you down just to count your rings 
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
And there were Colors pouring out of the fringe 
All heart though we would've made cowardly kings 
They will chop you down just to count your rings 
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
