Ones too many and a hundred ain't enough 
for Corna baby give me more oh that stuff 
oh baby oh baby we had a real good time 
Pipey Magraw 
Pipey Magraw 
Pipey Magraw 
Pipey Magraw I run a monkey casino 
I gotta head full of vino 
I hear the voices of evil 
Telling me to do murder. 
I got my false feel 
I got my false friends 
I got my rum deal 
I got my soul train 
It's coming round the bend And believe me 
You know you wouldn't wanna be me 
Nor would you want the shame or the strain of my name 
But if i can live my life all over again 
There ain't one single thing I'd change Bilo, they call me Billy Bilo 
I'm like a fish on a lilo, I'm all out of place 
It's written all over my face Bilo, some call me blood clot weirdo 
Oh they fuck with your mind, oh 
When you do it skag and bone Bilo, they call me Billy Bilo 
Oh they fuck with your mind, oh 
When you do it skag and bone Pipey Magraw 
That's Pipey Magraw 
Pipey Magraw 
That's Pipey Magraw One's too many and a hundred ain't enough 
For Corna baby give me more oh that stuff 
Oh baby, oh baby 
We had a real good time 
Just me and you
