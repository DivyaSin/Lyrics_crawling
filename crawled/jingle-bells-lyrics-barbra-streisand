Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
Jingle all the way. 
Oh! what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
Jingle all the way 
Oh! what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. Dashing through the snow 
In a one-horse open sleigh 
O'er the fields we go 
Laughing all the way 
Bells on bobtail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
A sleighing song tonight! Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
Jingle all the way. 
Oh! what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
Jingle all the way 
Oh! what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. A day or two ago 
I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright 
Was seated by my side 
The horse was lean and lank 
Misfortune seemed his lot, 
We ran into a drifted bank 
And there we got upsot. 
Upsot? Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
Jingle all the way. 
Oh! what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
Jingle all the way 
Oh! what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh Dashing through, the fields of white 
On this happy Christmas night 
Off we go through the snow 
Bells are ringing, but we're singing 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jing jangle 
Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jing jangle 
Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jing jangle 
Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jing jangle 
J-J-J-J-J-J-Jingle bells, J-J-J-J-J-Jangle bells 
J-J-J-J all the way 
In a one-horse open sleigh
