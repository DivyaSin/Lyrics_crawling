Home where my heart beats 
Where my love waits for me 
Where the winds of change 
Howl into my face There's rain off the headlands 
Closes in by day 
Don't cry, don't cry 
Wipe you tears away The rivers are rising 
There is a flood in me I can feel the heat 
In the air that I breathe Home 
WHERE A TOWN ONCE STOOD 
Home 
Before a storm 
Home 
WHERE A TOWN ONCE STOOD 
Home 
Before a storm Distant horizons 
Drowning in the fire 
Slowly, slowly 
A life flashing by The rivers are rising 
There is a flood in me 
I can feel the heat 
In the air that I breathe Home 
WHERE A TOWN ONCE STOOD 
Home 
Before a storm 
Home 
WHERE A TOWN ONCE STOOD 
Home 
Before a storm Home 
WHERE A TOWN ONCE STOOD 
Home 
Before a storm 
Home 
WHERE A TOWN ONCE STOOD 
Home 
Before a storm Whoa, whoa
