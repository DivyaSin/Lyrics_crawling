I remember all my life 
Raining down as cold as ice 
Shadows of a man 
A face through window cryin' in the night 
The night goes into Morning just another day 
Happy people pass my way 
Looking in their eyes 
I see a memory I never realized 
How happy you made me Oh Mandy, well you came and 
You gave without taking 
But I sent you away 
Oh Mandy, well you kissed me and 
Stopped me from shaking 
And I need you today oh, Mandy I'm standing on the edge of time 
I walked away when love was mine 
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing 
The tears are on my mind 
And nothin' is rhyming Oh Mandy, well you came and 
You gave without taking 
But I sent you away 
Oh Mandy, well you kissed me and 
Stopped me from shaking 
And I need you today oh, Mandy! Yesterday's a dream, I face the morning 
Cryin' on the breeze, the pain is calling Oh Mandy, well you came and 
You gave without taking 
But I sent you away 
Oh Mandy, well you kissed me and 
Stopped me from shaking 
And I need you today Oh Mandy, you came and 
You gave without taking 
But I sent you away 
Oh Mandy, you kissed me and 
Stopped me from shaking 
And I need you
