I been bad, bad as any other but I don't want to be bad no more 
And I been guilty, cheatin' on my lovers but I don't want to mess around no more Because I finally found a lady that means everything 
I promise I will never break her heart 
This time I 'll be committed and that's what I'll be 
I found my angel I found my star [Hook] 
You know you're truly somethin' special 
And I'll keep you right here 
In my heart baby, and you know I'm sincere 
You know you're truly somethin' special and I'll keep you right here 
In my heart baby, and I'll hold you so dear to me I can be good 
Good as any other, but I been bad for so long 
I want to be good your one and only lover and I want you to keep me strong There are no indecisions I've made up my mind 
Your the only girl for me yeah yeah 
It's time I started listenin' to this heart of mine 
I finally found the girl of my dreams [Hook x2] 
Oh I want to know, do you want to go with me baby 
Come on and marry me baby 
This time I will be true 
Girl always for you [Hook x2]
