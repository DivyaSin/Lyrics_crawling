Ah, Christine, my Christine 
What a triumph you gave me tonight 
My Christine 
All the dark silent years now set right 
Ah, Christine The song was beautiful 
It sounded beautiful 
Every note, every word And it felt beautiful 
And I felt beautiful 
Lost in the music once more 
Feeling it rise up and soar 
Alive once again My dearest wife 
Little Lotte, I beg you, forgive me 
Raoul, no 
Little Lotte 
Ah, what fools we once were Long ago in our youth 
In Paris at the opera 
Romantic idiot 
Those two people are gone Now I must go 
Our choices are made 
The opera is done 
The last notes have been played May your angel of music 
Watch over you now 
And give you what I wish 
I gave you somehow Yours, in regret 
Raoul
