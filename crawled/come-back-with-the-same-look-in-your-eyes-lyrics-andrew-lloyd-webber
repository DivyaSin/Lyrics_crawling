I will see you in a week or two 
It's late, you better get going. 
Take care of yourself and call anytime, 
You feel, that you're missing me! 
I can only say what I always say at these good-byes Come back with the same look in your eyes! 
I know, you've got your work to do 
And I know how much you love me. 
But sometimes a friendly face can look good to you on a lonely night 
If there comes a time, just remember, 
I'm the kind that cries Come back with the same look in your eyes! 
Everything, we want, we find in each other. 
We would be fools to let love slip away. 
Everything's so right, 
I'm scared that we might lose it one day. 
We could never keep things from one another, 
You know all the feelings that are in my heart. 
It's not easy, it's not easy when you have to be apart. So I'll see you in a week or two 
It's late, you better get going. 
You think that by now we know how to handle this 
But we never will. 
When you are away, everyday I pray 
That nothing dies and you'll come back 
With the same look in your eyes.
