Wish I could Keep You Much Longer 
I know You gotta Go 'cause you got things to do 
Wish I could Keep You Much Longer 
Now You to Busy for Me Girl like I was To You Wish I could Stop By 
And Maybe Say, "Hi" 
Wish I could just Stop By 
And Lay By Your Side The Tables have Turned 
And I've Finally Learned 
That this is Makin' Up for Every Day I was Gone 
And that's Why I'm Concerned 
But Now it's Confirmed 
That You Spread Your Wings and Learned to Fly All Alone Darkness in the Night 
I'll Find that Light for You 
As Long as I got Eyes 
I'll have a Sight for You 
Long as I am Alive Baby I?d Die for You 
I Wanna Be With You Wish I could Keep You Much Longer 
I know You gotta Go 'cause you got things to do 
Wish I could Keep You Much Longer 
Now You to Busy for Me Girl like I was To You Wish I could Stop By 
And Maybe Say, "Hi" 
Wish I could just Stop By 
And Lay By Your Side You're Always On My Mind 
While I'm Racin' 
While I'm Paper Chasin' 
You Were There when I said One Day I'd Get Up Out that basement 
Playin' as My Agent 
For You, There's No Replacement 
You Will Always Be My Girl 
and You can Hold Me on that Statement Darkness in the Night 
I'll Find that Light for You
