The world is cruel, the world is wicked 
It's I alone whom you can trust in this whole city 
I am your only friend 
I who keep you, teach you, feed you, dress you I who look upon you without fear 
How can I protect you, boy, unless you 
Always stay in here, away in here 
Remember what I've taught you, Quasimodo You are deformed, I am deformed 
And you are ugly, and I am ugly 
And these are crimes for which the world shows little pity 
You do not comprehend, you are my one defender Out there they'll revile you as a monster 
I am a monster out there they will hate 
And scorn and jeer, only a monster 
Why invite their calumny and consternation? 
Stay in here Be faithful to me, I'm faithful 
Grateful to me, I'm grateful 
Do as I say, obey 
And stay in here Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone 
Gazing at the people down below me 
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone 
Hungry for the histories they'd shown me All my life I memorize their faces 
Knowing them as they will never know me 
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day 
Not above them but part of them And out there living in the sun 
Give me one day out there 
All I ask is one to hold forever 
Out there where they all live unaware 
What I'd give, what I'd dare 
Just to live one day out there Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives 
Through the roofs and gables I can see them 
Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives 
Heedless of the gift it is to be them 
If I was in their skin, I'd treasure every instant Out there strolling by the Seine 
Taste a morning out there like ordinary men 
Who freely walk about there just one day and then 
I swear I'll be content with my share 
Won't resent, won't despair, old and bent I won't care 
I'll have spent one day out there
