Laying lazy. Hazy. 
Crazy thoughts are dancing through my brain as I'm lying here with you 
Shifting. Sifting through the night before and 
My clothes are on the floor 
Why's that sock up on the door? I guess it must be morning 'cause you got to go so fast 
Stay with me, my darling. Let this love last; when I come to 
Then in my hazy state I'll find your number on my hand 
On a brown paper bag; write a message on tag 
Is it bright enough to see? Cause slowly I can read Straight lines fade away with you 
Cause I tripped in your groove 
Street lights fade away to blue 
Yes, I'm staring at you 
And its bright enough to see that straight lines fade away with you Trying hard to please me. Its so easy baby 
Wipe that sleep out of your eyes 
And, where you passed out on my sleeve I see a little drool spot because 
You drank a lot. 
Did you dream about me too, last night? 
All the sudden startled, knowing Now it must be morning 'cause you got to go so fast 
Stay with me, my darling. Let this love last; Please, please do. 
Then in my hazy state I'll find your number on my hand 
On a brown paper bag; write a message on tag 
Is it bright enough to see? Cause slowly I can read Straight lines fade away with you 
Cause I tripped in your groove 
Street lights fade away to blue 
Yes, I'm staring at you 
And its bright enough to see that straight lines fade away Take it with you now 
Let it in and let it out 
Everyday in everyway just like I'd say from the night before 
So, take it with you now 
Let it in and let it out Everyday in everyway just like I'd say 'til the sun burns out 
Burns out. Yeah Straight lines fade away with you 
Cause I tripped in your groove 
Street lights fade away to blue 
Cause I'm staring at you Straight lines fade away with you 
Cause I tripped in your groove 
And its bright enough to see that straight lines fade away 
Straight lines fade away 
Yeah, straight lines fade away
