Today won't be like yesterday 
The bell tolls for an hour straight 
Screaming mothers chase their children down 
Fathers tear out their eyes 
As the city topples to the ground Outside the streets are in a panic 
Truth sellers jump from tall, tall ledges 
No sign of Christ with a sword in his mouth 
Beneath the blood red sky I'll sit and laugh with you tonight This is a promise I made to you 
I'll be right there 
I'll be right next to you When the trumpets blare the loudest and cannons roar 
All the trains that once came for you 
Spill off the tracks floor 
All your horrors they multiply 
And you realize your fears 
I'll block your ears with both of my hands 
Kiss away the tears
