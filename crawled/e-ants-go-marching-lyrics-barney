He ants go marching one by one hurrah hurrah 
The ants go marching two by two hurrah hurrah 
The ants go marching three by three 
The little one stops to climb a tree And they all go marching 
Down to the ground 
To get out of the rain Boom boom boom boom 
Boom boom boom boom The ants go marching four by four hurrah hurrah 
The ants go marching five by five hurrah hurrah 
The ants go marching six by six 
The little one stops to pick up sticks And they all go marching 
Down to the ground 
To get out of the rain

Boom boom boom boom The ants go marching seven by seven hurrah hurrah 
The ants go marching eight by eight hurrah hurrah 
The ants go marching nine by nine 
The little one stops to check the time And they all go marching 
Down to the ground 
To get out of the rain Boom boom boom boom 
Boom boom boom boom The ants go marching ten by ten 
The little one stops to say 
The end And they all go marching 
Down to the ground 
To get out of the rain Boom boom boom boom
