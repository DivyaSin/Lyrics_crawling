I feel the sun, its returned again 
To chase the cold far away 
Im not alone to fight the world Im in 
You gave me hope for better days I was searching for a friend like no other 
I never thought Youd come my way Everything I give to You 
Ill love You so 
Everything I say or do 
Ill love You so Look where weve come, how could I ever forget 
Before Your love my heart was dead? 
I was afraid that my sun would set 
But You stayed around to lift my head I was living my whole life undercover 
I never dreamed Id see Your face Everything I give to You 
Ill love You so 
And everything I say or do 
Ill love You so Ooh, Ill love You so 
Ooh, Ill love You so Everything I give to You 
Ill let it go 
Everything I say or do 
Ill love You so Ooh, Ill love You so 
Ooh, Ill love You so (Ooh, I feel the sun) 
Ill love You so 
I feel the sun
