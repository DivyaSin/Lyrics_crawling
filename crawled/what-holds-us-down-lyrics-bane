We are only brave enough to fight the battles already won for us 
And spend more time with our hair than we do our minds 
While the girls and the young and the lost 
Are kicked off to the side Our armies in fractions because our kings are so foolish 
We will never know true victory and are happy just to survive 
To live to dance another day 
Still clinging to those golden, olden days While our mouths sweep the mess to the back of our minds 
Nothing ever changing as we all grow older 
Nothing ever changing as our hearts grow colder 
Thats what holds us down 
We flap our wings but we never leave the ground
