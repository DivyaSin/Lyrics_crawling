Mama never taught me how to love 
Daddy never taught me how to feel 
Mama never taught me how to touch 
Daddy never showed me how to heal Mama never set a good example 
Daddy never held mama's hand 
Mama found everything hard to handle 
Daddy never stood up like a man I've walked around broken, 
Emotionally frozen 
Can't get on, getting it wrong [Chorus] 
How do you love someone? 
Without getting hurt 
How do you love someone? 
Without crawling in the dirt 
So far in my life, 
Clouds have blocked the sun 
How do you love, how do you love someone? 
How do you love, how do you love someone? I was always the chosen child 
The biggest scandal I became 
They told me I'd never survive, 
But survival's my middle name I've walking around hoping, 
Just barely coping 
Getting on, getting it wrong [Chorus] It's hard to talk, 
To see what's deep inside 
It's hard to tell the truth, 
When you've always lied [Chorus] How do you love someone? 
And make it last 
How do you love someone? 
Without tripping on the past So far in my life, 
Clouds have blocked the sun 
How do you love, how do you love someone? 
How do you love, how do you love someone? Someone
