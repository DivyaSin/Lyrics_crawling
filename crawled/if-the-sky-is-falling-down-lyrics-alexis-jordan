What I wouldn't give to 
Wrestle over the remote control 
What I wouldn't give to 
Hit you harder than you thought I could 
With a pillow Can we stop just for a second? 
Cause you got as feather in your eye 
I get it out and you kiss me 
I smile and than we get back to our pillow fight 
Man that sounds nice If the sky begin to fall 
We won't even notice 
Well it wouldn't bother us at all 
If the world came to an end 
Nothing else but us two 
When I'm laying around with you 
When I'm laying around with you What I wouldn't give to... What I wouldn't give to 
Cook you dinner from the microwave 
What I wouldn't give to 
Burn the popcorn and hear you telling me; "baby that's okay" 
And then you leave to go to the store 
And it's too much for me 
Though I know it'll only be a minute 
And then you come back through the door 
With a bag full of foods we're not supposed to eat 
That's a night that can't be beat If the sky begin to fall 
We won't even notice 
Really wouldn't bother us at all 
If the world came to an end 
Nothing else but us two 
When I'm laying around with you 
When I'm laying around with you What I woudln't give to... I wanna be in your arms 
Where no harm could ever come my way 
I wanna be where you are 
Near or far, every night and day If the sky begin to fall 
We won't even notice 
Really wouldn't bother us at all 
If the world came to an end 
Nothing else but us two 
When I'm laying around with you 
When I'm laying around with you If the sky begin to fall 
We won't even notice 
Really wouldn't bother us at all 
If the world came to an end 
Nothing else but us two 
When I'm laying around with you 
When I'm laying around with you
