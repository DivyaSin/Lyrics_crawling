Thank you! 
You know this is, I haven't done a concert, in about six years. and 
It's oh thank you... but it's very exciting I 
Must say, but it's also terribly, terribly 
Scary... ooh, god I wish I was back on the set! 
Mmm, I gotta tell you this funny thing. but it's 
Not so funny. but talking about being scared 
I was even more scared till I spoke to friends 
Of mine also performers, you know...and they 
Were telling me that they also... uh ...[drinks Tea] 
Tastes much better that way! the Japaneses 
Said so! anyway... they told me that in order 
To conquer their fears, you know, they ... eh 
Well, some of them drink; but I really hate 
The taste of liquors, so i...you know, I can't 
Do that... and some of them... uh ... take pills; 
But I can't even swallow aspirin, so I can't 
Do that, but... more important than that... I 
Have found, and I believe, that performers 
Should be very strong, you know, and... you don't 
Know what I'm gonna say... your way ahead of me tonight. 
It's still illegal? we should face our problems head 
On! you know... what I was about to say you see, 
I have found that the way I conquer my fear of 
A performance is just to... uhm... you know, 
Talk about it, and you get it out in the open, 
And you discuss it with a little...excuse me... 
[sniff] you just, you just talk about it freely and just... 
Everything... and she's... what a fantastic 
Accord you just played... what was that of f minor 
7th with a demented pinky on the 5th it was really high.
