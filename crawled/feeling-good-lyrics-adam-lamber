Bird flying high 
You know how I feeel 
Sun in the sky 
You know how I feel 
Reeds drifting on by 
You know how I feel 
Its a new dawn 
Its a new day 
Its a new life 
For me.. 
And I'm feeling good Fish in the sea 
You know how I feel 
River feeling free 
You know how I feel 
Blossom in the tree 
You know how I feel 
Its a new dawn 
Its a new day 
Its a new lfe 
For me... 
And I'm feeling good dragonfly out in the sun 
You what I mean 
Don't cha know 
Butterflies are havin' fun 
You know what I mean 
Sleep in peace 
When the day is done 
In this old world 
There's a new word for me 
And a bold world 
For me... 
Yeahhh stars when you shine 
You know how I feel 
Scent of the pine 
You know how I feel 
Freedom is a mine 
You know how I feel 
Its a new dawn 
Its a new day 
Its a new life 
For me.. ohh for me.. for me 
And I'm feeling, I'm feeeling, I'm feeling--- Gooood 
Feeling good
