this rhythm is sick this rhythm's ridiculous well up until now your only concept of rhythm is a four by four loop 
square as a pool table 
with no dynamics implanted but you couldn't understand 
why all of your gigantic rap sounded so bland 
but the answer was right in your hand 
couldn't believe you were so naive to 
arrangements changes different time signatures 
the freedom of your imagination that must have been a fixation with blocks 
like tryin to make a wheel out of rock 
like tryin to make a puppet out of sock

and the electrons to pass on so the world don't seem so wavy

you have no devotion to the social bug spread 
by the words you said to the public 
you have no regard for the masses how you effect them 
and how they view you 
now you know you knew you were open wide for the 
whole wide world to do you 
now i propose those who chose their flows 
irresponsible and irrationally 
be exhausted from the face of the earth and be forced to deal w/me 
me i'd rather be undefined not underestimated or undermined 
i'm underlined as the underdog under the influence of time 
now i know you're sick of that same old same old 
lame old running man dance style 
niggas screamin' and yellin' and tellin' lies about what they do 
brother I say to you but don't you believe or be deceived 
by the hip hop that you breath 
i am multidirectional i move randomly and professional 
intellectual with perpetual 
first in motion bustin' you open 
now you are exposed to the rap and closed in the mind trap i find that 
hilarious and mysterious every area gets a dose 
full of malaria and asbestos from the west coast 
breath in and coat your lungs arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
