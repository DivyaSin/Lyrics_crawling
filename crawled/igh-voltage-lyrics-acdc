Well you ask me 'bout the clothes I wear 
And you ask me why I grow my hair 
And you ask me why I'm in a band 
I dig doin' one night stands 
And you want to see me do my thing 
All you gotta do is plug me into high I said high 
High voltage rock 'n' roll 
High voltage rock 'n' roll 
High voltage, high voltage 
High voltage rock 'n' roll Well you ask me why I like to dance 
And you ask me why I like to sing 
And you ask me why I like to play

And you ask me what I'm all about
