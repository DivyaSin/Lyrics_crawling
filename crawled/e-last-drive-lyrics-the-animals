They came from England 
They came from France 
All the way from the USA 
Just to take a chance 
They came from Holland 
Germany, Scandinavia too 
The rebel citizen driver's, look out 
They come blasting through 
And they would drive all the way 
Through the pouring rain 
All night and all day 
Non-stop all the way Jacking it in for the last drive, jacking it in for the last drive now 
Jacking it in for the last drive, jacking it in for the last drive now Outlaw motorcycle gangs joined forces with the citizen drivers 
And had become the spearhead, 
Finding out the routes that would take them south, 
Away from the cold north to the sun, The rebel riders.... 
Black Chevy's, Rollers and Ford Escorts too 
Tanked up, tuned up, ready to blast, clean on through 
I said, the riders were the spearhead, they got us over the border line 
And we came steaming through Amsterdam, right on time 
I got nothing to declare, there ain't nothing to be checked 
But at the Franco-Russian border ten of us go wrecked Jacking it in for the last drive, jacking it in for the last drive now 
Jacking it in for the last drive, jacking it in for the last drive now A family doctor in Boston, Massachusetts, 
He made it all the way not by chance 
He had a hot shot Chevy panel truck designed as an ambulance 
Be broke through to his final destination 
The desolated beaches of St. Tropez Jacking it in for the last drive, jacking it in for the last drive now 
Jacking it in for the last drive, jacking it in for the last drive now 
Jacking it in for the last drive, jacking it in for the last drive now (Burdon, Carter, Dietz, Gartig, Kravetz, Noya, Passmann)
