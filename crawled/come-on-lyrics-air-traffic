You took the sun from the hole in the sky 
And then you place it in my little hand 
Oh, what a rush just to be in control 
It?s like nothing you could understand This time I'm not gonna let it go 
This time I want everyone to know 
You're a fool, you're wrong, I believe in myself 
I believe in myself this time [Chorus] 
So come on, come on 
Can we break this place apart? 
Come on, come on to me The taste of blood like a spear in my side 
It?s no wonder I'm a driven soul 
Why do you think I just lie here and get fucked 
While you tell me that I'm undersold? You should be scared in amongst desire 
I'm a spark to set the truth from fire 
Yes, I am, I'm here, I'm the Antichrist 
I?ll be leaving alive, I?ll be leaving alive [Chorus] Come on, come on 
Can we break this place apart? 
Come on, come on to me I struggle to my knees 
Struggle to my knees I'm getting to my feet 
I'm getting to my feet You should be calling my name 
You should be calling my name 
You should be calling my name 
You should be calling my [Chorus] Come on, come on 
Can we break this place apart? 
Come on, come on to me
