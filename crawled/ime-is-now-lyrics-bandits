When you're killed by your thoughts like a suicide 
When you're a running for your life like in a marathon ride 
When you're a longing for someone to keep you warm 
When you don't know where's my hatred coming from When it's over what will happen in case I'm dead 
Go to hell - guess it's not to bad, it's not to bad 
Take a shotgun, I will kill you until you die 
Look inside me, try to find me and say good-bye Is there still that need to fill 
Are you there and do you care Time is now - it's time to break the vow 
Time is right - it's time to start the fight 
Time is now - somewhere, someway, somehow 
Break the vow - you tell me how, you tell me how When you love it do you hate it getting into it 
When you like it do you break it getting into it 
When you loose it do you choose it to get used to it 
When you fuck it do you suck it to get all of it When you need it do you feel it getting trough you 
If you don't get it - just hit it, you don't know what to do 
Would you kill it just to chill it, get a new one 
You think you rock it like a rocket and then you're done Is there still that need to fill 
Are you there and do you care Time is now ... When you're burning like a fire in the desert sun 
When explosions hit body while you're on the run 
When you're screaming like a siren deep down in the sea 
When you're asking for the reason why I'm here to be Time is now ...
