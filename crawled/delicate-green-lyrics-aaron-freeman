Do you feel wide open? 
Close your eyes and smile! 
Rest your head now, it's alright! 
You were born before you needed 
Never locked this world away 
Open, child 
Let it know you! Make it warm, make it home! 
Do it fast, do it slow! 
Either way you wanna go, 
Just a dream we are Focus on what's all around you 
Leave your mind alone 
See life working on its own! 
Touch the Balsa that grows above you 
Buried toes in sand 
We are water, delicate green! Make it warm, make it home! 
Do it fast, do it slow! 
Either way you wanna go, 
Just a dream beyond 
Either way you wanna go, 
Just a dream beyond 
Either way you wanna go, 
Just a dream beyond
