you never want to stand 
you never want to free fall 
you never want to rise 
you never want to walk 
you never will fly you never saw the way 
you never ask the giver 
you never took a chance 
you never did ask 
you played your own game i stood quietly 
i believe, i believe 
and it still won't free me 
from his arms you cannot see 
it's too late, it's too late, 
it's too late you never want to run 
you never want to fight back 
you never want to move 
you never want to stick 
you never want to try you never want to climb 
you never want to reach it 
it's just out of sight 
you say you've got rights 
and you think you're the same i stood quietly 
i believe, i believe 
but it still won't free me 
from his arms you cannot see 
it's too late, it's too late, 
it's too late i stood quietly 
i believe, i believe 
it still won't free me 
from his arms i cannot see 
it's too late, it's too late, 
it's too late
