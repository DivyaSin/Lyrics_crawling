Its not about who's right or who's wrong 
Its not about who's weaker or who's strong 
Its not about who's innocent or who's fault 
It ain't really bout that kinda thing at all 
Its not about who does it or done it or did it to who 
Don't matter if the, you lose 
Its really not bout nothing except for me and you girl Its about drama and love and 'lationships 
And when the going gets tough you deal with it 
And you don't ever you never walk away from it 
You hold on you be strong 
Its about drama and drugs and making it 
If your somebody messed up you dig it in 
Don't let nobody come between you you just stay with it 
You hold on and be strong 
And hold on, yes you do Its not about the stupid things that we say 
Were always saying stupid things anyway 
Its not about the secrecy of the lines 
Girl everybody's got a secret to hide 
Its not about who was it who was she who's creeping on who 
Won't matter if the both of us lose 
Its really not bout nothing, 'cept for me and you Its about drama and love and 'lationships 
And when the going gets tough you deal with it 
And you don't ever you never walk away from it 
You hold on you be strong
