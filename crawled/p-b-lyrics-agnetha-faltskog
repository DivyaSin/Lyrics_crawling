Title track for the movie P & B 
(Agnetha Fltskog) Who's there? 
Who's stealing around the place? 
Who's groping about for my wallet? 
Who's tampering with my pocket? 
Who's there? Lock your door, and cock the gun 
Or take your money and run 
I said lock your door, and cock the gun 
Or take your money and run. They're going to coax you and cheat you 
Cajole you and treat you like a fool 
Just for fun 
They're coming and coming, P & B 
They're coming and coming around (twice) 
So lock your door, and cock the gun 
Or take your money and run. Lock your door, and cock the gun 
Or take your money and run 
I said lock your door, and cock the gun 
Or take your money and run. With innocent smiles and oily jokes 
Lots of charm and ratty clothes 
They can fool just anyone 
Oh, they're coming and coming, P & B 
They're coming and coming around (twice) 
So lock your door, and cock the gun or run 
They're coming and coming, P & B....
