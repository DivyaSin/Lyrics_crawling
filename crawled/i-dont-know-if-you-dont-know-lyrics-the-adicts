I don't know 
if you don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know she holds me like no other 
she is the vice of a lover 
she puts me in a squeeze 
don't do that to me 
i just won't hear her pleas 
when she gets down on her knees 
don't ask me how i feel 
don't do that to me I don't know 
if you don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know I don't know 
if you don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know I'm not a passionate guy 
i don't now how to cry 
i'm not in touch with my self 
it's just not my scene I don't know 
if you don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know I don't know 
if you don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know i don't know 
i don't know 
i don't know I don't know 
if you don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know I don't know 
if you don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know Why can't I be in sync 
with what i feel and i think 
you shouldn't ask me to try 
don't do that to me I don't know 
if you don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know i don't know I don't know 
if you don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know 
if you don't know 
then i don't know i don't know I don't know 
if you don't know
