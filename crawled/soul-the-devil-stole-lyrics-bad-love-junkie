"Mine is the soul that the devil stole" Came upon a serpent 
In a midnight dream 
He danced out of the fire 
Drinking gasoline 
He offered me his cup 
While I drank it up 
Ten million voices screamed Mine is the soul that the devil stole 
Mine the soul that the devil stole 
Mine is the soul that the devil stole from me Dancing with the Devil 
The dammed moan and sigh 
The dream goes on forever 
Darkness veils the sky 
Fate or destiny 
Dante's tragedy 
The fire never dies Mine is the soul that the devil stole 
Mine the soul that the devil stole 
Mine is the soul that the devil stole from me Anything you want 
I can give to you 
Anything that you want 
How could I refuse
