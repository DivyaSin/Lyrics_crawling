Don't let them rule your world 
Don't let them rule your life 
Just let your feeling show the way Don't let them rule your world 
Don't let them rule your life 
Just let your feeling show the way, yeah All right 
This one is getting out to another out here 
You gotta find yourself and don't rely to another 
Chose yourself .... in the world 
You gotta trust your instinct 
Everybody ......... floor ......... right You'd better be nice when you're angry 
Just let it all out, 
Just do what you want, 
You'd better be strong when you need it Once again with the rhythm my love 
But do it it right it's what I'm thinking of 
... like a child... tonight 
You confuse me amuse me allright The way to control (is the way you wanna control) 
The way to control 
Is live and learn Ready for cha-cha, when I come, when I come my soul 
All time I'm angry, I will come baby you're my goal 
I want to be ya........................ 
But when I want you.... anger.... human race
