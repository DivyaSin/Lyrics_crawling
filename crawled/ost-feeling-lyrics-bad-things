Like watching the fame 
Just float away 
When they dive 6 feet oh my 
Its like i'm living in vain And the women try your blood out 
I can hear them feed 
Piss drunk head deep to the knees 
Cause its a lost feeling If your to stun dummy 
just believe in nothing 
watch you kill a fella 
fill her up with needles 
And why 
Why taste it 
Just reach out and waste it 
Once your finally conscious bury all the nonsense I'd run to sort stacks 
Scratch to my for my balls 
I'm diabetic I have scaves 
Can I afford to cure 
Cause its a lost feeling If your to stun dummy 
Just believe in nothing 
Watch you kill a fella 
Fill her up with needles 
And why 
Why taste it 
Just reach out and waste it 
Once your finally conscious bury all the nonsense Sire 
To sin 
Sore 
Tower is sweet 
I get by 
Around round round 
Catch up you'll see you'll see 
See me see me 
I am defeat 
From lonely kill 
Its a wrong web
