The blind man said hey I don't care 
I can smell it taste it on the air 
Let all the good folks stop and stare at me 
And we laced out veins with the poisons there and we 
Laid down in the poison air 
And everyone was a stepping stone 
Except one girl and she said Did you know? 
There's a garden in your eyes 
And in it grows the only thing I need 
And all I want is paradise 
So come and make me weak 
And I won't bleed for free no more Stop here comes big karma now 
And what goes around still comes around 
I got mine as she laid me in the weeds 
Her nails dug in and made me howl she said 
I need a savior now oh so come and rescue me Did you know? 
There's a garden in your eyes 
And in it grows the only thing I need 
And all I want is paradise 
So come and make me weak 
And I won't bleed for free no more Well you know you know know 
When you're home there's no place like home 
When you're home you make it go away 
When you're home I never feel alone 
When you're home you make it go away Did you know? 
There's a garden in your eyes 
And in it grows the only thing I need 
And all I want is paradise 
So come and make me weak 
And I won't bleed for free no more
