Time wasted, wasted worrying 
Hurrying down the same street 
Time beats with every moment 
Eroding from under my feet Time waits, it waits for no one 
And here I sit, I'm standing still 
Time waits 
I'd like to go on but I'm out of time My own doubt eats a hole 
From the inside out through my plans 
Work it out, I need to now 
But I don't know how to begin Time waits, it waits for no one 
And here I sit, I'm standing still 
Time waits 
I'd like to go on but I'm out of time
