I can tell, she found a man 
Cause I saw the roses in her hand 
She may have been so lost 
And all the happiness he has cost Always brokenhearted in the past 
She makes this life seem so fast 
Girl you don't deserve this it always seems on purpose 
That you would miss the chance of a nice romance 
And you're such a beautiful sight and I'd hate to see you cry So it seems you feel the same, 
Cause you put your love to shame 
You felt so happy when I came 
Maybe it's because he's the one to blame Always brokenhearted in the past 
She makes this life seem so fast 
Girl you don't deserve this it always seems on purpose 
That you would miss the chance of a nice romance 
And you're such a beautiful sight and I'd hate to see you cry 
And now I'm wondering why And I can't even understand how 
you'd pass all the gentleman by 
Hey, just take a moment and you'll realize 
He's nothing but a liar in disguise Cause girl you don't deserve this it always seems on purpose 
That you would miss the chance of a nice romance 
And you're such a beautiful sight and I'd hate to see you cry Girl you don't deserve this, it always seems on purpose 
That you would miss the chance, of a nice romance And you're such a beautiful sight and I'd hate to see you cry and I'd hate to see you cry
