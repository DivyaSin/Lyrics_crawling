Wise men say, only fools rush in, 
But I can't help falling in love 
With you. 
I can't help falling in love with you 
Shall I stay, would it be a sin, 
If I can't help falling in love 
With you. Like a river flows, 
Surely to the sea. 
Darling, so it goes. 
Some things are mean't to be. 
Take my hand, 
Take my whole life too, 
For I can't help falling in love 
With you. Like a river flows, 
Surely to the sea. 
Darling, so we go 
Some things are mean't to be. 
Take my hand, 
Take my whole life too, 
I can't help falling in love 
With you. For I can't help falling in love 
With you. 
Yes I can't help falling in love with you 
No I can't help falling in love with you
