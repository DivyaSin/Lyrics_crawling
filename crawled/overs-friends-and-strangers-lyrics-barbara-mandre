Looking back into the world we knew 
When love was such a sweet surprise 
Wasn't it beautiful how strangers came to love 
Like magic right before our eyes 
Strangers become friends and friends become lovers 
But the same fire that warms the heart can burn 
Then it's lovers, friends, strangers again 
Ain't it funny how the circle turns Looking back I'd do it all again 
Although the story's sad but true 
Even lovers can be strangers again 
Stranger still I keep on loving you 
Strangers become friends... 
Ain't it funny how the circle turns
