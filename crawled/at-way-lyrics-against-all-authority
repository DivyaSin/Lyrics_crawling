Here we go again good citizens 
Avert your eyes 
As the innocent collide 
Run and hide as the world sits and watches, hypnotized 
Another Belgrade sunset leaving town 
Another refugee Macedonia bound 
And the bombs still fall tearing the city down 
And I want to beat you all black and blue 
Cause your not like me 
And I ain't nothing like you 
And I wanna keep it that way 
Facism gaining ground 
An effective cleansing 
The borders are closing down 
The unwanted masses litter the bloodstained ground 
And I don't really want to know and I don't care 
I've got my own problems and they're over here not there 
A good american remains totally unaware 
And I want to beat you all black and blue 
Cause your not like me 
And I ain't nothing like you 
And I wanna keep it that way 
So give us your tired your poor and your weak 
Cause we break ground for a Wal-mart there next week 
And I wanna keep it that way
