She looks out of her window at the people passing by they look so happy make's her cry 
She watches them laughing sees the lovers holding hands and everyone each others friends Beautiful and blue they're not as good as you 
Beautiful and blue they're lonely too She feels so unhappy she no longer cares for life and is close to ending all her strives 
The world doesn't know her it's so hard and cold and cruel she wonders why she's such a fool Beautiful and blue 
Beautiful and blue
