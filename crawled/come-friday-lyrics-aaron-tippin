My friends and me work overtime 
All try to walk the bottom line 
You've been breathin' down our necks 
But soon as we cash our paychecks 
We'll be chillin' on my deck, Boss Man Chorus: 
There's nothin' you can do, nothin' you can say 
Nothin' you can throw our way come Friday 
We've been rubber stampin' paper clippin' 
Sortin' fillin' faxin' 
It's time to let the good times roll 
Nothin' you can say, nothin' you can do 
Nothin' that can wreck our mood come Friday 
We've been roofin' rakin' truckin' pavin Packin' stackin' layin' block 
Farmin' fencin' monkey wrenchin' pickin' up and droppin' off 
We can't wait to punch the clock 
Come Friday - yeah! Gonna fill my igloo full of ice 
Stock up on my way home tonight 
Light tiki torches and the grill 
Put speakers on the windowsill 
Play our music loud and dance all night Repeat Chorus We'll be horseshoein' barbecuin' flippin' 
Sippin' kickin' back 
Lawn chairin' music blarin' laughin' havin' us a blast 
Work all week until at last- It's Friday 
It's Friday - yeah! 
Whoa!
