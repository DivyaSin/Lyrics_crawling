A seismic sound fell down from the sky 
through the star-knit night 
to land in my mind 
settled deep inside 
the truth came to light How sweet the taste of it upon my lips 
Though I struggled first and fought with it 
It was a deafening sound 
A seismic sound A seismic sound tore through my ribs 
And from my chest 
I blew it's raging hiss 
Though the words were free 
I still longed for it The large release of courage from my lips 
Though I struggled first and fought with it 
It was a deafening sound 
A seismic sound No more dreaming of the day 
When I and strength itself would be one 
No more fighting for that drop of hope 
and bravery in my sternum No more dreaming of the day 
When I and strength itself would be one 
No more fighting for that drop of hope 
and bravery in my sternum 
I could feel it on my fingertips 
and in my bones that we've won We've won.
