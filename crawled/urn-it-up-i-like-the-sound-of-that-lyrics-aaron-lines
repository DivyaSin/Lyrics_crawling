I like the sound of 
The ocean crashing 
Waves making their way 
To the beach 
I like the sound of 
The Gulf breeze blowing 
Holding your hand, 
The sand on our feet I like the sound of 
Raindrops dancing 
As we sleep away 
A Sunday afternoon 
And I like the sound of 
The alarm clock ringing 
Means I'll spend 
Another day with you So turn it up, turn it up 
Turn it up a little louder 
I can never ever get enough 
Turn it up, turn it up 
Cause whenever I'm around you 
You've got me thinking that 
I like the sound of that I like the sound of 
A fireplace crackling 
Watching a movie, 
Holding you tight 
Yeah, I love it when 
I hear you laughing 
At that joke I've told 
A thousand times 
And I like the sound of 
Guitars screaming 
Music so loud 
We talk with our eyes Turn it up, turn it up 
Turn it up a little louder 
I can never ever get enough 
Turn it up, turn it up 
Cause whenever I'm around you 
You've got me thinking that 
I like the sound of that I like the sound 
Of your heart beating 
In my arms, right here, right now 
When it's so quiet 
I can hear you breathing 
That may be my favorite sound Turn it up, turn it up 
Turn it up a little louder 
I can never ever get enough 
Turn it up, turn it up 
Cause whenever I'm around you 
You've got me thinking that 
I like the sound of that 
Turn it up, turn it up 
Turn it up a little louder 
I can never ever get enough 
Turn it up, turn it up 
Cause whenever I'm around you 
You've got me thinking that 
I like the sound of that
