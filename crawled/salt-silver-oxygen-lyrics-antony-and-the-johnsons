The flying horse carries me across the sky 
Triumvirate swallows make our breath 
Can we grow a sun 
A water run 
The Great White Water? 
Every slum an ox inside it 
Sweet crevice for miniature flies? Dancing with his casket 
Christ becomes wife 
The easy dust is dancing, too 
It splits the waterside in two Elect the Salt Mother 
For She's a Selective Christ Punch her ghost! 
For sure she'll sigh 
And watch the window gives rise
