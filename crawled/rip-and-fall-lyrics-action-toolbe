Wake up early, no time to waste Grab some food along the way to see me thru 
Brush your hair back, from your face 
I promise to come home again from work to you Can't help wondering if it's my time 
Always something calm I see in you 
Constant dangers always on your mind But I'll stand...so tall...for you Alarm rings loudly turns my stomach sick 
Never know exactly what it's all about 
Fire's building, make it double quick 
Running in as everyone's running out 
Mass confusion all around, everything fades black to blue 
Shout I love you as it crashes down But I'll stand... so tall... for you 
It's what I do My broken heart will never stop beating for you 
I hope the pride you feel tonight will see you thru to the end 
Where we can meet again and start brand new And I'll stand so tall for you 
And I'll trip and fall for you 
It's what I do My broken heart will never stop beating for you 
I hope the pride you feel tonight will see you thru to the end 
Where we can meet again and start brand new
