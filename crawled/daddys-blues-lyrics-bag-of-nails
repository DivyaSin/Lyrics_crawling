You know I work so hard babe 
since I was a little boy 
my father used to tell me 
I'm his pride 'n' joy I was almost ten when my 
father he came in 
he told me son you should know 
the shape I'm in 
I was almost ten when my 
father he came in 
I work so hard son to earn for livin' Then he took me out with him 
out in the cotton fields 
to show me how babe 
to plant the seeds 
Then he took me out with him 
out in the cotton fields 
that's the way my father 
he taught me the blues Well he taught me the 
the hard workin' way 
how to work with naked hands 
both night and day 
You know he taught me 
the hard workin' way 
that's the way my father 
he taught me the blues
