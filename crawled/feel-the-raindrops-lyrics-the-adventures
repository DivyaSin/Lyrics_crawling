I am injured and confused 
feel the pressures of my youth. 
In my innocence they drag me down there is nothing left to lose. I feel the raindrops on my head Watch the sun 'til my eyes turn red Still I can hear those things you said 
you said. Through the rain I feel your tears Helps me beat these endless years. 
Just one feeling lingers that of sorrow Now I'm screaming 
no one hears. 
I feel the raindrops on my head 
. . . I feel the raindrops on my head 
. . . 
I feel the raindrops on my head 
. . . 
You said 
you said 
you said 
you said.
