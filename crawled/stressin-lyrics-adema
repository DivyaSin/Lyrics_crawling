The weight of the world has been put on my shoulders 
I looked in the mirror and know that I'm older 
I try to escape but the rain makes it colder 
Why do I let all our problems take over? There's nothing I can do 
There's nothing I can say 
We need to try to find the right way Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back on me 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
There's nothing left for us to say 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
There's nothing left to blame 
To blame I've tried to explain what it's doing to me 
Arguing over the simplest things 
You tried to make life like you want it to be 
Upset everyday isn't something we need There's nothing I can do 
There's nothing I can say 
We need to try to find the right way Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back on me 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
There's nothing left for us to say 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
There's nothing left to blame You're letting me down again.You're letting me down again 
You're letting me down again, letting me down again There's nothing I can do 
There's nothing I can say 
We need to try to find the right way Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back on me 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
There's nothing left for us to say 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
I cannot change the fact Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
I cannot change the fact 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
I cannot change the fact Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back 
Stressin'out. Stressin'out 
God has turned his back
