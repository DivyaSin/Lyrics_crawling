They raise their fists into the sky 
Many didn't suffice to bring the death to some of them 
They prayed to Gods they died with pride 
Some of them sufficed to bring the death to all Their swords drilled into their skull 
The blades were hungry and now have to be sharpened 
And freed from strange blood 
Which is precious for the clairvoyance The barbarians prepare to leave now 
To get closer, to their aim
