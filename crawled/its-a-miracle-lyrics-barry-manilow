You wouldn't believe where I've been 
The cities and towns I've been in 
From Boston to Denver and every town in between (Everyone looks the same) 
The people, they all look the same (yes, the same) 
Oh, only the names have been changed (just the names) 
But now that I'm home again 
I'm tellin' you what I believe It's a miracle (miracle) 
A true, blue spectacle, a miracle come true (whoa oh-oh-oh-oh) 
We're together, baby, I was goin' crazy 'till a miracle came through 
(Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh) 
Now you're here and my arms are around you 
And, baby, there'll be dancin' in the street For the miracle (miracle) 
A true, blue spectacle, miracle is you (who) 
(Oh oh oh, whoo) I never knew you looked so good 
Oh, I never knew anyone could 
I must have been crazy to ever have gone away (almost forgot ya, babe) 
I almost forgot what it's like (every night) 
Oh, holdin' you near me at night (every night) 
But now that I'm home again, you know that I'm home to stay 'Cause it's a miracle (miracle) 
A true, blue spectacle, a miracle come true (whoa oh-oh-oh-oh) 
We're together, baby, I was goin' crazy 'till a miracle came through 
Now you're here and I'm feelin' so good 
And, baby, there'll be dancin' in the streets For the miracle (miracle) 
A true, blue spectacle, a miracle is you (who) 
(Oh oh oh, whoo) Now you're here and my arms are around you 
And, baby, there'll be dancin' in the streets Ha, there's gonna be dancin' in the streets 
Gonna be dancin' in the streets (Dancin' in the streets)
