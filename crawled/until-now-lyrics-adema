I knew you all my life 
Though only through my dreams 
Look inside your mind 
And see what's on mine Calling out my name, I see you there 
This frozen cold, it isn't fair 
How much of this pride will I spare 
We both are seething All I know is to act now 
(All I know) 
And hold on, this one's the real one 
Just calm down, don't look back This is what we never had 
I never felt so alive til I saw blue eyes 
Until now it wasn't hard to leave, I'm wanting more Everyone around but still alone 
Try to grasp losing the flow 
Use a single emotion 
You left me totally motionless So quick so soft like a thief in the night 
Came here and changed my life 
Everyday the same, just sit and stare Will I see you up in the air? 
These separate lives we don't share 
Again I'm leaving All I know is to act now 
(All I know) 
And hold on, this one's the real one 
Just calm down, don't look back This is what we never had 
I never felt so alive til I saw blue eyes 
Until now it wasn't hard to leave, I'm wanting more I thought all this time 
I would end up alone 
Beside you I lay 
And watch you breathing All I know is to act now 
(All I know) 
And hold on, this one's the real one 
Just calm down, don't look back 
This is what we never had 
I never felt so alive til I saw blue eyes (Until now) 
I never felt so alive 
(Until now) 
I never felt so alive 
Until now it wasn't hard to leave 
I'm wanting more
