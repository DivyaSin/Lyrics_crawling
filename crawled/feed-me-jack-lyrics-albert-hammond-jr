Won't you feed me Jack 
Won't you feed me Jack It's not too late 
To see you smile 
It's not too late 
To stay for awhile 
Watch all the trees 
And what they do 
And all those leaves 
The fall onto you Won't you feed me Jack 
Won't you feed me Jack In my mind 
That's what we do 
Fall asleep 
I lay on you 
Look at all the change we've made 
All the places 
We once played Won't you feed me Jack 
Won't you feed me Jack It's not too late 
To see your smile 
It's not too late 
To stay for awhile 
Watch all the trees 
And what they do 
And all those leaves 
The fall onto you Won't you feed me Jack 
Won't you feed me Jack 
Won't you feed me Jack 
Won't you feed me Jack 
You always feed me Jack
