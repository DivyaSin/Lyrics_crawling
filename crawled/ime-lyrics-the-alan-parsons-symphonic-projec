Time, flowing like a river 
Time, beckoning me 
Who knows when we shall meet again if ever 
But time, keeps flowing like a river to the sea Goodbye my love, Maybe for forever 
Goodbye my love, The tide waits for me 
Who knows when we shall meet again If ever 
But time, keeps flowing like a river (on and on) 
To the sea, to the sea Till it's gone forever 
Gone forever 
Gone forevermore Goodbye my friends, Maybe for forever 
Goodbye my friends, The stars wait for me 
Who knows where we shall meet again if ever 
But time, keeps flowing like a river (on and on) 
To the sea, to the sea
