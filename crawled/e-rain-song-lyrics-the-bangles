I don't think about us much anymore 
Frankly, the topic has become a bore 
And you don't come up much in my conversation 
I don't think about you on vacation But when it rains 
When it rains 
When it rains 
That's when I remember 
That's when I remember 
I remember you 
I remember you I don't think about you when I'm sleeping 
It doesn't even cross my dreamlike mind 
I don't think I see your face through the curtains 
Hell, I don't even miss you half the time But when it rains 
When it rains 
When it rains 
That's when I remember 
That's when I remember 
I remember you 
I remember you I'm doing fine as long as you stay locked up 
Inside a cloud of gray 
Rain, rain 
Rain, rain, rain 
Rain, rain, rain 
But when it rains 
When it rains 
When it rains But when it rains 
When it rains 
When it rains 
That's when I remember 
That's when I remember 
I remember you 
I remember you Well that's when I remember 
The only time I remember 
When I remember you
