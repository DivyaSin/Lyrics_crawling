Gonna keep on dancin' to rock and roll 
Saturday night Saturday night 
Dancin' to the rythm of the heart and soul 
On Saturday night Saturday night

At the good ol' rock and roll road show 
I gotta go Saturday night Saturday night 
Gonna rock it up roll it up do it all have a ball.

Gonna dance with my baby till the night is trough 
On Saturday night

On Saturday night Saturday night

I-I-I-I'm gonna let her know. 
At the good ol' rock and roll road show 
I gotta go Saturday night Saturday night
