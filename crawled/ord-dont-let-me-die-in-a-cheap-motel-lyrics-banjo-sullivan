Picking for the wait staff again, baring my soul up on stage 
Where my guitar's my only friend 
Slurring the words to a hit song from a bottle that never ends 
Mama says, Roy, get home, boy, before the devil does ya in Lord, don't let me die in a cheap motel 
Gideon's Bible on the nightstand 
Can't save me from the gates of hell 
Nothing more to offer, no more soul to sell 
Lord, don't let me die in a cheap motel Took 'em from their homes when they were young 
Five times I married, had kids with every one 
Never raised a hand in anger, scarred 'em, just the same 
Mama said, Roy, get home, boy, you're playing the devils game Lord, don't let me die in a cheap motel 
Gideon's Bible on the nightstand 
Can't save me from the gates of hell 
Nothing more to offer, no more soul to sell 
Lord, don't let me die in a cheap motel Washed in the blood of the lamb 
Laying in the bathtub, with a pistol in my hand 
Waiting on the reaper, to make my final stand 
Mama said, Roy, get after, boy, you're playing in the devil's band Lord, don't let me die in a cheap motel 
Gideon's Bible on the nightstand 
Can't save me from the gates of hell 
Nothing more to offer, no more soul to sell 
Lord, don't let me die in a cheap motel Lord, don't let me die in a cheap motel
