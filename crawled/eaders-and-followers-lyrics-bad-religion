There's the image of a man 
Who commands a high opinion 
But he hides his hatred with a sheepish grin And beside him flanking closely 
Are the boisterous hollow masses 
Who lap up whatever trickles in This intercourse of nature, 
This vulgar social pastime 
Reflects the lowest mark of our progress And the few who ride peripheral 
Maintain subtle advantage 
Fighting hard to abstain and redress Do you know your place 
In the big charade? 
Are you more than they? Leaders and followers 
Leaders and followers Recognition by proximity 
And a brand new face 
Just a smidgen of success pie 
And a pinch of social grace 
You can play with the big boys 
Or you can tell them what to do 
But sooner or later there's another one like you The voyeuristic public 
Of which we're all a part 
Maintains perspective on the human play And while many have desires 
Of joining in the show 
Many turn and go the other way Tell me do you know your place 
In the big parade? 
Are you fear and shame?
