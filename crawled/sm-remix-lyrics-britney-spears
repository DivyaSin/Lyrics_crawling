Na na na na [Rihanna] 
Feels so good being bad (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
Now the pain is my pleasure cause nothing could measure (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
Love is great, love is fine (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
Out the box, outta line (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
The affliction of the feeling leave me wanting more (Oh oh oh oh oh) Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it 
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it 
Sticks and stones may break my bones 
But chains and whips excite me Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it 
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it 
Sticks and stones may break my bones 
But chains and whips excite me

Just one night full of sin (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
Feel the pain on your skin (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
Tough, I don't scream mercy 
It's your time to hurt me 
Yeah (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
If I'm bad tie me down (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
Shut me up, gag and bound (Oh oh oh oh oh) Me 
Cause the pain is my pleasure 
Nothing comes better 
Yeah 
Oh oh oh Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it 
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it 
Sticks and stones may break my bones 
But chains and whips excite me Na na na na
