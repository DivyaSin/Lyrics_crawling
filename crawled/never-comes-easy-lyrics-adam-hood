My first show was at a dead end bar down on College Street 
I was proud to play for nothing back when I was seventeen 
I swore my dreams were over when I never played a second gig 
Till I found out that the bar shut down for getting rich off of high school kids A change never comes easy 
A change never comes easy Ten years have come and gone. Slipped out form under me 
And now days I play my songs a long way from College Street 
Everyday is a brand new place and sometimes I still play for free 
It goes to show the good old days ain't as bad as they used to be A change never comes easy 
A change never comes easy I guess I took it hard as anybody in my shoes 
Live and learn hide the scars but don't let it get to you A change never comes easy 
A change never comes easy 
A change never comes easy 
A change never comes easy
