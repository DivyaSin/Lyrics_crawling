Overrated, overrated 
Love is overrated is what I say 
But as overrated as love can be today 
I love you baby anyway Complicated, complicated 
Love's a complicated game to play 
But as complicated as love can be today 
I love you baby anyway I always thought that love was a ladder 
You trip at the top and then you're shattered, 
But I heard you call and now the risk of falling 
Hardly seems to matter. Devastated, devastated 
Overtaken by your love and swept away 
So as complicated and overrated as love can be today 
I love you baby anyway 
Trust you baby anyway 
I love you baby anyway
