Blinded behind walls of 
Self built stained glass 
Focus enters eyes well watered 
At last, the eyes with vision split Hewn end to end, life force leaked 
From sun-cracked skin 
In the blink of an eye, dying too is the quick 
This life story to tell with one second to live The hammer comes down and thunder strikes 
Where we burn fast in the build of our lives Slowing down to see the mountains you built 
This life story to tell with one second to live 
Slowing down to see the time that passed you by 
Your life story to tell with only one second to live Time takes throne to purge the fill of our flight 
When days turn into years and a loss of life 
Death rattles a mile away from your restless symphony 
The ridden thought unsound 
The shadows that crept lonely all around The hammer comes down and thunder strikes 
Where we burn fast in the build of our lives Now waiting will just not work 
When tales must be told, changed and retold Slowing down to see the mountains you built 
This life story to tell with one second to live 
Slowing down to see the time that passed you by 
Your life story to tell with only one second to live Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey Slowing down to see the mountains you built 
This life story to tell with one second to live 
Slowing down to see the time that passed you by 
Your life story to tell with only one second to live Slowing down to see the mountains you built 
Slowing down, your life story to tell 
Slowing down with one second to live
