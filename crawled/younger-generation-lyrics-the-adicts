Start to moan when there's nothing to do 
Scream and bawl when there's nothing to do at all 
Wanna go out but there's nowhere to go 
Live our lives before we get too old, you know We're just the younger generation 
We want to have a good time 
We're just the younger generation 
And it's on our mind Think they're pretty think they're nice 
Think they're living in Paradise, it's not true-
