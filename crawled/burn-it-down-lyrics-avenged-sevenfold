Jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care 
Converse behind my back, but now I'm here 
Need no one to comply with me though everyone that I defeat 
Don"t need you, fuck camaraderie, this rage will never go away Hatred fuels my blood 
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me) 
One king to watch the horsemen fall 
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you) 
I can't trust anyone (See it in my eyes) 
Now I can understand 
It's sorrow that feeds your lies 
Whoa, yeah! You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe 
A crutch for you that won't always be there 
Hide in the dark another day 
The fear in you is here to stay 
So keep the fuck away from me and learn to trust the words I say Hatred fuels my blood 
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me) 
One king to watch the horsemen fall 
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you) 
I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes) Now I can understand 
Put faith in you for the last time 
It's sorrow that feeds your lies 
Huh! Yeah, yeah! Running from me before I tear you down (Be afraid) 
You chose the wrong side (It feels so right) 
I won't help you, let you run away (Despise what you say) 
Run towards the light exposing your soul (We won't be there by your side) 
Salvation's dying (Somebody's crying) 
We're all gone in the end 
Sweet child we'll miss you 
Whoa, so far away, far away I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes) 
Now I can understand (Put faith in you for the last time) 
It's sorrow that feeds your lies Falling away 
Can't buy back time 
Burn it down anyways
