Our conversations are flying home tonight 
Honeymooners, returning on a midnight flight 
They are coming back to normal lives 
Vacations morph into nine-to-fives 
And I slip off this rosy pair 
Of lenses and you're still beautiful 
Smoke has cleared, the wrapping tears 
Bright lights fade, and you're still beautiful 
I sense you shaving off my mysteries 
And knowing my trophies have realistic histories 
The fish have gone aback to normal size 
A man of limits stands before your gentle eyes 
And I slip off this rosy pair 
Of lenses and you're still beautiful 
Smoke has cleared, the wrapping tears 
Bright lights fade, and you're still beautiful 
I start with my nose at the painting 
Slowly step back and this is amazing 
Dr. Cal has a patient-ly waiting for me to earn them 
"Real" is harder to see in a smile 
Tears break the seal of denial 
Rosy colors are nice for a while but now I'm learning 
And I slip off this rosy pair 
Of lenses and you're still beautiful
