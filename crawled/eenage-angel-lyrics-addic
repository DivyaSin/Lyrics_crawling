She's in love but she doesn't know 
What she needs or how to let go 
I feels like being married 
She was too young to miscarry 
She says 
"Bye bye my childhood dream man 
I will keep in touch if I can 
Spent the best years of my life with you" 
Happens every time 
You start to lose yourself 
You turn to blame the one 
That loves you the most 
To stay and work it out is harder 
Than to run away 
So she leaves a note 
Because to his face she couldn't say 
"Bye bye my childhood dream man 
I will keep in touch if I can 
Spent the best years of my life with you" 
Hold on if you can 
Hold on 
So all things fade in time 
But what was once so bright 
Somehow no longer shines 
Caught the pain at last 
Thought he was the one 
Thought she had the strength to hold 
"Bye bye my child hood dream man 
I will keep in touch if I can 
Spent the best years of my life with you" 
"Bye bye my teenage angel 
I don't know how the spell was broken 
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'll miss you 
I don't know what I'm doing but I'll miss you 
I don't know what I'm doing but I'll miss you"
