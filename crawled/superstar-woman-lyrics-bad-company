Well my baby, she's a superstar 
She's got diamond fingers, 
Drives a super car 
When I see you burnin' down the highway 
Driving everybody insane 
And I ask you, are you going my way 
Don't you want to know my name 
I say, baby give me one little chance 
To show you that I can romance 
Baby give me one little chance 
To dance with you Well my baby, baby 
She's a man-eater 
And she's mine, all mine 
Life couldn't be sweeter, 
When I see you on a TV programme 
You're driving me insane Then I hear you on a radio 
I'm going to get you some day 
Baby give me one little chance 
To show you that I can romance 
Baby give me one little chance 
To dance with you Now when I'm lonely, she comes to me 
And when I'm tied down, 
She set me free, she set me free 
Baby give me one little chance
