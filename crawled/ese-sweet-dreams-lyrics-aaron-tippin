You reach out and touch me and tell me you love me 
And promise that you always will 
But as i start to kiss your tender lips 
I wake up to my living hell 
These sweet dreams are killin' me 
Your heavenly memory is pure misery 
I'm losing my mind one night as a time 
These sweet dreams are killin' me When sleep comes i hold you just like i used to 
In a world where our love still lives 
But each mornin' i wake as i feel my heart break 
When i lose you all over again These sweet dreams are killin' me 
Your heavenly memory is pure misery 
I'm losing my mind one night as a time 
These sweet dreams are killin' me These sweet dreams are killin' me 
These sweet dreams are killin' me
