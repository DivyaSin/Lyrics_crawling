This is history ahead of time 
Set it off like a fucking bomb up in Lebanon 
You can bet I move whatever I set'em on 
Not afraid to dive in the water 
You'll be treading on Infidels get the (?) 
Stash O and I rap till the cash flows 
She say I'm a motherfucking asshole 
Now she telling me to go deeper than a Sylvia Plath poem 
Presidents, success measurements, 
Invest anything to get everything 
You wanna quit now? 
Don't sweat it kid 
You were never up for the job, Pope Benedict 
I'm way fucked up when they hate I hear nothing 
If you don't care then why you so aware of it? 
Run the city and I ain't even the mayor of it 
You could trust me I swear Welcome to X generation 
Here to corrupt the next generation 
Be the cause one nation 
We the bomb, detonation 
Welcome to X generation 
Here to corrupt the next generation 
Be the cause one nation 
We the bomb, detonation Pardon me, Imma go harder than an armory double O seven 
Sean Connery bigger than my arteries 
And I'm so like...so I'm in my zone don't bother me 
Pardon me I'm never subtle with the fuckery 
The ash dreams...like a summary 
Rhyme to the hate like the ray bans cover me 
Fuck what they worse I'm about what it's gonna be 
Imma be running till the sneakers are 3 stop 
Police to the east smoke till my yeast stop 
Young Caesar brush you like a season 
Cops ain't a preacher but maybe I can teach ya 
Meet the demand if the cash is right 
You get one chance in life 
And me I'm going way over your head boy 
Try not to get damned on twice 
Bitch
