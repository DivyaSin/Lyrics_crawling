Would you tell me, if I caused you pain? 
Would it shock you baby if I said I felt the same? 
Would you share with me, some of your doubt? 
Would you let me help you, if I could help you out? I couldn't give you, all that you wanted. 
I couldn't even give you half of what you wanted if I wanted to. Be my witness. 
Be my bride. 
I'm on the edge of something, 
That I can't hide. Would you go there, if I go there too? 
Would you give me all your love if I gave all mine to you? 
Would you come back if I called your name? 
But it won't shock me baby if you say you feel the same. I couldn't give you, all that you wanted. 
I couldn't even give you half of what you wanted if I wanted to. Be my witness. 
Be my bride. 
I'm on the edge of something, 
That I can't hide. Be my witness. 
Be my bride. 
I'm on the edge of something, 
I'm on your side.
