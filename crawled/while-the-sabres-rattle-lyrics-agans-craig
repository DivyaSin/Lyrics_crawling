While the sabres rattle, and the forces start to move 
Threats and reputations force the warlords all to prove 
The power in their hands, that they have got to send 
Thousands for to die, to achieve their ends 
As petty as the conflict, may have beginned 
As bloody as a war has got to end.. 
While the sabres rattle, and history's cards are dealt 
Battle plans are drawn up as tradition starts to melt 
Burned by a fury, as blind as a flag 
After hopes for peace have started to sag 
Of a mighty power, most are proud to brag 
And your neighbor, to his possible death they are going to drag.. 
While the sabres rattle, it has always been the same 
Bracing for the storm to come, studying those that came 
But that lesson, has yet to be learned 
Even a good man, will kill if his home is burned 
While the sabres rattle, to sirens near and far 
Wailing forth their warnings, and their call to arms 
These pictures I now see, as we begin to fight 
They are pictures I have seen before, but they were in black and white.
