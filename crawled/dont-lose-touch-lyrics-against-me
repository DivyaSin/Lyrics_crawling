You're coming off, kinda contrived and pretentious 
You're not sayin' anything we haven't heard before 
You're caught up in an argument, oh you're so lost in modern art 
You will lose it all and you will find again Don't lose touch, don't lose touch SOS texted from a cell phone, please tell me I'm not the only one 
That thinks we're taking ourselves too seriously 
Just a little too enamored with inflated self purpose 
Talk is cheap and it doesn't mean much Don't lose touch, don't lose touch I'm losing touch, I'm losing touch 
(I'm losing touch) 
I'm losing touch, I'm losing touch 
(I'm losing touch) Constant entertainment for a restless mind 
Constant stimulation for epic appetites 
Is there something wrong with these songs? 
Maybe there's something wrong with the audience 
Manipulation in rock music, fucking nausea I'm losing touch, I'm losing touch 
(I'm losing touch) 
I'm losing touch, well and it's obvious
