Walking in my sleep at night 
And you can't have me 
Can't have me 
Ever Walking in my sleep 
So you can't have me 
Disappeared, gone 
You have gone out of my dreams Walking in my sleep 
With my flesh in bed 
Still you are there 
Think you'll never let me be Walking in my sleep 
So you can't have me 
Disappeared, gone 
You have gone out of my dreams Walking in my sleep 
With my flesh in bed 
Still you are there 
Just get the fuck out of my dreams Walking in my sleep at night 
And you can't have me 
Can't have me 
Ever
