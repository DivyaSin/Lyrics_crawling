I know I talk too much 
Baby, won't you give it a try 
You said to me what good will it be 
'Cause I don't really care And please, baby, don't you see 
All the time in the world is for me 
If I pack my bags, if I walk out that door 
Would you still try to hold on I know you'll find a better place 
I know you'll find another home 
I know you'll find some heaven in hell You made me feel so good 
One in a million, baby, tell me it's true 
Give me some time, won't you give me a chance 
'Cause I can show you what I believe And nobody will ever know 
Sometimes I feel that I'm getting old 
You see, money don't mean so much to you 
But it sure means something to me I know you'll find a better place 
I know you'll find another home 
I know you'll find some heaven in hell We could be angels 
We could just fly away 
Baby, just hold me tight 
I will make it through the end of the night Baby, I would make it 
Baby, I would make it 
We could just fly away 
We'll fly away 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I know you'll find a better place 
I know you'll find another home 
I know you'll find some heaven in hell
