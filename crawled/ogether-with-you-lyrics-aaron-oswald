Verse 1: 
I don't know why I try to be so different around you. 
I sometimes hope it'll just come so soon. 
But I know I've said way too much before, making you walk right 
Through the door. Chorus: 
I've been waiting here to see if I could, show you the real me. 
Even though I know it may never show, 
Everything I do to be, 
Together With You. Verse 2: 
My friends keep telling me I should just, 
Forget about you. But that's not what I wanna do. 
I just stop and think what else can I do, 
To get through to you? Chorus: 
I've been waiting here to see if I could, show you the real me. 
Even though I know it may never show, 
Everything I do to be, 
Together With You. Bridge: 
I don't know why I just don't cry maybe 'cause 
I'm ashamed of the feelings I hide. 
All I could do is tell you, 
I Care For You. Chorus: 
I've been waiting here to see if I could, show you the real me. 
Even though I know it may never show, 
Everything I do to be, 
Together With You.
