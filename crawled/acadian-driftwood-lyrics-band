The war was over 
And the spirit was broken 
The hills were smokin' 
As the men withdrew 
We stood on the cliffs, 
Oh and watched the ships, 
Slowly sinking to their rendezvous They signed a treaty 
And our homes were taken 
Loved-ones forsaken, 
They didn't give a damn. 
Try to raise a family 
End up an enemy 
Over what went down on the Plains of Abraham. [Chorus] 
Acadian driftwood, 
Gypsy tailwind 
They call my home, 
The land of snow 
Canadian cold front, 
Movin' in 
What a way to ride, 
Oh what a way to go Then some returned, 
To the motherland 
The high command, 
Had them cast away 
Some stayed on, 
To finish what they started 
They never parted, 
They're just built that way We had kin livin', 
South of the border 
They're a little older, 
And they been around 
They wrote in a letter 
Life is a whole lot better 
So pull up your stakes, children, 
And come on down Acadian driftwood, 
Gypsy tailwind 
They call my home, 
The land of snow 
Canadian cold front, 
Movin' in 
What a way to ride, 
Oh what a way to go Fifty under zero when the day became a threat 
My clothes were wet 
And I was drenched to the bone 
Then out ice fishin', mmm, 
Too much repetition 
Make a man want to leave 
The only home he's known Sailed out of the Gulf, 
Headed for St. Pierre 
Nothing to declare, 
All we had was gone 
Broke down along the coast oh 
What hurt the most 
When the people there said 
"You better keep movin' on" Acadian driftwood, 
Gypsy tailwind 
They call my home, 
The land of snow 
Canadian cold front, 
Movin' in 
What a way to ride, 
Oh what a way to go Everlastin' summer 
Filled with ill-contempt 
This government 
Had us walkin' in chains 
This isn't my turn 
This isn't my season 
Can't think of one good reason 
To remain oh We worked in the sugar fields 
Up from New Orleans 
It was ever-green 
Up until the flood 
You could call it an omen 
Point ya where ya goin' 
Set my compass North 
I got winter in my blood Acadian driftwood, 
Gypsy tailwind 
They call my home, 
The land of snow 
Canadian cold front, 
Movin' in 
What a way to ride, 
Oh what a way to go Sais tu, Acadie j'ai le mal do pays 
Ta neige, Acadie, fait des larmes au soleil 
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo 
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo 
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
