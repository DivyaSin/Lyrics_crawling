(Verse 1) 
If I told you that I loved you 
Would you tell me that 
You loved me to 
I'm giving it all I got 
Whether you say or not 
The choice is up to you Times gone by 
So fast 
On the night that we would give everything 
To make it all seem 
Like this would last (Chorus) 
Cause girl... 
When you smile, Yeah 
Thoughts whirl through my head 
Like a hurricane 
And every single night 
I think you and that will never change 
You, You 
You, You My heart is telling me, that this is real 
It's everything you do 
I can't explain the way you make me feel 
You, You 
You, You (Verse 2) 
If I got you this diamond ring 
Would you tell me that 
You'd marry me 
I'm giving it all I got, 
And I know that you'd take the shot 
To spend your life with me And I know that we'll 
Go so far 
All this bad weather is gonna get better 
No nothing will spread us 
As long as you're with me (Chorus) 
Cause girl... 
When you smile, Yeah 
Thoughts Whirl through my head 
Like a hurricane 
And every single night 
I think you and that will never change 
You, You 
You, You My heart is telling me, that this is real 
It's everything you do 
I can't explain the way you make me feel 
You, You 
You, You (Verse 3) 
And all I need is just 
A little bit more of your company 
Cause every single dream I dream 
It's you I see 
You're everything to me... And all I need is just 
A little bit more of your company 
Cause every single dream I dream 
It's you I see 
You're everything to me. (Chorus) 
Thoughts whirl through my head 
Like a hurricane 
And every single night 
I think you and that will never change 
You, You 
You, You My heart is telling me, that this is real 
It's everything you do 
I can't explain the way you make me feel 
You, You 
You, You
