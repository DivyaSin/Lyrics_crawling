I close my eyes but what's the point? 
I know sleep'll never set me free. 
So much desire, so much desire: 
Look at what you've done to me. I take a drive down in the city, 
Stop and get a drink or two. 
Secretly prayin', secretly prayin', 
Somehow I'll run in to you. Ooh, can't get you out of my mind 
Ooh, can't get you out of my mind Love is cruel, love is beautiful, 
Love is all shadow and light. 
Jesus forgive me, Jesus forgive me, 
Baby, where are you tonight? Ooh, can't get you out of my mind 
Ooh, can't get you out of my mind Why'd you have to walk into my life, 
And tear it all apart with a kiss? 
Everything was going along all right, 
Why'd you make me want you like this? Love is cruel, love is beautiful, 
Love is all shadow and light. 
Love is cruel, love is beautiful, 
Love is all shadow and light. I close my eyes but what's the point? 
I know sleep'll never set me free. 
So much desire, so much desire: 
Look at what you've done to me. Love is cruel, love is beautiful, 
Love is all shadow and light. 
Jesus forgive me, Jesus forgive me, 
Baby, where are you tonight? Jesus forgive me, Jesus forgive me, 
Baby, where are you tonight? Jesus forgive me, Jesus forgive me, 
Baby, where are you tonight? Ooh, can't get you out of my mind 
Ooh, can't get you out of my mind. 
Ooh, can't get you out of my mind, 
Can't get you out of my mind. Love is cruel, love is beautiful, 
(Can't get you out of my mind.) 
Love is all shadow and light. 
(Can't get you out of my mind.) 
Love is cruel, love is beautiful 
(Can't get you out of my mind.) 
Love is all shadow and light. 
Love is cruel, love is beautiful, 
Love is all shadow and light. 
Love is all shadow and light. 
Love is cruel, love is beautiful, 
Love is all shadow and light.
