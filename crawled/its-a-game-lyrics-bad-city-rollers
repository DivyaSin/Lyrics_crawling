The clown came down to meet me 
With a smile upon his face 
He fired his starting pistol 
And began the human race 
There were faces all around me 
They were running everywhere 
But everywhere is nowhere 
And nowhere isn't there It's a game 
a game 
a game that we're playing 
Well 
I don't mind but I don't make the rules 
It's a game 
a game 
a game that we're playing 
Just a game for lovers and fools There's snakes upon your ladder 
And there's dice upon your skirt 
There's lipstick on my collar 
And there's sweat upon my shirt 
The neighbours wiil start talking 
But you know that I don't care 
For the neighbours they are nowhere 
And nowhere isn't there It's a game 
a game 
a game that we're playing 
. .
