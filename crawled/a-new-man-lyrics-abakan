Why do I consider my life as something serious? 
Time as a burden, love as tough, isn't that delirious? 
Why can't I find a little joy, a little happiness 
When the others can? How do I get rid of that sad, sullen look upon my face? 
Give me some fresh new air to breathe, just give me some more space 
Feels like it's time to change my views, unlock the closed doors 
I'm sure there is more Got nothing to prove, no reason to hide 
I just need to free my mind 
Dreams left to live and nothing to lose 
I'm gonna make my own rules 
I'll seize each day like it's my last 
Nothing will be the same 
(Cause) I'm a new man So far I've known too fragile loves, with pleasure but no care 
so lonely in the picture, but also unaware 
I've been passing by the truth, fool enough to forget 
This common mistake It's not too late to understand that the present is a gift 
Capture the essence of each day and let the bad vibes drift 
Leave your past and future aside, as they'll always remain 
Your invisible chains Got nothing to prove, no reason to hide 
I just need to free my mind 
Dreams left to live and nothing to lose 
I'm gonna make my own rules 
I'll seize each day like it's my last 
Nothing will be the same 
(Cause) I'm a new man (Chorus) Got nothing to prove, no reason to hide 
I just need to free my mind 
Dreams left to live and nothing to lose 
I'm gonna make my own rules 
(From now on) Yeahhhh 
I'll seize each day like it's my last 
Nothing will be the same 
(Cause) I'm a new man
