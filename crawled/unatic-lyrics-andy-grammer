I've got five bucks sitting at a coffee shop 
I just wrote a lyric that made me stop 
Think about the world and what I got 
It's a beautiful, beautiful day I got dreams for food and hope for drink 
A new chance coming every time I blink 
Sunset dripping off the thoughts I think 
It's a beautiful, beautiful day And maybe I should care more about safety 
But I can't ignore or betray these voices singing [Chorus] 
You can do this, you can do this 
You are not a lu-lunatic 
Crazy would be changing your mind 
You can do this, you can do this 
You are not a lu-lunatic 
Crazy would be leaving it behind I've got five bucks waiting on a matinee 
I love to see films in the middle of the day 
Same movie seen a different way 
I don't think that makes me crazy 
And I start work on the opposite side, of the clock 
Tic tock clubs open at nine 
I like to rock till the early daylight 
Write music till five, this is my life Maybe I should care more about safety 
But I can't ignore or betray these voices singing [Chorus] I will wiggle in a straight jacket forever 
This is not some slight disease we can try and cure 
This is one thing in my life that I know for sure 
There is no turning back now And maybe I should care more about safety 
But I can't ignore or betray these voices singing [Chorus] Would be leaving it behind 
Would be leaving it behind yeah 
Would be leaving it behind oh 
Would be leaving it behind
