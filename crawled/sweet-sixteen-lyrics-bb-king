When that ev'nin' sun goes down 
Yeah, you'll find me hangin' around 
Because the night life 
It ain't no good life but it's my life Yeah, yeah, yeah listen to the blues 
Listen to what they're sayin' 
Oh, please listen to the blues 
Listen to the blues they're playin' Ah, ah, all of the people just like you and me 
They're all dreamin' about their old used to be 
Because the night life 
It ain't no good life but it's my life They tell me life's an empty scene 
An avenue of broken dreams 
Because the night life 
It ain't no good life but it's my life
