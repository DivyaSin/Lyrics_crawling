Work hard every day - because I've got to eat 
And every day the politicians recline in the seat 
Of the government corruption and the 
Political waste. The fruits of my labor 
I never get to taste 
Let the blood of the pigs run red down the Capital steps 
Left me with nothin' 
Politicians gettin' fat and I can't even pay my rent 
Left me with nothin' 
While the cold war wages on 
In the houses of government 
Civil servants sitting so high on the hog 
While the rest of us are forced to fight for 
Scraps like a dog 
In the Cabinet right were they told us before 
Why in this place do I feel like such a whore? 
Let the blood of the pigs run red down the Capital steps 
Cold war in the city states 
Elected officials still get paid 
For runnin' a system that doesn't have 
Anything to do with them.
