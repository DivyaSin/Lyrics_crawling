Take me away from the ocean, Ive already gone away 
Im already gone Take me up north to the blue grass, horse-meat and pharmacies 
Im already gone Board up the house! 
Hide your boys and girls! 
Board up the house! 
Hide your boys and girls! We wanted the best for our sweet little September castaway 
Im already gone Shes floating in acetone, covered in bruises and common colds 
Im already gone Board up the house! 
Hide your boys and girls! 
Board up the house! 
Hide your boys and girls! Board up the house! 
Board up the house! 
Board up the house! 
Board up the house! 
Board up! Hide your boys and. . . 
Hide your girls and. . . 
Hide your. . .
