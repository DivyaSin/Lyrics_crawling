The shadowside 
You say I have 
Is making everything 
Go bad You say I don't 
Care enough 
For all the things that 
I have got But I do 
And I will I don't want to see myself descend 
Into the shadowside again 
If you ever let me go again, 
In the shadowside I'll end The shadowside 
Where I go 
I'm never where 
I'm needed so You say I don't 
Give enough 
That I don't care for 
All I've got But I do 
And I will I don't want to see myself descend 
Into the shadowside again 
If you're letting go of me again 
In the shadowside I'll end
