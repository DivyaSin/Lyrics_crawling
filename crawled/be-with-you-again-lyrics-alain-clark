[Verse:] 
I can feel the world around me fade away and slowly fall apart 
I never could imagine I'd be left with just the memory of your love 
In my heart [Chorus:] 
I would pay the highest toll, pray to God or sell my soul 
I would give my life away and trade it for a single day 
I would be the Antichrist, wave my place in paradise 
I would truly give up everything to be with you again 
(To be with you again) [Verse:] 
I can't explain the pain I feel, but sometimes feels impossible to bear 
And how am I supposed to carry on as like the world is just the same 
Without you here [Chorus:] 
I would pay the highest toll, pray to God or sell my soul 
I would give my life away and trade it for a single day 
I would be the Antichrist, wave my place in paradise 
I would truly give up everything to be with you again 
(To be with you again)
