Once I woke to find a splinter 
forgotten in my northern eye 
scratched and scribbled to remove it 
but it was shy so warm inside 
tried my best to re-remember 
what foe or friend had placed it there 
wading through the hall of records 
the sand and sea beneath my hair I was lost and floating frantic 
through such piles of ancient grime 
I had never learned to swim in 
my own kaleidoscopic mind 
always stuck to simpler waters 
soft push and pull of others' tides 
shallow blues and lofty hazels 
the only riddles I'd dare ride though when I confront the mirror 
the look she gives me is black as night 
deeper than our mother ocean 
absorbing every speck of light Once I dreamed the end of winter 
was hidden in my southern eye 
I clicked my teeth and asked for spring 
but she was wilting closed as ice 
I tried to warm her by the flame 
that leaped out of my northern stare lacing lashes through the ashes 
powdered gray compressed my care 
I was hidden between pages 
obsessing over abstract time 
between all the roman numerals 
a ticking face so far from mine kept my wings all folded under 
moving within the grid and guide 
but today I'll test my edges 
and fall or free from off the side with the moon I will uncover 
my waxing luminescent sight 
for I am just a constellation 
and lightning flies this human kite
