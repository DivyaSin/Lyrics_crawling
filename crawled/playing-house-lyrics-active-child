This is getting tough sitting here waiting for you. 
And I think you've had enough cause I know that it's wrong. 
This is going on, going on for way too long 
I think you aught to know I just can't wait Oh I'm trying to find you oh I'm trying to reach your God 
I don't even know just what I want 
I don't even know just what I want Maybe we're just playing house just 'cause it feels good 
Maybe we're just playing house just 'cause it feels good That don't make it good for anybody 
Don't want to be in love just with any body 
I'm tired of being just Mr. Anybody 
So baby come with me and let's just make a body, between us 
I need you to see me- 
Girl I've been waiting please don't leave me needing 
When you want I will always be fair. 
Always Oh I'm trying to find you oh I'm trying to reach your God 
I don't even know just what I want 
I don't even know just what I want Maybe we're just playing house just 'cause it feels good 
Just 'cause it feels good
