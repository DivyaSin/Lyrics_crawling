Once a month your girl's upset 
She goes to Boots to buy Lilets 
It happens every 28 days, 
When she's in her Luteal phase. 
All she does in moan and nag, 
You go five days without a shag 
There's no cunnilingus 
You can only use your fingers 
When she's using a menstrual rag. For the week or two preceeding 
The days your other half is bleeding, 
The moody bitch is in a stress 
Complaining about PMS and, 
When her womb has started sluffin, 
You won't be eatin any muffin, 
Two, four, six, eight, 
Come on girls, lets menstruate. Heavy flow or gentle spotting, 
Running down her legs or clotting 
All that lining that she sheds leaves 
Nasty patches on your bedsheets. 
Just don't waste your efforts pleading 
You won't be shagging when she's bleeding 
The Methenamic acid means you might as well be flaccid 
When she's using a menstrual rag. It's hard to be all that devoted 
When she is looking fat and bloated 
From all the water she's retaining, 
While her pants have nasty staining. 
You won't be doing any groping 
When she's losing haemoglobin, 
Two, four, six, eight, 
Come on girls, lets menstruate.
