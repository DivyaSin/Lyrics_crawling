In me, you see a man alone 
Drinking up sunshine, and thinking it's his own 
A man who listens to the trembling of the leaves 
With sentimental ease Easy to be a man alone 
Just make the whole wide world your only home 
Don't talk to strangers, some will not be kind 
And muddle up your mind Alone, not lonely 
Except when the dark comes on 
I'm a man learning to live with 
Memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn In me you see, a man alone 
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone 
Man who still goes walking, walking in the rain 
Expecting love again Alone not lonely 
Except when the dark comes on 
I'm a man learning to live with 
Memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn Easy to be a man alone 
Just make the whole wide world your only home 
Don't talk to strangers, some will not be kind 
And muddle up your mind
