On a cold misty night 
On the corner of Haight 
She stood with a Colt 45 
The gun in her hand 
Awaiting her man 
A victim to take by surprise She's the Golden Gate Park killer 
She's the scourge of 'Frisco bay 
Where she got herself beat up and left for dead 
By a man she felt true love for 
But who left her out of hand 
Now she's out to take revenge on every man 
As she stands there with a pistol in her hand The victim arrives 
She looks in his eyes 
He goes for the gun in her hand Karl Malden was great (unlike the film, though) 
But just a bit late (this was the real show) 
And got it right between the eyes
