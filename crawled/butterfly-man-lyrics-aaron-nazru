Layin up in bed, all night with you again 
Yeah we hide from the next day 
Cos we know we know that I, 
in the end I really can't stay 
Pleasure & pain are both the same and love is just a losing game 
Wanting to give it all but 'fraid to lose it if it falls apart We hold each other, but we hold back 
Yeah we enclose each other, then we step back 
I can see it in your eyes, you need to hold on to your life 
Not run away in my dreams of paradise 
You're wise, you say that I'm A Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man 
Today I'm yours but tomorrow when I'm gone, you'll understand 
Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man 
Holding me mama can't you see's like a hand full of sand So now before I go away 
If I could seal your heart 
Keep inside the feelings of today, I'd be 
Keeping the fire burning til the moment I return to see you 
But the only problem is I cannot promise anything We hold each other, but we hold back 
Yeah we enclose each other, then we step back 
I can see it in your eyes, you need to hold on to your life 
Not run away in my dreams of paradise 
You're wise, you say that I'm A Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man 
Today I'm yours but tomorrow when I'm gone, you'll understand 
Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man 
Holding me mama can't you see's like a hand full of sand
