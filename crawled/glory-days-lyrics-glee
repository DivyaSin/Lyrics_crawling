Yeah, c'mon, hoo! I had a friend was a big baseball player 
Back in high school 
He could throw that speed ball by you 
Make you look like a fool boy Saw him the other night at this roadside bar 
I was walking in, he was walking out 
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks 
But all he kept talking about was Glory days well they'll pass you by 
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye 
Glory days, glory days, yeah Well there's a girl that lives up the block 
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads 
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by 
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed Her and her husband Bobby well they split up 
I guess it's two years gone by now 
We just sit around talking about the old times, 
She says when she feels like crying 
She starts laughing thinking about Glory days well they'll pass you by 
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye 
Glory days, glory days, yeah All right boy watch me working now! (Working now) Think I'm going down to the well tonight 
Well now I'm going to drink till I get my fill 
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it 
But I probably will Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture 
Little of the glory of, well time slips away 
And leaves you with nothing mister but 
Boring stories of Glory days well they'll pass you by 
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye 
Glory days, glory days Glory days well they'll pass you by 
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye 
Glory days, glory days What about this! All right! Ooh yeah All right! All right! Woah, c'mon now Oh yeah All right! It's alright Ooh yeah Oh yeah All right! All right! C'mon now Oh yeah All right boys! 
Keep rockin' now! Glory days!
