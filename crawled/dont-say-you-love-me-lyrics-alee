Heartbroken you tell me take my hand 
You tell me youll keep me locked away 
Where no one else can break me Simple stories with hidden words 
Truthful tales and little white lies 
Bet youre glad you didnt see me cry Dont say you love me 
Dont say you need me 
Dont say these tears that Im crying are just make believe 
Dont say you feel bad 
Dont say youre sorry 
Dont say that someday, someday youll see 
Dont say I love you Now youre coming back and telling me 
All those lies you said were just to keep from hurting me 
Youve made a choice that cant be turned around 
A now this carnival ride is slowing down Dont say you love me 
Dont say you need me 
Dont say these tears that Im crying are just make believe 
Dont say you feel bad 
Dont say youre sorry 
Dont say that someday, someday youll see 
Dont say I love you Bet youre glad you didnt see me cry 
Bet youre glad you didnt see me cry Dont say you love me 
Dont say you need me 
Dont say these tears that Im crying are just make believe 
Dont say you feel bad 
Dont say youre sorry 
Dont say that someday, someday youll see 
Dont say I love you Dont Say I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
Dont Say I love you
