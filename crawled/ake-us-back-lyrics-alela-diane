The tops of crags and cliffs, the air is thin 
So we'll find a mountain path on down the hill 
Meet me where the snow melt flows 
It is there, my dear, where we will begin again 
Skipping stones, braiding hair 
Last year's antlers mark the trail Take us back, oh, take us back 
Oh, take us, take us back, Take us back, oh, take us back, oh, take us, take us back I've a friend who lives out by the rivers mouth 
He knows the fiddles cry is an old sound 
A lonesome of creeks and moans of empty houses 
Are songs like fallen rain 
Windblown buildings, muddy ground 
The strength of water can sink a man Take us back, oh, take us back 
Oh, take us, take us back, Take us back, oh, take us back, oh, take us, take us back
