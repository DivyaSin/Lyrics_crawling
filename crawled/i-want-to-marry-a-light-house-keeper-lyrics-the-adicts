I want to marry a light house keeper 
And keep him company 
I want to marry a light house keeper 
And live by the side of the sea I'll polish his lamp by the light of day 
So ships at night can find their way 
I wanna marry a light house keeper 
Won't that be okay We'll take walks along the moonlit bay 
Maybe find a treasure too 
I'd love living in a light house 
How 'bout you? Dream of livin' in a light house baby 
Every single day 
I dream of living in a light house 
A white one by the bay
