Shining through the colors. 
Proud and not afraid. 
Different to the others. 
Color to the gray. If you call on me. 
I'm there for you. 
If you call on me. 
I will care for you. But nothing that you offer, could never be enough for. 
Words of love. 
Molding on the places. 
Wanted every night. 
Taken in the spaces. 
Hidden from the light. Oh. How you shine. 
Oh. How you crawled up my spine. 
Words of love. 
Shining through the colors. 
Proud and not afraid. 
Searching like the others. 
Needles in the hay.
