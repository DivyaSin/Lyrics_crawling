Like a thief in the night 
You should really get arrested 
Youre so its a crime 
I was yours in just a second 
Didnt know this at all 
Till I knew it was gone 
But youve done this before. 
Might be part of the game 
But I cant look away 
Its too good to ignore! 
Chorus: 
Boy you know, it was daylight robbery 
You should have known better 
take it all from underneath 
Cause you stole my attention from the start 
From the start, from the start, from the start 
From the start, from the start, from the start. 
Is the thing in my mind ..caught me blinded 
Broke the rules, cross the light, but you know I kinda like it 
You dont need a disguise, I dont know where to hide 
So just lay down alone, might be part of your game 
But I cant look away, is too good to 
Chorus: 
Boy you know, it was daylight robbery 
You should have known better 
take it all from underneath 
Cause you stole my attention from the start 
From the start, from the start, from the start 
From the start, from the start, from the start. 
Uh, uh, said you should have known better 
From the start, start, start! 
Chorus: 
Boy you know, it was daylight robbery 
You should have known better 
take it all from underneath 
Cause you stole my attention from the start 
From the start, from the start, from the start 
From the start, from the start, from the start.
