Many Rivers To Cross 
But I Can't Seem To Find My Way Over 
Wandering I'm Lost 
As I Travel Along The White Cliffs Of Dover Many Rivers To Cross 
And It's Only My Will That Keeps Me Alive 
I've Been Ripped, Washed Up For Years 
And I Merely Survive Because Of My Pride And This Loneliness Won't Leave Me Alone 
It's Such A Drag To Be On Your Own 
My Women Left Me But She Wouldn't Say Why 
Guess I'll Just Break Right Down And Cry Many Rivers To Cross 
But Just Where To Begin 
I'm Playing For Time 
There've Been Times I Find Myself 
Thinking Of Committing Some Terrible Crime Still This Loneliness Won't Leave Me Alone 
It's Such A Drag To Be On Your Own 
My Girl Left Me But She Wouldn't Say Why 
Guess I'll Just Break Right Down And Cry Many Rivers To Cross 
But I Can't Seem To Find My Way Over 
Wandering I Am Lost 
As I Travel Along The White Cliffs Of Dover Many Rivers To Cross 
And It's Only My Will That Keeps Me Alive 
I've Been Ripped, Washed Up For Years 
And I Merely Survive Because Of My Pride
