(You see) love takes sacrifice and compromise 
Fail to do so and in it lies its demise 
But now that you're around 
Love found Verse 1: Was it love 
Or did they drop the ball 
Are you equipped to make that call 
And how many loves left standing tall 
Tell it to a broken heart 
That's falling apart 
In life 
We try to do what's right 
When love comes in your life 
Like a thief in the night (2 Peter 3:10) 
And can so easily leave the same 
But was it in vain (no) 
Ah two people meant for each other 
Love that is greater than a brother 
G-d brings two together 
In a love that will last until forever 
But if they chose to let go 
How can love grow 
If they choose to let go 
Then where can love go Chorus: They hurt love 
With their deeds 
And in the process 
Sow the seeds 
Love is not a labor 
Love is not a duty 
When you fail to see its blessing 
You miss its beauty 
Love lost 
You see love takes sacrifice and compromise 
Fail to do so and in it lies its demise 
But now that you're around 
Love found Verse 2: (I say) How do you reconcile 
Losing love all the while 
Down to the letter 
You pray that things get better 
You remember them with bittersweet tears 
And silent stares 
Cause through the years 
Your heart doesn't clear the memory 
And you don't think of them as an enemy Repeat chorus: Bridge: Oh love 
A beggar's purse 
A blessing or a curse 
How it will end 
Will all depend 
On you two 
So, to those who cry for a love lost 
And take the time to ponder its cost 
To you I say 
Things will get better one day Spoken: I have come to this conclusion 
Without illusion 
That I have no palpable answer to this question 
Only a hard learned lesson 
Love doesn't fail 
People fail 
A beggar's fare 
Sacrifice a love 
For a few that don't compare 
And love will leave you 
Standing there 
So here's your second chance 
To make things right 
And this time 
I hope you see the light 
I will remember your sins no more (Hebrews 8:12) 
Only what this love is for 
Love found Now that you're around 
Love found 
Love found 
Love found
