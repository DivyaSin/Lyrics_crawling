Say hip hop (hip hop) 
Say hip hop (hip hop) [Hook: Ab-Soul] 
A.L. Now I lay me down to sleep 
L.A. I pray the Lord my soul's a G 
H, wait if I OD before I wake 
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day 
Godbody 
Cuz He is and I am Him (Soulo) 
Yes He is and I am Him (Soulo) 
He is and I am him (Soulo) 
They ain't me and I ain't them [Verse 1: Ab-Soul] 
They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols 
Nuclear power plants and missiles, real warfare 
This where the wealthy need welfare 
How many mortal men knowing healthcare 
My cautious conscience give me nightmares 
I stopped dreaming many eons ago tho 
I paid my dues and rocked the bells like Quasimodo 
On the low tho, Soulo only artist on crown without a solo album in the stores tho 
I got my opinions 
What do you suggest? 
I'ts been a drill to be ill, you ain't really sick 
Who you a-mucinex? [Hook: Ab-Soul] 
A.L. Now I lay me down to sleep 
L.A. I pray the lord my soul's a G 
H, wait, if I OD before I wake 
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day 
Godbody 
Cuz He is and I am Him (Soulo) 
Yes He is and I am Him (Soulo) 
He is and I am him (Soulo) 
They ain't me and I ain't them Muthafuck the government 
Muthafuck the system 
Muthafuck you, I'm just living.. [Verse 2: Ab-Soul] 
Ay man, I'm a sorta a rock and a hard place 
Like a guitar in the Hard Rock Cafe 
They argue about me in barber shops when I got cropped 
Hmm... What a paradox 
I'm borderline crazy with a stamped up passport 
Getting past TSA with shit stashed, smelling like a hundred ashtrays 
Little white kids asking for my autograph 
Hey man, I'm off half a xan, off to my aircraft [Hook: Ab-Soul] 
A.L. Now I lay me down to sleep 
L.A. I pray the lord my soul's a G 
H, wait, if I OD before I wake 
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day 
Godbody 
Cuz he is and I am him (Soulo) 
Yes he is and I am him (Soulo) 
He is and I am him (Soulo) 
They ain't me and I ain't them Muthafuck the government 
Muthafuck the system 
Muthafuck you So I say, so I say, so I say, catch another plane 
Represent my hood in every state up in the USA 
I'm feeling good today, feeling good to be from D.A 
I had to do it [Verse 3: Ab-Soul] 
Back to the music, back to the fact I'm actually stupid 
Stupid meaning genius, come suck Jesus' penis on Venus 
Back to reality, sadly I'm actually Jewish 
Or whatever you wish to call me, I don't wanna offend nobody (l'chaim) 
Just remind them all, that it's real 
Like when the Ark of the Covenant is still 
Foolish humans this is faith without the H 
The work is never done dummy, the lazy will be late 
A stewardess who was familiar with my music said: "You must be living the life" 
I looked at her with my red eyes like: 
"I ain't going on no vacation 
I ain't going on no vacation 
I ain't going on no vacation 
'Till I fulfill my vocation" [Hook: Ab-Soul] 
A.L. Now I lay me down to sleep 
L.A. I pray the lord my soul's a G 
H, wait, if I OD before I wake 
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day 
Godbody 
Cuz he is and I am him (Soulo) 
Yes he is and I am him (Soulo) 
He is and I am him (Soulo) 
They ain't me and I ain't them (Soulo)
