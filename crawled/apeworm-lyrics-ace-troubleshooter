I don't want to feel this way 
But I know with every step I take or move I make 
He's staring me right in the face, get out of my way! 
I don't want to feel this way 
Tearing me apart inside, I know I can't hide 
Takes me for a ride, he's quite the lie 
Tapeworm "I don't care if it's your way" 
That's the anthem of the thing I love to hate 
"I don't care if it's your way" 
Feeding me toxins 
Though I'm boxed in I know I can't trust him 
Tapeworm Smooth and slippery 
Full of frippery 
Full of ballyhoo 
I hate you! Na na na na na na na 
Hate the tapeworm!
