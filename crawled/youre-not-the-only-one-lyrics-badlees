I was sad and lonely as can be 
When an angel appeared in front of me 
And she said to me "you're not the only one" And I said "darlin', darlin' you don't understand 
My life ain't turnin' out like I had planned" 
And she said to me "you're not the only one" Well, we spend our lives in speculation, spend our time in thought 
Try to estimate the value of every thing we bought 
While the days keep gettin' shorter and the nights keep gettin' colder 
And we're gettin' older So let's not spend our time tryin' to make sense 
Of all these things that make no, no difference 
Or the consequence, " you're not the only one"
