i knew the way to get her 
was to let her know 
that i didn't want her 
don't let it show i knew i could not stop her 
her mind was slow 
she hoped i couldn't see her 
when her tears would flow now she's long gone 
does she know the way 
maybe she's wrong 
but she likes the jade and the walls of berlin 
couldn't stand the hate 
her walls are iron 
and i cannot wait now she's long gone 
does she know the way 
i know she's wrong 
but she likes the jade now to say i'm sorry 
for my heart that's free 
is to live in a silence 
that's killing me now to say i'm sorry 
for my heart that's free 
is to live in a prison 
just you and me
