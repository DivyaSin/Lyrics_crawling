they'll say 
he never knew 
what he wants and never will 
who follows to lead the blind? 
its the anatomy of a failure 
sit back 
this should only take a second 
i really feel like you're not listening 
no matter what you say or do 
i hope you know you're all dead to me no breath of conscience 
no seam could ever hold your tongue 
just let it spill out 
all this time you've wasted opening your mouth why don't you face me when you tear me down? 
coward 
why don't you face me when I'm in the crowd? 
coward 
and you hate me for knowing this 
so I'll hate you right back 
again, it all comes down to reason 
what you tried so hard to be 
and never were you're debt 
just a corporate buyout 
a forced addition to the contract signed 
you're calm 
poised 
a finger to the forehead 
thoughtful and so well refined 
infected with mindless delusions and thoughts 
about the ones you thought you could trust 
so go on stand up and justify your insults 
and back up the shit that you say
