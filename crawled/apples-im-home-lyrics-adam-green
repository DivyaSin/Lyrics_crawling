Apples, I'm home 
Gonna grab a fuck (Maybe play some hockey!) 
My mouth is a liar (Beware!) 
My feet are on fire (Who cares!) 
I've never been shy-er (I'm not scared!) If everyone's bumping around 
Because... 
Knowers know to know and 
Goers go to go and 
Showers show to show and No one's gonna ask your name 
When you fade into forever 
How can anyone say maybe 
How can anyone say right or wrong (I love you) 
And then tell you, you're okay Oh I loved the ground once 
And I kept my fingers warm 
Everything was true 
Everything was true When your penis fell apart and 
No one had a heart and 
No one had a chart to 
Show you the right way You had to be a creature 
Without specific features 
There were no teachers 
To tell you what to say (Rip out your guts!)
