Here I come to find myself, catch the tide, 
Looking for a peace at the end of the line. 
Sometimes I can't help myself, fever's high, 
I'm all at sea and so unwise. I'm so afraid I'll lose your love, as time goes by, 
But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright. 
The sunset built a memory, our love sign, 
And all at sea we come alive. Will I wash away, turning like a stone? 
I need a place where I belong. 
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope 
And take me to a place called home. I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine, 
Standing on the shore in a world I design. 
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky, 
And all at sea we say goodbye. Will I wash away, turning like a stone? 
I need a place where I belong. 
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope 
And take me to a place called home. Looking for a place called home.
