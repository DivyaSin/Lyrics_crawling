Shine, I'll stand by you 
Don't try and push me away 'cause I'm just gonna stay Do you know my name well, I ain't gonna take 
That big time line, won't be beat by a lie 
Gonna call out to these embers waiting to ignite 
Gonna pull you up by your love, by your love and tell you Shine, I'll stand by you 
Don't try and push me away 'cause I'm just gonna stay 
You can shine, I won't deny you 
And don't be afraid it'll all be okay I can see the frown you wear all around 
Like some faded crown, like a watch over wound 
Gonna call down to this diamond buried underground 
Gonna pull you up by your love, by your love and tell you When it's said and done 
What you need will come 
And time, it won't let me 
Let you let me waste it this time Shine, shine, I'll stand by you 
Don't try and push me away 'cause I'm just gonna stay 
You can shine I won't deny you 
And don't be afraid it'll all be okay Gonna pull you up by your love 
Gonna pull you up by your love 
Gonna pull you up, gonna pull you up 
Gonna pull you up and tell you, tell you Shine, shine, shine
