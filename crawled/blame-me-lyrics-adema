I'm always gonna be one life behind 
It's why I'm all alone 
What's it gonna take to make you see 
That we are falling apart? 
I wondered can we throw away the past 
So we can stop the screaming match? 
I'm not gonna break down anymore 
I've found my way to the door I can see through all of the loss 
It's an issue of our trust 
It's killing me 
It's killing me to watch you leave me 
Leave me 
Leave me I tried to talk about what's really wrong 
I see that look of discontent 
The volume starts to rise and then it's on 
That's why I have to go 
Dealing with the pain is all that's left 
Because we cannot get along 
You want to put the blame on me again 
I think that we have reached the end I can see through all of the loss 
It's an issue of our trust 
It's killing me 
It's killing me to watch you leave 
I can see through all of the loss 
It's an issue of our trust 
You keep blaming me 
Blaming me for what you do to me It's your turn to 
Watch me leave you 
It's your turn to 
Watch me leave you 
It's your turn to 
Watch me leave you I can see through all of the loss 
It's an issue of our trust 
It's killing me 
It's killing me to watch you leave 
I can see through all of the loss 
It's an issue of our trust 
You keep blaming me 
Blaming me for what you do to me
