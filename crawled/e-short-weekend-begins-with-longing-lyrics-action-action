Are you up in the middle of the night 
Trying to figure out where things went wrong and they did 
Just another semi-bummer weekend It seems hard to find a home for the words 
Though I'm sure they make complete sense in your head 
It's a light hearted movie with a splash of calamity And when I dig too deep, when I get too high 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of 
And when I talk too much, don't talk enough 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of And when I fall apart over the weekend 
And the pills begin to stop working 
And when I'm not in line, just too aligned 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of And just like that, we'll snap our hands 
And all will turn to white, on white 
Does everything have to be such a tragedy? Let's sum the world into one clever line 
And sell it back at double their asking price, or triple 
It's a crazy world, someone should sell some tickets And when I dig too deep, when I get too high 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of 
And when I talk too much, don't talk enough 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of And when I fall apart over the weekend 
And the pills begin to stop working 
And when I'm not in line, just too aligned 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of I saw you again last night 
Side walking junkie, filled with hazy thoughts, oh yeah 
Beginning of my snow storm daydream You're a drug hit to my sanity 
An acid trip to my well being, yeah, yeah, yeah 
As the doctors prescribed, a well-mannered lad 
In the ever growing well-mannered fad And when I dig too deep, when I get too high 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of 
And when I talk too much, don't talk enough 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of And when I fall apart over the weekend 
And the pills begin to stop working 
And when I'm not in line, just too aligned 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of 
I never ask of you, I'll ask of
