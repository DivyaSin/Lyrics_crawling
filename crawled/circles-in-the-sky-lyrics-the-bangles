In a window small and high 
A boy watches the sky 
Turning to monochrome 
And when they asked him do you know 
Where in the whole world you will go 
He said I wanna go home, home, home Were all here to wonder why 
Its a freefall til we fly 
Then you and I will make circles in the sky Too many birds up on a wire 
And they sway like a gospel choir 
Making music so heavenly 
And the bees make a honeycomb 
The road home is our home 
Home will always be here with me Were all here to wonder why 
Its a freefall til we fly 
Then you and I will make circles in the sky 
Circles in the sky, circles in the sky And if this is true then I belong to you 
And you belong to me... In a window tall and wide 
A girl sits side by side 
With a boy no one sees but me 
And she whispers in his ear 
Ill wait for you right here 
This is where were supposed to be Cause were all here to question why 
And its a freefall til we fly 
Then you and I will make circles in the sky 
Never be alone 
The road home is our home 
And that is why well make circles in the sky 
Circles in the sky
