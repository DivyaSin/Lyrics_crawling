Self destruct 
We've lost all control 
Self destruct 
Defy all the trust you stole 
Self destruct 
I think you sold us all 
I feel your stranglehold Self destruct 
We've lost all control 
Self destruct 
Defy all the trust you stole 
Self destruct 
I think you sold us all 
I feel your stranglehold grow tighter with time 
We stand in line to fall Keep an eye on us, we surrender 
Steal our thoughts so we don't think at all 
A different view, a new offender 
Monitor the world and watch us crawl Now we're silent and in submission 
Steal our thoughts so we don't think at all 
Single file, we're in position 
Push the button, we start our own downfall Self destruct

We stand in line to fall Without a sound, we're deadly silent 
Accepting it all as we follow the path to our fall 
We fall and they crawl 
Over all of the bodies, it's our self-destruction, that's all Without a sound, we're deadly silent 
Accepting it all as we follow the path to our fall

Over all of the bodies, it's our self-destruction Self destruct
