I want to have it all 
happiness and love all around 
Always wanted finer things 
but all that money brings me down Gonna walk around in your head 
it's time to start moving 
And do what you said Gonna walk around in your head 
Don't know where you're going 
But you know where you stand 'Cause everybody walks alone 
when they feel like they don't belong 
If only you try, then you can have it all 
But you need to let go, of everything you know 
If you live and let die, then you will have it all Some people let it in 
while lovers let the moments pass them by 
oh why 
And there's never any question 
it was always right in front of your eyes 
oh why I'm gonna walk around in your head 
you know where you're going 
And you know where you stand 'Cause everybody walks alone 
when they feel like they don't belong 
If only you try, then you can have it all 
But you need to let go, of everything you know 
If you live and let die, then you will have it all 'Cause everybody walks alone 
when they feel like they don't belong 
If only you try, then you can have it all 
But you need to let go, of everything you know 
If you live and let die, then you will have it all And I'll wait for you now 
while you turn things around 
I will wait for you now 
to be ready, where you are 'Cause everybody walks alone 
and they feel like they don't belong 
If only you try, then you can have it all 
But you need to let go, of everything you know 
If you live and let die, then you will have it all
