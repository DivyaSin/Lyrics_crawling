Yo blaze the fire 
Watch the enemies crumble 
Sure See the blood of a slave, eyes of a Banta 
Rise from the grave when they listening to Dylan 
Action and ways speak clearly like a veteran 
Looking both ways when concealing my weapon I was raised in the gutter fifties for elevens 
And a dirty box cutter, I'm standing my ground 
Back and forth out of town, I'm getting that cash 
And niggaz can't see Babs, if you ain't licking my ass One tough chick, my flows is not to be fucked with 
Send the word out to them bitches that you run with 
I'm here now bitches in trouble I spit fire 
Quick to bust off like Weebay from the wire You fucking with the grimiest nigga 
Look in my eyes my life was paralleled park until I put it in drive 
D.U.I. smacked and broke both of my headlights 
Chicks gunning me down running mad red lights I had low mileage 
It was either hugging the block or hip hop 
I never been to college, I'm only being honest 
Cadillac with the Mac with the serial stretched up in the lining Now pass me some diamonds with some dudes who move 
When I say them good so the hood call me Simon 
When I rob I ain't rhyming, I change climates 
And break more records than Rice did for the Niners Them silly one now, all gangstas get them bless 
To be wake to be among so many living legends 
Nobody stop me don't ask me why 
This a real tall guy saying Budda bye bye bye Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless 
To be wake to be among so many living legends 
Nobody stop me don't ask me why 
I'm a real bad boy saying Budda bye bye bye Man fuck them other niggaz 'cause I'm down with my niggaz 
Yep, we Da Band y'all niggaz ain't fucking with us 
Don't make me have to spend that bend and do a pull up 
Reach for that 10 that have you duckin' them bullets Hit you where it hurt it be hard for you to push up 
Half-way crook ass niggaz I got you shook up 
You walk with your head faced down, you scared to look up 
And I know Black and Blue I got the hook up I stay on my grind BK niggaz know 
In your face everyday like a Bad Boy video 
On the block for a couple of years 
I done smoked a lot of blunts, drunk a couple of beers The streets know me the hood hold me 
I paid dues, I'm the chick in the click 
Full of niggaz, I made moves 
Stay on top of my game I can't lose 
Get down or lay down bitch niggaz better choose I ride in the biggest trucks all day, call me, shit 
I supply the biggest stuff hit the block 
Like I'm Cartel blunts ready for something to dump 
I feel as though I got the biggest nuts Wait, move I put blood in your socks, your shoes 
Overflowing now you shaking your leg 
Man I run with the gage like bacon with eggs 
It's white, when I bite when I bake it, it's beige Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless 
To be wake to be among so many living legends 
Nobody stop me don't ask me why 
This a real tall guy saying Budda bye bye bye Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless 
To be wake to be among so many living legends 
Nobody stop me don't ask me why 
I'm a real bad boy saying Budda bye bye bye Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless 
To be wake to be among so many living legends 
Nobody stop me don't ask me why 
This a real tall guy saying Budda bye bye bye Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless 
To be wake to be among so many living legends 
Nobody stop me don't ask me why 
I'm a real bad boy saying Budda bye bye bye
