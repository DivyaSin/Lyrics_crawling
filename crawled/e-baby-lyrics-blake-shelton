My brothers said that I was rotten to the core 
I was the youngest child, so I got by with more 
I guess she was tired by the time I came along, she'd laugh until she cried 
I could do no wrong. She would always save me, because I was her baby I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the bayou 
I drove a truck in Birmingham 
Turned 21 in Cincinnati, I called home to mom and daddy 
I said your boy is now a man 
She said I don't care if your 80, you'll always be my baby She loved that photograph of our whole family 
She'd always point us out for all her friends to see 
That's Greg he's doing great, he really loves his job 
And Ronny with his to kids, how 'bout that wife he's got 
And that one's kind of crazy, but that one's my baby I got a call in Alabama said come on home to Louisiana 
And come as fast as you can fly 
'Cause your mama really needs you, and says shes gotta see you 
She might not make it through the night 
The whole way I drove 80 so she could see her baby
