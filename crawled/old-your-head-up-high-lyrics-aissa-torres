He kisses you goodbye 
And before he's out the door 
He's already on the phone 
Calling his girl on the side 
That he has (on the side) 
When you're not at home 
And you know about it 
Cry all night about it But girl don't you know 
You deserve so much better 
You used to be a go getter 
what happened to your throne? He's over there macking it to 
Anyone he can get to 
come home it doesn't matter 
As long as he can get him some Hold your head up High 
Hold your head up High 
Don't let em push you down 
Knock you down 
Take away your crown 
Hold your head up high 
Hold your head up High 
Hold your head up High This world is yours for the taking 
Walk with direction 
Be confident with who you are 
If you're lonely 
Never fear 
Cuz you know you're not alone 
You've made it this far 
Don't regret anything 
Or what you've been through Take time to realize 
You need to walk tall 
Stand proud, shake it loose 
Clear your mind 
And hold your head high Take care of you first 
Do the things you want to do first 
Take care of you 
don't let anyone take you down Hold your head up High 
Hold your head up High 
Don't let em push you down 
Knock you down 
Take away your crown 
Hold your head up high 
Hold your head up High 
Hold your head up High Oh you are worth every thing in this world 
Girl you are worth every thing in this world Hold your head up high baby girl 
don't let anyone come into your world 
to smash it up 
beat it up 
take everything from you 
until you had enough 
and got nothing left to give up 
you gotta know your worth 
and know you always come first 
you ain't no second hand selection 
your heart needs 100 % protection 
don't mess with a man 
that doesn't have that intention 
you're ain't no average girl 
you deserve the whole world 
on a silver platter 
so its gonna take more than swagger 
to get a piece of your heart 
the part that truly matters 
oh and better yet you're a dime 
don't you know you are just that fine? 
next time take a look in the mirror 
let me make it a little clearer 
girl look yourself in your eyes 
and hold your head up high 
ugh yeah 
what 
yeah yeah Hold your head up High 
Hold your head up High 
oh oh oh oh oh 
oh oh 
hey oh oh oh oh 
eh ay
