Never mind, never mind things are good again, 
I took the time, in my life, to figure it out, 
And I wont let, I can't let real life bring me down, down, down, 'Cause I could run, 
Across the world, And everywhere I go, 
I see my name in bright lights, 
If I keep it up I know that I could fly, 
I feel like it's a good life, 
And when I feel it most I feel like I could fly, 
I could fly, 
Yeah I get away, get away, when I need it most 
'Cause I could find, I could find, myself outta time 
Of the shapes and the lines that I draw in my mind, mind, mind, I've got to run, 
Before its too late, And everywhere I go, 
I see my name in bright lights, 
If I keep it up I know that I could fly, 
I feel like it's a good life, 
And when I feel it most I feel like I could fly, 
I could fly, 
Yeah Bright lights in my eyes for the first time, (I watch you burn up in your atmosphere) 
Bright lights in my eyes for the second time, (I watch you burn up in your atmosphere) And everywhere I go, 
I see my name in bright lights, 
If I keep it up I know that I could fly, 
I feel like it's a good life, 
And when I feel it most I feel like 
Everywhere I go, 
I see my name in bright lights, 
If I keep it up I know that I could fly, 
I feel like it's a good life, 
And when I feel it most (oh I feel it most) 
Yeah I feel it most, 
I feel like I could fly, 
I could fly, 
Yeah
