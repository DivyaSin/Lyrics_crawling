Beneath the midnight caller 
She thinks of paper green 
You never hear them calling her name 
They just know where they've been You never hear her holler 
The tears no longer come 
She reads her daily book of the past 
That shows of everyone Grey years that show in her hair 
Can't be, but don't seem to care 
She unlocks the door and there's no one there She sees a daytime stroller 
Walk from the night before 
And though she paints a smile on her face 
He won't be back no more She's got no saint to follow 
She's got no place to go 
Too proud to ask an old friend for help 
Too proud to let him know Grey years that show in her hair 
Can't be, but don't seem to care 
She knocks the door and there's no one there Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody's gonna help you now.
