Na na na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na, 
Na na na Bobby had everything 
He thought he'd ever need 
A fancy new car 
And a master's degree 
Still he's feeling lost, 
With no purpose in life 
And nothing seems to fill 
The empty space inside 
He sees an ad on late night TV 
Says "Change a kid's life with 
Just a couple hours a week" 
Normally he'd keep clicking, 
Just surfing around 
But something makes him stop 
And write that number down 
Oh, it's amazing 
How love changes everything Na na na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na, 
Na na na 
Love changes everything 
Na na na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na, na na na Well, Sara does her best 
Just to keep the faith 
But ever since he left, 
It's hard to find the strength 
She wipes a tear from her eye 
As she puts the groceries on the shelf 
Cause after dinner, baths and homework, 
Where's no time for herself 
Two jobs, two kids, too tired to fight 
No money, no romance, no end in sight 
Just when she thinks she can't go on 
She sees a painting on the fridge 
That says 'I love you Mom' 
Oh, it's amazing 
How love changes everything Na na na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na, 
Na na na 
Love changes everything 
Na na na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na, 
Na na na Well, I know we've got problems 
We've got to figure out, baby 
Yeah, I know we haven't been talking 
Or touching much lately 
But I know this love's 
Got a lot of life left in it 
Oh, so let me hold you close, 
I don't want to let you go 
Baby, let me know, 
We won't wait another minute Na na na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na, 
Na na na 
Love changes everything 
Na na na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na, 
Na na na It can change the world, 
It can change your mind 
It can change your tire 
In the middle of the night 
It can change your name, 
It can change your heart 
It can change your tune, 
It can change your life
