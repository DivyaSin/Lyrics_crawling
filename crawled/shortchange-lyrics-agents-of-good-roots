Lyrics: winn 
Music: winn Lyrics: Burn 
Fire 
Blaze 
Steam Take it from me 
Watch your way 
Take it from mev just the same Dust off your cap 
Grab your cup of tea 
Open up your mouth 
Don't forget to speak Yeah, take it from me 
Better watch your way 
Ah, take it from me 
You got the shortchange 
Shortchange 
Shortchange 
Shortchange Dark 
Brain 
Cold 
Heart Open up your book 
Open up your eyes 
Break open your head 
Try to sympathize Ah, take it from me 
Better watch your way 
Ah, take it from me 
You got the shortchange 
Shortchange 
Shortchange 
Shortchange Pull the curtain 
Choke the cloud 
Speak in circles 
Pluck the proud Raise the floodgate 
Fuck the free 
Beat the children 
To their knees 
Their knees Cool 
Soft 
Blue 
Tear Send the butler home 
Get the laundry clean 
Do the dishes first 
Sing yourself to sleep Ah, yeah take it from me 
Better watch your way 
Ah, take it from me 
You got the shortchange 
Shortchange 
Shortchange 
Shortchange
