I've got what I need, I know you're there 
Call my name, I'll be there 
I want you to know, it's on my mind 
I'm afraid of the pain that you hide Anytime fear surrounds you, let it pass away 
Hold it down, turn around 
Love will come your way I want you to be, it's all I need 
Loving you, loving me I've got what I need, I know you're there 
Call my name, I'll be there
