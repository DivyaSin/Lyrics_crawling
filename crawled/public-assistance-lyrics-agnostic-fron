You spend your life on welfare lines 
Or looking for handouts why don't you go find a job 
You birth more kids to up your checks 
So you can buy more drugs cash in food stamps and get drunk Uncle Sam takes half my pay 
So you can live for free 
I got a family and bills to pay 
No one hands money to me 
You can go to school for nothing Got that government grant get money in advance 
When you're sick from shooting up 
Medicaid pays full portion 
When little Maria gets knocked up 
She gets a free abortion Uncle Sam takes half my pay 
So you can live for free 
I got a family and bills to pay 
No one hands money to me 
You can go to school for nothing Got that government grant get money in advance 
When you're sick from shooting up 
Medicaid pays full portion 
When little Maria gets knocked up 
She gets a free abortion How come it's minorities who cry 
Things are too tough 
On TV with their gold chains 
Claim they don't have enough I say make them clean the sewers 
Don't take no resistance 
If they don't like it go to hell 
And cut their public assistance
