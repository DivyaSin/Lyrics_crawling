I've got a nail in my head and I don't know where I got it from 
Got a nail in my head right between the eyes 
Yes, a nail in my head and it's driving me mad yeah I've got a nail in my head and it doesn't seem to shed at all 
Got a nail in my head but I haven't seen a hammer around 
I've got a nail in my head but I don't know why I saw it when i woke up this morning 
And I desperately tried to hide it 
But it ain't easy, you know 
It's under everyone's eyes 
There's no way I can walk around without being seen I've got a nail my head and something happens when I try to move it 
This nail in my head it seems is doing something to my brain 
This nail in my head can make me have a clearer view And people ask me why did I put it there 
Cause they say that I could have put it anywhere 
But I think I got used to it 
I see it as a part of me 
Like an arm or a leg or a nose or an ear I've got a nail in my head But each time I get around 
I'm the main attraction 
And someone's getting angry 
'Cause I'm stealing the show 
I'm a star on TV 
I get all kind of presents 
A B&I T shirt 
For an autograph I've got a nail in my head and I still don't know who put it there 
A nail in my head and appears to be becoming fashionable 
A nail in the head is what teenagers want from this day on
