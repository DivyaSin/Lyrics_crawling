Every little step we take breaks the dreams 
Of a warm pig itching to re-stitch the seams Namsayin, when I walk, I want to break concrete! Ox'll spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror 
My light beams are mad bright, 
They stay clever 
Yo challenge an Ox member, Get a vow severed 
Found your body in the desert (scavenger's dessert) 
Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran 
Plus enter battles talkin' shit like 'Look mom, no hands!' 
I'm tired of cats tryin' to sum me 
You can't add that far yet, 
That counting is far fetched I treat MC like canines 
Throwin' words at they face 
To see if they bite when they catch 
I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette Now you standing there 
Wit razors in your head like barrettes 
Man, if the mic had ass cheeks 
The sticker in my hand Would say priority seating 
And man, I dunno if it was me or you 
But your girl was on my dick like she was teethin' 
You play the role/roll, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you 
The godspeed is actual, 
That doesn't mean I act usual 
One of the first emcees to give The crowd full attention 
'Cause you need love and affection If we could absorb every star in the sky 
We noticed some shine brighter than others, 
You wonder why 
It's the simple things in life 
That turn the peasants into leaders 
And we know the differences between 
The walkers and the sleepers If we could absorb every star in the sky 
We noticed some shine brighter than others, 
You wonder why 
It's the simple things in life 
That turn the peasants into leaders 
And we know the differences between 
The walkers and the sleepers I boogie with picket-a-vision, 
Carbon based stickler 
City piss aroma, 
Therapy coma, clone sitter 
Itching to pigeon hole villain soul magnet 
Feelings activate 
Passionate the germ, 
And the book met the worm 
I hold a book of matches captive to flashin' 
For some need flat line 
Be a thick fatigue episode, 
Brewed in batches 
Flirted curse at perked nurse, 
Broken skeleton patches 
One muddy veteran collapsed 
The untapped resource center 
Housing style pageants 
My little limbs lassoed catered to wings 
While mankind's baby steps 
Break dirt and demon I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of 
Mass times weight times tame semantics 
Encompassing that which splits lips 
But never supply and demand it 
To hell wit plastic, ooh yeah it's splendid 
Tap it on the shoulder, 
Grab it, tag it, apprehend it 
Lend it to the devil of a friend it, 
Wrench it back, mend it again 
It still never renders suspended 
But finicky picket fences 
Now every toy dreams to manufacture hearts 
Start with the diving parts and the blueprints 
You follow the precedence 
Set by war pigs of a yesteryear 
Let the tears pray 
Skip a stone over the reservoir 
To shake the whole charade 
Hmm gun play the tumors platoon 
I couldn't see 
I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, 
Woke up holding a tree 
The only bridge I ever burned 
Along this legacy at dance 
Was the one that linked 
The cities of Prosperity and Chance If we could absorb every star in the sky 
We noticed some shine brighter than others, 
You wonder why 
It's the simple things in life 
That turn the peasants into leaders 
And we know the differences between 
The walkers and the sleepers If we could absorb every star in the sky 
We noticed some shine brighter than others, 
You wonder why 
It's the simple things in life 
That turn the peasants into leaders 
And we know the differences between 
The walkers and the sleepers
