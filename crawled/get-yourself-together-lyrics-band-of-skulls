Wake before the dawn 
You will lie, but you're older 
Neither right or wrong 
Who is that in the mirror? Ask my broken heart 
For the damage 
I just need your love 
To make me feel brand new 
Brand new, brand new Come on, get yourself together 
Hurry up, babe 
Now or never 
'Cause what we've got won't 
Last forever 
So come on, get yourself together Struggle to keep up 
In your head, from the water 
We're letting down to luck 
Or a thing, could it top you? Ask my broken heart 
For the damage 
I just need your love 
To make me feel brand new 
Brand new, brand new Come on, get yourself together 
Hurry up, babe 
Now or never 
'Cause what we've got won't 
Last forever 
So come on, get yourself together Come on, get yourself together 
Hurry up, babe 
Now or never 
'Cause what we've got won't 
Last forever 
So come on, get yourself together Wake before the dawn 
You will lie, but you're older
