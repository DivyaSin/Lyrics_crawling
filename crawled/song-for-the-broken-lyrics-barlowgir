I am the comfortable secure 
The definition of this western world 
And I have perfected deceit 
Even I believe I am above saving 
And I'll never let You see I am the broken 
I am the bruised 
I am the poor ones 
I have been used It takes me falling to the ground 
To admit to fully needing You 
Then when I'm breathing my last breath 
Come and save me, I will cry to You 
'Cause pride has not let me say I am the broken 
I am the bruised 
I am the poor ones 
I have been used Why does it take so much to bring me to my knees? 
Why does it take so much pain for me to see? 
If strength is only found when I am on my knees 
Why is it so hard to show that I am weak? I am the broken 
I am the bruised 
I am the poor ones 
I have been used
