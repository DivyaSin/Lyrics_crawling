I went down to Old Joe's Bar 
On the corner by the square 
All the men were having drinks, same as usual 
And the same old crowd was there 
Oh, no... On my left stood my good friend, Joseph McGinley 
Oh his eyes were blood-shot and red 
And he turned to the people standing by him 
And these are the words he said... I went down to that St James Infirmary 
They had my baby there 
She was lying on a long, long white table, yeah 
So cold, so still... She was dead 
Oh no... Let her go, let her go, 
God bless her 
Wherever she may be 
She can search, search this whole wide world over 
But she'll never, find another man as good as me 
No she'll never, never find another man 
Who'll treat her like I did
