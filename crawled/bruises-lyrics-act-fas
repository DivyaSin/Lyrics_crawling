I dont' know 
Why you do 
Everything that you do 
Seems to me 
You can't see 
Just how much 
That you've changed 
And everything 
That you do 
Turns my skin black and blue 
And why do you 
Just proceed to beat the crap out of me *chorus* 
Am I finding too much out about you 
Why didn't you tell me I thought that I should know 
You should have been straight with me and told me of your past 
I should have told me I shouldn't have had to ask You wear a mask 
So we won't see through 
You won't let us 
See the real you 
You're insecure 
And afraid 
Of what we might really think 
You've got to learn 
To not care too much 
About what we think 
And more about what you want 
The real you inside 
Is who we want to know 
So just drop the act 
And let it go I'm sick 
Of what you put me through 
Trying to hide 
What is really you 
You are not 
Fooling anyone 
So drop the act 
And have some fun
