Colors of distinct moments 
are like a rainbow in the sky 
different pictures of the world 
changing moods from dark to bright. You and me in a moment 
So many possibilities 
Your red sunset warms my earth 
Let my wind caress your trees. It seems quite hard 
To match those colours we possess 
So hard to think of 
what to use and whats the best. 
The fear of empty papers 
makes the rainbow fade away. 
We can put our thoughts together 
paint different pictures every day. Colors of distinct moments 
are like a rainbow passing by 
different pictures of the world 
turn you laugh or make you sigh Just gaze at all these moments - 
so many possibilities - let 
blossoms shower in the rain - or be 
dancing in the breeze. With all our love and creativi-ty 
Green yellow red and blue 
Were in a gallery that never ends 
The artist is me and you. Place our picture in a frame 
And sign it with your name 
Just for me
