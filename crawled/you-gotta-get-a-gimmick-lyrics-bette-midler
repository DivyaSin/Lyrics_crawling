You can pull all the stops out 
Till they call the cops out 
Grind your behind till you're bend 
But you gotta get a gimmick 
If you wanna get a hand You can sacrifice your sacharo 
Working in the back row 
Bump in a dump till you're dead 
Kid, you gotta get a gimmick 
If you wanna get ahead You can uh, you can uh 
You can uh, uh, uh 
That's how burlesque was born 
So I uh, and I uh 
And I uh, uh, uh 
But I do it with a horn Once I was a schleppa 
Now I'm Miss Mazeppa 
With my revolution in dance 
You gotta have a gimmick 
If you wanna have a chance She can uh, she can uh 
She can uh, uh, uh 
They'll never make her rich 
Me, I uh, and I uh 
And I uh, uh, uh 
But I do it with a switch I'm electrifying 
And I ain't even trying 
I never had to sweat to get paid 
'Cause if you got a gimmick 
Gypsy girl, you've got it made All them uh and them uh 
And them uh, uh, uh 
Ain't gonna spell success 
Me, I uh, and I uh 
And I uh, uh, uh 
But I do it with finesse Dressy Tessie Tura 
Is so much more then demurer 
Than all them other ladies because 
You gotta get a gimmick 
If you wanna get applause Do something special 
Anything special 
Do something special 
Anything special You're more than just a mimic 
When you got a gimmick 
Take a look how different we are If you wanna make it 
Twinkle while you shake it 
If you wanna grind it 
Wait till you refined it If you wanna pump it 
Pump it with a trumpet 
Get yourself a gimmick 
And you too can be a star
