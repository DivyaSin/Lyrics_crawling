To me, you are the hand that I reach for 
When I've lost my way 
To me, you are the first star of evening 
The sun that warms my day Just as sure as I'm sure 
There's a heaven, this was meant to be 
No road is too long 
As long as you belong to me To me, you are the truth I believe in 
I believe in you 
To me, you are the love I have looked for 
My whole life through Just as sure as I'm sure 
There's a heaven, this was meant to be 
No road is too long 
As long as you belong to me
