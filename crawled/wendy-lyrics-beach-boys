Wendy...Wendy what went wrong...oh, so wrong, 
We went together for so long, 
I never thought a guy could cry, 
'Til you made it with another guy, 
Oh, Wendy...Wendy left me alone. Wendy...Wendy don't lose your head... 
Lose your head, 
Wendy...don't believe a word he says, 
I can't picture you with him, 
His future looks awful dim, 
Oh, Wendy...Wendy left me alone. Wendy...I wouldn't hurt you like that... 
No, no, no, 
I thought we had our love down pat... 
Guess I was wrong, 
The farthest thing from my mind, 
Was the day that I'd wake up to find, 
My Wendy...Wendy left me alone.
