She's a double-cross 
Demon powder queen 
Bitch in the gutter 
Master of kings 
She's a too-cool torture 
Top of the line 
Dangerous lover; White Cadillac 
She'll suck you dry and skin you alive tonight She'll rip you up 
This is one tough whore 
She can eat out your eyes, boys 
Keep you coming for more 
She's a too-cool torture 
Her wish is your command 
In over your heads, boys; you're playing with fire 
She's licking your soul from her hands tonight So straighten up 
Turn toward the Son 
He's your only salvation 
The only true One 
Don't be a too-cool loser 
Just to run with the herd 
The ride isn't worth it; stop playing with fire 
Stop lighting the fuse on your world tonight
