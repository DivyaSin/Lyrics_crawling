Chorus: Today, everything is gonna be okay 
God will help you find your way 
I know it will work out fine 
If you just give it time Verse 1: Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we planned 
The moments we don't understand 
The design 
At that time 
The dreams that extend beyond reality 
A struggle with duality 
But it will be okay Chorus: Today, everything is gonna be okay 
God will help you find your way 
I know it will work out fine 
If you just give it time Verse 2: Life changes so much, so fast 
We cherish the moments that last 
But you can't keep living in the past 
For long singing the same song 
Get up 
And write a new melody 
Filled with all the rhapsody 
In your heart 
And let it start 
You on your way Chorus: Today, everything is gonna be okay 
God will help you find your way 
I know things will work out fine 
If you just give it time Bridge: When you look around you see 
Heartache and misery 
But it doesn't have to be 
This way 
I pray 
God will help you find your way 
I know things will work out fine 
If you just give it time 
Just give it time Gonna be okay 
Gonna be okay 
Just give it time...
