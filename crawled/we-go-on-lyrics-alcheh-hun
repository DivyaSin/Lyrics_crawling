Reaching out through the fog of memory, 
Where your heart echoes my name, I feel you here, every tear, 
I'm always beside you 
Let all of your worries be gone, 
I am always here, forever near, 
When darkness surrounds you 
If you can't go back, then go on. Finally, meeting under starlight 
Knowing we're so far from dawn, Your every fear, every tear 
Is breaking around you 
Let all of your worries be gone. 
I am always here, ever near, 
believe when I tell you 
If we can't go back, we go on. Your heart's crying for more 
Love is the wind that can lift up your soul till it soars.... I feel you now! No more tears, no more fears 
I'm always beside you 
Let all of your worries be gone. I am always here, forever near, 
believe when I say 
That If you can't go back, then go on... 
...crying for more, 
Love is the wind that blows into our souls 
Till they soar.... I'm with you now, 
And If we can't go back we'll go on!
