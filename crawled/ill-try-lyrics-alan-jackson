Here we are talking about forever 
Both know damn well it's not easy together 
We've both felt love 
We've both felt pain 
I'll take the sunshine over the rain [Chorus] 
And I'll try to love only you 
And I'll try my best to be true 
Oh darling I'll try So I'm not scared 
It's worth a chance to me 
Take my hand let's face eternity 
Well I can't tell you I'll never change 
But I can swear that in every way [Chorus] I'm not perfect 
Just another man 
But I will give you all that I am [Chorus] I'll try. 
To be true to you I'll try 
I'll try 
To always love you I'll try
