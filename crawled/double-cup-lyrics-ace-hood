Ok now purple stuff in my styrofoam 
Sippin' slow while they blowin' strong 
All I need is my dirty sprite 
All I need is her super dome 
Drapped up & I'm dripped out 
K-dup and my pistol out 
Bad bitch, she thick as fuck 
And I'm tryna see what that pussy 'bout 
Bust it open for a real nigga 
Bust it open for a trill nigga 
Touchdown, what up h-town? 
Lonley the pimp this ones for you! 
Bun b my nigga thrae the truth 
Still in the coupe when I'm double deuce 
Still in the hood on that purple food 
You better know what I'm sippin' ain't grape juice 
I be floatin through the city, let my chain swang 
Hoy you living young nigga? tryna maintain 
Get money, fuck lames 
All my lil niggas on the same page 
Spittin' racks when I'm up in nema's 
Gimme head, she gon' catch the semen 
Hatin' on me? nigga so what

Double cup & I'm winnin' (i said it) (x3)

Gangsta nigga, I'm 'bout it

Tell me what's the happs 
Cuz you know I'm strapped 
A nigga never leave home with out it

I'm twisting up a big fatty 
And it's full of dro and imma mack your hoe 
And you know she callin' me daddy 
I'm a trill og and I earned it 
That g-code, nigga I learned it 
So when I saw the dough they had for me bro 
I just grabbed the knob and I turned it 
I wanted bread so I chased it 
And I got so close I could taste it 
Then I played the deck and got my respect 
So nigga I'm the king now just face it 
I'm in the house and I'm chillin' 
My mind on cash and I'm willin' 
I'm on a paper chase with no time to waste 
So I give a fuck how you feelin' 
I'm sideways on that buck 
My setas is stitched and they tucked 
You ain't down with that 
Then imma hide your hat 
And your ass would be outta luck, wassup? 
Double cup & I'm winnin' (x3) (yuh) (hold up) 
F-fuck them niggas, I'm in it 
Double cup & I'm winnin' (already) (x3) 
F-fuck them niggas, I'm in it 
Shit, well it's that young nigga 
From the south side, of the u.s.a 
I need calimine l-lotion cuz 
A nigga music bumpin' 
A nigga came from nothin to sayin nevermind 
To the pretty girls in the magazines 
Yo girlfriend look like maxime 
My phonebook full of billy jean's 
Condoms made out them limousine's 
I been a fiend for that codeine 
Since martin luther was like 13 
F-fuck then queenz cuz I'm a king 
Put 5% on everything 
I done threw 10 on top of 10 
Bumper kit on bumper kit 
Threw my last bitch on my new bitch 
Then threw 10 on my fuckin git 
I done came down, 
Hold it down for that h-town 
I'mma take the crown 
Sippin' hen don't fuck with crying 
But i'mma just drop this 4 for 9 
And free my cousin that's doing time 
I'mma pay the lawyer but I hope you down 
To hold it down for a real nigga 
Young kirko a young trill nigga
