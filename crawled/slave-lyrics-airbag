Slave It's been awhile since you left me 
I never wanted it to end up like this 
Is it you or is it me 
Did I lose the faith 
I need someone to be here 
I need someone to care But you make me feel so small 
You break me down 
And leave me wanting so much more 
But I can be your slave again 
So come back to me 
Don't leave me all alone You're the sweetest taste 
You're in my veins 
I can see so much clearer now with you 
No matter how hard I try 
No matter how bad I feel 
I need you to be here 
Cause I'm never satisfied
