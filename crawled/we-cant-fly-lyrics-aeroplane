We're boys and girls, who rule the world 
We can fly or kiss the sky

We can't, oh, oh, we can 
We can't, oh, oh, we can We can fly, come on, let's try 
We're boys and girls, who rule the world 
We can fly or kiss the sky 
So long, bye, bye Come on, don't cry 
We can fly, come on, let's try 
We're boys and girls 
Who rule the world
