I reckon there's one near your hometown 
An old cinder block building looks a-half torn down 
Just hang a left down the lost highway 
Keep going till you see the signs that say Honky tonk, if you love country 
Honky tonk, your whole life long 
Honky tonk, if you love country 
That's what keeps this country strong Them little ladies in the kitchen can't be beat 
They've got your hard-boiled eggs and your pickled pig feet 
Don't you try to order no imported beer 
That truck only runs from St. Louie to here Honky tonk, if you love country 
Honky tonk, your whole life long 
Honky tonk, if you love country 
That's what keeps this country strong All the girls get frisky on Friday night 
When the band starts playing don't you be surprised 
We do things different when we start to rock 
Yeah, we hop on the hip and we hip on the hop Honky tonk, if you love country 
Honky tonk, your whole life long 
Honky tonk, if you love country 
That's what keeps this country strong We'll be the life of the party at the party of your life 
You might even meet your next ex-wife 
Ain't no better place for you to be 
In the home of the brave and the land of the free Honky tonk, if you love country 
Honky tonk, your whole life long 
Honky tonk, if you love country 
That's what keeps this country strong Honky tonk, if you love country 
Honky tonk, your whole life long 
Honky tonk, if you love country 
That's what keeps this country strong
