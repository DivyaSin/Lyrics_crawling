Wedding Ring 
Adrienne Young / Mark D. Sanders I went downtown to the jewelry store 
Just a window shopping, thats all 
Lady asked me what I was lookin for 
I said a fella bout six feet tall Wedding ring, gold & grand 
Sure look purty on my left hand 
Some man fickle, some man fair 
Some man gonna put a wedding ring there I oughta just find me a doctor type 
To help me ring them wedding bells 
Oh but leave it to me to loose my heart 
To some good lookin neer do well Wedding ring, gold & grand 
Sure look purty on my left hand 
Some man fickle, some man fair 
Some man gonna put a wedding ring there A girls obliged to make the most 
Of what the Lord done gone and give her 
No I aint just ribbons and pretty paper 
This girl can gosh darn deliver Now loves like a rollercoaster I like to ride 
And I like to ride full tilt 
But mama say whos gonna buy the cow 
When they already got the milk? Wedding ring, gold & grand 
Sure look purty on my left hand 
Some man fickle, some man fair 
Some man gonna put a wedding ring there Now girls, whatever you do tonight 
Dont you fall for the banjo player 
No you may not see it by the candlelight 
But youre sure gonna see it later Wedding ring, gold & grand 
Sure look purty on my left hand 
Some man fickle, some man fair 
Some man gonna put a wedding ring there
