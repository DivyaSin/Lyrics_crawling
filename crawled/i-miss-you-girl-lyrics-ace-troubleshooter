Where did you go, girl? Where are you? 
What happened to the sweet girl that I knew? 
Can't believe the love that we once shared 
Was thrown back in my face 
And now you just don't care I miss you, girl 
I miss the look of love in your face 
I miss you, girl 
Holding hands and the warmth of your embrace Now you are there and I am here 
And every time I think of it 
It breaks my heart, dear 
But Jesus holds me to Him tenderly 
And I pray that He shows you the joy He's given me I love you, oh I miss you 
Wanna hold you close in my arms 
Never let you go
