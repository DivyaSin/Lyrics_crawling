The woman screams at the windy day 
Her children play in the acid rain 
The water is green and the sky is brown 
The cars and buildings, all broken down Now what in the world is happening here 
Will somebody please explain 
Nothing I see makes sense to me 
Maybe it's only a dream The deer in the forest or the eagle in the sky 
They see Man coming and they run to hide 
The birds on the shore will no longer fly 
They're covered in oil and they're bound to die Now how in the world does that make sense 
The killing of innocent beings 
What in the world is wrong with us 
Maybe it's only a dream The air we breathe and the food we eat 
Poor Mother Earth was poisoned in her sleep Now what in the world is happening here 
Will somebody please explain 
Nothing I see makes sense to me 
Tell me it's only a dream The woman screams at the wind and rain 
It's only a dream 
Just a bad dream 
What a bad dream
