I'm standing at the station waiting just to see your face 
I'm looking in shop windows whilst trying to retrace 
I received your letter, now the information's clear 
I want to keep the feeling going, don't let it disappear 
All the time we've spent together, memories of the past 
The future holds the key forever, let's make the future last 
Your confession 
My sweet obsession
