Starting today they are going to welcome a new girl, 
Starting today no more lying or sneaking about, 
- No! They'll see someone lovely as a flower! 
Someone who is totally in power! 
Starting today when the real Ludmilla comes out! Starting today every rule's guaranteed to be broken, 
(Broken) 
Starting today every whisper turns into a shout! 
(Aah!) I feel all my inhibitions molting, 
(More than just the peasants are revolting) 
Starting today when the real Ludmilla comes out! (Starting today is the grand transformation) 
- aaaAAAAHHH 
(Hide, run away or go on a vacation) 
- aaaAAAAAAHHH 
(Starting today she'll be ruling the nation, no doubt.) 
- aaAAAAAAAHHHHHHH -OHH YES! And starting today the whole world will be mine on a platter! 
(Every man on a plate) 
Kneel, you peasant, you peon, you dim-witted lout! 
(Gee, the future looks great) Now my inner beauty is appearing, 
I can almost hear the peasants cheering! Starting today when the real Ludmilla, Proves she's a ruler to rival Attila! Starting today when the real Ludmilla, COMES OUT!
