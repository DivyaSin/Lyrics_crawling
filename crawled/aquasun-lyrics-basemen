So I will run away from all I can see in front of me 
I will lay and talk of my hopes and dreams 
to make it seem that a light can shine 
and brighten up the darkest things 
but a light can't shine enough to light up 
these memories Dive into me 
dive into me 
I'll meet you underwater there, sometime 
so say the words before you leave; 
tear my heart off my sleeve 
and tell me you believe, in me, in me, in me Dive into me 
dive into me 
I'll meet you underwater there, sometime 
and I'll swim halfway, 
if you swim halfway 
words help me believe, 
but this is killing me Dive into me 
dive into me 
I'll meet you underwater there, sometime.
