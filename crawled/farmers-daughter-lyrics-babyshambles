You've been travelling on a dusty road 
Break some bread with me! 
Your wife and donkey on a dusty road 
Now break some bread with me! 
Now come and watch' with me! And that's that to choose between this or that 
Hmmm, I'll take the farmer 
I'll take the former every time! 
I'll take the former every time! 
Chorus: 
He knows where his daughter goes 
Cause the way it feels when sun light hits snow 
Sunlight hits the snow. 
Well, that's to choose between this and that 
Me, I take the farmer 
I take the farmer every time 
I take the farmer every time! 
Chorus: 
He knows where his daughter goes 
The way it feels, when sun light hits snow 
Cause the farmer knows where his daughter goes 
Cause the way it feels when sunlight hits the snow 
Sunlight hits the snow.
