Now that all the snow has fallen 
It's crunching in below my feet 
And all the Christmas lights are shining 
On houses up and down my street 
And I can see the happy families inside 
If only for a moment, it's Christmas time I think I see the children down the street 
Here they come caroling 
Now I can hear them, they sing "oh yeah" Mr. Johnson bought a Christmas tree 
He set it up with his family 
They're opening their presents big and small 
Mr. Johnson got a big, brown, bowling ball 
Sally got a pair of brand-new skates 
And Jimmy got a box of Frosty Flakes 
He knows that there's a special little prize inside 
What a happy moment, it's Christmas time The carolers are standing in line 
They sing, "oh yeah, oh yeah"
