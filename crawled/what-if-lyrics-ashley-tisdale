Don't speak, 
I can't believe 
This is here happening, 
Our situation isn't right 
Get real who your playing with, 
I never thought he'd be like this 
You were supposed to be there by my side When you say that you want me, 
I just don't believe it 
Your always ready to give up 
And never turn around But what if I need you baby 
Would you even try to save me 
Or would you find some lame excuse to never be true 
What if I said I love you 
Would you be the one to run to 
Or would you watch me walk away 
Without a fight So sick of worrying, that ya 
Gonna quit over anything 
I could trip and you'd let go like that 
And everything that we ever were 
Seems to fade but not the hurt 
Cause you don't know the good things from the bad 
When I say that I want you 
You know that I mean it 
And in my hour of weakness 
There's still time to try But what if I need you baby 
Would you even try to save me 
Or would you find some lame excuse to never be true 
What if I said I loved you 
Would you be the one to run to 
Or would you watch me walk away 
Without a fight Every time I speak you try and stop me 
Cause every little thing I say is wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
You say your noticing but you never see 
This is who I really am that you can't leave 
Makes me wanna know right now 
If it's me you'll leave without 
Or would you change your mind What if I need you But what if I need you baby 
Would you even try to save me 
Or would you find some lame excuse to never be true 
What if I said I loved you 
Would you be the one to run to 
Or would you watch me walk away without a Oh baby what if I need you (what if I need you) 
Yeah, yeah 
What if I need you, what if I you 
What if I need you 
What if I need you 
Oh what if I need you 
What if I need you 
Need you, you, you
