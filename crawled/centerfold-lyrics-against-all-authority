Does she walk? Does she talk? 
Does she come complete? 
My homeroom angel always pulled me from my seat 
She was pure like snowflakes, no one could ever stain The memory of my angel could never cause me pain 
Years go by, I'm looking through a girlie magazine 
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in between 
My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold My angel is a centerfold 
Angel is a centerfold 
My angel is a centerfold 
Angel is a centerfold Slipping notes under the desk 
While I was think about her dress 
I was shy, I turned away before she caught my eye 
I was shaking in my shoes, whenever she flashed those baby blues Something had a hold on me when angel passed close by 
Those soft fuzzy sweaters, too magical to touch 
I see her in that negligee is really just too much 
My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold My angel is a centerfold 
Angel is a centerfold 
My angel is a centerfold 
Angel is a centerfold Now listen, it's okay, I understand 
This ain't no never-never land 
I hope that when this fish is gone 
I'll see you when your clothes on Take your car, yes, we will, we'll take your car and drive it 
Take it to a motel and take 'em off in private 
A part of me has just been wrecked 
The pages from my mind are stripped Oh no, I can't deny it 
Oh yeah, I got to buy it 
Alright! Alright 1 2 3 4 
My blood runs cold, my memory has just been sold My angel is a centerfold 
Angel is a centerfold 
My angel is a centerfold 
Angel is a centerfold
