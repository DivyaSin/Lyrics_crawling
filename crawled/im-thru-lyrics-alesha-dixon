In terms of lies and filth I don't amount to much 
My soul is sugar sweet with an angelic touch 
But very single boy who thinks I'm worth a try 
Well I'd like to give him one in the eye 
I've had enough of giving no I'm on the take 
I'm changing my religion for my poor hearts sake 
Had it up to here, I'll take a running jump if any boy comes near CHORUS: 
I'm through with love, it didn't do much for me 
I'm through with love, as if you really care 
I'm through with love, so honey please don't call me 
I'm through with love, mon cher I had the chance to think about the whole shebang 
And come to the conclusion that it's not my thing 
A word to the wise, keep out of site 
My bark ain't nothing on my bite 
I'm sure it isn't me but that I can't be sure 
It seems that cupid's arrow always hits the board 
Had it up to here, I'll take a running jump if any boys come near [CHORUS] To boldy go where no girl's gone before 
I'm packing up and heading out the door 
Heavens above 
I'm through with love 
It didn't do much for me 
Do do do do do do do [CHROUS] Do do do do do do do
