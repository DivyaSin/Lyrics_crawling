The skies are clouded, the roads are flooded 
I'm losing the stars that guide my way 
You had that tied to my name, tell the gods from my game

Tonight, yeah 
Don't you ever let it get in your way 
Tonight, yeah L-l-look into my eyes 
I'm not gonna die, I'm gonna survive 
Coz this is for you, and this is for me 
So never give up in what you believe 
Hear all soldiers 
(See them standing strong in storms) 
Hear all soldiers, hear all soldiers 
(See them standing strong in storms) 
Hear all soldiers, yeah Now I'm out the trenches, no I'm not offended 
Defending the pain that I've been through 
Seen the blood in my veins, now I'm out of the rain 
Now that I'm clean, the skies are blue Don't you ever let it get in your way 
Tonight, yeah
