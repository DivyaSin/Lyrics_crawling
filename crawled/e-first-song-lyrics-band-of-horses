I'm shaking awful 
I'm shaking, asshole 
And where's the remote? 
Its gonna fall off The snowing in cover 
Do you recover from those? And Christmas time coming 
And over approaching 
We've been drinking, pardon As Christmas time goes 
I'm coming over 
Coming from 
You're already gone I'm wrapping up 
The presents 
I bought An overcoat 
Will take me anywhere 
Oh 
We've suffered enough It's scary 
To leave 
And they're leaving from earth 
Cutting us off 
Knowing that 
One 
Calling on 
Total 
Way 
Do I know anyone? 
No 
I don't know 
Anyone
