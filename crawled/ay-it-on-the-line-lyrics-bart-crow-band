[Verse 1] I'm a little bit lazy 
Get a little bit crazy 
There's so many words 
That I need you to say 
I'm a little bit restless 
I get a little bit reckless 
And there's so many things 
I just need you to say [Chorus] So I'm gonna 
I'm layin it on the line 
I'm tired of fightin what I'm feelin 
From deep inside 
I'm layin it on the line 
Lord, cause what have I got to lose 
Cause if he takes her hand 
She's gonna leave me here behind [Verse 2] Sittin here talkin 
To the walls 
There's nobody home 
So there's noone that I can call 
Smokin on cigarettes 
Drinkin on whiskey 
And prayin to God 
That you were right here with me [Chorus] So I'm gonna 
I'm layin it on the line 
I'm tired of fightin what I'm feelin 
From deep inside 
I'm layin it on the line 
Lord, cause what have I got to lose 
Cause if he takes her hand 
She's gonna leave me here behind Leave me behind, Lord
