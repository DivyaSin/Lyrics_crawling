Hey, where you going to 
I can see by your eyes 
You've had enough of my lies 
What you gonna do But wait. Please, don't go that way 
I'm down on my knees 
Can I beg you please 
One more time to stay, stay No, never go away 
Your eyes I'd see everywhere 
'Til my dyin' days So please, I'm down on my knees 
No more lies you hear 
No cry, no tears 
Oh I beg you please, please If you go away 
Then I'd be lonely 
Thinkin' about your eyes 
Your mile, you lips, your touch, your kiss 
All those empty lies 
Don't want to be lonely, forever without your love 
Your smile, your lips, your touch, your kiss 
Baby, you're my love Babe, I'd be lonely 
Thinkin' about your eyes 
Your smile, your lips, your touch, your kiss 
All those empty lies 
Don't want to be lonely 
Forever without your love, your smile, your lips, your touch, your kiss Baby, You're my love 
Baby, You're my love 
Baby, You're my love 
Baby, You're my love
