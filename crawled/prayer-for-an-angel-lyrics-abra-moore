Don't tie the string so tight 
She tried 
She'll never slip away from you 
A broken wing don't fly A kiss, a kiss to say goodbye 
To a world you used to know 
I watch you chase her down 
Away from you But, can you hear her cry 
Hope, hope is all you've got 
You've forgotten how to find your way Over you 
Don't tie the string so tight 
She'll never slip away from you 
She tried 
A broken wing don't fly.
