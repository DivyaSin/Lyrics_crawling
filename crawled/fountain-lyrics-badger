Why do I always doubt your word 
When you tell me everything is alright? 
Reasons child always had a clear sight 
I doubt your word Why do I always run away? 
My fear is always greater than my judgement 
Gotta stand up straight with my feet down on the ground 
I run away Smile on my face 
Like the sun on a fountain 
Smile on my face 
As you look in my eyes I see hungry faces in my sleep 
Don't seem to have the time, not like I used to do 
Sad to say I see a storm cloud growing in the sky 
Above the street
