I'm watching the raindrops as they fall 
Feels like the sky is crying 
If only my eyes were not so cruel 
Then maybe the tears would show you I know they'd fill up an ocean 
If I could set them free 
If only you could see 
If only I could cry No one has cared enough before 
To tell me or write it down in words 
And no one has reached me like you do 
And I want the world to know that 
If you don't see a teardrop falling 
Help me set them free 
I've got to make you see 
If only I could cry Tomorrow I'll catch the early train 
Be out of your life forever 
The letter I wrote tried to explain 
I know you won't understand
