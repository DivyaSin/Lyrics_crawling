no matter what they say now I'm in love 
i do it my way cause i'm in love 
and i can't keep that song out of my mind 
playing that silly tune all the time 
I'm In Love 
no matter what they say i dont care 
i do it anyway anywhere 
i found this little song on my own 
she said that i'm a genius i'm in love 
my friends say that i'm crazy i'm just fine 
my neighbours stare at me never mind 
cause only tell the sweetness of a smile 
my supersided girl i'm in love no matter what they say now I'm in love 
i do it my way cause i'm in love 
and i can't keep that song out of my mind 
playing that silly tune all the time 
I'm In Love
