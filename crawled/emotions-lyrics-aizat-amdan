[Verse 1]: 
I had enough... 
This silly things won't do me any good... 
I lied before, 
But only when I have to [Chorus]: 
Leap into another phase... 
You swore it would be ok... [Verse 2]: 
What happens next? 
This overrated chapter prolongs... 
Whatever happened could have not 
But then again, what are we supposed to do... [Chorus]: 
Leap into another phase... 
You swore it would be ok... Oohh.. 
Leap into another phase... 
You swore it would be ok... Could there be an easy way... 
To feel joy, hate, sorrow and love and live a life of emotions... emotions... emotions Emotions... emotions... emotions... [Bridge]: 
I put myself on this thin wire... 
I need you... I need you to hold my hand 
and pull me out from this sorrow... 
my lover... my best friend... my heart... Emotions... emotions... emotions... 
Emotions... emotions... emotions...
