Summer's ending 
And when it does, all my flowers will fall 
And when they fall the colors will fade 
And it could leave me anywhere 
Picture-boxed movie stars in stereo 
Paperbacks and radio have taken his place 
The pull of the ferris wheel, the sound of the train 
And it could take me anywhere 
And it could leave me anywhere 
Listen can you hear them fall 
They're falling down, a hundred flowers 
I can't count them all 
They're falling down a thousand times 
I can't catch them all 
And it could leave me anywhere 
It could take me anywhere 
Summer's ending 
And when it does, all my flowers will fall 
And when they fall the colors will fade 
And it could leave me anywhere 
Listen can you hear them fall
