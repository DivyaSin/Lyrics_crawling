Welcome to Ch' Miguel 
Will we be starting with a cocktail today? Oh yes, I'd like the bottle of Dom Perignon 
Some Beluga Caviar and for the main course 
We'll have the Pekin' Duck A La Roux 
And the stuffed artichoke Pekin' duck, I don't want no duck 
Give me some pig, pig's feet 
And how much y'all green Scotch? 
And with that I want some OE, aight?
