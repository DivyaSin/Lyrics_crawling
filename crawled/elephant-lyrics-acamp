I caught you smiling 
With pointed teeth 
What once was beautiful 
Has turned bitter and cheap 
So now there 's nothing I can do for you 
But leave your roses out to die I misbehaved 
I 'm in your way 
In your way like an elephant Gentle smiling 
With pointed teeth 
Now there 's a war between 
My high hopes and me 
So this is how you put an end to things 
By cutting throats with a smile I misbehaved 
I 'm in your way 
In you're way like an elephant
