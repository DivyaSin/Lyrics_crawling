You can't be happy searching for answers nobody even knows. Find a friend and search together for what it is you're looking for. Two is as bad as one, well I disagree. Nothing seems hard at all when it's just you and me yeah. 
And I could sail the seven seas if you were there with me, and I could be whatever you need, just say you love me. 'Cause I jump a mountain every time our lips touch, even though I'm weak at the knees. They flew around the world in eighty days, you and I we only need seventeen. Not a bird, not a plane, no superman in the sky, it's you and I. Big green eyes and a pretty smile that's all I'll need to survive. Oh we will fly. Oh we will fly. You should be happy searching for answers that I seem to know. You will ask all the right questions, so what is it you're scared of? I'll be forever by your side and don't disagree. Taking pictures and driving for miles, it's just you and me, yeah.
