What color is death? 
The shade of an ice pick sinking into flesh 
Sex and sex and sex and death 
I don't want you, I want your flesh 
Close my eyes and dream of death 
Slip away and take a breath 
Rivers running dark and cool 
How can nothingness be cruel? (verse x2) Trip with me and meet the sun, orgasm of light 
Suck the world inside yourself, splitting forth the night 
Douse their minds in gasoline, drop the burning match 
Angel light, alien love, I wait for them to hide I listen to the trees, they hum and hold hands with the moon 
Insects whisper sweet nothings, the solar system blooms 
The skulls of babies grow within the garden of the soul 
Where the girls run barefoot and all life lives uncontrolled Come on baby let's kick back and bleed with me awhile 
Never mind the cold black truth 
That stains the kitchen tile (verse x2)
