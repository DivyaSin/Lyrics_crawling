Listen 
Baby, not with your ears cause this song will pass you by, 
See this is, 
The language of love, 
Not every man can read it's sign 
So, forget about whatever you learned boy, 
You don't have to speak your mind to me, 
Oh 
With every page you turn 
You find me in between the lines. 
So, 
And we don't even have to spell out what you lovin' me is about, 
And me in love with you is louder than I could ever shout. 
Cause no words can explain what I feel each day, 
Every time your around seems the ground slips away. 
When you called out to me and I just could not speak. 
It wasn't hard to see 
You silenced my whole world and left me breathless. 
I don't need no words. 
No words, no words, no words 
We don't need no words. 
This is worth a lifetime of riches, diamonds, pearls, and gold 
You can search through eternity and we will never grow old 
So let the music play boy 
I can hear the lyrics to your soul 
There's nothing we can say boy that our hearts have left untold 
So we don't even have to spell out what you lovin' me is about, 
And me in love with you is louder than I could ever shout. 
Cause no words can explain what I feel each day, 
Everytime your around seems the ground slips away. 
When you called out to me and I just could not speak. 
It wasn't hard to see 
You silenced my whole world and left me breathless. 
I don't need no words. 
No words, no words, no words 
We don't need no words. 
Words. 
Can't you feel my body, body 
I put you first, first 
You gotta know, gotta know baby 
No words, words 
Let me feel it poppin', poppin' 
Don't make a sound 
Don't make a sound baby 
Yeah, 
And we don't even have to spell out what you lovin' me is about, 
And me inlove with you is louder than I could ever shout. 
Cause no words can explain what I feel each day, 
Everytime your around seems the ground slips away. 
When you called out to me and I just could not speak. 
It wasn't hard to see 
You silenced my whole world and left me breathless. 
I don't need no words. 
No words, no words, no words 
We don't need no words. 
No words, no words, no words, no words 
We don't need no words
