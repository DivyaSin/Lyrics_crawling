Verse I 
Here I sit, at the terminal 
Messing with life like it's just another funeral 
Don't know why I'm thinking of you 
All I know is who: Chorus 
Who goes pretty wild all the time, 
Who goes down for a dime, 
Who does this, who does that 
Who does more than just chat 
Oh, you're so lucky, so damn very lucky 
Wish I was as lucky as you 
But I ain't Verse II 
Laying by the road, on the pavement 
Not allowed to move, by the inebriants enslavement 
You're wasted but you disapprove, that your knees are bent 
And you almost realise who: Chorus 
Who goes pretty wild all the time, 
Who goes down for a dime, 
Who does this, who does that 
Who does more than just chat 
Oh, you're so lucky, so damn very lucky 
Wish I was as lucky as you 
But I ain't Verse III 
Standing beside your bed, listening to the electrocardiography 
Hoping you're not dead, hoping this is not what it was meant to be 
Trying to reassure you, that you're gonna get trough 
Then I think you would realise who: Chrous II 
Who went wild all the time, 
Who went down, even for a dime 
Who did this, who did that 
Who did more than just chat
