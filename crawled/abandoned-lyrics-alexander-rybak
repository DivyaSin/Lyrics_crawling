Sleepless in the night 
I try to lose my faith in you 
Saying to myself 
You can't be the right one for me And now that you're gone 
I finally get a taste of freedom 
Only problem is I don't really want 
To be free I don't wanna be abandoned 
I don't want to curse your name 
I don't wanna feel the sadness 
Pretending that I'm still the same 
I don't want to burn your letters 
I don't want to face the truth 
I don't wanna be abandoned 
I don't wanna waste my youth You try to suffocate with your pretends 
And I believe in the shallow romance 
I ran for cover but I couldnt hide 
And still you try to get me to abide You scratched me like a perfume and 
Erasing all the feelings that I had 
And all the time you faked this loneliness 
Cause you wouldn't see my twisted mess I don't wanna be abandoned 
I don't want to curse your name 
I don't want to feel the sadness 
Pretending that I'm still the same 
I don't want to burn you letters 
I don't want to face the truth 
I don't wanna be abandoned 
I don't wanna waste my youth
