Stupid scatterbrained 
too much pressure in my vein 
Shithead, silly pain 
maybe I just went insane 
You could be me 
if you have the eyes to see 
Way high in the sky 
the old man sits an wonders why Blinded 
hope that you can see 
All the things that I can be 
I'm blinded 
do you hear my call 
tell me will you catch my fall Slowpaced arrid space 
Guess my life has been a waste 
Wet cat in the rain 
noone knows about my pain 
Bullshit - waste of time 
listen to your stupid lie 
Everytime we say good-bye 
I just hang my head and cry Blinded 
hope that you can see 
All the things that I can be 
I'm blinded 
do you hear my call 
tell me will you catch my fall
