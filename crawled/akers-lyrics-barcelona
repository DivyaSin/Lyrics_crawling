What makes these boys fall hard 
Over all the girls they have fought and won 
These kings work hard and long 
Just to ensure that their girls don't run 
Oh no, nobody has taught them to love slow 
They're crying out at the streets below Why don't you stay with me 
I think you can save this beast 
But I'll leave you in an empty room 
Honey that's what takers do 
I'm a thief and I'll take you What makes these monsters cry 
You can see the gold reflecting in their eyes 
Yeah their chests are heaving, skin stretched tight 
Greedy hands grab what feels right 
Oh no, nobody taught them to let go 
They don't know Why don't you stay with me 
I think you can save this beast 
But I'll leave you in an empty room 
Honey that's what takers do 
I'm a thief and I'll take you (Woah) Woah 
Woah 
Woah 
Woah 
Woah (Woah) If you stay 
(Woah) You would break 
(Woah) You're way too innocent to take 
(Woah) After these violent days 
(Woah) You still love 
(Woah) And I still take Stay with me 
I think you could save this beast 
But I'll leave you in an empty room 
Honey that's what takers do I'm gonna take you and you'll stay with me 
Well I think you could save this beast 
But I'll leave you with an empty room 
Honey that's what takers do 
I'm a thief and I'll take you
