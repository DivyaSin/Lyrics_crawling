It started off so easily 
Looking back now I can see what could have been 
One simple chance 
Begging Me 
Begin Again 
Push yourself to learn new ways to begin again 
Do the wrong things 
Activate 
You must carry on 
You can't relive what you were 
You've used it and used it and not it is all gone 
I know what you're missing 
Face where you are 
You're not young anymore 
Tomorrow won't go away 
With your every decision some movement is made 
Yesterday was a loss 
You turned the key now take care of business 
Push yourself to learn new ways to begin again 
Do the wrong things 
Understand 
You have just begun
