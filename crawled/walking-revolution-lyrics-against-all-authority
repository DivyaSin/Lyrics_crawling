I never do what I'm told 
I'm a fucking time bomb waiting to explode 
I'm a walking revolution 
I've git problems no solutions...damn 
so you say I've got a problem with authority 
well I just don't know what to do 
cause all your rules & regulations 
benefit no one but you 
so I refuse to let you run my life 
and be a rat in your race 
so you'd better get outta my sight 
before i fuckin smash your face 
Pressures & I'm gonna explode 
I'm gonna grab my glock & empty my load 
I'm stuck in a dead end job burger flipin 
everybody's movin forward but i'm slipin 
further further down with no hope 
everydays a struggle I just can't cope 
my heads a mess, I can't think straight 
look into my eyes & all you see is hate
