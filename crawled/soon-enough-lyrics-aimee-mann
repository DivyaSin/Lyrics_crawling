Everybodys got their differences 
too bad 
heres a circumstance in which the stakes are high 
everybodys got their secrets out 
so sad 
go around the room and see who doesnt cry Soon enough 
youll be free to write it off 
you dont know enough 
to call a bluff 
and the one who does 
will never ever tell Soon enough 
you can say we made it up 
just for fun I guess 
to make a mess 
cause whats more fun 
than other peoples hell So go ahead and say youre done with it 
its cool 
baby you can go whatever way you choose 
though you ought to kill the whole vindictive bit 
cause youll 
someday realize theres ties youll want to use Soon enough 
youll be free to write it off 
you dont know enough 
to call a bluff 
and the one who does 
will never ever tell Soon enough 
you can say we made it up 
just for fun I guess 
to make a mess 
cause whats more fun 
than other peoples hell
