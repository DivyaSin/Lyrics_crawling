Creeping slowly like a spider on the wall 
Rolling heavy like a cannonball 
Crawl beside me 
Wont you tell me where you've been? 
Don't let them tell you that it's in your head I'm the one 
I'm your friend 
Let me in (Move) You wanna start it up? 
(Move) You gotta roll it up 
Just one is never enough 
(Move) Are you feeling lit? 
(Move) You wanna take a hit? 
Just one is never enough 
Sweet sounds coming down from above Light me 
Try me now the smoke can clear the air 
Take it all until there's nothing left 
Can't deny me cause I know you feel the hit 
Close your eyes and you're still seeing red I'm the one 
I'm your friend 
Let me in (Move) You wanna start it up 
(Move) You gotta roll it up Just one is never enough 
(Move) Are you feeling lit? 
(Move) You wanna take a hit? 
Just one is never enough 
Sweet sounds coming down from above (Move move) You wanna start it up? 
(Move move) You wanna roll it up? 
(Move move) You wanna light it up 
Just one is never enough (Move) You wanna start it up 
(Move) You gotta roll it up 
Just one is never enough 
(Move) Are you feeling lit? 
(Move) You wanna take a hit? 
Just one is never enough 
Sweet sounds coming down from above Just one I never enough 
Are you feeling lit? 
You wanna take a hit? 
Just one is never enough 
Sweet sounds coming down from above 
Just one is never enough 
Sweet sounds coming down
