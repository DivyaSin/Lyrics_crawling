I always will remember those sultry desert nights 
(Our) hearts burning with a passion 
Whoa, it's never felt so right 
It was meant to last forever but when I reached out you were gone 
It's taken time to mend this broken heart and forget you done me wrong Now you're back after all this time 
You've reawakened all the feelings that I've tried so hard to hide 
But baby Will you love me like you loved me yesterday? 
That's all I need to know 
Will you love me like you loved yesterday? 
Or will you just let me go? 
We could leave the pain behind us take a shot at love again 
We could fool ourselves believing that our love would never end 
I've been missing you, whoa, what should I do? 
Did you really have a change of heart 
Or are you playing me for a fool? You don't have to tell me where you've been 
But there is one thing I've gotta know before I let you in Baby
