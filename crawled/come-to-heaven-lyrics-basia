Sitting forever, looking at heaven 
Wanting it so much 
A born worrier, you better wake up to your heart 
Or you'll break it, forsake it I can't stand by and let you ruin it 
We've come so far to be turned down now 
I'm on your side, I'm a friend 
To be certain isn't easy anyway Come to heaven 
I'm waiting, but tomorrow never comes 
Come to heaven 
Now or never, just take it 
Oh baby, you only have to try it once Wanting a miracle, getting too cynical 
Taking it too far 
I won't carry you 
You've got to find out for yourself 
Like I did, be decided I can't stand by and let you ruin it 
We've come so far to be turned down now 
I'm on your side, I'm your friend 
To be certain isn't easy anyway Come to heaven 
I'm waiting, but tomorrow never comes 
Come to heaven 
Now or never, just take it 
Oh baby you only have to try it once Now or never may be forever 
Only now we could be together 
No time for being clever 
Gonna stay with you whatever 
Let's embark on this endeavour 
Baby it's now or never 
Come to heaven 
Oh baby you only have to try it once
