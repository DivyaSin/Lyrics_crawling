Let me know... 
Ayo AB! 
Yeah? 
Tell 'em somethin' You better slow it down, I might not be what you think, you barely know me now, telling me you wanna hold me down, then give away everything in a hurry now, you might let me down, down. Tryin' to flash your cash and cars for me, how ironic, already seen the same damn thing before you, so if you think you can find a way to stay honest, I could find a way to open up to you. [Chorus] 
C'mon with it babe, loosen me up 
C'mon now baby, baby, loosen me up 
Show me you're forreal, loosen me up 
C'mon now baby, baby, loosen me up You think expensive things will get my attention, its the simple things, it always go missing, Ill show you what to do, my love. Dont think that Im asking for too much, it wont work if youre in a rush, all you gotta do is never break a promise, make me feel like Im the only one for you. If you do that then anything you want, I got it, all you gotta do is get me to open up to you. [Chorus] 
C'mon with it babe, loosen me up 
C'mon now baby, baby, loosen me up 
Show me you're forreal, loosen me up 
C'mon now baby, baby, loosen me up [music break] [Chorus] 
C'mon with it babe, loosen me up 
C'mon now baby, baby, loosen me up 
Show me you're forreal, loosen me up 
C'mon now baby, baby, loosen me up
