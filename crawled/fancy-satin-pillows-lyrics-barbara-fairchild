Fancy satin pillows that you bought for me to place beneath my head 
I must admit they're very nice but I would rather have your arms instead 
To have you here beside me and to feel your warmth so very close is what I need 
More than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me 
Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows I don't mean to be unkind 
But I can't use 'em both and I thought sharing them was what you had in mind 
In the stillness of the night to have your arms reach out and pull me close so tenderly 
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me

Still I thank you for... 
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me
