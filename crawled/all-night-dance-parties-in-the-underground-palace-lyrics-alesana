Beautiful, you know you leave me breathless 
When you fall into my eyes 
My heart belongs to you my angel There is just no reason for you to 
Let life bring you down 
Please come with me and let me show you I know that at times it may be hard to let go of yourself 
Baby girl, tonight leave your cares behind 
Because it's time to celebrate All night long I'll sing and dance with you 
My sweet princess only if you trust in this 
Take my hand and follow me 
I will sweep you off of your feet 
All night long I will sing and dance with you Every time I look at you I can't believe 
How magical you are 
The stars belong to you my angel Run away with me into a world 
Where time seems to not exist 
The smile on my face will show you I know that at times it may be hard to let go of yourself 
Baby girl, tonight leave your cares behind 
Because it's time to celebrate All night long I'll sing and dance with you 
My sweet princess only if you trust in this 
Take my hand and follow me 
I will sweep you off of your feet 
This night will only end when we stop dancing My sweet princess I will sing and dance with you 
All night long 
The stars they belong to you my angel All night long I'll sing and dance with you 
My sweet princess only if you trust in this 
Take my hand and follow me 
I will sweep you off of your feet 
This night will only end when we stop
