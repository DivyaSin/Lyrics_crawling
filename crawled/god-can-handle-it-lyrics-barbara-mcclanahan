In my trails my weakness my struggles, 
He is there to see me through 
When it seems all hope is gone. 
I know there's problem He cannot solve 
He said He'd never leave or forsake me 
So I know He can work it out for me 
I know He can work it out for me 
I know God can work it out for me 
So I let Him handle it 
I let Him handle it 
So I let Him handle it 
Sometimes I wanna pick it up myself 
But I know He knows what's best for me 
I know He knows what is best for me 
I know He knows what is best for me 
I know He can work it out for me 
I know God can work it out for me 
So I let him handle it ya 
I let Him handle it.
