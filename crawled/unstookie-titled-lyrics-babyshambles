You smoke your cigarettes down to the bone 
And since you vowed to back it and you're too proud to sack it 
You have to carry on your own You think you had it under control 
Best foot forward and don't look back no more 
It could break your heart and torment your soul Well, they sold my name after they stole my shame 
Sold my name, ah yeah 
Tumbled my game, tumbled their game 
Got a tablet sized brains, yeah You smoke your cigarettes down to the bone 
And it's best not to mention you're craving for attention 
Your love for fame like blood from a stone Too busy to notice that you've thrown 
You turn to dust as there's no one left to trust 
Last chance and your mind will go Suppose my name, suppose it came 
And they sold my shame, yeah 
And suppose it came out and tumbled their game 
Tablet sized brains, yeah Or is it really such a sin though? 
Toll for my sin 
Is it such a sin though? One hand is sailing 
One hand is sailing 
One hand is sailing 
One hand is sailing 
One hand is sailing 
One hand is sailing
