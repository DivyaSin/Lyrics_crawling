Kill yourself all by yourself 
Your eyes cried dry and you've gained nothing 
Hearts in shreds your own knife 
Refuse to escape your self made torture 
Alone by yourself only hurts if you need someone 
To need truly need anothers touch can lead you into... 
And I'm sorry, if my momentary lapse just caused you one more thing 
And knowing what I've done can tug a fraying tear 
Like thread slipping through my fingers and that's not much to show for pain 
Endured 
But in the end you'll learn its worth 
Alone by yourself only hurts if you need someone 
To need truly need anothers touch can lead you into hell 
Longing, desire, burning inside her 
Crawling in darkness, only a glimmer of hope as she yelled these words. 
I'll face my pain 
On my own - standing strong 
Prove for myself.
