Something always brings me back to you 
It never takes too long 
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 
'Till the moment I'm gone You hold me without touch 
You keep me without chains 
I never wanted anything so much 
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain Set me free, leave me be 
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity 
Here I am and I stand so tall 
Just the way I'm supposed to be 
But you're on to me and all over me I live here on my knees as I try to make you see 
That you're everything I think I need here on the ground But you're neither friend nor foe though 
I can't seem to let you go 
The one thing that I still know is 
That you're keeping me down Set me free, leave me be 
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity 
Here I am as I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be 
But you're on to me and all over me Something always brings me back to you 
It never takes too long
