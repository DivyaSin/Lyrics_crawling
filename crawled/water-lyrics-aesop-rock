The water ain't safe, the land's made of water 
I hug a half empty glass my dignity's trying to pawn her 
I'm trying to see the future in a tea cup and a saucer 
But I rather be drinking coffee with my cigarette foster 
And a run away buckle the cloud-nine fantasy filter to force the 
brutal truth 
Of daily market place wars through the roof 
I mean I stood beneath the icicles that bleed under the awning 
And magically mastered the great absorbing of spirit falling 
But I'm sick, I've plowed these fields a thousand times over 
Sold botanical research studies to farmers with whole quotas 
And when science proposes to art besides that peaceful sea 
I'll be that cat with a ring on a pillow shouting finally 
Take a number, the apple seeds rained upon each slumber 
A hundred thousand freaks on parade for the village hunter 
My every whim acted upon has gone loopy 
But I play a game called lets prepare barnacle city for the end-all noosings 
I split the radius at go-getter bellies, reconnaissance 
Seeping fossil genie bottle optimist freeze 
Run for the fountain but the fountain is a desert optical 
tease 
Tummy full of sand running man impossible stop 
There's a wing in my gut and i'm all dust 
Surf in the urban Iditarod certainly flushed 
Now one in the hands worth two atop the tallest cedar 
But what lies inside my heart is off the mother f**king meter [Chorus] 
See the Water ain't safe no more 
'I'm just trying to build myself to act as a truly better man 
damn' 
See the water ain't safe no more 
'Nah nah the water ain't safe no more' 
I'm just trying to be a solid oak tree for every child to carve 
its name across 
'The water ain't safe no more' 
I'm just trying to be the dream of ever peasant the hurricane 
can offer 
'I'm just trying to be some body I can talk to in the morning 
with a smile' 
The Water ain't safe no more.. [Verse Two] And I've always been a 40 night chronologic hostage 
Rusted hook in the lip of the monarch 
Wingless Anime 
I don't play in the man race cycle 
Hope floater 
Gloating inside carnal indifference till doom cops are slight 
and 
potent quotas 
I'm 20 something pumping acrylic tomorrow side ways 
Blazing passage with a map tattooed on the back of the classless 
Now tip toe across a lost cause 
Because a lost cause found 
Don't mean you found a cause 
That means you found a lost cause 
Ok now ive been here for role playing 
Slaying my here and now 
To benefit consumption for my peers steering the plow 
And its incredible 
Handy jackets turn numerals to sentinels 
But bad apples ain't sweet and cretins ain't that memorable 
I'm Mozart with a focus on the tide 
Hiding the inconsistencies of man behind water and wine 
I wear a tiger stripped ego and bivouac my progression 
With a kingliness formulated through the flesh of the oppressors 
God had a flask I can prove it 
You really think the 13 loops that loose daughter 
spawned me a sober unit, check potion 
Addressed the ghost inside my TV with a ruler 
At hear to the back bone stone pusher 
Here ten thousand hackers deep in a movement 
That's 20,000 crucial ruby heels clicking in unison 
It's beautiful, truly beautiful 
I keep a stick inside my hand 
and carve my name inside every wall of the falling hologram
