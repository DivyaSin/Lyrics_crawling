We passed through like a nightmare falling down, 
Without touching the ground. 
This ghost and vacant eyes deceive thee, they've come to take me without words and silence. 
With a hand now crushing hope this late kiss, You've come to make this my last night home. 
I promised everything. 
The necklace and those things you made will go with me everwhere I go. 
Well, it's not the end. I won't pretend it's impossible to fix what can't be broke. 
I'm breathless and disconnected. 
Take me home, so far away from here. 
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. Take my breath away, wake me up today, 
I will return for you. 
Now I've seen the world through eyes of bitter hate and lies and now I can't stand what I have become. Was there something I missed? 
Can you replay this kiss? 
And the ghost sought by my side. 
I'm breathless and disconnected. Take me home, so far away from here. 
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. 
Take my breath away, wake me up today, 
I will return for youTake me home, so far away from here. Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. 
Take my breath away, wake me up today, 
I will return for you. 
I won't forget those times we spent, Cutting our silhouette, 
Waking up nights again. 
I am afraid because I'm open and undone. 
I won't (I wont) forget (forget) those things you said, A stab to the heart and head, 
Killing without an end. 
I am afraid because I'm open and undone. 
Take me home, so far away from here. Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. 
Take my breath away, wake me up today, 
I will return for youTake me home, so far away from here. 
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year. Take my breath away, wake me up today, 
I will return for you.
