One Sunday morning. 
In San Francisco 
I drove across the Golden Gate 
There I got the hope to carry on. One Sunday morning. 
In San Francisco 
I drove across the Golden Gate 
There I got the hope to move on. What does it profit a man 
If he gain the whole world One Sunday morning. 
In San Francisco 
I drove across the Golden Gate 
There I got the hope to carry on.
