The library has a swimming pool 
Got an allergy to following rules 
We're headed for a huge collision, with an interstellar physician 
He's the type of man you wait for 
Timeless quips and witty rapport Headed for a huge collision, with an interstellar physician 
Cause "bow ties are cool" he said 
Suspend your disbelief 
Come fly with me 
Because "bow ties are cool" he said 
All of space and time 
It could be mine Sontarans and cybermen 
Somehow the daleks are back again 
We're headed for a huge collision, with an interstellar physician 
He's got the TARDIS, sonic screwdriver 
He'll regenerate the world 
He's a survivor 
Headed for a huge collision, with an interstellar physician Cause "bow ties are cool" he said 
Suspend your disbelief, 
Come fly with me 
Because "bow ties are cool" he said 
All of space and time, 
It could be mine His hopefulness is deadlock sealed 
He's a madman with a box 
He makes it right, 
He makes it real 
Whooooaaaaa We're headed for a huge collision, with an interstellar physician 
"Bow ties are cool" he said 
Suspend your disbelief 
Come fly with me 
Because bow ties are cool 
All of space and time 
It could be mine
