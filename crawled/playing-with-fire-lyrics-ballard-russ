Baby when I think about it, then I thought we had it made 
Like a fool I let you play two timer, but I'd be a bigger fool if I stayed 
Now I don't come running, hey girl ain't it strange 
I'm thunder, I'm lightning, ''cause I made the change 
You don't believe it, ''cause I ain't the same, oh girl can't you see - you're [Chorus] 
Playing with fire, playing with fire, when you play with me 
But I won't play your mind games, girl count me out, walk away from me 
Don't touch, you'll burn your hand, you still don't understand 
You're playing with fire Baby you see that in my heart, the smoke has turned to flame 
The pain it was lost in the fire, now I won't break at the sound of your name 
Now you cry, say will we love again 
I guess that could be girl, but I don't know when 
All I know is baby 'til then, that's how it's got to be [Chorus: x 2]
