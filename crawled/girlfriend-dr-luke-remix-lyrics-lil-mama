I want to be your girlfriend. You're so fine, 
I want you; mine, 
You're so delicious, 
I think about you all the time, 
You're so addictive, 
Don't you know what I can do, 
To make you feel alright? 
Don't pretend, I think you know, 
I'm damn precious, 
And hell yea, 
I'm the motherfuckin' Princess, 
I can tell you like me too, 
And you know I'm right. She's like "So, whatever", 
You could do so much better, 
I think we should get together now,

I know you think of me, 
I know you talk about me all the time, 
Again and again, 
So come over here, 
And tell me what I wanna hear, 
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear, 
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again (again and again and again). Cause
