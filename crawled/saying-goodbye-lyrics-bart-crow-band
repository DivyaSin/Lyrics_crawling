I've been searching for some connection 
To put a finger on the way you think 
And I've been looking out in every direction 
It keeps feeling like my heart's gonna break So I'm saying goodbye 
No tears I cry for you 
I've done all I can 
I've been a good man for you 
But your heart's cold as ice 
And mine's payin the price for loving you 
So baby I'm saying we're through 
We're through Like it or not hey baby I'm saying we're through At the party on the night I met you 
You smiled and told me I could drive you home 
And then you kissed me in the corner of your doorway 
Should have known it would never last long 
You spent some time out in San Fransisco 
Thought the ocean was a nice getaway 
And then you left me in the corner of the diner 
Well we were both supposed to meet that day So I'm saying goodbye 
No tears I cry for you 
I've done all I can 
I've been a good man for you 
But your heart's cold as ice 
And mine's payin' the price for loving you 
So baby I'm saying we're through 
We're through Yeah Like it or not hey baby I'm saying we're through Don't wanna hear about your hard luck stories 
Or wanna hear where your life went wrong 
'Cause you've been living for your morning glories 
And nothing for nothing is what you did all along So I'm saying goodbye 
No tears I cry for you 
I've done all I can 
I've been a good man for you 
But you're heart's cold as ice 
And mine's payin' the price for ever loving you Yeah I've done all I can 
I've been a good man for you 
But you're heart's cold as ice 
And mine's payin' the price for ever loving you 
So baby we're though
