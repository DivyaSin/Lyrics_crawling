I never did time, committed mad crime 
Only paid rhymes but now niggaz drop dimes 
Harmonizin' on a homicide rap 
Singin' in the precinct, tryin' to catch an R&B contract Now they hit me with a one, two, three, personally 
Conspiracy, it don't mean shit to me 
The time will go fast because I'm true blue 
On the D L, back home, I got a stash for ma duke I stack razorblades in my shoe 
Niggaz threaten to kill the AK if I ever come through 
And I'm doin' 30 more days in this steel cage 
Locked down with men that go both ways But gays ain't gon' grease me 
My razor blade say OPP, niggaz in PC gon' know me 
I'm not the everyday herb 
Actions speak louder than words, so step to the verb Fuck a pronoun, I get down for my crown 
Pass the three pound, show it to King Clown 
And watch him lounge, you know the whole phase 
I'm about to go through the government's maze 
In about 30 days You know my name, no shame in my game 
Best to fly the kid champagne from Spain 
About to go in to push a bid for wrongs I done did 
Goin' away, party at the crib Me and my friends gonna get together 
I didn't think jail could ever, I learned to never say never 
But now we just gonna party, party 
Shit, fiesta, forever Gun [unverified] up on my floor 
All my peeps know they got to keep they damn guns at the door 
Don't wanna get hit with a bullet, meanin' a year time in jail 
If you can't, comprehend with the slang friend All you do, don't act like nuts 
It don't make no sense for the whole crew to get locked up 
Bad enough I have to go in, yo 
But when the shit hit the fan, debris' gotta blow Windy days but ain't nothin' changed but the weather 
While I'm locked down, the thugs'll write me no love letters 
That's for queers, couple of years later, gator But hold all them crocodile tears because it ain't like I'm dyin' 
You see I'm not marked for death, so stop the blood clot cryin' 
This ain't The Wizard of Oz where I can tap my heels and go for it 
I take it slow 'cause I'll be home before you know it 
I'm comin' through like X-rays in approximately the next 30 days But if you think I'm tryin' to skip town 
You best to purchase a hearin' aid and ask yourself how that sound 
I'm not tryin' to jump bail 'cause that's the dough 
That I'ma use to flip up the new connects that I meet in jail Politicians, they all know this 
Every now and then they visit a snitch who helped 'em get rich 
Yeah, part of the government's plan 
Lock down the man who stack grands 
Put him in the hand of Uncle Sam This the stuff, you can't trust for 30 days 
I'm on a bus with niggaz that fuss over tight handcuffs 
And while I'm inside, I take in stride 
Livin' in prison, stool pigeons know that time don't fly Days go by, night gets darker but I'm a New York 
Whalin' on your ass like Orca 
Not the Avon Lady, stay up out my face 
It only take a shoelace, for a nigga to catch a new case You get done in different ways 
I'm headed for the cage
