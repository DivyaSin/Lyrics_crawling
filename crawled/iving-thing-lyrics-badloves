In the cool evening breeze 
Sweet perfume of burning leaves 
An easy feeling has come to be 
I let it wash all over me 
Feel's like there's something going on 
It's just a living thing 
The moment you let it under your skin 
You've got that living thing 
Oh won't you let it in 
Love comes on like a dream 
Rocket fuel for soft machines 
We have no secrets, no disguise 
And there before our very eyes 
See that there's something going on 
It's just a living thing 
The moment you let it under your skin 
You've got that living thing 
You got to let it in 
It took a little time to grow 
But honey, it was worth the waiting 
And now I know 
And I know that there's something going on 
You got that living thing 
The moment you let it under your skin 
You've got that living thing 
Don't know how it started 
See'est la vie 
She's got that living thing 
The moment you let it all begin 
You feel that living thing 
You got to let it in 
But it's alright 
She drives a soft machine 
And she rides like a dream
