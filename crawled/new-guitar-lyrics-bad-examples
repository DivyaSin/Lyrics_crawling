She paints her room in polkadots 
How does she get to sleep? 
And if I never see for myself 
Me and my new guitar are alright 
Me and my new guitar are alright 
That guy on the TV news 
Will never talk about me 
But then everyone he shows is unhappy 
And me and my new guitar are alright 
Me and my new guitar are alright 
Would Sartre have been more happy in an existential rock and roll band? 
Just show him the knob for the fuzz-tone and turn on the amp 
Me, Im no philosopher, just trying to figure this thing out 
How to make this girl Im in love with jump and shout 
Me and my new guitar are alright 
Me and my new guitar are alright 
And if I fly to the moon 
Living in a lunar colony 
I might just paint my room in polka-dots 
Me and my new guitar are alright 
Me and my new guitar 
Me and my new guitar are alright tonight 
Me and my new guitar are alright
