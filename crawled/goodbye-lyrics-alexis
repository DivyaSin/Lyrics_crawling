I've been sitting here for hours 
Trying to figure out 
How I got here with you 
See I know that when it started 
It was fun but somehow our feelings grew 
And its hard to let go even though I know I should 
Cause it feels like your heart belongs to someone else And I don't wanna fight 
I don't wanna cry 
But I'm so tired of your lying 
You don't want me to go 
And baby I don't want to 
But I think it's something that I must do And we try to break it off 
Maybe for a week or two 
Then call each other 
I miss you 
It's a senseless thing 
And I just don't understand why we just can't let it go (Let it go) 
You push and I pull 
And we get nowhere 
Tell me whats the use of holding on And I don't wanna fight 
I don't wanna cry 
But I'm so tired of your lying 
You don't want me to go 
And baby I don't want to 
But I think it's something that I must do And maybe someday we can be together 
Somehow someway 
Cause I know I love you 
But right now 
Your breaking my heart 
And I can take it no more 
I gotta say goodbye to you And I don't know where this road may go 
But boy you gotta make a choice 
I just can't keep holding on 
Tell me what you gonna do 
Ohhhhhhhhhh 
uh ohhh (And I don't wanna fight) 
And I don't wanna fight 
I don't wanna cry 
But I'm so tired of your lying 
You don't want me to go 
and baby I don't want to (I don't wanna I don't wanna) 
but I think it's something that I must do And maybe someday we can be together (Baby Baby) 
Somehow someway 
Cause I know I love you (Yeah) 
But right now 
Your breaking my heart (Your breaking my heart) 
And I can take it no more 
I gotta say goodbye to you And I don't wanna fight (Don't wanna fight) 
I don't wanna cry 
But I'm so tired of your lying And I don't wanna fight 
I don't wanna cry And you don't want me to go 
And baby I don't want to
