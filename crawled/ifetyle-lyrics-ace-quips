{Verse 1} I want a new formula potion number 9 
1 Anit mixing my liquor drink it straight every time 
It Anit good for my liver at this point I'm feeling fine 
I Anit stressing nothing steady sticking on my grind 
natural progression not the Same man as last year 
No longer saving face I'm taking off the mask here 
Not from the same cloth they cotton while I'm kajmir 
N you can count on that not to change no cashier 
Cant you tell my thoughts are a bit more reciprocal 
Extra inverted individual wit residuals 
Based off of principals of not living miserable 
Got to stay ahead of the curve cuz life is difficult 
It's hard to stay a float trending mistakes of the past 
Thats why in life I take what I want and don't ask 
Making my own reality I'm on that 
N im Never slowing down why cuz life's fast {CHORUS x2} (ey ey) I want a different Lifestyle 
(ey ey) A whole different Lifestyle Chillin with different women on different nights out 
Aint worried about no money just living your life out (ey ey) I want a different Lifestyle 
(ey ey) Who wouldn't want this Lifestyle Chillin with different women on different night out 
Aint worried about no money just living your life out {Verse 2} I could never get enough I'm in the fast lane 
You should be able to tell by my government last name 
I always want (Moore) I fell in love wit the cash game 
Addicting to living good allergic to past days 
Of being broke I'm never going back to ends meat 
persistent grind gon get me mill eventually 
Wit presidential suites and girls that do it like lewinki 
Truck loads Of money on delivery call it Penske 
(Ya) i won't it all not just to stunt 
Just so I Anit got to live month to month 
Hate this hand foot I could give a standard book 
Throughout my early 20s on how i stand an shook 
Obstacles it possible to get here 
So can't nobody tell me I Anit shit here 
I fighting past devils man I gotta be careful 
Goin to keep going till I'm on the next level {CHORUS x2} (ey ey) I want a different Lifestyle 
(ey ey) A whole different Lifestyle Chillin with different women on different nights out 
Aint worried about no money just living your life out (ey ey) I want a different Lifestyle
