I just kept hoping, I just kept hoping 
The way would become clear 
I spent all this time tryna play now 
I found my way here See, I've been having me a real hard time 
But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright So I just kept dreaming, yeah, I just kept dreaming 
It wasn't very hard 
I spent all this time tryna figure out why 
Nobody on my side See, I've been having me a real good time 
But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright So please don't take my feelings 
I have found a name 
So please don't take my feelings 
I have found a name 
Yeah, if I wanted to, I'd be alright So I just kept going, I just kept going 
And hoping I'm growing in 
Well this good I've found, I spent all this time 
Tryna find my way here And I've been having me a real fun time 
But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright Please don't take this feeling 
I have found a name 
Please don't take my feelings 
I have found a name 
If I wanted to, I'd be alright 
Yeah, if I wanted to, I'd be alright
