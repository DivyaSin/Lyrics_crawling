Wake up baby it?s time to leave, 
We?ve got plans and we?ve got dreams, we?ve got a long way to go. 
Pack up all of your emotions, all your faith and devotion. 
We?re gonna need it this I know. 
If you?re at the edge of the past, our futures unfolding fast. 
Baby, don?t look back. (Chorus) 
We?re going to a new frontier, wide open without fear. 
I?ll walk this winding road with you into the great unknown. 
We?re going to a new frontier 
Let?s trust our love will lead us right where we belong. 
Walk on. I can?t wait to get out of here, 
The wind is up and the path is clear for the first time in my life. 
Our destination don?t concern me, more and more I?m longing. 
It?s the journey; it?s the ride. 
Everything is within our grasp, 
If we have the courage to ask and we don?t look back. (Chorus) 
We?re going to a new frontier, wide open without fear. 
I?ll walk this winding road with you into the great unknown. 
We?re going to a new frontier 
Let?s trust our love will lead us right where we belong. 
And walk on. I know there?s no confusion where my heart is moving. 
I know it?s true, I know it?s true. (Chorus) 
We?re going to a new frontier, wide open without fear. 
I?ll walk this winding road with you into the great unknown. 
We?re going to a new frontier 
let?s trust our love will lead us right where we belong. 
And walk on.
