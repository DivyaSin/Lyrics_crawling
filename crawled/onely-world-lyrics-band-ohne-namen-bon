lyrics: G. Gross, C. Capek 
music: G. Gross, C. Capek, G. Raschke What if life was one of those things that we all dream of, 
That we could go where we want and we could chose whom we love, 
No money to worry about, 'cause every one is the same, 
You can't speak your mind, but then it's all just a game. What if freedom was in the fact that we'd all be friends, 
That we'd be happy all day and all hold hands, 
You wouldn't be thinkin' your own thoughts, but then again, who cares 
I you've got one love and one life to share In this world (and if it all came true) 
In this brave new world (what would life be like) 
This world (and if it all came true) 
This lonely world Refrain: 
It's a lonely world, it's a lonely world 
And we are living it, and we are living it ... What if your job would make you happy every second of each day, 
You wouldn't be doing what you chose, but then you're happy anyway, 
There wasn't a freedom of speech, hey, but that's okay, 
'Cause it's all just right, when you learn to obey. Now what if all these things that we just mentioned were true, 
Now would you still be the same and would you still be you, 
Not thinkin' about the future and not thinkin' about the past, 
But you know it's all right, as long as this life lasts In this world (and if it all came true) 
In this brave new world (what would life be like) 
This world (and if it all came true) 
This lonely world Refrain
