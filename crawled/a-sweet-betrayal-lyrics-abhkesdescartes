I think of you, like nothing else 
Piling up my life with sweet remembrance 
The doses I take of you yesterday 
Fall short of one today 
Where will this make me sail 
Where will this make me sail 
With, 
A sweet betrayal in the love of Juliet 
A sweet betrayal in the love of Juliet And to get you back, I tried it all 
But needed to dream and that was lethal 
I killed the star in the moonlight shades 
I asked the GOD why she left 
(And he told me ,"boy 
You're long ago dead 
It's the memories made that can't be erased) 
Where will this make me sail 
Where will this make me sail 
With, 
A sweet betrayal in the love of Juliet 
A sweet betrayal in the love of Juliet
