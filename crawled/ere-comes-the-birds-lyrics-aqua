Sometimes all right things happen, 
and only deep shit moving me, yeah all right 
Sometimes all good guys see me, 
Your feeling love in the air, oh yeah 
all right 
Come on with me to the forest of love, 
to a very nicer place, you can`t run 
But if you try to be sorry in the top of the trees, 
you need us, below 
Here comes the birds, 
(shake it, oh) 
here comes the beach 
(work it on out, yeah) 
I`m in love, what wonderful words, 
Here comes the birds 
(hey, all right) 
Here comes the birds 
(hey, all right) 
I`m in love, what wonderful words, 
Here comes the birds 
Sometimes... 
Bridge: Come on with me to the forest of love... 
Chorus: Here comes the birds... 
Get out of the trees, 
just go out and get it 
Do what you`re do 
you wont regret it 
ooooh (repeat) 
(hey, all right) 
(hey, all right) 
(hey, all right) 
(hey, all right) 
Chorus: Here comes the birds...
