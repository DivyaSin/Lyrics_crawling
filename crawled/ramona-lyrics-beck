There's nothing left to hide; 
You can see it in my eyes. 
Oh I've tried, to be who I thought you wanted. And if it's all a lie, 
The truth's not far behind. 
We could try to live right... follow the moment. Ramona! 
Ramona... Oh, oh. 
Ramona. If only I had known, 
It's less than what I felt, 
Why should I have nothing to fear for? Ramona... 
Ramona... Oh, oh. 
Ramona. Ramona! Oh oh, 
Ramona! Oh my, 
Ramona! Ramona! 
Ramona! Oh, 
Ramona!
