If I could have chosen where God would hide his heaven 
I'd wish for it to be the salt and swell of the ocean 
Carried by the currents to all continents' shores 
Reaching into the depths where the sun's light is never shown 
Mixed with algae and coral, breathed in by sharks and dolphins 
Sailed by tanker ships, private yachts, swam in by tourists 
Working its way up through inlets, lakes, and rivers 
Swamps, and estuaries, down through limestone into the aquifer Purified by the county, pumped through pipes and out faucets 
Filled into a glass to meet the thirst of our children And if I could have chosen, I would have been born a woman 
My mother once told me she would have named me Laura 
I'd grow up to be strong and beautiful like her 
One day, I'd find an honest man to make my husband 
We would have two children, build our home on the Gulf of Mexico 
Our family would spend hot summer days at the beach together 
The sun would kiss our skin as we played in the sand and water 
And we would know we loved each other without having to say it At night, we would sleep with the windows of our house left open 
Letting the cool ocean air soothe the sunburned shoulders of our children
