The times that we had yeah they were memorable 
And yeah the chance of us together was improbable 
but I took a chance for you and everything that Ive done 
Was for you to be happy 
I wanted to be your only one 
I remember wed talk every night 
Loving every millisecond yeah I knew this was right 
We talked about being perfect in this cold dark world 
But now your truth is finally told 
Ohhh oh I asked if you were sure 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh well I guess you didnt want it anymore 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh I kinda had a feeling that in the end 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh That youd chose to just be my friend 
Just to be my friend 
Hope that you still care and that you still think about me 
You know I think of you every night in my dreams 
I really didnt mean to make things end up like this 
And now Im sitting here still in the cold lonely mist 
Ohhh oh I asked if you were sure 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh well I guess you didnt want it anymore 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh I kinda had a feeling that in the end 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh youd chose to just be my friend 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh You just say that you care 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh I remember all that we share 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh Stuck in 100 problems 
Ohhh Ohhh Didnt have to end up this way 
No it didnt have to end up this way 
Ohhh oh Ohhh oh Ohhhh oh
