The streets are filled with Christmas cheer 
At least it's only once a year 
Perfect parcels tied with perfect bows 
And carols ringing in my ear 
Bundled up against the cold 
Lines wherever gifts are sold 
Each shop window displays a Christmas scene 
For everybody young and old 
Icicles on eavesdrops and tinsel on the trees 
But it's a green Christmas for me Couples skating on the pond (couples skating on the pond) 
Making angels on the lawn (making angels on the lawn) 
Five red mittens drying on the rack 
And needle-shedding tannenbaums 
Red bows on the railings 
And snowflakes on the ground 
But it's a green Christmas in this town Green 
Cause of everything I miss 
All this mistletoe, no kiss 
And with every Christmas wish 
There would be no greater gift 
Than to have this envy lift Carolers are at my door 
Don't want to hear them anymore 
Stockings on the mantle 
It snows here everyday 
But it's a green Christmas anyway
