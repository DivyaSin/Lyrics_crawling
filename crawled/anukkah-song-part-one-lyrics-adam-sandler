Put on your yamaca 
It's time for Hanukkah 
So much fun-uka 
To celebrate Hanukkah 
Hanukka is, the festival of lights 
Instead of one day of presents 
We get eight crazy nights 
When you fell like the only kid in town 
Without a Christmas tree 
Here's a list of people who are Jewish 
Just like you and me 
David Lee Roth lights the menorah 
So does James Caan, Kirk Douglas and the late Dina 
Shora 
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli 
Bowser from Sha NaNa and Arthur Fonzerelli. 
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half, too. 
Put them together, what a fine looking Jew 
You don't need deck the halls or Jingle Bell Rock 
''cause you can spin a dreidl with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock 
Both Jewish! 
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew 
But guess who is, Hall of Famer Rod Carew 
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby 
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish 
Not too shabby 
Some people think that Ebenezer Scrogge is 
Well he's not, but guess who is 
All three stooges 
So many Jews are in show biz 
Tom Cruise isnt, but I heard his agent is 
Tell your friend Veronica 
It's time to celebrat Hanukkah 
Don't forget harmonica 
On this lovely, lovely Hanukkah 
So drink your gin and tonic-a 
And smoke your maraijuana-ca 
If you really, really, really, really wanna-ka 
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy, Hannukah 
Happy Hanukkah
