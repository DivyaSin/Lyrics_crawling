Jesus, what a crowd 
Nervous? 
Just a bit 
Kid, look who you are 
The headline act 
A major star 
You're already a hit 
Got a match? 
Wonder what he'll think 
The boss? 
Ha, if he's even here 
Honey, please, he's here 
And in just two days 
He'll be there tossing you bouquets 
At our gala premiere 
Picture it 
The cream of Manhattan 
Celebrities, millionaires 
Watching you 
I'll be waiting in the wing 
Wound up tighter than a spring 
As the house begins to dim 
And I'll practice every line 
Hoping desperately to shine 
Shining only for him 
Just imagine how they'll cheer 
At the moment you appear 
Stepping out before the scrim 
Let them whoop and let them call 
I won't hear the crowd at all 
No, it's only for him 
Tell me how I look 
Fine 
Just fine? 
What about my hair? 
Beautiful 
You swear? 
Trust me, once the boss sees 
How you put that song across 
Hell, he ain't got a prayer 
Oh, you mean it? 
You'll stand proud into the light 
Looking lovely 
Burning bright 
All vitality and vive 
Aha, and I'll rapturously float 
Through the melody he wrote 
Singing only for him 
And before the music dies 
Up, the audience will rise 
Nearly bursting at the brim 
And you'll stand there in the glow 
And perhaps, at last he'll know 
Girls, hurry up, we're on 
Where is she? 
Look 
(The center) 
Just look at the poster 
(There, the ooh-la-la girl) 
Welcome, each and everyone 
To our furvalent of fun 
A buffet of bally-who 
It's where Coney comes to play 
And it's opening today 
And it's only for you 
And you 
And you 
And you 
Entertainment day and night 
Sure to dazzle and delight 
And of course we'll be there too 
Yooh 
We're so happy that you're here 
For this season's big premiere 
And it's only for you 
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Megan Giri 
The ooh-la-la girl 
Five shows daily only here at Phantasma 
And now the aerial [Incomprehensible] 
Of the fabulous Miss Fleck 
[Incomprehensible] 
How was I? 
Tell me 
Meg, you were just perfect 
And I say that not only as your mother but as your producer 
Was he watching? 
I'm sure he was, I'm sure he'll have much to say 
About how much you've progressed 
By the way, it seems you have an admirer, a certain Mr.Thompson 
Is he important?
