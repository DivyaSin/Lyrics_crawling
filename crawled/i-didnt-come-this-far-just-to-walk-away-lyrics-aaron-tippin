I made five hundred miles in six hours flat 
Trying to make up for lost time 
I been beatin' a path to your mama's door 
To set things between us right 
Between the hands of fate and a lot of hard luck 
This ain't been no gravy train 
And I didn't come this far just to walk away I slung a rod just east of Memphis 
And that heap of a truck shut down 
So for nine cold hours I thumbed my way 
Straight to the guitar town 
And the last twelve miles to your mama's house 
I hiked through the pouring rain 
And I didn't come this far just to walk away I could have turned around a thousand times 
And went back to where I'm from 
But I'd go an extra million miles 
If I could save what's left of us 
Oh, it was a burning love that drove me here 
And girl I hope and pray 
That I didn't come this far just to walk away I know that this front door ain't the only thing 
That stands between you and me 
All the things that I've said, and the wrong that I've done 
Ain't undone easily 
But I'm gonna prove my love to you 
No matter what it takes 
'Cause I didn't come this far just to walk away Oh, I could have turned around a thousand times 
And went back to where I'm from 
But I'd go an extra million miles 
If I could save what's left of us 
Oh, it was a burning love that drove me here 
And girl I hope and pray 
That I didn't come this far just to walk away Oh, I didn't come this far just to walk away
