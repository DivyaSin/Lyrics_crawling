Why'd you have to go little girl 
and leave me alone 
I've got no where to go little girl 
I'm left all alone 
So if i see you hangin around 
I'll look to the sky 
But don't come upon my door 
I think I'll CRY!! [Chorus:] 
I loved you, this is true 
I loved you, this is true I can't take this shit no more 
I'm about to die 
So if i see you little girl 
Don't no I'll cry 
Hey baba! Ya i need ya 
so don't go no wait no huh wait what what AHHH [Chorus] Why'd you have to go 
I'm on my knees baba 
Why'd you have to go 
Got nobody to depend on 
Why'd you have to go 
And now i am left with the chairs in the room and the doors 
Why'd you have to go [Chorus]
