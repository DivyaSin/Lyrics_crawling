You shun me out 
you locked me in 
Make me go crazy 
like a summers wind Rake up the leaves 
sound of the wind 
Dead of the night 
i'm falling thin. Let me take you 
to another relioum 
Let me wake you from the 
sleep your in Let me take you home 
let me see the light 
Let me here the sounds 
of the wind whispers nile Let me take you 
to another relioum 
Let me wake you from the 
sleep you're stuck in. Dangers of wreakage falling 
on me 
Bones that are broken just 
tearing my skin You're hearing the remix 
of a song that came on (oh,oh) 
This aint the Re-Up 
dont get it mix up Oh oh Oh oh 
oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh Oh oh 
oh oh oh oh oh oh Let me take you 
just take you away 
Let me take you (Take You) 
to another day. Let me take (Away) 
Let me take (The Day) 
Let me take (Your Heart) Let me take you 
away
