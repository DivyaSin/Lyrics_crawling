Christmas is just around the corner 
Christmas you feel it in the air 
Better write all your letters to Santa 
There's shopping and wrapping to do 
I bet you'll never believe it 
When you see what I got you 
You're gonna love it Christmas is just around the corner 
Candles are glowing everywhere 
Can't wait until that night reindeer appear 
Christmas and it's just about here Christmas is just around the corner 
Christmas you feel it in the air 
All the trees are surrounded with presents 
The stockings are filling up too 
I'll bet you'll never believe it 
When you see what I got you 
What did you get me? Christmas is just around the corner 
Sleigh bells are ringing in the sled 
Too bad December comes just once a year 
Christmas time to trim the tree 
Christmas can it really be 
Christmas yes it's finally here
