She steals the ripened fruit off my tree 
Love slowly withers on the vine 
Jasmine's in bloom 
I know that you will soon be gone 
The only woman I know 
To hurt me so 
And the flowers will grow 
In my garden 
She left her lipstick and her stale perfume 
I left a note upon the wall (it said) 
Be sure of what you've got 
Cause girl you're not 
The only woman I know 
To hurt me so 
And other flowers will grow 
In my garden 
You're not the only woman I know 
To hurt me so 
And other flowers will grow 
In my garden 
In my garden 
In my garden the wild magnolia grows 
And there's a rose in the window 
Where a lover's heart is snared on a jealous thorn 
With the change of the seasons 
I let you slip from my hand, now I know 
Love is pain 
Pain is truth 
And the truth is it's over and done 
The only woman I know 
To hurt me so 
And other flowers will grow 
In my garden 
In my garden 
In my garden 
In my garden
