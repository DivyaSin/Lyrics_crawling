Here I am again 
Wondering if you're okay 
Can't stop this troubled heart 
'Cause we're apart, miles away 
Phone pressed up to my ear 
Wish you were here, holding me 
A face to go with your sweet voice 
Will bring me joy, totally Chorus: I know I can't be there 
Baby it's alright 
I'll be waiting for you tonight 
I pray that you'll be there 
When I close my eyes 
Meet me in my dreams tonight One thing that never changes 
No matter what 
I can't wait to see you 
Can't wait to feel you 
And there's a place of ours, where we can go 
Nobody knows 
I close my eyes real tight 
And make love to you all night Chorus I wish I may, I wish you might 
Find some time when you sleep tonight 
To think of me and I'll appear before your eyes 
It's my paradise, your world 
You're my heart, my life, my girl 
Oooh, can't wait to go to sleep 
'Cause there's a possibility, you'll meet me Ohh, oh oh oh oh 
Ohh yeah, oh yeah 
I know... Chorus x 2
