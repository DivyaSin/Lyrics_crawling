I can't stop you now 
You just strut hang around 
Drive me insane with what you wear 
Nothing much I do declare 
I've been all up I've been all down 
I hang my head all over town 
I been about all night 
Just got it way deep down inside 
Hey young girl take a look at me now 
I'm a long time loving you 
Smiles that mean delight 
All the thoughts you know are right 
I've been around & I've been down 
Passed away and helped around 
You know it turns me on 
I like the way you do things wrong 
High school in doubt oh no 
I know I'm crazy but I love you so 
Hey young girl take a look at me now 
I'm a long time loving you 
Hey take it easy 
Come get easy do you like what you see
