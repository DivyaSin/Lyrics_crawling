I think it's time that you let go 
At the end of the day I know you know 
But where is my DJ? I know you know 
Our love had faded a long time ago 
Now it's time to move on 
Now go insane I know you know 
The time we had felt like sunshine in our lives 
But now it's time for me to go 
Like this, hit it Are you ready for this? 
But where is my DJ? I think it's time that you let go 
At the end of the day I know you know I know you know 
Our love had faded a long time ago 
Now it's time to move on 
Now go insane I know you know 
The time we had felt like sunshine in our lives 
But now it's time for me to go 
Hit it
