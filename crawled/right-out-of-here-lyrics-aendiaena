summer's gonethe leaves come tumbelin' down 
this picture of you pretend's I'm not alone 
in my restless mind one melody 
it's the song that we sang in ardency 
you know I am the one 
you could come running to 
I wish I could be here 
'cause you're the only one that I want 
back were we started 
so come to rescue my heart 
I send my lovin' 
right out of here call me up 
I know i will survive 
just a fool of lovewish to keep up the fire 
and this fool I am and want to be 
on a bed of nails you're finding me 
you know I am the one you could come running to wish you could be here 
'cause you're the only... summer lovin' always has to end 
'thought it seemed to be 
like heaven sent 
when the one you dearly want is so 
far, far away
