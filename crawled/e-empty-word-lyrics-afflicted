(I have) Realize the meaning of the empty word humanity 
affected with the sight of (an even worse) our insane reality Build up your aggression 
release your frustration 
despite the ignorance 
of our passive lives You keep on complaining 
with an aggressive verbal rage 
reform your mentality 
react with more than words 
you know what they have done 
deeds beyond all measures 
their insanity increases 
I realize that LIFE IS EXTREME Days passed by 
before your TV eyes 
your ignorance 
leave me just frustration #: Daily visions of a forthcoming end 
where reality increases to the extreme 
the world begins to boil over 
awaiting just to cease to be Our heritage, an unfertile world 
diseased by greed and passivity 
the major threat is yourself 
your senseless mind and lack of consciousness
