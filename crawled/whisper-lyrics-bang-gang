I feel so alone 
I feel so cold 
I want to fly 
Take off to the sky 
It's so cold 
It's so cold 
It's so cold There was a chill 
There was a sound 
There was a whisper 
That I found 
It went along 
Searching 
It will return while I stay I feel so alone 
I feel so cold 
I want to fly 
Take off to the sky 
It's so cold 
It's so cold 
It's so cold There was a chill 
There was a sound 
There was a whisper 
That I found 
It went along 
Searching 
It will return while I stay There was a chill 
There was a sound 
There was a whisper 
That I found 
It went along 
Wandering 
It will return while I stay 
Searching There was a chill 
There was a sound 
There was a whisper 
That I found 
It went along 
Searching 
It will return while I stay There was a chill 
There was a sound 
There was a whisper 
That I found 
It went along 
Wandering 
It will return while I stay 
Searching
