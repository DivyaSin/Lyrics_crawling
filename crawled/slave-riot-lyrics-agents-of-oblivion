long ago i kissed her skull 
sunbleached and beautiful 
slick-wet with diesel fuel 
we'll watch the midnight movie 
painted with the sky 
bleeding white butterflies 
after surfacing from the mirror 
(where the rabbits lead us) 
woman shaking death from her hair 
i swear the wind sounded like spirits voicing all the things that tortured them 
(when they were men) 
the fire light was an offering to the god 
that runs through the bark of the trees, i believe 
like the sky above me 
we won't live to see it end 
now lets not pretend 
that it could've been 
(any other way) 
long and slow i kissed her skull 
sunbleached and beautiful 
slick-wet with diesel fuel 
we'll watch the midnight movie 
painted with the sky 
bleeding white butterflies 
older ghosts than you and me 
listen to the whispering 
whisper to the listening 
the old grey ghost and i 
whisper to the listening sky 
by the gods above us 
we won't live to see it end 
now let's not pretend 
that it could've been 
(any other way) 
bleeding white butterflies 
long and slow i kissed her skull
