Lights, camera, action. I remember how 
It happened, young punk rappin. Rhymes in 
My notebook, beats in my dissent. Battles in 
The lunch room, everybody listenin. Cant stop 
I got something to prove. I put it all on the line 
I got nothing to lose. I done paid my dues. And I stand 
By my team, I made a damn lifestyle outta my life stream. 
Its been a long time coming and plenty of hard work 
And you cant take that away. I represent my city 
Through my music, imma take that to the grave. 
Its been a long time coming and plenty of hard work 
And you cant take that away. And when it all falls down and 
Theres nothing left, imma sell those songs and say 
Theres a part inside of me, you can never ever take away 
Say my name. Cuz imma prove that Im here to stay. You 
Know I did it for the love of the game. Cuz I remember 
What it took to get here. Outta time and I still grew up 
here. It aint all about the fame. I did it for the love of the game. 
I did it for the east side, did it for the west side. Did it for the 
Women show my love when I jet by. For the O H I O , o-state. 
Yo, its all love, no hate. I salute you, swear to stay true to 
The town where they taught me to stand till they move 
You. And you know the kush keep my eyes closed. 
I dont need em anyway. Blindfold.

Kells. My stilo, Chuck Taylors and Fritos. Every day is a movie 
You better pick up the TiVo. Me and my entourage but I aint 
Talkin HBO. Fucking, puffing, and stunting, I feel like 
Evil Kanevil. And all of the people that laugh when I said I 
Do it big. All the same hoes comin up to me now sayin 
are you the shit? Anywhere I go now cameras flash 
And please excuse the pics and your girl in my room 
Doing the same so please excuse my dick!
