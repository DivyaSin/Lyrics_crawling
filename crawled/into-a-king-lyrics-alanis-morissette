It started harmless enough 
Animal infatuation 
But something within it prevailed You were a sweet amalgamation 
Of all the parts i have loved 
The hottest slippery slope And out came depth 
And out comes healing 
Out comes friendship unlike any i have known Happy anniversary baby 
You've gone from a prince into a king 
Happy anniversary darling 
I've gone from a maiden to a queen Continued and softened us up 
Our rocks are hewn by this water of love 
And steadfast: our pinky swear And out comes fun 
Out comes relief 
Out comes championing unlike any i have known Happy anniversary baby 
You've gone from a prince into a king 
Happy anniversary darling 
I've gone from a maiden to a queen And how far have we come 
How far we've yet to go 
Til we're gray great grandparents 
Til we're one tiny little wrinkle 
I say i do i do i do Happy anniversary baby 
You've gone from a prince into a king 
Happy anniversary darling 
I've gone from a maiden to a queen And so, we'll traipse from paper through diamonds 
A family tree's genesis 
Our fingers t'wining together And out comes ever 
And out comes alchemy 
And out comes drooling on your chest Happy anniversary baby 
You've gone from a prince into a king 
Happy anniversary darling 
I've gone from a maiden to a queen
