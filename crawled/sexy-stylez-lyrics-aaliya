More than a woman Passion, instant 
Sweat me, feel me 
Cupid's shot me 
My heartbeat's racing 
Tempt me, drive me 
Feels so exciting 
Thought of highly 
It's yours entirely I'll be... 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than your others 
I'll be... 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than enough for you 
Ill be more... 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
Making love under covers 
I'll be more... 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than enough for you Midnight grindin' 
My heartrate's climbin' 
You go, I go 
'cause we share pillows 
Taste me, feed me 
There's still no separating 
Morning massages 
With new bones in your closet I'll be... 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than your others 
I said ill be... 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than enough for you 
Ill be more... 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
Making love under covers 
I'm gonna be more... 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than enough for you I don't think you're ready 
I don't think you're ready 
For this thang 
For this thang 
I don't think you're ready 
For this thang 
You're not ready 
I don't think you're ready 
For this thang 
This thang, this thang 
I don't think you're ready 
For this thang Constant pressures 
No scale can measure 
Secret treasures 
Keeps on getting better 
Do you wanna roll with me? 
We can go to foreign lands 
Your hand in my hand 
Do you wanna ride with me? 
We can be like bonnie & clyde 
Be by your side I'll be... 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than your others 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than enough for you 
I, I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
Making love under covers 
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than enough for you
