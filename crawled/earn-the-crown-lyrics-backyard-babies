Every time I hit the streets I'm fast 
Like a cannonball of gold 
Every day I'm travelin' from the past 
To fulfill a restless soul 
I've been ridin' more than you've been drivin' 
It's like a "must go on wheel's" 
Anyway it can no longer last 
Cause you know yeah you know Take a look at us now, never do turn around 
Turn around, take a look at us now, never 
Do turn around, turn around 
What's with your face? Making us earn the crown, earn the crown. 
Take a look at us now. 
We never do turn I can remember when I was not this way 
Not as bright as I was told 
Can't recall what I said yesterday 
Something 'bout the perfect role 
I've been gamblin' more than you've been playin' 
But I keep head above my heels 
I'm here, but I'm not here to stay Take a look at us now, never do turn around 
Turn around, take a look at us now, never 
Do turn around, turn around 
What's with your face? Making us earn the crown, earn the crown. 
Take a look at us now. 
We never do turn Every song gets better on the road 
Rhythm moving with that sound 
Everyone is getting in the mood 
Makes no difference, town to town 
I've been listening more than you've been hearin' 
Just a little price to pay 
Being lead astray but I'm not sold Take a look at us now, never do turn around 
Turn around, take a look at us now, never 
Do turn around, turn around 
What's with your face? Making us earn the crown, earn the crown. 
Take a look at us now. 
We never do turn
