Everyone minds their own business 
But nobody's watching the store 
Everyone's playing their own game 
But very few know the score 
No replacing the time we're wasting 
So attitudes had better improve 
When the ways of the world make your little light flicker 
Priorities will quickly be moved You're never too safe to feel the fire 
Everyone feels the heat 
You'll never be too safe to feel the fire 
Until your perfection's complete Carnage on the corporate ladder 
Bite and scratch like cats in the night 
The camel's getting fatter and fatter 
The needle's eye is tighter than tight 
I'm not saying you shouldn't be playing 
Everyone has got to pay dues 
But if gaining the world makes your little light flicker 
The winner will eventually loose No time for endless division 
No time for sowing bad seed 
Consider the unfaithful servant 
No time for letting things be 
No replacing the time we're wasting 
So attitudes had better improve 
When the ways of the world make your little light flicker 
Priorities will quickly be moved
