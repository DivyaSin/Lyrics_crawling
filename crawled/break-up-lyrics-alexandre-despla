I crawl out of sight for you, dear 
I melt with the night, i disappear. 
I won't have more fun with you. 
Never get drunk with you. 
I'll let you go for good. I pulled it apart for you, dear. 
I wait for my heart to shift gear. 
I'll never sleep late with you. 
Never get baked with you. 
I let you down for good. I'll never go back to you. 
never shoot swank with you. 
I'll let you go for good.(3X)
