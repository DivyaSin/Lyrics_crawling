Don't know what it is you want from me, babe 
Don't know what song it is I'm supposed to play 
But even though I'm singing out of key, babe 
I mean every single word I say 
In a minor way, in a minor way I know those little words I haven't spoken 
Have driven better men than I insane 
I see no need to fix what isn't broken 
The two of us have such a winning game 
In a minor way, in a minor way In a minor way 
You're nearly always on my mind 
I love you almost all the time 
I absolutely for the most part can say 
In a minor way 
Better would be hard to find 
So tell me that you'll always stay 
In a minor way Subtract reality from expectation 
Subtract a little more from what is left 
Add a bit of me to your equation 
A winning formula for happiness 
In a minor way, in a minor way
