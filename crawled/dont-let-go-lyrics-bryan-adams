I can't believe this moment's come 
It's so incredible that we're alone 
There's so much to be said and done 
It's impossible not to be overcome 
Will you forgive me if I feel this way 
'Cause we've just met - tell me that's OK 
So take this feeling'n make it grow 
Never let it - never let it go (Don't let go of the things you believe in) 
You give me something that I can believe in 
(Don't let go of this moment in time) 
Go of this moment in time 
(Don't let go of things that you're feeling) 
I can't explain the things that I'm feeling 
(Don't let go ) 
No, I won't let go Now would you mind if I bared my soul 
If I came right out and said you're beautiful 
'Cause there's something here I can't explain 
I feel I'm diving into driving rain 
You get my senses running wild 
I can 't resist your sweet, sweet smile 
So take this feeling 'n make it grow 
Never let it - never let it go (Don't let go of the things you believe in) 
You give me something that I can believe in 
(Don't let go of this moment in time) 
Go of this moment in time 
(Don't let go of things that you're feeling) 
I can't explain the things that I'm feeling 
(Don't let go ) 
No, I won't let go
