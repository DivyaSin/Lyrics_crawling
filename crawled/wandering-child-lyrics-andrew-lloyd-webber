Wandering child, so lost, so helpless, yearning for my guidance Angel or father? Friend or phantom? Who is it there, staring? Have you forgotten your Angel? Angel, oh, speak! What endless longings echo in this whisper! Too long you've wandered in winter, far from my fathering gaze Wildly my mind beats against you You resist 
Yet the (your) soul obeys Angel of Music! You denied me, turning from true beauty 
Angel of Music! Do not shun me! Come to your strange Angel! Angel of Music! I denied you, turning from true beauty 
Angel of Music! My protector! Come to me, strange Angel! I am your Angel of Music 
Come to me, Angel of Music No, Christine! Wait! Raoul! Whatever you may believe, this man, this thing is not your father!
