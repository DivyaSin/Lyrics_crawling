I believe in revolution 
I believe in silent power 
Crawled out with the institution 
In the witching hour My dreams 
They can't be all just what I see 
They can't be all just what I live 
They can't be all just another dream 
But I believe I believe in revolution 
I believe in silent power 
Crawled out with the institution 
In the witching hour I see 
That what about was suddenly 
Was just a hidden tragedy 
Stare at the sun inside of me 
I still believe I believe in revolution 
I believe in silent power 
Crawled out with the institution 
In the witching hour (I believe in, I believe in, I believe in, 
I believe in, I believe in, I believe in, 
I believe in, I believe in, I believe in,) But I believe in revolution 
(I believe in, I believe in, I believe in, I believe in) 
I believe in silent power 
(I believe in, I believe in, I believe in, I believe in) 
Crawled out with the institution 
(I believe in, I believe in, I believe in, I believe in) 
In the witching hour 
(I believe in, I believe in, I believe in) I believe in revolution 
I believe in silent power 
Crawled out with the institution 
In the witching hour
