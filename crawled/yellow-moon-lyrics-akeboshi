All day yesterday 
My cellphone's call signal kept going off 
An out-of-tune fuzz guitar 
In a strange park On my motorbike, oblivious 
Overtaking the wind 
The crescent moon is history 
Above me 
The earth is my goal line 
The dogs and the lions 
Are all moving on to Venus 
It's kind of annoying A yellow moon. Keep on counting 
To three, and open your eyes 
Shadow moon 
Still dreaming Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
As we stand with our backs to each other 
Look in my eyes and tell me, yes or no? Every day every night 
I want to tell you right now, with words of love 
About my love for you 
Every day every night 
With an ordinary signal 
I want to tell you about this feeling that's out of control Feeling fine, with you this time 
Holding each other in a golden church Yellow moon 
As the moon wanes in the night sky 
It shines with a serene smile once again tonight Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
As we stand with our backs to each other 
Look in my eyes and tell me, yes or no? Every day every night 
I want to tell you right now, with words of love 
Every day every night 
About my love for you Every day A yellow moon. Keep on counting 
To three, and open your eyes 
Shadow moon 
Still dreaming Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
As we stand with our backs to each other 
Look in my eyes, when will I see you again? Every day every night 
I want to tell you right now, with words of love 
About my love for you 
Every day every night 
With an ordinary signal 
I want to tell you about this feeling that's out of control A magic code change 
In this sleepless town 
A jazz guitar playing a soft minor 
That changes every day
