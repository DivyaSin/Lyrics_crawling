Take this song of freedom 
Put it on & arm yourself for the fight 
Don't let them blind your eyes now 
Or listen to the devil liar Feelings growing getting stronger 
But even now my hands are tied 
I feel restricted I can't cut loose This ball and chain that's round my neck What can I say that's not been said before 
Until there's a better way i'm gonna stay this way Come gather round you people to me 
And listen now to what I say Sticks and stones will get us nowhere 
There's twenty years yet we still don't know What have we learnt is this all we can show 
There must be a better way to end the day We've got to stand now and push on through to the other side 
We must not blind our eyes 
Or listen to the devil liar. Now we're the nation of many colours 
But everybody's blood runs red 
Cut our wrists and bind together 
Too much blood has been spilt in hate Do it now for your children 'cause their lives are yet to come 
Do it now for you own sakes FOR FREEDOM. We've got to stand now and push on through to the other side 
We must not blind our eyes 
Or listen to the devil liar. Do it now for your children 'cause their lives are yet to come 
Do it now for you own sakes FOR FREEDOM. 
FOR FREEDOM. We've got to stand now and push on through to the other side 
We must not blind our eyes 
Or listen to the devi lliar.
