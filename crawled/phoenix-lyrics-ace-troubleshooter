So this is who I become when You leave me to myself 
A burned up, hollow, angry, empty shell 
An actor on a barren stage and even keel with unchanneled rage 
Sinking deeper into hell Bind me to You, pierce me straight through 
Consume me with Your fire 
Ravage my heart, tear me clean apart 
And still be my desire As I descend it starts again sliding down, spiraling 
Gasping on the breath of corruption 
Fighting undertow holding on, realizing 
My own hopeless helplessness finally letting go All is madness as the flames engulf me oblivion 
Refining fire making ashes of this life 
Burn, fire, burn, clean this holy temple 
Restore Your holy name in the onslaught of Your love
