There i stood in the night 
Out on the broken pier 
Me with my feet in the sea 
You with your face in the clouds, 
The man in the moon 
And as i heard your voice, 
Felt your laugh 
Flood across the broken pier 
I wanted to die right then and there You smiled down across the waves 
As if to say to me 
"everything will be okay, 
Be strong and true" 
And i felt your eyes 
Like the tide 
Pulling me out into the air 
For a moment in time 
You held me there, 
Father and son, 
Home again'
