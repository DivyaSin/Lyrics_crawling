I never dreamed his footsteps could ever sound so lonely 
As they did when he left today 
I raised my hand and brushed away your tear as I helplessly stood there 
Watching my world walk away 
I'm leaving forever he said with his eyes but his lips had nothing to say 
I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd be standing in this doorway 
Watching my world walk away [ guitar - steel ] I'm leaving forever... 
I never thought I'd live to see the day... 
Watching my world walk away
