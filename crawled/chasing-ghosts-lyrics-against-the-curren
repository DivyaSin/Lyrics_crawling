We used to have a light, 
Now it's too dark to shine, (Oh...) 
Now we're just passing by, 
Two shipwrecks in the night (Oh...) Remember when we met yeah I know I was mean, 
Stones shirt, black boots, and ripped jeans, 
And you were such a mess and I thought it was sweet, 
That night still haunts my dreams, I won't keep chasing ghosts, 
I need somebody I can hold, 
Gave you my heart and soul, 
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing ghosts 
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing ghosts Blue from the TV light, 
Two bodies intertwined (Oh...) 
I guess we tempted fate, 
Always so far away, (Oh...) Remember when we met yeah I know I was mean, 
Stones shirt, black boots, and ripped jeans, 
And you were such a mess and I thought it was sweet, 
That night still haunts my dreams, I won't keep chasing ghosts, 
I need somebody I can hold, 
Gave you my heart and soul, 
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing ghosts 
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing ghosts Remember when you left yeah I thought I was mean, 
Stones shirt, black boots, and everything, 
Let you fool me twice, shame on me, 
That night still haunts my dreams, I won't keep chasing ghosts, 
I need somebody I can hold, 
Gave you my heart and soul, 
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing ghosts Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing ghosts 
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing ghosts
