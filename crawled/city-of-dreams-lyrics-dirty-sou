Everything seems like a city of dreams, 
I never know why, 
But I still miss you. There she's standing in a field of lights, 
I close my eyes, 
And I still miss you. Oh, oh 
And I still miss you, 
Oh, oh 
And I still miss you. Everything seems like a city of dreams, 
I never know why, 
But I still miss you. There she's standing in a field of lights, 
I close my eyes, 
But I still miss you. Oh, oh 
But I still miss you, 
Oh, oh 
But I still miss you.
