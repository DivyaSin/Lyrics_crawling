It's a lonely road out there we're all just waiting 
For these answers that may never come our way 
So we hold on to each other 
Hoping to find what's missing 
A million more questions by the end of the day So we've been getting all this inside information 
Are you as confused as me or it's all driving you insane 
I throw some money at the problem 
Lose your inhibitions go talk to someone 
It's a million more questions by the end of the day It's who we are 
It's who we are 
It's who we are 
It's who we are We try to get a way out, pray for shade 
Follow what will we find 
Return to sacred ground or the mem'ry of one strange 
Is it a new day? 
Bored? Sounds all too familiar 
A Good excuse for change in pace 
Go forth be a happy clone 
Questions at the end of the day It's who we are 
It's who we are 
It's who we are 
It's who we are Running in circles 
In this once in a lifetime 
I got this 
One last chance 
To ditch this borderline life My place in this world 
Last day I draw breath 
I'm about to collide 
With myself 
With myself 
With myself It'll all get better all we need is time 
Drag yourself out of bed 
Waiting for that change in season 
Praying for a line 
Living in a rainbow 
Or drowning in the gray 
You've filled in all the blanks 
It ain't all that bad 
Questions by the end of the day
