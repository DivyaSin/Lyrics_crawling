I can do anything that he wont do 
Im not your lover

Pull your hair 
You know how we do it boo 
Making love is cool 
But you need something freaky too

Never miss an opportunity to hit 
Call me up whenever you need a fix

Turn you to a fiend for this 
Bring your girl 
You know that i love a split 
And she just know 
So we just go 
Hitting the spots making her body go (ooo) 
Dont you hold back 
Let your secrets show

Ill take you to another word girl 
You the baddest thing i see here 
Nah i aint your man and i aint tryna be 
But im thinking we should leave here 
Beat it up now youre breathing like youre asthmatic 
Pull your hair then i tell her look back at it 
Take a break recoup now we back at it 
Make a movie cinematic im a sex addict 
Bite your lips when i do it make you wile out 
Its game time when im in it no timeouts 
If she aint screaming i aint working make her cry out 
Im on it and she want it so i knock her lights out 
She hit me up then i go and lay the pipe down 
I cant stay gotta go this my lifestyle 
She looking at me like boy i want it right now 
I make her moan to my song thats the right sound
