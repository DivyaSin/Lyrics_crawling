Driving through hell just to get back home 
I can't find the way there's too much smoke 
I'm choking on the air that I breathe 
I can't turn around 'cause I'm in too deep I'm in a hellfire 
It's better to die young 
I'm in a hellfire 
It's better to die young With driving wheels I was born to ride 
Straight outta hell and to the other side 
I don't give a damn about the big boss man 
For all I care he can kiss my arse With driving wheels 
I was born to ride 
Straight outta hell 
And to the other side, hellfire I been slavin', workin' 
Kickin', livin', screamin' in a hellfire It's better to die young 
I'm in a hellfire 
It's better to die young 
I'm in a hellfire It's better to die young 
Yeah, all alone in a hellfire 
It's better to die young
