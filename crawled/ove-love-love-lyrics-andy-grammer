It's like I've been feeling like a helium balloon 
You know I'm always on the rise 
Or is this love, love, love, love, love? Dead winter but it feels like June 
With a smile I can't hide 
Is this love, love, love, love, love? Ooh wee no defenses I'm too deep for common sense 
Well it's love, love, love, love, love yeah 
Oh my I'm so delighted, I don't try to even fight it 
And I think that you should know that I will never let you go Oh I won't, I won't let you go 
I won't let you go 
Said oh, I won't, I won't let you go 
I won't let you go 
I won't let you go now I've been feeling like you're swimming through my hair 
You know you're always on my mind 
Is this love, love, love, love, love? 
Dead broke feeling like a millionaire 
With a twinkle in my eye 
Is this love, love, love, love, love? Ooh wee no defenses I'm too deep for common sense 
Well it's love, love, love, love, love yeah 
Oh my I'm so delighted I don't try to even fight it 
And I think that you should know, that I will never let you go Oh I won't, I won't let you go 
I won't let you go 
Said oh, I won't, I won't let you go 
I won't let you go 
Said I won't let you go now I've been sleeping on a cloud called number nine 
Walking on the air and staring at the sky 
I can't remember ever feeling so alive 
It's like you brought me back to life 
Well you turned on all the lights, somehow Ooh wee no defenses I'm too deep for common sense 
Well it's love, love, love, love, love Oh I won't, I won't let you go 
I won't let you go 
Said oh, I won't, I won't let you go 
I won't let you go 
Now sing it out Oh I won't, I won't let you go 
I won't let you go 
Said oh, I won't, I won't let you go 
I won't let you go 
Said I won't let you go now
