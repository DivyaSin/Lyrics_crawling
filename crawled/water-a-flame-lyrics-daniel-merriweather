Seven days has gone so fast, 
I really thought the pain would pass. 
It's been nearly an hour, 
Since I thought of you. But your not answering the phone, 
I'd settle for a busy tone, 
At least that I'd know that you're okay. 
A girl like you ain't meant to go away. 
Oh Now you're gone, 
There's nothing else I want. 
Now that it's over, 
There's nothing else I want. 
What have I done, 
Looks like I was wrong. 
Is everything really meant to change, 
I guess we're like water and a flame. 
Water and a flame I'm tired of this empty house, 
I need a drink to get me out. 
A couple more til I forget your name. I saw a boy that looked like you, 
I didn't know quite what to do, 
It took a power of will to break my stare. 
I realized what I wanted wasn't there. Now you're gone, 
There's nothing else I want. 
Now that it's over, 
There's nothing else I want. Is everything really meant to change, 
I guess we're like water and a flame. 
Water and a flame If you see me coming 
I look away, I look away 
And if your mind is made up 
I look away, I will look away If your worry bound 
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am 
All this sorrow and this pain, 
Is going to go away Now you're gone, 
There's nothing else I want. 
Now that it's over, 
There's nothing else I want. 
What have I done, 
Looks like I was wrong. 
Is everything really meant to change, 
I guess we're like water and a flame.
