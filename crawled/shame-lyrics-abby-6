run to your room 
prize apologies 
crawl back in her womb 
who's fantasies are these 
so I tried to love you 
so long, so real i tried to tell you 
somewhat how I feel 
shame! 
Chorus 
i can see just what you've done to me 
half is he who holds hypocracy 
stand in my face, watch you disappear 
i can see just what you've left me here 
crying to feel plain 
screm to pass the time 
prophecy in vain 
who's standing by your crime 
so i tried to love you so long so real 
now i have to tell you 
shame is how I feel 
shame! 
Chorus 
I look alive 
I'm aliveand i'm high, high 
I look alive 
I'm aliveand i'm high, high 
shame!
