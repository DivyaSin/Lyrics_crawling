Smile somebody loves you smile take a look and see 
Smile somebody needs you smile take a look at me I will comfort you I will love you true 
And if the world starts closin' in I'll be your friend 
I will understand I'll do all I can if you'll just turn around take my hand 
Smile somebody loves you... 
Smile somebody loves you...
