well i'm a bird without a sky 
i'm a mountain just trying to fly 
i'm doing the best that i can do 
without you well i'm a ship in a desert sea 
well i'm the only one there for me 
i'm doing the best that i can do 
without you oh, were'd you go 
oh, you need to know those were the best days of my life 
those were the memories 
that will never die if only i could turn back time 
i would find you and make you mine 
i'm doing the best that i can do 
without you well take these eyes and learn to see 
that we were always meant to be 
i'm doing the best that i can do 
without you oh, were'd you go 
oh, you need to know those were the best days of my life 
those were the memories 
that will never die if only i could turn back time 
i would find you and make you mine 
i'm doing the best that i can do 
without you, without you 
without you, without you oh, were'd you go 
oh, you need to know those were the best days of my life 
those were the memories 
that will never die if only i could turn back time 
i would find you and make you mine 
i'm doing the best that i can do 
without you, without you, without you
