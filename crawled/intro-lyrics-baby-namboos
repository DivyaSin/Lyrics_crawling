My name`s Anthony 
And I am Tony Guest 
I live in Manchester 
I go to Bristol now and again 
To see the skinheads 
Oh stop laughin` now 
You keep me alone so 
`Cause one night you`re found 
`Cause I see 
I see me cousin 
I`m out there now and again 
Goin` up and behind me the high cliff 
He jumps all over the tables and that 
Shows me around town 
Meet a few girls 
Ahaha you wish
