The moon's gone down 
I know you're still awake 
This heart I've found 
I didn't intend to break Cause I've seen the world from down there 
And it wasn't a pretty sight 
Now the circle is turning 
Are you armed for the fight Chorus: 
I wanna be your firewoman 
I'll water down your desire 
Because i know this love is a killer 
I wanna put out your fire Apology...hmmn..it's futility 
Now, destiny...is not a friend 
Not a friend Cause I've seen the world from down there 
And it wasn't a pretty sight 
Now the circle is turning 
Are you gonna be alright Chorus: 
I wanna be your firewoman 
I'll water down your desire 
Because i know this love is a killer 
I wanna put out your fire Did you come from danger? 
You gave me love for pain 
Now you're much more than a stranger 
I wanna give you love 
But all I have is rain Chorus: 
I wanna be your firewoman 
I'll water down your desire 
Because i know this love is a killer 
I wanna put out your fire I'm gonna put it out put it out (4x) I wanna be your firewoman (put it out) (put it out) 
I wanna be your firewoman (put it out) (put it out) 
I gonna be your firewoman (put it out) (put it out) 
I gonna be your firewoman
