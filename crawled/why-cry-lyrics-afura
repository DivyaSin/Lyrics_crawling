Nobody's crying out for justice 
And everyone is crying out for peace 
Mankind overstand 
Please. A hungry man is a hungry man 
And the war will never cease 
Malicious power struggle 
Make a whole a dem a freeze ya 
And you a Mr. Scripe and Mr. Pharisees 
Can you show some love and put your mind at ease 
Say them a bun down to them flame like a beast them can't tame 
And now you stand alone in a de rain ... 
It a run red out der 
Everyday another innocent dead out der 
More wickedness the whole a dem spread out der 
And the ghetto youth a try and try and them cant find no bread out there 
People upset out der 
Politician know a ders show no regret out der 
Cast things dem a do we should reject out der 
But instead of dat 
Nobody never fling a stone a flatten dem a ya ... 
You wanna be tender 
But you got to be tough 
Becud the food that you eat 
Look like it not enough 
And you want to be real 
But you gotta be rough 
And the whole town a pray for a message from above 
Boom 
Wanting on moods 
Motion handcuff 
Working for de system the goota you crush 
And better you go cool and avoid the rush 
Them step on your toe an not even say hush Nobody's crying out for justice 
And everyone is crying out for peace 
Mankind overstand 
Please 
A hungry man is a hungry man 
So the war will never cease 
Malicious power struggle 
Make a whole a dem a freeze ya 
And you a Mr. Scripe and Mr. Pharisees 
Can you show some love and put your mind at ease 
Say them a bun down to them flame like a beast them can't tame 
Now you stand alone in a de rain
