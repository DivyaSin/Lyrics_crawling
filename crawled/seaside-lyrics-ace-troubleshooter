Walking on the seaside 
With a sunset over blue 
Hand in hand with you Listen to the waves break 
On a blanket spread for two 
Hand in hand with you If I had a million sand dollars 
I'd spend them all on you 
And build a sandcastle 
Just big enough for two So look me in the eyes, dear 
And know my love is true 
Hand in hand with you 
With you
