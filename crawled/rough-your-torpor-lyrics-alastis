From the power, the power of your faith 
Is born the life's fire 
Still believe, in the spiritual union 
Still believe in your power 
And live, and die in peace! Beyond the life, the life's mirror 
Look at your destiny 
Beyond the life, the life's mirror 
Don't let the doubt come over 
And live, and die in peace Live, livefor you, fight for Him 
Don't let the doubt come over... I'am still alive, I'm still the same 
I'am still alive, I'm still your faith 
I'am still alive, I'm still the same 
I'am still alive, I'm still the same
