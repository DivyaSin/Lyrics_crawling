We don't want your approval 
It's 1978 
We know we're not in tune 
We know we'll never be great We met at this bar 
A little piece of fame 
Up on the bandstand 
Nobody knows no shame Louie louie talk 
Well what you got on me 
Louie louii, I 
I don't even 
Try, try, try, try, try We've got so much to live for 
It's not too late 
We've got so much to live for 
It's not too late Jennifer my scony 
Don't need anybody's pain 
She had enough desire 
To shatter window panes 
She said "I'm not fond of small talk" 
Down on Levenworth and Poke 
She said I don't need your heroes 
To make my life a joke 
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha We've got so much to live for 
It's not too late 
We've got so much to live for 
It's not too late You take a Mill Valley charmer 
Mix in some Bowie trash 
A little too much mascara 
Under a surgeon's mask She cuddles like a puppy 
Yeah man, you know she will 
You've never heard her bark like an animal, ha 
Yeah, I've heard her myself 
She hit me in the head with a fantasy 
Yeah it's stuck to my cheek 
My lip was bleeding 
Blood running down my face I put her back on my own yeah 
Punched myself in the mouth 
I put her back on my own head 
Punched myself in the mouth I turn on the tv 
You're teeth were burning bright 
I turn off the tv 
And kiss myself good night 
Good night, good night [Chorus: Repeat 2X]
