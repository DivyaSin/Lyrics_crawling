Heart don't fail me now 
Courage don't desert me 
Don't turn back now that were here 
People always say life is full of choices 
No one ever mentions fear Or how the road can seem so long 
How the world can seem so vast 
Courage see me threw 
Heart I'm trusting you 
On this journey to the past Somewhere down this road 
I know someone's waiting 
Years of dreams just can't be wrong No, Arms will open wide 
I'll be save and wanted 
Finally home where I belong Well, starting here my life begins 
Starting now I'm learning fast 
Courage see me threw 
Heart I'm trusting you 
On this journey to the past Heart don't fail me now 
Courage don't desert me 
Home love family 
There was once a time 
I must have had them too 
Home love family 
I will never be complete 
Until I find you One step at a time 
One hope then another 
Who knows where this road may go 
Back to who I was 
On to find my future 
Things my heart still needs to know Yes let this be a sign 
Let this road be mine 
Let it lead me to my past 
Courage see me through 
Heart I'm trusting you 
To bring me home 
At Last 
At Last Courage see me threw 
Heart I'm trusting you 
Journey to the past
