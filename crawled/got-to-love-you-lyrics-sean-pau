Yo yo cah [Chorus] 
Now that I got your love girl 
I'll never ever give it up 
Ah wan' yuh listen up

I'll always need your kiss and your touch 
And all these things 
Now that I got your love girl

And all these things So no lullaby, no ring ding 
Well ah plane can't fly pon one wing 
I needing you, you be needing me 
And all these things 
There ain't no use pretending 
Without you my life has ended 
Without me your life descending 
And all these things 
Keep running through my mind 
Confusing every time 
Cause you ain't really mine

Gotta keep my thoughts on the bright side 
But I'd love to have you girl by my side when I ride 
When I love to get fi introduce you as my bride 
To spend quality time, girl you that I've tried

You put me top ah de world world (world) 
And all these things 
Cause this is what we deserve 
Although it seeming absurd 
Girl and all these things [Chorus: x2]
