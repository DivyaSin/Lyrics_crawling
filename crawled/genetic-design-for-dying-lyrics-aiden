Dear Mother, I am lost and the damage has been done. 
I'm in love with my old century fix and this needle can't be wrong, 
But I wonder, where do we go from here? 
Because we're never coming home. The sequel to this nightmare lasts forever, forever. 
One last goodnight with this painted picture in our minds, 
The voice inside that sings tonight. 
One last goodnight with this painted picture in our minds, The voice inside that sings tonight. 
I'm not scared at all, so let's walk away. 
Dear Mother, now beyond the grave, 
You're the soul that wants me. Front row with a cigarette, 
You're the ghost that haunts me, 
But I wonder, I'm too fucked up to come home. 
I swear this heart was made of stone, I won't pretend that everthing's alright when it's not. 
One last goodnight with this painted picture in our minds, 
The voice inside that sings tonight. 
One last goodnight with this painted picture in our minds, The voice inside that sings tonight. 
I'm not scared at all, so let's walk away. 
Wake me now, drive faster, 
Make me now a disaster. Take me now, live after and walk away. 
Can you design living through hell and back again? 
It's the life that's killing you. 
Walk away friend. Can you design living through hell and back again? 
It's the life that's killing you. 
Walk away. 
WALK AWAY!!! One last goodnight with this painted picture in our minds, 
The voice inside that sings tonight. 
One last goodnight with this painted picture in our minds, 
The voice inside that sings tonight.
