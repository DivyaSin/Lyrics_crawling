Dressed to kill, and drinking all alone 
Waiting for some lizard to take you home 
Another wham-bam rendezvous 
The script is moldy but the lines are tried and true But there's no freedom 
No real freedom 
There is no freedom in sin Conscience screaming, but its Saturday night 
Dig deep for anything to make the wrong feel right 
Morning comes, your head is split in two 
I know your bleeding; I've crawled that same path too The swords are rattling, and the end is in sight 
Its now or never if you want to make things right 
The future's shaky, but the facts are quite clear 
The King is coming, and He's almost here
