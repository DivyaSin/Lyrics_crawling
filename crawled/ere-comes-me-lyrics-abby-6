here comes god, here comes me 
ones too shy of making it three 
and I can't see 
so blind i'll be 
here comes god, here comes me 
this will go down but no history 
down in the mind where the soul shall see 
this boys been torn but it's the man you see 
here comes god 
here comes me 
here comes me 
here comes god, there goes me 
ones too shy of making it three 
and i can't see 
so blind i'll be 
here comes god, here comes me 
here comes me 
here comes me 
Chorus 
i'm not sleepin 
don't try to wake me up 
i'm just dreamin 
don't try to wake me up 
here comes god, is he mad at me? 
number three was killed by me 
I can't see 
so blind I'll be 
here comes god 
goes me 
here comes me 
here comes me 
Chorus 
here he comes 
here he comes 
here he comes 
I'm still awake 
I'm still awake 
I'm still awake 
I'm still awake
