Why did I run away? 
I didnt get nowhere. 
Why did I run away? 
My remorse rips and tears. 
Stupid as I could get. 
I didnt see it yet. 
So why did I run away from you? Shadows, keep away from my window view. 
And sunrise, hurry on cause I dont have time. 
I gotta find my girl. Why did I run away? 
If it was up to you. 
Would you let me stay? Would it matter to you? 
Im sorry as I can be. 
I never meant to flee. 
So why did I run away from you? Shadows, keep away from my window view. 
Sunrise, hurry on cause I dont have time. 
I gotta find my girl. 
Yeah.. Stupid as I could get. 
I didnt see it yet. 
So why did I run away from you? Baby, seems like years since I saw your face. 
And maybe, imagine youll never ever leave a trace. 
So shadows, keep away from my window view. 
I gotta find my girl. 
Find my girl
