Rudy was my friend 
But he had an end 
Oh yes, I did send him into an eternal sleep 
I'm so sorry, boy 
No longer my toy 
Oh my pride and joy 
You no longer go beep Rudy my electronic penguin 
I'm so sorry boy, I hope you rest in peace Oh my Rudy, how I miss you Maybe we'll meet in a better world 
Filled with penguin boys and penguin girls 
But until then my love for you will never cease 
And I just hope that you will rest in peace
