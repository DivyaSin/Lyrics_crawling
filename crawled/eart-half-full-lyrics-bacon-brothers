Written by Michael Bacon Water is to glass as _______ is to Heart. a. Blood b. Love c. Taxi d. Happiness MB As you stare off to one side and appear to be listening 
I can see in your eyes, a small tear is glistening 
For years we've been drifting on sands ever shifting 
'Neath our feet, where we once walked hand in hand How can I say just how much I need you to stay 
When I reach out to touch, why do you turn away? 
The cold winds are blowing, distances growing 
Tell me we've got something left to save Is your heart half empty or half full of love 
Can you ever find the feeling again 
Baby my love's so large and I'll never stop 
'Til I fill your heart right to the top My words can't explain just how hard I am trying 
'Cause my heart hurts so badly when I see you crying 
Just a sign that you need me, a hint you still care 
Tell me that your love is still alive Is your heart half empty or half full of love 
Can you ever find the feeling again 
Baby my love's so large and I'll never stop 
'Til I fill your heart right to the top
