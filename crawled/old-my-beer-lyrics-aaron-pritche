I've been watchin' you watchin' every girl in the bar 
And payin' no attention to the one on your arm 
You're a dog 
And man, she's smokin' 
I've seen your kind before 
You think you're so cool 
This country boy's gunna take you to school 
Hold out your hand, no man..i ain't jokin' [Chorus] 
Hold my beer 
While I kiss your girlfriend 
Cause she needs a real man, not a boy like you. 
Hold my beer 
Ya, I'm a man on a mission 
You don't see what you're missin' 
But I do 
So here, hold my beer Well friend I wouldn't blame me if you wanted to fight, 
If you wanna later we can take it outside 
But now, do me a favor [Chorus] Well guys like you, 
You ain't good for nothing 
Well hold on a second, 
You gotta be good for something (something) 
I know Hold my beer 
While I kiss your girlfriend 
Cause she needs a real man, 
Not a chump like you 
Hold my beer 
I'm a man on a mission 
You don't see what you're missin' 
But I do 
So here, hold my beer Hold my beer
