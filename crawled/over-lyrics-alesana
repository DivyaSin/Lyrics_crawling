Is it her, could it be, 
Should my eyes believe 
What they see If you are who I think you are 
I might lose my mind Just a kiss, from her lips 
And I would simply float away. 
The way her hips 
Swing back and forth 
I've got butterflies Dead girls don't just appear 
Out of thin air 
But I am victim 
To her sinister stare. Please don't hate me for 
What I've done 
Run away with me, 
I'll be everything that you need 
Such a pretty girl screams to me, 
Take my hand, take my breath away 
What if my heart breaks again? 
Take my breath away Just the scent of her skin 
Unlocks forbidden memories 
The slightest graze of fragile hand 
I've got butterflies Dead girls don't just appear 
Out of thin air 
But I am victim 
To her sinister stare. Please don't hate me for 
What I've done 
Run away with me, 
I'll be everything that you need 
Such a pretty girl screams to me, 
Take my hand, take my breath away I'll be your anchor, I'll be your lover 
I'll be your anchor, I'll be your lover 
And if your heart is filled with doubt 
I'll bear my soul to you belle! Please don't hate me for 
What I've done 
Run away with me, 
I'll be everything that you need 
Such a pretty girl screams to me, 
Take my hand, take my breath away I can't lose you again 
I can't lose you again 
I can't lose you again 
I'm nothing without you. 
I'll never let you down 
I'll never let you down 
I'll never let you down
