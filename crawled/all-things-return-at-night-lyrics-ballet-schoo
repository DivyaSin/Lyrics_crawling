Where is nature boy? 
Where is jimmy jimmy rebel red? 
I used to see your name on the readers letters page 
Gentle Steven, where have you been? 
Where are you John? 
Too big for hugs, too old for cardigan songs 
You were wrong, you were wrong I'm all or nothing at all 
Why'd you wanna write your name in water? 
I break you out of my heart 
I sing you out of my soul 
But I don't wanna let you go You're the boss, raspberry sauce 
You're the boss, raspberry sauce 
You'll get yours in the post Remember when you were two? 
You went missing and the whole of our street 
Was out looking for you 
All the dads went out in cars 
But when it got dark 
Your mum called the police 
'Oh no, oh God, where is he?' 
Oh, I was not able to tell them you were hiding 
Under the table with the feet and the mischief The chance and the pleasure 
Are hanging by a thread 
The fear of someone watching 
The ghost that hid under your bed I'm all or nothing at all 
Why'd you wanna write your name in water? 
I break you out of my heart 
I sing you out of my soul 
I don't wanna let you go I know what you really are
