I took your picture, with one particular reason and its to capture your character, 
I like to sit and stare at 'cha 
Ain't nothin wrong with starin' at cha 
Girl don't be scared at the fact that I envision us getting married 
And I ain't tryin' to rush nuttin' 
'Cuz I ain't rushin' 
It'll take a time like 
"What's them things that move slow you know them...damn.. I can't think 'cuz you on my mind..." 
And when you on my mind I can't find anything to rhyme with rhyme 
I gotta rhyme rhyme with mixture 
And speakin' of mixture 
With you I wanna get mixed up 
I'm like a record and your like a record 
So let's let the DJ mix us 
You're like an elixir 
That's got me tipsy, 
This is just like ripplets 
Believe it or not girl but I love you [Chorus:] 
Girl you really got me goin' 
Outta control 
I don't know what I'm doin' 
Let's let it go 
And do what we do best 
Take off our clothes 
We look better undressed [Bridge x2] 
Let's get sexy 
Let's get sexy 
Sounds so good 
Sounds so good 
Fightin' is rightin' 
Fightin' is rightin' 
Let's get sexy 
It's so much more exciting For you I'm a fanatic 
I'm a addict 
Your sexy antics turn me on like automatic 
No need to get dramatic 
But I gotta have it 
(Gimme gimme gimme gimme) 
Gimme some of them sexual acrobatics 
Kama Sutra girl, anything that suits you girl 
Things you ain't used to girl 
Come over here and let me show you just how we will do it 
I'm a freak and you knew it 
Your a freak and I knew it 
Baby let's get to it [Chorus] Its called the S E X X X X 
(Yes yes yes!) You take me to ecstasy 
Without takin' ecstasy 
It's exactly like ecstasy 
When you layin' right next to me 
I'm sexin' you 
Sexin' you 
You sexin' me 
Sexin' me 
It feels so damn natural 
What we doin' so naturally 
I'm likin' you rubbin' me 
And you likin' me rubbin' you 
Da passions emaculate 
While you lovin' me lovin' you 
I put L-O-V-E in you I love me puttin' me in you 
Make love to you 
Just like Sergio Mendez play piano
