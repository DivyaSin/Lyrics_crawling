I'm walking alone 
By the light of the moon 
Someone in the shadows hiding just moved 
She calls out my name 
I turn around 
I staring at a psycho off her merry-go-round 
I staring at a psycho off her merry-go-round 
I staring at a psycho off her merry-go-round She came here for me 
With a payback from hell 
Voodoo in her eyes and she's chanting a death spell 
It's not a bluff 
She's taking me down 
Dealing with a psycho of her merry-go-round 
Dealing with a psycho of her merry-go-round 
Dealing with a psycho of her merry-go-round Numbers flash through my head 
Little lies that I told 
Lovers that I mislead 
Promises I broke 
All you players beware 
Breaking too many heart 
Or you may find your fate 
Rests in the hands of one 
Sweet baby psycho Laughter and tears 
Rage is in bloom 
Waving a gun now 
Screaming I hate you I hate you 
All through the streets 
She's hunting me down 
Running from a psycho off her merry-go-round 
Running from a psycho off her merry-go-round 
Running from a psycho off her merry-go-round
