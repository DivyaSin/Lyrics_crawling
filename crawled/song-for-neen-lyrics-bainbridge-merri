Little flower how you've grown so fast 
Seems like only yesterday 
Little flower how your beauty lasts 
It always will to me Floating in around the trees 
Flighty as an autumn breeze 
Nothing has upset you 
All the pain has left you Little flower lying in the sun 
How you soak up every ray 
Little flower take it while you're young 
It may never shine again When you open up I see 
What a gift you've given me 
Nothing has upset you 
All the pain has left you Little flower have you grown to be 
Everything you wanted 
Little flower is your earth complete 
It always seems to be What we give we reap and sow 
Closer to me that you know 
I could never let you go 
I would never want to
