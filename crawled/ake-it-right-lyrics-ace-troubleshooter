Won't make do with your games 
And your slamming the door 
So fall down, fall through 
So have done with your vice and your virtue It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it right Prattle with your voice and it's sounding off 
Sounding like white noise 
If we fall, divide, if it's yours to choose 
Then go and decide 
'Cause if it's mine, I won't let it ride It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it Didn't I stay and didn't you wait? 
And didn't I care when you were crying? 
Didn't I stay and didn't you wait? 
And didn't I care when you were crying? It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it right 
It will take a lot to make it right 
Make it right, make it right, make it right
