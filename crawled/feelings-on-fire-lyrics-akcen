No reason to blame 
This feelings on fire! 
Me and you, 
The perfect view, 
It could be true! 
We've got love to share, 
The passion we ware

And i'm meaning i'm meaning like kiss of this night 
'Cause you set 
My feelings on fire! 
'Cause i'm dreaming i'm dreaming of love and desire, 
And i'm feeling i'm feeling the heat in the air 
'Cause tonight
