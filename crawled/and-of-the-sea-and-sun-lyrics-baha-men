Many nights I sit here 
With memories by the score Thinking of the days I spent With the girl I still adore So I'm going back to see her 
Before my days are done Going back to see her in the Land of the sea and sun Once I had a notion About this Bajin girl I put my thoughts in motion And found my heart in a whirl Going back to see her Before my days are done Going back to see her in the 
Land of the sea and sun ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Ever since I left her Nothing has been the same Think I'll pull up anchor I'm going back to give her my name Many nights I sit here Thinking of the days I spent 
With memories by the score With the girl I still adore Before my days are done 
Yes I'm going back to see her Going back to see her in the Land of the sea and sun
