It's a long, long way from here to you 
Tell me, how do I get there? There's so much I wish I could undo 
Tell me, how do I get there? Can a million wrong turns ever turn me around? 
Can I ever un-burn the bridges I've burned to the ground? 
Nowhere's too far 
And I'd go anywhere 
Tell me how do I get there from here? Your touch is beyond my fingertips 
It lingers in me Your heart is where forgiveness is 
Tell me, how do I get there? Can a million wrong turns ever turn me around? 
Can I ever un-burn the bridges I've burned to the ground? 
Nowhere's too far 
And I'd go anywhere 
Tell me how do I get there from here I'm sitting here, asking where to go 
With all I am, all I'll ever know So can a million wrong turns ever turn me around? 
Can I ever un-burn the bridges I've burned to the ground? 
Nowhere's too far 
And I'd go anywhere 
Tell me how, tell me how Nowhere's too far 
Yeah, I'd go anywhere 
Tell me, how do I get there? 
Tell me, how do I get there? 
From here Well how do I get there? 
Oh, please tell me now 
How do I get there?

How do I get there?
