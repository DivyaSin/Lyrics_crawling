Girl, you lookin' so fly, do, do, do

You skurred to face me, you don't wanna race me 
Fendi fur, Cartier glasses for the blur 
I'm a do it for me and let you do it for her I got a real bad habit when I wanna grab it 
So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit 
Bitches be like, "Ahh man" when they see me with Cardin 
Puffin on the green, discussin' a war plan I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a laptop 
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped 
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder 
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order So fuck your bitch nigga, what I wanna take 
Plus she been on my nuts since thumps and pencil breaks 
'Cause I'm a nigga with the hoe, a nigga with the flow 
Fo' Reel nigga, pissy drunk in the Rov' Fellas, we can get it on 
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn

I ain't never seen nathen like you before 
And you the type to make a nigga wanna open your door And to the house up on the hill and the jag is yours 
As long as you can prove that you wit' a nigga for sure 
You know I'm young and a thug, so I got issues 
I did them St. Louis blues, I done paid them dues, ay But nevermind that, how 'bout we hop the next cruise 
We can cash it or plastic, you choose 
Get pissed out with the Cristal or the Boones 
Get ya Xed out, leave ya stretched out in the room, my doom Fellas, we can get it on

Hopin' I could give you some love in the right way 
But I don't wanna give you the wrong impression 
I keep it mellow, sayin' hello, you still thinkin' I'm a thug fellow So I let you know from the get-go you thorough 
You a cutie with thighs and you live for dinero 
But, me and my team drop, shit overseas 
Then bounce wit' the ounce that's thick and Japanese I'm a goodfella, you know, I'm a made man 
Got 'em winin' like spoiled babies in play pens 
Put that ass up baby and I hit it from here 
Now lick your tongue out lady and I put it in here Let me whip that, lick that, and I don't stop 
Then hit the block with my niggaz in, my new drop 
Convertable, tens and dubs, no matter the weather
