Baby, do you understand me now? 
Sometimes I feel a little mad 
But don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel 
When things go wrong I feel real bad. I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree 
With a joy that's hard to hide 
And sometimes it seems that, all I have to do is worry 
And then you're bound to see my other side I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood If I seem edgy, I want you to know, 
That I never mean to take it out on you 
Life has its problems, and I get my share, 
And that's one thing I never mean to do Cause I love you, 
Oh, Oh, oh, oh, baby - don't you know I'm human 
I have thoughts like any other one 
Sometimes I find myself, Lord, regretting 
Some foolish thing, some little simple thing I've done I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood 
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood 
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
