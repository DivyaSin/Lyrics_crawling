Walking a line 
I try to walk a straight line 
But I'm stoned 
Counting the lies 
I've been counting the lies 
That I've told 
Remember what you said 
In that cold condescending tone 
There's good in everyone 
I knew you just couldn't leave it alone Tried my best but couldn't change 
You said you'd love me anyways 
But in a voice so soft it shouts 
I could hear the doubt 
As you crushed my cigarette out Walking a line 
I try to walk a straight line 
But I'm stoned 
Counting the lies 
I've been counting the lies 
That I've told 
Repeating what you said 
And I tried so hard not to laugh 
You barricaded the front door 
And I escaped out the back Tried my best but couldn't change 
You said you'd love me anyways 
But in a voice so soft it shouts 
I could hear the doubt 
As you crushed my cigarette out
