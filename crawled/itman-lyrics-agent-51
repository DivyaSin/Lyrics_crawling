Hitman, hitman, where ya been? 
Gotta magical mystery plan? 
You're goin' round town breaking all the rules 
But you're the king of fools 
I'll just point and shoot 
And no one will see me now 
I'll just point and shoot 
'Cause I work for the system now 
Hitman, hitman, draw the line 
I see you're out of time 
Assassination done 
The system's got him under control 
The Divided States of America 
Is a playground for kingpins and hypocrites 
In a country woven from outdated cloth 
And the fabric won't take much more of this 
We feed the world while our children starve 
And our soldiers forced to carry empty guns 
We preach about life and liberty 
While our mothers kill their unwanted sons. 
You draw your battle lines 
You see you're outta time 
It's just another excuse 
For what you people might call war 
You think you're tolerant 
You prove your ignorance 
The United States of America ain't united anymore!
