I remember trying not to stare the night that I first met you 
You had me mesmerized 
And 3 weeks later in the front porch light taking 45 min to kiss goodnight 
I hadn't told you yet but I thought I loved you then Chorus 
Now you're my whole life now you're my whole world 
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl 
Like a river meets the sea 
Stronger than it's ever been 
We've come so far since that day 
And I thought I loved you then. I remember taking you back to right where I first met you 
You were so surprised 
There were people around 
But I didn't care I got down on one knee right there 
And once again I thought I loved you then Chorus 
Now you're my whole life now you're my whole world 
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl 
Like a river meets the sea 
Stronger than it's ever been 
We've come so far since that day 
And I thought I loved you then. I can just see you with a baby on the way 
I can just see you when your hair is turning gray 
What I can't see is how I'm ever gonna love you more 
But I've said that before. Now you're my whole life now you're my whole world 
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl 
Well look back some day at this moment that we're in 
And I'll look at you and say and I thought I loved you then 
And I thought I loved you then...
