Everywhere you look you see a world so bright and new 
And everywhere you look to see the sun that shines over you 
Every now and then you feel there's nothing you can do 
In this world you seem to be all alone and life's got a hold on you 
But all you have to do is close your eyes 
Just think of it (oh baby) 
And we'll be there for you (you... you...) 
So not the time has come to let us in believe (oh baby) 
And now the world belongs to you 
[refrain] 
Just believe we're loving you and there ain't you can't do 
Just believe we'll be there for you and the world belongs to you 
Just believe we'll miracles lets make it all come true for you 
Everywhere you walk, you walk in love hand in hand 
And anything you want your dream will be yours 
When you're in command 
Just in case you feel alone and there's nothing more to do 
Just believe we'll live inside the hall's of me and you 
And all you have to do is reach your back and touch the sky 
And we'll be there for you you and you 
So now the time has come to make it start from the heart 
And all the world belongs to you 
Now we must join as one 
Lets give to a cheering time 
The world will be so lonely 
It's up to us to make a change 
If you all just remember that we are all the same 
Just believe 
[repeat]
