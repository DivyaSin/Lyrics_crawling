Here we go 
Round 1 wasn't what thought it'd be 
Round 2 I'm struggling to breathe 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7 times I wondered why I stepped inside this ring? I may be knocked down and so bruised 
But I'm here to tell you 
I may be knocked down but not for the count 
(1, 2, 3, 4) So take me one more round 
I'll just keep fighting 
One more round 
You're messing me up but I'm still here One more round 
I'll come out swinging 
One more round 
I'm telling you now I'm not gonna lose it here It's so hard to get up off the floor again 
But I know that victory is when 
I'm pushing through the pain that tries to beat me like that 
That I won't, the end I may be bloodied and so bruised 
But I'm here to tell you 
I may be knocked down but not for the count 
(1, 2, 3, 4) So take me one more round 
I'll just keep fighting 
One more round 
You're messing me up but I'm still here One more round 
I'll come out swinging 
One more round 
I'm telling you know I'm not gonna lose it here I am not defeated, though you cannot see it 
I have never won a battle on my own 
I find strength in weakness, I find hope believing 
God is for me, who can bring me down? So take me one more round 
I'll just keep fighting 
One more round 
You're messing me up but I'm still here One more round 
I'll come out swinging 
One more round 
I'm telling you know I'm not gonna lose it here
