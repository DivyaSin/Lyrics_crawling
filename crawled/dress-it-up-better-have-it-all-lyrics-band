"Oh, mos' feet and it hang, can't you see?" I groan. 
She says, 'Oh, wha' 'ts arright." I said, "Jesus, don't take it at all." 
She's a past-cold beauty, but she can't light a cannonball. Now, down by the river she's a-hop on her knees, 
and I holler to my baby, yelling, "Please, please, please!" 
Oh, then I hit her and doubt my chase at all. 
Now, no hoax. Let's go! But it's that pure soul, and it's off the ball. Now, honey, I'm makin' a hot to road. 
Now I'm happy to leaving, but it's a heavy load. 
I said, "Ah, my babe. She don't meet me no half at all." 
Dress it up. Best to pick up, bub: better have it all. [Oh, let's shake it up.] Well, hot dog, goody me. Settle on a trail 
Down apart my knees I can't find my kerry. Find a nail! 
She old top these... oh, better hold mine up. 
Please, let's go, 'n' I hope it don't interrupt. [Oh, do it again, now. One time for Bozo and his dog. 
Hot skimmin', jumpaway. yay, yay, yay, yay.] I hope it come' easy; I hope it comes hard; 
I hope I sit me down yon' sit a little a chicken yard. 
Open up, ol' Henry. Get that boy on home. 
Tell Bess momma, he's up 'n' gone too long. [Once again, now. Oh, sounds so sweet.]
