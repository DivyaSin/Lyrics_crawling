'Stood with my kid on the lonely windswept beach 
The winter sun was on the horizon 
And we were both out of reach 
She ran ahead of me looking for the next surprise 
Our souls were wet, yes Lord 
From the incoming tide She stopped and turned and looked at me 
Lord, tears in her eyes 
It's only a dead bird 
And its soul has gone to the sky, yeah, yeah Don't you know he's free 
Not like you and me 
That bird is free 
Not like you and me I never ever thought you would be so out of reach 
And the lonely times have been like poison, child 
I wish I could practise what I preach Then I can release these feelings that I've been 
Holding deep inside 
I been missing you so much, baby 
We only hear, there can be time 
By then you will have forgotten 
The little dead bird on the beach 
But please don't forget your father, child 
Because he's out of reach I got a dream, baby 
And my dream is 
To be free 
Freedom for you and me 
I'm talking about freedom 
Freedom for you and me You hear my music in the wind 
Hearbeat like the rolling tide 
One thing you can be sure of my love 
Wherever you go, I'll hold your love inside And I told her, look baby 
Even if he was living 
And you could hold him in your hands 
You'd still have to open up one of these days 
And let that bird fly, free She stopped and turned and looked at me, 
Lord, with tears in her eyes 
It's only a dead bird and its soul has gone to the sky 
Don't you know he's free 
Freedom for you and me 
I'm talking about freedom, freedom 
Freedom for you and me 
To be free 
It's all I need baby 
It's all I dream about baby 
To be free (Burdon)
