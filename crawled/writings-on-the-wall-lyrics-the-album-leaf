Writing on the wall 
so you can speak 
writing on the wall 
will sing will sing writing on the wall 
so you can scream 
the writings on the wall 
they'll sing they'll sing i couldn't seem to find you from here 
i only wanted to say the right words writings on the wall 
they'll speak to me 
writings on the wall 
they'll sing to me the writings on the wall 
will scream at us 
writings on the wall 
they'll sing they'll sing over clouds and through the sky 
to find a place that we can hide 
and close our eyes this time 
it's all inside through this journey 
we can see all the trees 
their changing leaves 
this safe place where we can hide away writings on the wall
