-Verse 1- (Aloma Steele) 
Drivin' down the 405, the butterflies, I feel alive. 
My heart is warm, my eyes are wide. 
Paralyzed 'till I arrive, the chills are running down my spine. 
It's funny cause it's warm outside. Pixels before 'till I opened the door. 
Feel it in my core, don't be patient no more. 
Footsteps await with your face on display, 
Echoes that stray from your voice, it's too late. -Chorus- 
I'm more fragile than I've ever been, 
In a city where, you are unaware. 
(Hang in), hang up and it all begins, 
Not a screen tonight, this is real life. Pixels before 'till I opened the door. 
Feel it in my core, don't be patient no more. 
I'm more fragile than I've ever been, 
Not a screen tonight, this is real life. -Electronic Rift- 
Not a screen tonight, this is real life. (3x) -Verse 2- (Alexa Lusader) 
Drivin' down the 405, L.A., 'cause it's my time. 
The dreamless space is on the rise. 
Something missing inside, told you I want you by my side, 
But I eventually realize... Emotions flow, tears are starting to grow. 
Strangers no more when I open the door. 
Footsteps await with your face on display, 
Echoes will stay from your voice when you say... -Chorus (variant)- 
I'm more fragile than I've ever been, 
In a city where, I am unaware. 
(You're it), hang up and it all begins, 
Not a screen tonight, this is real life. Emotions flow, tears are starting to grow. 
Strangers no more when I open the door. 
I'm more fragile than I've ever been, 
Not a screen tonight, this is real life. -Electronic Rift- 
Not a screen tonight, this is real life. (3x)
