I looked to the sky last night 
And my eyes caught the light of a star 
Burning like the memories of brighter days 
And I know this life is all mine 
Just a moment in time 
But everyday's another beginning (so) Pull yourself together 
You know it's for the better 
Now, It's our turn 
It's our turn to carry this weight 
Nothing is forever 
You can't predict the weather 
Now, it's our time 
And I'll help you carry this weight They say that love won't die 
And then I realize 
What will be will be 
You're always here with me 
And in the darkest night 
I feel you by my side 
What will be will be 
You're always here with me Meet me in my dreams 
And you can help me believe 
Tell me there are gonna be better days 
To see your face and feel your embrace 
I swear I'll never forget what you gave (so I) Pull myself together 
I know it's for the better 
Now, it's my turn 
It's my turn to carry this weight 
Nothing is forever 
You can't predict the weather 
Now, you'll be there to help me carry this weight They say that love won't die 
And then I realize 
What will be will be 
You're always here with me 
And in the darkest night 
I feel you by my side 
What will be will be 
You're always here with me And if a day goes by 
And you start to question why 
Tell me why 
There is a way to hold on 
You just gotta stay strong 
Close your eyes and you will find 
Love lives on inside They say that love won't die 
And then I realize 
What will be will be 
You're always here with me 
And in the darkest night 
I feel you by my side 
What will be will be 
You're always here with me What will be will be 
You're always here with me What will be will be 
You're always here with me
