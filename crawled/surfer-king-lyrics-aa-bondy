Behind the red door in american skin 
there is a murder of roses 
In the midnight hiss come cover me there 
For i am electric nothing Out on the tide strangers all are drowing by 
Under eclipse i wait for your kiss 
with the beating of all these idiot hearts No more evil now, no horror sound, no maniac song from a tyrant 
And the surfer king will show me everything in the great green flash of the evening Out on the tide strangers we ride 
smoke in our eyes 
under eclipse, i wait for your kiss 
with the beating of all these idiot hearts
