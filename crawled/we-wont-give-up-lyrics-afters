Everywhere, everyday 
All we hear is, all we hear is 
Wait, it's not your time 
Just get back in line And they can try to knock us down 
We've got our feet nailed to the ground 
If you want to count us out, go ahead 
But it's not over yet We won't back down 
We've gotta take our best shot 
Give it all we got now 
We won't back down 
They say we'll never make it 
But we're gonna take it all the way We won't give up, we won't give up 
We won't give up, we won't give up With the clock running down 
We're gonna leave our fears and failures all behind 
This is our time 
We'll reach till we touch the sky We won't back down 
We've gotta take our best shot 
Give it all we got now 
We won't back down 
They say we'll never make it 
But we're gonna take it all the way We won't give up, we won't give up 
We won't give up, we won't give up 
We won't give up, we won't give up 
We won't give up, we won't give up We won't hold back and we won't slow down the pace 
We wont let go and we won't call off the chase We won't back down 
We've gotta take our best shot 
Give it all we got now 
We won't back down 
They say we'll never make it 
But we're gonna take it all the way We won't give up, we won't give up 
We won't give up! We won't give up! 
We won't give up, we won't give up 
We won't give up! We won't give up! 
We won't give up, we won't give up 
They say we'll never make it 
But we're gonna take it all the way 
We won't give up!
