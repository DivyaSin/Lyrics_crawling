We're all here we're all the same open your eyes don't play their game fighting each other nothing's to gain fight the system not each other they control your lives when we should be fighting the system that fucks up why are we so busy fighting each other open your mouth but do not close your eyes a sound called unity if we stand together we've gotta stop the violence in our scene and holds us down with the shackles that bound there's a new sound comin down from the underground and focus our hate on the state till they hear our screams we'll never be torn apart by hatred
