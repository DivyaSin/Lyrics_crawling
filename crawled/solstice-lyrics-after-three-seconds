In summertime the air breathed light through apertures and doors 
Holding hands out of windows in cars, the wind in our ears roared 
The trees could never cast a shadow that darkened our stride 
Not a path through the cool summer night we couldn't say we tried Just so you know, I would rather have died 
Sooner exchanged my life than see that summer slide to winter's cold hand 
It's just a step on the wind 
Never could I begin to verbalize it all 
Do you hear the call? With wrists unbound we beat our wings against the heated air 
Flying higher than mountains that once paralyzed us with their stare 
The cages that we left behind, they fill with empty space 
No constriction can kill in our minds the fantasies we chase Wind, carry me over mountains, through land and sea 
And we gave it all, our momentum will never let us fall
