Hunter of tears, relative pain 
Half of this world is dark with the stain 
The stain of unknowing the dead flower buds 
On smiling lips is innocent blood 
The corpse of your God can only rot and grow cold 
Now promise me you'll kill me before I get old 
I heard you on the telephone moaning my doom 
A cold woman will kill me in a darkened room 
The chain-saw of the mortician shines 
I still got all my fingers but somewhere I lost my mind 
I can smell abortion on you I can see thru 
I take the gun out of my moth and point it at you
