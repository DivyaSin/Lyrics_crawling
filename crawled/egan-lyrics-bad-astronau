I'm better on a summer day when she's around, 
I was on the tracks when the gate came down 
Suddenly I recognized those bloodshot rear view mirror eyes as mine 
I heard that whistle call my name 
I almost drove away, 
But Megan, 
I had a feeling that you would be on that train 
So I just waited there for you Caught a ride to another town, where the air was clean and the sun never goes down 
Everyone was standing in a line between the landing and the stairs 
I heard somebody call my name 
I almost climbed the stairs 
But Megan, 
I had a feeling that someday you'd meet me there 
So I just waited there for you I'm better on a summer day when I hear that name, 
It's a dream that never came true 
Sat down on the tracks and waited for a train 
Take me back to you 
Somebody came and took my hand 
I finally had to go 
But Megan, 
I just want you to know, that I waited as long as I could 
I'm better on a summer day when she's around
