The party's over 
A cd's skipping 
It's the same hook repeating 
Grows more grating with each passing second... And the walls contain a resonation, laughter, and conversation. 
It was fun while it lasted, but now we should be going. 
And I hope everybody had real, real good time 
The hospitality's partaken, my head is flying my heart's racing to keep up. 
And I hope I havent overdone it nooo... 
I hope my body can take it. I hope I make the occasion. 
It's only this fucked up I start realizing 
all this living is just dying 
and if these are my friends, if this is my home, 
if this is how Ii spend my nights, how I communicate, and demonstrate a love of life. 
My eyes roll into the back of my head, if these are the last words that I ever said 
No I'm not ready to die just yet.
