[Intro] 
Part two! Ha-ha [Verse] 
Okay, no one on the corner have swagger like me 
Because I'm so incredible, they not compatible to me 
Used to hustle on the B, now I'm onto better things 
Sitting closer to the ring, watch Mayweather swing 
Nigga hold up, yeah I got my dough up 
Thinking I'm the shit in the whip doing donuts 
Yeah nigga sho nuff, put me in a jungle 
Ball like a dog got them looking for a fumble 
Cocky with the flow, more dough, still humble 
Biting nigga's head in the middle of a scuffle 
I ain't with the talking, tussle, homie get muscle 
Fifteen shots in his leg and his upper 
Body bag duffle, the wolves get a supper 
Lord's my chef, but you roll with the leopards 
Spot y'all fake in the dark of the shelter 
Nigga I'm a tiger, rolling with the bears 
My own, my where's Gunter with the heels? 
Say you spent twenty on a watch? Who cares?! 
Drop thirty more just to make a bitch stare 
And added me the chain just to make her give brain 
And all way high, but I'm going insane 
Paid in full, only way to clear your name 
And y'all know me, I ain't lying I'm fly 
Twenty six inch on my rims and tires 
Must be the shit, look at all these flies 
Lord to the God, and I still pay ties 
That's random, way too hot to handle 
Catch me on a beach with my Louis V. sandals 
Rocking me a chain, got to shine like a chandelier 
I appear with them hoes by camera 
Rolling with a bitch that's super thick up out Atlanta 
Mister Do-It-Better-Than-You-Ever 
While I'm sticking to the cheddar in a cashmere sweater 
Looking fly as the propellers what you on 
Tell them get they game up 
Deuces up high, man I'm out for the change up 
Nigga, nigga
