I used to be, 
I used to be out of control 
Now I want to see, 
I want to see deep in your soul 
Where I can breathe, 
Where I could always make you whole 
and fill this need, 
To fill this need to grow inside until I finally reach my goal You used to be, you used to be out of control 
Now you just succeed, 
You just go out and sell my soul 
To fuel this greed, 
Fix broken parts that make you whole 
And fill this need, do you fill the need that always grows inside? You'll never your goal 
Don't stop it now you're on a roll Broken Dreams are what you've seen tonight 
The more you watch the more we'll have to fight Let's turn it on 
It turns me off 
I hope its ends up all right 
They cast their lines and watch us bite. This used to be, this used to be in our control 
Now you're such a scream 
I hear the shouting in your soul 
We're digging deep 
Never planned a way out of this hole 
Now I guess we need 
To fill the need inside us Never ever let us reach our goals 
But don't stop it now you're on a roll Broken Dreams are what you've seen tonight 
The more you watch the more we have to fight 
Let's turn it on 
It turns me off 
I hope its ends up all right 
They cast their lines and watch us I used to be, 
I used to be out of control 
Now I want to see, 
I want to see deep in your soul 
Where I can breathe, 
Where I could always make you whole 
And fill this need, 
To fill this need to grow inside until we finally reached our goal Broken Dreams are what you've seen tonight 
The more you watch the more we'll have to fight 
Let's turn it on....It turns me off...I hope its ends all right 
Turn the channel for us 
Make sure not to bore us 
Cast their lines and watch us bite.
