Monday Mornin' 
The sun wasn't out 
You were lazy 
The fight was last night It didn't set right 
I was hazy 
But you were cool 
Actin' like nothin' happened Time ain't runnin' out 
You hurt me for the last time 
and time ain't runnin' out 
''cause I'm leavin' The thing with the stare 
It just wasn't fair 
You rubbed it in my face And how do I know 
When I'm not around 
He's not takin' my place I'm done with abuse 
Knowing you'll never never admit it to me 
I'm leavin' 
I'm leavin' 
I'm leavin' Maybe some day 
Not far away 
You'll remember this voice Ooooooooh maybe you won't 
Maybe you can't . 
But you were given a choice 
I was ever so close 
But so far away Do you remember 
Do you remember 
Could you remember
