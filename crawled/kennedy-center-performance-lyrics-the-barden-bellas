They say you're a freak when we're having fun 
They say you must be high when we're spreading love 
We're just living life and we never stop 
We got the world 
We got the world world world world world 
World world world world world 
World world world world world 
World world world world world It's going down, I'm yelling timber 
You better move, you better dance 
Let's make a night you won't remember 
I'll be the one you won't forget Woah, woah, woah 
Woah, woah, woah The bigger they are, the harder they fall 
These bigiddy boys are diggidy dogs 
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off 
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber 
Face down, booty up, timber 
That's the way we like to what? 
Timber 
I'm slicker than an oil spill 
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timber They say you're freak 
Woah,woah,woah,woah 
From sea to shining sea I came in like a rainbow 
I never hit so hard in love 
All I wanted was to break your walls 
All you ever did was wreck me I came in like a wrecking ball 
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung 
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall 
All you ever did was wreck me 
Yeah, you, you wrecked me
