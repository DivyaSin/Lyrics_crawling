Its calling for you man, so be real 
That old tree next to your house, 
You know the one with the possum family in it, 
Is creaking under the strain, 
Which is a metaphor for your life, woo. 
Hey sweetcakes, you've got to roll your gold r 
eal flat. 
Sweetcakes roll your gold flat. 
Take the time to talk to old people too 
Often they know a lot about the things that 
Are worrying you, like superannuation, 
Or where to buy Preparation H for piles, 
A very uncomfortable ailment, 
Which is a metaphor for politics, yeah. 
Hey sweetcakes, you've got to roll your gold real flat. 
Sweetcakes roll your gold flat. 
Roll your gold, Roll your gold, Roll your gold, 
Real flat.
