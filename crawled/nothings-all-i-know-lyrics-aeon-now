I've got this pistol 
loaded ready for the game 
but I can't seem to shoot it 
cause I don't know where to aim 
but I guess that in the end 
everything's the same 
I just want to say I'm sorry 
for all the faith I lack 
I just want to see how you look when you 
turn to face the facts I've got a canvas 
whiter than a blind eye's gaze 
I can't seem to stroke it 
cause I'm limited in paints 
but I guess that in the end 
everything's a waste I just need some time to think 
oh no don't leave me here alone 
I just want someone to fill in 
all the lonely space unshown 
I've got a voice 
always rememberin' the words 
I can't seem to sing em 
cause it don't ring like the birds 
but I guess that in the end 
nothing's truly heard I don't need to justify 
my psychotic reveries 
I just want to cultivate 
these sparking new sewn seeds
