Intro: Cinderella looking for the right fella 
Snow white looking for Mr. Right Verse 1: 
All my life 
I've believed 
There's someone out there 
God has for me 
And someone 
God has me for 
In a matter of time 
He'll be at my door 
Our love would be true 
A man for who 
I'd fall deeply in love 
What I've always dreamed of 
Everything I want in a man 
According to God's plan Chorus: Cinderella looking for the right fella 
Snow white looking for Mr. Right 
That only happens in the books 
The real thing isn't as easy as it looks 
He will be 
The man for me 
Mr. right 
Come into my life Verse 2: I wonder what it would be like 
If I met Mr. Right 
If God grants me life 
And I became his wife 
Will I know when we meet 
Will he sweep me off my feet 
Not on a whim 
Will I know it's him Repeat chorus Rap: I'm talking to you 
In what you're going through 
You think you do 
But you don't know who 
You want a man with a plan 
To take you by the hand 
And be everything you've wanted in a man 
You're not gonna meet Mr. Right 
in the club down the street 
So stop wasting your time being indiscreet 
It doesn't matter 
If he's rich or poor 
This is what I'm looking for 
Money doesn't matter as far as I see 
Love is what matters to me 
He could own the business 
Or work on staff 
I'm looking for someone that will make me laugh 
Someone with good judgment 
But how good could his judgment be 
If he's dating me 
(I'm kidding) Bridge: He's got to be 
The one for me Repeat chorus
