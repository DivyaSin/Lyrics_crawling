I heard it from a friend 
A friend of mine 
Could it be the end 
The end of time 
Maybe it's just 
Just pretend 
I don't know 
True love comes once in life 
I used to think it was sugar and spice 
Sugar and spice and all things nice 
I'm not man enough for a girl like you 
Is it her you love 
Well ain't that cute 
You left me for a lover of a different kind
