following footsteps of my thoughts 
they start our scattered 
but each one leads straight back to you 
reach in pull half my heart out 
it cant hurt cause you already broke it in two it sucks when seeing you 
or hearing your voice 
only makes me miss you more poured my heart into this pen 
and pour back out in this letter I'm writing to you 
it tells you of my favorite things 
and all of the memories i have of you infatuation with someone can 
create a reason that their the one you're meant for 
no matter how stupid the reason 
it always finds a way to take control misdirected once again 
and i landed on my face 
a sweet shot of you followed by a bitter chase Those nights we said our last goodbye 
the same nights you made me cry 
cant you see that you are my only everything 
those dreams that i used to call ours 
and thought about for hours 
what would I say if i could say anything 
i guess i'd have to say goodbye please erase the memory 
and numb the pain i feel 
your cutting through me 
as if your words were a blade of steel
