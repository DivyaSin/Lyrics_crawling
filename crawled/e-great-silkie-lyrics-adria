An earthly nurse sits and sings 
And aye she sings of lily-wean 
Saying "Little ken I my bairn's father 
Far less the land that he comes from" 
So he came one night to her bed feet 
And a grumbly guest I'm sure was he 
Saying "Here am I thy bairn's father 
Although I be not comely" 
And he had taken a purse of gold 
And he had placed it on her knee 
Saying "Give to me my little young son 
And take thee up thy nurse's fee 
For I am a man upon the land 
And I am a Silkie on the sea 
And when I'm far and far from land 
My home it is in Sule Skerry 
For it shall come to pass on a summer's day 
When the sun shines bright on every stone 
I'll come and fetch my little young son 
And teach him how to swim the foam 
And ye shall marry a gunner good 
And a right fine gunner I'm sure he'll be 
And the very first shot that ever he shoots 
Will kill both my young son and me 
For I am a man upon the land 
And I am a Silkie on the sea 
And when I'm far and far from land 
My home it is in Sule Skerry"
