Please buy me a ticket to a foreign destination 
Where no one knows my face or knows my name 
Computer screens and peak hour traffic 
Switch me on I'm automatic 
Every single day is just the same 
Any day now I'm gonna walk right out the door 
Any day now I'll tell my boss just what his job is for Welcome to the world, Welcome to the real world 
Welcome to the world, Welcome to the real world Meet me outta Cairo at the market near the station 
Together we can take a midnight train 
We'll fly into the desert sand and leave behind this bedsit land 
Dirty dishes in the sink 
I ain't got no time to think 
Boss is screaming in my ear 
Someone get me outta here 
Any day now I'm gonna walk right out the door 
Any day now I'll tell my boss just what his job is for Welcome to the 
World 
Welcome to the real world 
Welcome to the world, Welcome to the real world
