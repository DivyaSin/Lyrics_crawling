Sometimes I feel like I'm falling from the sky 
And they were just waiting to be loved 
So I stopped to think of you I think I'm for you it's true 
I know I've been gone and so I wrote for you this song Baby you know I've been away 
But every day for me each day I'm gone 
Baby you know I've gone away 
So will you pray for me each day I'm gone I've looked in your eyes and I see this love inside 
A love that is pure is a gift from me to you 
So I've paused to shed a tear, oh wipe away your fears 
I don't want to lose a gift from God to me to you Baby I miss you so 
And I never want to let you go 
My heart goes out to you baby can you 
Come stay with me and I'll promise that 
I'll give you all I can 
It may not be made out of gold 
But this heart I have just cant be so 
I love you 
Yes it's true Baby you know I've gone away 
So will you pray for me each day I'm gone 
Gone 
Baby you know I've gone away 
So will you pray for me each day I'm gone Baby you know I've been away 
But every day for me each day I'm gone 
Baby you know I've gone away
