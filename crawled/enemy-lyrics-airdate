So what do we do now? 
You lost me in the crowd 
If I'm not the perfect one 
You strike me down like I try, I try to figure out 
Where it all began 
But that won't change anything 
So take all of this in 
'Cause this is how it ends You were never there for me back then 
So why should I hold on 
Try to pretend, everything's alright 
I could be your enemy 
And care for what you've done I can taste this hate 
Cutting through the air 
Pushing at my lungs 
And breaking me like I try, I try to figure out 
Are you worth the breath? 
I clear, I clear the air 
And you'd rather forget 
And this is how it ends All useless words 
And all they say 
Is it's staying this way
