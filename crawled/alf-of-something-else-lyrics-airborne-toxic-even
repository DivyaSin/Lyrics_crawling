On the night that we met 
You said that you wanted 
Something more from me 
And it was all that I could do I remember your face, like a child 
The way that you blushed and 
The way that you smiled Now it's all that I can do 
And I wake up feeling new 
There's so much more than I ever knew So I think of all those years spent alone 
It's like you're searching for something 
To make you feel whole 
Like you're half of something else 
Like you're half of something else 
Just a fraction of yourself You take it so hard, we did what we could 
There were no easy answers 
To be understood 
It was all that we could do 
We're the only ones who knew 
Now all I think about is you The way that you screamed 
The way that you cried 
The way that you wiped your eyes 
And fall against my side 
The way that you told 
Told me I was wrong 
And the way that you'd sing 
When you'd hear a song 
And the way that you'd answered 
When you knew I was gone 
Now I know that I'm blind 
And that you're all I see 
And I know it's not clever 
I just want you with me I'm only half of something else 
I'm only half of something else 
I'm only half of something else
