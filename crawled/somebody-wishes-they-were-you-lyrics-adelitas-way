Paralyzed and you don't know why 
Feeling like somebody's fool 
Try to find some peace of mind 
Maybe you're hiding the truth 
Thought it'd be better in a world so cold 
But I want to tell you 
What I've been told Life ain't that bad 
Look what you have 
Yeah, yeah 
When the high's aren't so high 
Just do what you can 
Yeah, yeah 
A world you can change and 
A life you choose 
'Cause somewhere out there, 
Somebody wishes they were you In your eyes, I see the fight 
Of someone with nothing to lose 
Changing laws not set in stone 
'Cause I see a lot left in you 
Thought it'd be better in a world so cold 
But I wanna tell you what I've been told Life ain't that bad 
Look what you have 
Yeah, yeah 
When the high's aren't so high 
Just do what you can 
Yeah, yeah 
A world you can change and 
A life you choose 
'Cause somewhere out there, 
Somebody wishes they were you Live for it
