Well, I can see that you are gone 
You're here with me but you are gone 
It's a matter of time 
'Till you can catch up with your mind 
And you're gone There's nothing I could do, you're gone 
It just caught up to you, you're gone 
Woke up in a place one day 
Apathy in your way 
Now you're gone You're gone 
It's the time 
You're slipping into shade 
You're gone, you're defined 
Now you're left alone to fade For everyone concerned, you're gone 
The point of no return, you're gone 
One day you're gonna find 
You're just a memory in someone else's mind 
And you're gone
