In a land made of string 
Where the hills are balls of twine 
And the doctor knits the sun 
Down in a baseball diamond mine And the mozzarella sweaters 
Get sewn to the tits 
Where the lump behind the sheet 
Is where the tumor took a shit 
And I'll be getting head 
Under the rainbow 
And I'll be getting head 
Under the rainbow 
And I'll be getting head 
Under the rainbow Well we came upon a cracker 
And we all came on this cracker 
And the last one had to eat it 
And she did But she threw it up like a whore 
And the sunshine stabbed right through her 
Like a whore on a skewer 
In the wind
