A meek man built his home out of dirt 
In view of the kings castle 
The king frowned upon the man and ordered it to be torn down 
Is a man the builder, or the arsonist? 
The lion, or the sheep? 
The king, or the peasant? 
The man's wife shivered as they heard a knock upon the door 
And opposite the door was a knight bearing the news from the king 
I have a wife and kids he said 
Where sir, will I live? 
Where sir? 
Where the fuck will I live? 
Do we have enough strength to stand on our own two feet? 
Or have we become too weak? 
The nation's thrones have gathered dust 
Leaders killed by followers 
All because, we didn't wanna be told what to do 
Fuck the man who thinks he is above me 
As a species, we are fucking disgusting 
Are you the lion, or the sheep? 
The king, or the peasant? 
"They bowed their heads to pray for massive strokes and heart attacks"* 
And holy golden rain 
We've been starving our artists 
And feeding our filth 
But it is our shopping mall hierarchy that is keeping us alive 
We're building homes just to burn them down 
Who's the better because of it 
We have nothing 
The man said, "I will not go away as a monster, but as a tragedy"** 
So, he set fire to the town 
And stormed the gates of the castle 
And holding the king by the hair he said, "You are no more than me, and I am no less than you" 
Then he cut and sat upon the throne 
We have nothing
