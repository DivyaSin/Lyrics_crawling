I don't wanna wait for your love First time I placed my eyes on you girl 
My heart said follow through 
What I know now is that I'm way down on your line 
But the waiting feeling's fine 
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string 
Cause I know how to do my thing 
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb 
I wanna know if you're gonna come Say 
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love 
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love 
Say 
I don't wanna wait for your love Like I said 
It's been three years since I'm knocking on your door 
And I still can knock some more 
Ooh girl, ooh girl 
Is it really luck? 
I wanna know 
I wanna know with this for sure You see in life I know 
There's lots of grief 
But your love is my relief Tears in my eyes girl 
Tears in my eyes girl 
Yes I'm waiting 
Yes I'm waiting for my turn Say 
I don't wanna wait for your love Say 
I don't want to wait in vain for your love 
I don't want to wait in vain for your love 
Say 
I don't want to wait in vain for your love The summer is here, and I'm still waiting there 
The winter is here coz I'm still waiting there
