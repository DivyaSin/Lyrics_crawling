WRITTEN BY KEVIN BACON, MICHAEL BACON She woke me up late last night 
She said something don't feel right 
I think it would be best for me 
To get this off my chest you see 
Way back in eighty-two 
Around the time I first met you 
He didn't even mean a thing 
A silly fling 
And she said 
I'm not attracted to those muscle-bound guys 
And she said I prefer a man who's more your size 
And he had a swollen wallet and a swollen head 
There's more to life than being good in bed CHORUS 
Too Much Information 
No I was not aware 
Too Much Information 
What makes you think I care 
I could have made it through this day 
Feeling perfectly O.K. 
Having never heard a single word 
That you just chose to say 
Too Much Information Now he said man it is so weird 
Weird that I should see you here 
'Cause I was just about to write 
Now we're face to face tonight 
At your audition yesterday 
You just blew us all away 
So much style and so much grace 
And what a face 
And he said 
You found the humor and the sadness there 
And he said you got the accent you got the hair 
And he said you've got the soul and you've got the heart 
And by the way 
You didn't get the part CHORUS Ooo don't you send that information my way 
I've had a blow-out on the information highway 
'Cause I'm not Sigmund Freud 
I'm not Carl Jung 
You can keep it on your mind 
But keep it off your tongue 
'Cause I don't want your cross it's more that I can bear 
Let it be my loss what makes you think I care 
I could have made it through this day 
Feeling perfectly O.K. 
Having never heard a single word 
That you just chose to say 
Too Much Information And I said I don't read reviews 
Because they just give me the blues 
When they're bad they're really rough 
When they're good they're not good enough 
They said this one you should read 
Because we all agreed you need 
A little bright spot in your day 
My day was gray I said O.K. 
The critic said 
This music was a nice surprise 
The critic said I did not expect to like these guys 
And he said clever lyrics and an awesome band 
But there's this one song that I can't stand 
Too Much Information 
I really hate that song 
Too Much Information 
Somebody give them the gong 
Too Much Information 
Hated that one a lot 
Too Much Information 
Lennon-McCartney they're not 
Too Much Information 
It had me seeing red 
Too Much Information 
Stick to the movies instead 
Too Much Information 
What an annoying song 
Too Much Information 
Even the ending's too long 
I could have made it through this day 
Feeling perfectly O.K. 
Having never heard a single word 
That you just chose to say 
Too Much Information
