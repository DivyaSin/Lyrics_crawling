I'm still waiting. I'm still waiting. I'm still waiting. I'm still waiting. Like in the desert sun, 
I feel the heat run down, and around my body. 
The warm water feels so right. 
And in the broad daylight, it serves to nullify me. 
Making my heart expand, 
Off into foreign lands, 
Where ancient ships could take me, 
And then the waves come down over me. 
Down over me, down over me. Deep in a heavy fog, 
Out from under a log, I creep just like an insect. 
Down in the mud I stay, 
Lying there five whole days, 
Where no one will come find me. 
And crawling down to the shore, 
I can be so much more than bugs under the soil. 
And then the waves come down over me. 
Down over me, down over me, down over me.
