Let's whisper things into your ear,making sure to discard what you hear.What you know is safe...but she seems to have played this game.Stay on the base...you'll see it's not worth you taking the blame.She looks so pretty that it's such a pity She won't be needing Help for this beating.This city...it's weeping...Things are not what they seem...What is you're...Warm blanket...To me it's every thing all under...Sleep safely...The safest kind of dream's now knowing...it's over...One day you'll hear me sing.Can i give you,all that I hold dear?Till this moment it's been a long hard year.Day in day out I watched my chance go by.Now opportunity is right by my side.Finally all of this makes sense to me.I gotta be the kind of man who lets you be.Finally all of this makes sense to me.I gotta be the kind of man who lets you be.And have to see you running free,with parts of me,gracefully,leaving it so easily.Have you ever ran this race...it all leads to disaster.I'll be the one who's standing straight.I promise I'll be faster.Three things she said to me...don't play with my heart,don't be cruel to me,be honest from the start.Don't mean a word of it,put me on the shelf.You have nothing to give you only love yourself.Finally all this makes sense to me.I gotta be the kind of man who lets you be.Finally all of this makes sense to me.I gotta be the kind of guy who lets you be.And have to see you running free,with parts of me,gracefully,leaving it so easily.Let's whisper...silently...Let's whisper...Only for me.
