Eye shadow hides how I see my day 
Foundation smoothes all the pain away 
Lipstick shapes what I wish to say 
And mascara holds all the tears at bay (Chorus) 
And I say Hey! Is this life for me? 
I say Im cool. Im wearing Maybelline. 
And I say Hey! Is this life for me? 
I say Im cool. Im wearing Maybelline. I do my face and wash my man 
I listen to the books and talk to the land 
I watch the radio and smell the mystery 
My lifes a cereal box or maybe thats just me (Chorus) 
And I say Hey! Is this life for me? 
I say Im cool. Im wearing Maybelline. 
And I say Hey! Is this life for me? 
I say Im cool. Im wearing Maybelline. Is there hope for a girl deep in confusion? 
Will I shed my mask? Is there Resolution? 
Will I come into my own, leave the mask behind? 
Im not asking for much, just a peace of mind I sit and watch my MTV 
Look past the act and what do you see? 
Im just your average everyday teen 
Im a carbon copy of Seventeen Magazine (Chorus) 
And I say Hey! Is this life for me? 
I say Im cool. Im wearing Maybelline. 
And I say Hey! Is this life for me? 
I say Im cool. Im wearing Maybelline.
