Son of a man, great I am, King of Heaven 
Son of God, You hold the measure of my days 
Holy Lamb, spotless Lamb, You are worthy, I am not 
Before Your throne I stand amazed Every tongue confess and every knee will bow 
To Jesus Christ the Lord forever, hear our praises now Your name is matchless, Your name is priceless 
Your name means more than I could know 
You're so far above me, the way that You love me 
Goes further than any love could go Wonderful counselor, root of David, morning star 
You are the way, the truth, the life 
Lion of the tribe of Judah, mighty God is who You are 
The only perfect sacrifice Every tongue confess and every knee will bow 
To Jesus Christ the Lord forever, hear our praises now Your name is matchless, Your name is priceless 
Your name means more than I could know 
You're so far above me, the way that You love me 
Goes further than any love could go In Your name You took the blind man and You gave him back his sight 
In Your name You took the dead man and You brought him back to life 
In Your name You took this prisoner and You opened up the doors 
And I will sing before Your throne forevermore Your name is matchless, Your name is priceless 
Your name means more than I could know 
You're so far above me, the way that You love me 
Goes further than any love could go Your name is matchless, Your name is priceless 
Your name means more than I could know 
You're so far above me, the way that You love me 
Goes further than any love could go
