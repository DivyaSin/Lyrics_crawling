[Verse 1] 
Sitting in the doorway waiting for my day to just go by 
Oh I, Oh I 
I can never seem to feel, good inside 
lately everything is putting me aside. [Pre-Chorus] 
As Time Goes By 
When I feel like this inside 
When I feel like this inside [Chorus] 
No matter where I go, 
You always seem to know, 
Just how to pick me up off the ground again. 
And No matter how much we cry, 
Lets hope there never comes a time, 
When youll leave me alone. [Verse 2] 
Standing here, staring at you 
While you stare back at him. 
I always think, where would I be? 
Without all this pain inside me. 
[Pre-Chorus] 
As Time Goes By 
When I feel like this inside 
When I feel like this inside [Chorus] 
No matter where I go, 
You always seem to know, 
Just how to pick me up off the ground again. 
And No matter how much we cry, 
Lets hope there never comes a time, 
When youll leave me alone. [Instrumental Solo] [Pre-Chorus] 
As Time Goes By 
When I feel like this inside 
When I feel like this inside [Chorus] 
No matter where I go, 
You always seem to know, 
Just how to pick me up off the ground again. 
And No matter how much we cry, 
Lets hope there never comes a time, 
When youll leave me alone.
