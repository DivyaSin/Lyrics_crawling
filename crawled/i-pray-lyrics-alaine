Alaine 
This is my prayer, for you my love. In these troubled time, there is no guarantee 
You'll be coming back safe to me. [Chorus] 
So i clasp my hands and close my eyes 
I'm praying to Jah you'll be alright 
I pray for you, everyday I do 
I get on my knees, hands to the sky 
I'm praying for Jah to be your guide 
I pray for you, every day I do [verse 1] 
Jah protect him 
Watch his steps and bless him 
Be with him I pray 
Jah surround him, may your presence be 
The light to guide his way. 
May the ones who try to make him fall 
Stumble at his feet. 
Give him strength, Oh keep him safe from harm 
Keep him safe for me [Chorus] 
So I clasp my hands and close my eyes 
I'm praying to Jah you'll be alright 
I pray for you, everyday I do 
I get on my knees, hands to the sky 
I'm praying for Jah to be your guide 
I pray for you, every day I do [verse 2] 
Jah prepare him daily for the battles 
That he has to face 
Father spare him from the hands of evil that may cause him pain 
Give him courage in his days to stand up firmly a good man 
Give him wisdom father, 
Keep him for me, keep him in your hands [Chorus]
