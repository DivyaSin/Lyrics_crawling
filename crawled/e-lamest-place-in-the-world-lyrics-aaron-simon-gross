Patrice: 
Down the road, there's a dairy queen 
Up the block, there's a Wall-mart 
Theres a place you can accessorize your pets 
A school, a tree, a couple of churches 
And no matter how hard anybody searches 
Thats about as thrilling as this dumb-ass village gets Its the lamest place in the world 
But it just got a little bit better 
So don't disappear 
Its the lamest place in the world 
But Im pretty sure 
Its not as lame as it was before 
Now that youre here Forty miles to the nearest river 
Sixty miles to the airport 
When we plan our escape, thats where were going to have to be 
Its a shame, its a sham, its a terrible pity 
You got dragged away from New York City 
Its major suck for you but its amazing luck for me Its the lamest place in the world 
But it just got a little bit better 
Im happy to say 
Its the lamest place in the world Your completely exotic 
Intellectual neurotic 
You would never have a shot except 
You've found the perfect guide 
And though I don't really know you 
I can hardly wait to show you Every fake and freak 
Every fool and clown 
Since the Chippewa settled this stupid town 
Let'em laugh 
They wont keep me down 
With you by my side And it just got a little bit better 
Amazing but true 
Yes, the lamest place in the world 
Has lots of flaws 
But maybe it'll be fine because 
It brought me to you
