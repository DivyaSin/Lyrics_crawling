What do you want if you don't want money 
What do you want if you don't want gold 
Say what you want and I'll give it you darling 
Wish you wanted my love baby What do you want if you don't want ermine 
What do you want if you don't want pearls 
Say what you want and I'll give it you darling 
Wish you wanted my love baby Well I'm offering you this heart of mine 
But all you do is play it cool 
What do you want 
Oh boy you're making a fool of me One of these days when you need my kissing 
One of these days when you want me too 
Don't turn around 'cause I'll be missing 
Then you'll wanna my love baby Well I'm offering you a diamond ring 
But all you do is turn me down 
What do you want 
Oh boy you're goin' to town on me One of these days when you need my kissing 
One of these days when you want me too 
Don't turn around 'cause I'll be missing 
Then you'll wanna my love baby 
Well then you'll wanna my love baby
