[Spoken] 
You're free and freedom is beautiful, 
And uh you know it will take time to 
Restore chaos and order, but we, but we will Chaos and order will destroy us 
Gonna be your saviour, and your employer 
So punch it get down on your knees 
Wash up the creator of this disease The worlds doing time 
Don't step outta line it will all be fine 
Just surrender your mind 
Take part in the crime 
Fight out with the swine 
The burning bodies look so pretty 
In the night they shine The dead are not concerned 
The restoration of chaos and order 
Cities crumble and bodies burn 
The restoration of chaos and order 
The dead are not concerned 
The restoration of chaos and order 
The rivers shine when the bodies burn 
The restoration of chaos and order Chaos and order will destroy us 
Gonna be your saviour, and your employer 
So punch it get down on your knees 
Wash up the creator of this disease The worlds doing time 
Don't step outta line it will all be fine 
Just surrender your mind 
Take part in the crime 
Fight out with the swine 
The burning bodies look so pretty 
In the night they shine The dead are not concerned 
The restoration of chaos and order 
Cities crumble and bodies burn 
The restoration of chaos and order 
The dead are not concerned 
The restoration of chaos and order 
The rivers shine when the bodies burn 
The restoration of chaos and order And I'm feeling fine while they shine 
Sleeping with the swine while they shine 
The restoration of chaos and order 
Restoration of chaos and order 
Restoration of chaos and order 
Restoration of chaos and order And I'm feeling fine while they shine 
Sleeping with the swine while they shine 
The restoration of chaos and order 
Restoration of chaos and order 
Restoration of chaos and order 
Restoration of chaos and order 
Chaos and order 
Chaos and order now
