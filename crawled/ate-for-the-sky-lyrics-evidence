I dream what these wings won't do 
'Cause counting sheep is as easy as 1 2 
Jumping out the nest to catch some bird food 
Clutch so intense that the knuckles turn blue 
I been hooped by wise men 
Check horizons, read the flight plan 
Spread the lifespan 
Sky heights are set, it's time to climb these steps 
We only try to get free from the spider's web 
Gotta murder all the messing around 
Carry the burden of work, never setting it down 
With a spot like now, my shot, my chance 
Put a plot of land in the pockets of my pants Break loose, raise roof when the kick drops 
They flew, straight through, no pit stops 
Lift off with your head in the clouds 
Or get lost in the rest of the crowd Been here for too long 
Said it's time to ride 
Got to push it on 
'Cause I aim for the sky 
Times have come and gone 
Yes, it's time to ride 
Early in the morn' Here's a quotable ? 
Slash rap notable 
Slash mic on the ? still controlling you 
I'm rarely candid, my view panoramic 
My eyes wide shut, if not one, I'm holding two 
I'm packing double, getting up too early 
I'm actually trouble, kind of acting 7: 30 
Attracted to this Earth, maybe acting kinda worldly 
But running on my work that says "Ev I better hurry" 
I'd rather worry death than being pushed in the line 
Still a perfect ?, never late when I fly 
Epic ? so this time when I rhyme 
Not an ounce of death dying, stay late to the sky 
Late for my prime, something that was shaped by design 
I been running while the others hurt from racing a line 
Making it great coincides with making it mine 
Coincides with the hate that I'm making in signs 
Let me start from the beginning, I rewind to the top 
Pitch my heart in every inning like I did with the ? 
And it don't stop, a body in motion stays in motion 
Coasting in between the wings of this flowing
