Life, in all it's fragile beauty surrounds me 
Life, it's energy and vigour consume me 
Life, my zest for life and living remain 
Life, the chi flows thick and forceful through my veins The wisdom of her anatomy 
Denies the first to enter the chance to create 
Survivors travel the unknown 
With the knoweldge of the location of their goal 
Each an individual yet all together one
