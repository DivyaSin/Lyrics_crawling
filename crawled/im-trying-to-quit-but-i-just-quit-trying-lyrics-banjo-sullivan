Adam, you like having a drink or two 
Sometimes twenty if you're feelin' blue 
Sometimes one in the morning, so you can get out of bed 
Ya like Jim, ya like Jack, ya like Makers Mark 
Drinking in the daytime, drinking in the dark 
Drinking with a crowd, drinking alone 
Drinking in the shower, or drinking on the phone I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying 
Tried to hide it but I'm bad at lying 
So I'm still drinking if you're still buying 
I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying Roy you like women but you're a married man 
Sneaking around every chance you can 
The feminine nation's gonna be the ruination of you 
You like brunettes, redheads and bottled blonds 
Pulling them jeans off, and mowing them lawns 
You're staring down the barrel, it's the same ole' song 
'Cause your wife and your girlfriend can't seem to get along I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying 
Having several women is death-defying 
If there's eggs to break, I can't help but fry em' 
I'm trying to quit but I just quit trying Roy you like smoking my cheap homegrown 
That Mexican Lettuce sure gets you stoned 
You cotton-mouth so dry 
You'll drink the water from my bong 
You like Cencimilla Red and Acapulco Gold 
Maui Waui and resin from the bowl 
But we ain't wrote a song in so long I don't know 
And now Johnny Law's waiting for us after the show I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying 
So roll me a joint and I'll start flying 
Made us laugh so hard that we both started crying 
I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying 
I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying 
I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying
