Wait for our moon 
Covered in ribbon so I can 
Present it to you Friend of a friend 
They mentioned you and me 
I'm lost in you Princess in a white dress 
Queen in a dream 
Princess in a white dress 
Queen in a dream Let's go outside and admire shooting stars 
It's true, I do 
You leave the scene, so quiet and patiently 
I'm lost without you Princess in a white dress 
Queen in a dream 
Princess in a white dress 
Queen in a dream Queen in a dream 
Queen in a dream 
Queen in a dream 
Queen in a dream Wait for our moon
