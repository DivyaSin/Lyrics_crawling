Oh, it feels like you want it 
A taste of living 
Oh, just a drop in the water 
And I'm trying to will myself against a better path

Oh, it seems like you want it 
And I'm fighting to live my life in a better way

Lay down, lay down on me now 
Stay down, stay down with me now 
And I'm trying to live my life in a better way 
Lay down, lay down on me

Oh, you should be there

You're coming with me 
You're coming with me 
You're coming with me 
You're coming with me 
Lay down, lay down on me now 
Stay down, stay down with me now 
Lay down, lay 
Oh, lay down, lay 
Oh, lay down, lay 
Oh, lay down, lay
