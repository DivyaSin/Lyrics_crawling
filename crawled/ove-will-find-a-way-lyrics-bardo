Picture walking, a dusty road 
Summer breeze on my body flows 
Dreaming of a blue horizon 
Meet me where the sun is shining He's coming for my love 
He's the one I'm thinking of 
Let me show you what I mean 
We'll be living in a dream Can't stop thinking about your love 
Light shining down on my whole life 
Wanting you to stay 
I know that love will find a way 
Each night I stare into the stars 
Each night I wonder where you are 
I know that love will find a way Secret paradise at rainbow's end 
There in the distance we meet again 
Have you been on your best behaviour 
We can talk about it later 
He's coming for my love 
He's the one I'm thinking of 
Let me show you what I mean 
We'll be living in a dream Can't stop thinking about your love 
Light shining down on my whole life 
Wanting you to stay 
I know that love will find a way 
Each night I stare into the stars 
I wonder where you are 
I know that love will find a way We will find 
Love this time 
Shining down 
Each night I stare into the stars 
I wonder where you are 
Can't stop thinking about your love 
Light shining down on my whole life 
Wanting you to stay 
I know that love will find a way 
Each night I stare into the stars 
I wonder where you are 
I know that love will find a way
