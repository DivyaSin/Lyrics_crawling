There's four cruisers flashing in my rear view 
They're not gonna take me out, Id watch it, what'd you do now? 
There's four cruisers weighing on my conscience 
There is one thing for sure, this is not a fucking love song My fear is gone, and still I don't know why 
I waited for so long to let you know 
(I'm not goin' back) 
Now this is all your fault and theres no one left to blame 
Did you think wed make it out? Did you know? Do you know? 
Oh, yeah Somewhere out there 
Theres a man on the ground who ain't livin' anymore 
And his name is written on my knuckles 
Take me, take my fuckin' burden There's four cruisers flashing in my rear view 
They're not gonna take me out, Id watch it, what'd you do now? 
In each cruiser is a man with his gun 
And his fancy little bullets with my name on 'em My fear is gone, and still I don't know why 
I waited for so long to let you know 
(I'm not goin' back) 
Now this is all your fault and theres no one left to blame 
Did you think wed make it out? Did you know? Hey, hey, ho, ho, wild chase to the open road 
Hey, hey, ho, ho, this car is too fuckin' slow 
Hey, hey, ho, ho, wild chase to the open road 
Hey, hey, ho, ho, this car is too fuckin' slow Don't know where I'm going, I'm not slowing down 
And I'll die before I stop this fuckin' car 
Street lights and white lines 
This is all I have left, this is all I have A flashing lights and racing hearts 
Will you ever just slow down? 
How did we end up here? 
And all those sirens are getting louder Flashing lights and racing hearts 
I don't think we're gonna make it out 
(This won't end well) 
Make it out 
(This won't end well)
