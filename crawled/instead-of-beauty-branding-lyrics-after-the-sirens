I meant to see you one more time 
in that white dress splashed with brine 
from the northern coast 
where we learned our lessons the first time. A line assigned to paper, 
maybe lines under the eyes. 
We meant to write each other, 
but it never quite worked out right. Your eyes were light when there was no light. The cans are scuttling; 
the end of summer brings an allergy to common things. 
And you could be on an eastbound train in half a day 
but I wouldn't meet you 
except on paper and maybe film.
