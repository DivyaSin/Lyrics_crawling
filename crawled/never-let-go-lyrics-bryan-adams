Can you lay your life down, so a stranger can live? 
Can you take what you need but take less than you give? 
Could you close everyday without the glory and fame? 
Could you hold your head high when no one knows your name? 
That's how legends are made, at least that's what they say We say goodbye but never let go 
We live, we die 'cause you can't save every soul 
Gotta take every chance to show that you're the kinda man 
Who will never look back, never look down and never let go Can you lose everything, you ever had planned? 
Can you sit down again and play another hand? 
Could you risk everything for the chance of being alone? 
Under pressure find the grace or would you come undone? 
That's how legends are made, at least that's what they say? We say goodbye, but never let go 
We live, we die 'cause you can't save every soul 
Gotta take every chance to show that you're the kinda man 
Who will never look back, never look down and never let go Never let go, never let go, never let go 
Gotta take every chance to show that you're the kinda man 
Who will never look back, never look down and never let go We say goodbye but never let go 
We live, we die but you can't save every soul 
Gotta take every chance to, show that you're the kinda man 
Who will never look back, never look down and never let go Will never look back, never look down and never let go 
Never let go, never let go, never let go
