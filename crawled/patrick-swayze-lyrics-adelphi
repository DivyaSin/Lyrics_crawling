lover i saw a pink sun fade away 
and loved her so long night turned into to day 
i'm so lost where have you gone 
i'm so lost where have you gone 
lover i felt several blades of grass 
and rested there till one whole year had past 
i'm so lost where have you gone 
i'm so lost where have you gone 
when will i have you like the sky 
where we can use the clouds to hide 
so we can swim around in blue and white 
and i can feel your sun from both sides 
i'm so lost where have you gone 
i'm so lost where have you gone 
we'll put these hopes into the sky 
we'll flood the sun and drown the earth in our light 
cause i'm so lost where have you gone
