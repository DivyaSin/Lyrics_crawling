Chasing memories and fears 
Running in this rain of tears 
My wings are black and heavy 
They try so hard to reach you 
My world is empty 
Cant take it 
One more try And I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger hold me in your arms oh 
I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger see my world tonight oh And I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger hold me in your arms oh 
I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger see my world tonight oh Never finding what I mean 
And its far from how I dream 
My wings are black and heavy 
They try so hard to reach you 
My lips cant call you 
They whisper sad goodbyes And I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger hold me in your arms oh 
I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger see my world tonight oh And I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger hold me in your arms oh 
I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger see my world tonight oh And I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger hold me in your arms oh 
I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger see my world tonght oh And I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger hold me in your arms oh 
I feel, I feel like an angel 
Beautiful, so stranger see my world tonght oh
