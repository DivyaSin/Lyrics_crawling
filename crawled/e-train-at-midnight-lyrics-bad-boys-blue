I've travelled 'round so many lands 
The time was melting in my hands 
And where the desert meets the sky 
I saw the fires die 
All years have come and gone 
But still my love for you is strong 
I'm coming back from shadowland 
I'm coming back, give me your hand 
Can't you hear the train? 
The train at midnight 
Can't you hear the train? 
The train at midnight 
The train at midnight 
Have I been far away too long? 
Our feelings dead and gone 
Will it all end in hurt and pain 
It matches end in rain 
The world keeps turning on and on 
And the still the fever's growing strong 
I'm coming back, I'm on my way 
I'm coming back, give me your hand 
Can't you hear the train? 
The train at midnight 
Can't you hear the train? 
The train at midnight 
The train at midnight 
Can't you hear the train? 
The train at midnight 
The train at midnight 
The train at midnight 
Can't you hear the train? 
The train at midnight 
The train at midnight 
I'm coming back from shadowland 
I'm coming back, give me your hand 
Can't you hear the train? 
The train at midnight 
Can't you hear the train? 
The train at midnight 
The train at midnight 
The train at midnight 
Can't you hear the train?
