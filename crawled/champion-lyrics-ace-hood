People said I wouldn't make it, that I'd never get to the top 
There was nothing they could say that would make me stop 
So I had to keep pushing through the pain and the tears 
All the things I've been through is why I'm standing here That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
They was wrong, this the song of a champion 
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
Let me see your hands up if you a champion Coming up I use to watch TV look up at the screen 
Then look at my mama tell her ma that's gon' be me 
She said son you gon' be great, I knew it from the start 
Your daddy was a poet that's how he captured my heart It's in my blood, you ask me why I keep it real 
Like talkin' in the flow asking how a nigga feel 
Imagine how it feels 
Waking up to nothing is enough to give you chills Waking up to nothing is enough to make you kill 
Enough to bring your daughter on a heist, unreal 
You said you gotta song living life unreal 
That's why I put my life in every song I kill, sing it girl That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
They was wrong, this the song of a champion 
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
Let me see your hands up if you a champion I had a job too, niggas so what? 
You haters make me laugh, how you hatin' so much? 
Go head and do the math, watch the numbers add up 
Picture me and Khaled rollin' to the Grammys, messed up 
Keep running to The Runners when it's time to make a I'm gunning at you suckas who ain't tryna feel this shit 
[Incomprehensible] blastin' out a niggas whip 
Throwing up a peace sign to all my hustlas on the strip 
Top down in the Chevy yeah, you know I keep it pimpin' And my pistol heavy, niggas know that ain't slippin' 
Know that I'm on the grind, niggas know that ain't slippin' 
My faith is on the line so you know I ain't slippin' 
You trippin' and that's why That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
They was wrong, this the song of a champion 
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
Let me see your hands up if you a champion Ladies put your hands up high 
Came too far now to give up 
We gotta keep reaching for the sky 
It don't even matter say what you want Fellas put your hands up in the sky 
Nothing you could say that'll make me stop 
We gotta keep reaching for the sky 
I'ma keep going till I reach the top and that's why Definitely livin' life, I gravitated to the light 
I sacrificed a decade, now it's times every night 
Let them suckas' spectate 'cause shorty I expect that 
We still touching big weight and surely I invest that Break it down the best way 'cause I know how to stretch that 
Haters talking sideways and I could never stress that 
Ready for the war though, I would never compromise 
Mammy call me Gordo, you shine like summer time That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
They was wrong, this the song of a champion 
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
Let me see your hands up if you a champion That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
They was wrong, this the song of a champion 
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing 
Let me see your hands up if you a champion People said I wouldn't make it, that I'd never get to the top 
There was nothing they could say that would make me stop 
So I had to keep pushing through the pain and the tears 
All the things I've been through is why I'm standing here
