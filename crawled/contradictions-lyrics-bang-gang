All my yesterdays have flown away 
And it's better now 
It's better now All my dreams have gone away 
And I don't know how 
Oh, I don't know how Lately in my dreams 
Maybe all's not really what it seems 
Contradictions 
Lately in my dreams 
I know, wonder what it means 
Contradictions Contradictions 
All my yesterdays make sense somehow 
Cause they've flown away 
It's another day 
All my dreams have gone away 
Where they went I don't know 
It's just so 
Lately it's so strange 
All has fallen off and gone away 
Contradictions 
Wonder what it means 
It's so... 
That's all that it seems Contradictions 
While I'm having fun 
I still wonder 
When will it be done 
Contradictions 
It's all fine, and why? 
Don't know 
Wondering and why... Contradictions
