Oh I've been touched and I've been touched 
And it's too much and it's too much And in the ocean and in the sea 
The red core over is in me You need only say the word 
That kissing like a humming bird And I've been touched and I've been touched 
And it's too much and it's too much You feel sunken And I've been working for a long time 
I never did commit no crime And on my dreams they all came true 
The day I laid my head on you The day that you crept up and died 
Turned black fruitful from inside And you need only say the word 
Gonna kiss you like a humming bird And don't know where I'm going so 
I'm gonna lay down in the snow And I feel touched and i feel touched 
And it's too much and it's too much And in the ocean and in the sea 
The red core over is in me
