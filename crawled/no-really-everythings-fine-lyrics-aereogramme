The reason we're all disfigured 
I will say it again 
The reason we're all disappointed 
With innocence lost 
You're alone 
You can feel the resentment 
Burning a pathway 
Straight to your heart 
I saw kingdom come Maybe your life is wonderful 
I wish you well 
Please understand I won't change you 
So grant me the same 
I know this 
There's a plain white horizon 
I want it so badly 
It seems after all 
That you will be done And it's done 
Reaching on out 
And it's done We are all defenceless now 
On your own you left somehow 
With these broken bones 
These broken bones But I am one with these chains 
Come around and I regain 
With my broken bones 
My broken bones The reason we're all disfigured 
I will say it again 
The reason we're all disappointed 
With innocence lost 
You're alone 
You can feel the resentment 
Burning a pathway 
Straight to your heart 
I saw kingdom come
