Searching the shore for your footprints in the sand. 
Looking for ships against the distant land. 
From where you came I don't remember 
But to hurt me like you did, 
I cannot understand. Counting all the sea shells on the beach, 
Watching as they're swept into the sea. 
Hoping that the ships try and reach 
out to the pretty pieces that are free. Why can't I find you? I'm feeling so wrong. 
The roads keep winding on, and now I'm just lost. 
Why can't you love me? What did I do wrong? 
The waves keep rolling on, But you'll always be gone. I watch the birds that dance around my head. 
Puttering over top the ocean bed. 
Why you left me, I can't remember. 
But I'll forever recall this numb september. Why can't I find you? I'm feeling so wrong. 
The roads keep winding on, and now I'm just lost. 
Why can't you love me? What did I do wrong? 
The waves keep rolling on, But you'll always be gone. Why did you leave me? 
And how could you want to? 
Now in every gust of wind I smell the scent of your skin. 
And down at the bay, 
I try to escape. 
I look for hope. But all that may be 
Is a vast open sea. Why can't I find you? I'm feeling so wrong. 
The roads keep winding on, and now I'm just lost. 
Why can't you love me? What did I do wrong? 
The waves keep rolling on, But you'll always be gone.
