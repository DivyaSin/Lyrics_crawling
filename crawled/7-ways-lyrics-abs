I don't know who, but it wasn't me 
He wasn't all that you'd thought he'd be 
And then broke your heart 
Girl you should have let me know 
'Cause you left it kind of hard for me to show Just how it feels when I'm next to you 
'Cause them other girls ain't nothing next to you 
No doubt in my mind 'cause I know it's you 
So tell me lady what you wanna do 'Cause loving you, it's all that I know girl, why would I lie? 
If you want me to, I'll give you just a little more time to decide 
If I could be your anything, 'cause you to me are everything I'm talking to the mirror at 5am 
Waiting for your call in the pouring rain 
Sugar coated kiss and a lipstick mark 
There are 7 ways of breaking my heart Wasted conversation and bad TV 
Loosing our original chemistry 
Walking like I'm dancing on priceless art 
There are 7 ways of breaking my heart Turn off the TV, we need to talk about the way 
'Cause I thought I heard you say 
Something 'bout not being there for you 
So what do I have to do to show I care for you I'm saying I could be the one, no more playing girls for fun 
Baby let me prove I got just what you need 
If you give me half a chance to romance you 
'Cause you make me feel complete 'Cause loving you is all that I know girl, why would I lie? 
If you want me to, I'll give you just a little more time to decide 
If I could be your anything, 'cause you to me are everything I'm talking to the mirror at 5am 
Waiting for your call in the pouring rain 
Sugar coated kiss and a lipstick mark 
There are 7 ways of breaking my heart Wasted conversation and bad TV 
Loosing our original chemistry 
Walking like I'm dancing on priceless art 
There are 7 ways of breaking my heart A couple of nights gone by 
She ain't called yet and I don't know why 
Could it be I didn't give enough attention or was it 
Something I said or didn't mention Slow down, too damn fast 
Bounce with another chick with a fine ass 
Not me, got the other girl on hold 
I was on line 2 she was going all cold 'Cause loving you is all that I know girl, why would I lie? 
If you want me to I'll give you just a little more time to decide 
If I could be your anything 'cause you to me are everything I'm talking to the mirror at 5am 
Waiting for your call in the pouring rain 
Sugar coated kiss and a lipstick mark
