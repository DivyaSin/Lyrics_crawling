Among the strange it had to be 
Over the gems, over the ice 
Sheltered from the sun Pissed in a cup in 
The corner of what seems like a box 
Trapped in the game 
I know it's right 
and sheltered from the pain And captain tells us to enjoy 
No one can smell the cobwebs and moss 
I know this sounds ambiguous 
But here's a different tune One more day we raise the captain 
The futile gesture isn't empty....yet
