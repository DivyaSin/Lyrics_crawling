Taylor: Once upon a time, 
Before i was insane, 
I dated this Disney guy, 
Joe Jonas was his name. 
But he broke up with me. Joe: You're just way too creepy, 
Plus I've found someone else his name's Mickey 
(Mickey: Oh Ho!) 
Taylor: So i wrote a song, 
About his stupid ass. 
Then found this guy named john, 
But that was over fast. 
If you don''t marry me, 
I will pull out your teeth! John: You're totally crazy! 
Taylor: No! 
John: Yes! 
Taylor: No! 
John: Yes! 
Taylor: Maybe! *HAHAHAHA!* He hit me with his guitar, 
And he said that, 
John: We are through! 
Taylor: Just you wait until I, write a song about you! Then i met that Jake Gyllenhaal dick. 
And was obsessed right away. 
Jake: You've sent me one thousand messages. 
(Taylor: AHAHHA!) 
And that's just from today! Taylor: Oh, that's because i'm having your baby. 
Jake: What? But you don't even put out. 
Taylor: Stop questioning me Jakey, 
Or i'll punch you six feet under ground! Jake: Whoa! 
Whoa! 
Psycho! 
Psycho! 
Psycho! 
Taylor: Fine, go! 
Its good material! Next came Kennedy 
I think he was 15. 
I bought the house next door, 
To watch you constantly. 
And also to make sure, you never ever cheat! 
Kennedy: OMG we are done you are scary! Taylor: Harry was my last, 
That One Direction freak! 
I taped him to my wall, so he could never leave. 
Harry: Someone call the police! 
You're insane we are through! 
Taylor: You're just like all the rest, what did i do to you? So i used my stalker app, 
To track down all of the pricks! 
The next song, i write, 
I'll use their blood as my ink! 
Hey! 
Jake: Holy crap that nut job just bursted in!
