Your Presence is all I need 
It's all I want, all I seek and 
Without it, without it there's no meaning 
Your Presence is the air I breathe 
The song I sing, the love I need and 
Without it, without it I'm not living 
I will exalt You, Lord, I will exalt You, Lord 
There is no one like You God 
I will exalt You, Lord, I will exalt You, Lord 
No other name be lifted high 
There will be no one like You 
And no one beside You 
You alone are worthy of all praise 
There will be no one like You 
And no one beside You 
You alone are worthy of all praise
