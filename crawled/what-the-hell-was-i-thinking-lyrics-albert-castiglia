What the Hell was I thinkin? 
What the hell I was thinking 
I'll never do it again 
What the hell was I thinkin 
I say it time and time again 
I was makin promises 
That I just can't keep 
What the hell was I thinkin 
I think I'm in it deep I got in situations 
And the fault was mine 
On account of Grey Goose vodka, 
Triple Sec and Rose's lime 
I was so falsely guided 
And whispered in her ear 
Stop this room from spinnin 
And get me outta here 
What the hell I was thinkin 
I'll never do it again 
What the hell was I thinkin 
I say it time and time again 
I was makin promises 
That I just can't keep 
What the hell was I thinkin 
I think I'm in it deep I run my mouth in West Texas 
Lost my mind in Tenesee 
Got run out of liquor 
With the Law escortin me 
But there's still love in Pomeroy 
And I can't believe 
Down East of Magnolia 
They still put up with me What the hell was I thinkin 
I say it time and time again 
What the hell was I thinkin 
I'll never do it again 
I was makin promises 
That I just can't keep 
What the hell was I thinkin 
I think I'm in it deep 
Oh, what the Hell was I thinkin? 
Lord, I think I'm in it deep 
Oh, what the Hell was I thinkin? 
Lord, I think I'm in it deep
