Oh, I'm brushing my teeth on top 
It's so much fun, I hate to stop But while I'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun 
I never let the water run, no I never let the water run Oh, I'm brushing my teeth on the bottom 
'Cause I wouldn't wanna say that I forgot em' But while I'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun 
I never let the water run, no, I never let the water run Oh, I'm brushing my teeth in back 
Gotta get rid of all the plaque But while I'm brushing my teeth and having so much fun 
I never let the water run, no, I never let the water run 
I never let the water run, no, I never let the water run Oh, I'm brushing my teeth all around 
'Cause I like to hear the squishing sound But while I'm brushing my teeth and having so much 
I never let the water run, no, never let the water run
