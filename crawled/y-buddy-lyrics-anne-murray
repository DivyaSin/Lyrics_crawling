Life is a book that we study. 
Some of it's leaves bring a sigh. 
There it was written, my Buddy, 
That we must part, you and I. Nights are long since you went away. 
I think about you all through the day, 
My buddy, my buddy, 
Nobody quite so true. Miss your voice, the touch of your hand 
Just long to know that you understand, 
My buddy, my buddy, 
Your buddy misses you. Miss your voice, the touch of your hand 
Just long to know that you understand, 
My buddy, my buddy, 
Your buddy misses you.
