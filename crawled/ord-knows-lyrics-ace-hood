Dear lord 
I understand all the problems I'm about to express to you 
Are things you already know 
Well here goes nothing Dear lord I am on my knees and I'm begging please 
Just guide me father this time I'm really in need 
Feeling like I just can't go on, mama cryin' and she lost her home 
Tears runnin all down her face, judge gave her ten days to be gone 
My god what I'm gon' do now, so stressed that the day go by 
Devil on me and I don't know why , beg mama just please don't' cry 
Times get a little rough I know, when it come to givin' up I don't 
Got twins and they on their way, see 'em starve in the bed I won't 
Sometimes I ask myself would I be a good father 
'Cause I've never had mine, would I give the world to my daughters 
Live and you learn, reap what you sow 
Regardless of wealth, grind like ? Chorus: 
Only lord knows what the hell I dun' really been through 
All the nights I ain't have no food 
Dear god tell me what I'm gonna do 
Man only lord knows all the times I was under my grind 
He helped what I never could find, reach out when I couldn't get a dime 
Man only lord knows, lord knows, lord knows 
Man only lord knows what the hell I dun' really been through 
All the nights my mama couldn't move 
And all the pain I dun' put her through 
Man only lord knows And I'm sick and tired of this pain 
Hate the lames in this game only down because of my name 
Rock Swiss because of my fame 
Lord knows the road where I came, lord know the nights that I cried 
Can't help the pain that's inside, lord wipe the tears from my eyes 
Ever seen the letter of eveiction, no place to go but you wishin 
That a blessing come and you lifted, yeah dog that's all in my vision 
I dun' been through hell and them trenches, I dun' seen the best of them fall 
Lost a couple of my dogs, miss them niggas like shit 
But they still reside in my heart, sore, ached and I'm scarred 
I''ma do it for Dale and Four Fifth, God damn it's hard 
Motherfuck this rapping, I really live this shit 
Blood, sweat and tears, I really live this shit [Chorus] And everyday that I wake, I grind, no time never wait for mine 
Still waiting on the day I shine my soul, every bar, every line 
I remember when I had no food, lights off, bills overdue 
Lord knows that I've paid my dues, won't forget when I got that news 
They say my mama sickly thank god she seen her fifties 
I pray and ask forgiveness, please lord just keep her with me 
I was down and out, remember that like yesterday 
Made it out that struggle bracket, this year I'm blessed to say 
Man this world's so fucked up, gas prices are way too high 
Time's hard and I ain't gon' lie, bust ass just to try and get by 
So who the hell is y'all to be judging, made it away from literally nothing 
Yeah I'm talking literally nothing [Chorus] And only lord knows 
I thank you jesus for guiding me, 
For keeping me 
In your name, I pray 
And only lord knows
