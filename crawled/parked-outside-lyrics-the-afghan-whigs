If time can incinerate what I was to you 
Allow me to illustrate how the hand becomes the fuse 
If they've seen it all, show em somethin' new 
And put out your innocence or you're gonna be smoke 
When she turns out the lights You're gonna make me break down and cry Divine in her disarray, pinnacle her persuasion 
On her cross you lay 
Serial supplication 
Defy your beating heart 
Only trouble can save me 
Take a walk on the river and then- 
Suffer your superstition again You're gonna make me break down and cry And you can't forget tomorrow 
When somebody wants to take you down You're gonna make me break down and cry
