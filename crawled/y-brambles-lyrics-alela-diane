Sun is dancing, my darling 
Arms been holding me all morning 
The sea is so far from home, my darling If we'd only feet it is here that we'd roam 
Oh, if we'd just two feet it is here that we'd roam 
And your arms would be keeping me all day 'Cause your love calms my brambles 
And your hands bring me sweet lavender 
Oh, your love clams my brambles 
And your hands bring me sweet lavender Oh, oh, oh, oh The glow will dance into the mountains 
And darkness falls upon the canyon 
And when the heat is gone, my darling 
Please come gather me Please come gather me oh, please come gather me oh 
Please come gather me, my darling 
Please come gather me oh, please come gather me oh 
Please come gather me, my darling 'Cause your love calms my brambles 
And your hands bring me sweet lavender 
Oh, your love clams my brambles 
And your hands bring me sweet lavender Oh, oh, oh, oh
