I'm in way over my head, 
Can't the find sunset over me 
The mirror in front of my bed 
Sees the one I said I'd never be 
Try to escape from the storms, 
Spinning over like a hurricane 
Can't get away in the dark 'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now 
Only God believes you know this now 
Just hold on to faith when we're still young 
We were born to run 
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now 
Only God believes you know this now 
Just hold on to faith when we're still young 
We were born to run The stolen innocence 
weights on my shoulders 
It's heavy now 
These broken nights we spend 
They shine through the cracks till they way out 
Try to escape from the storms, 
Spinning over like a hurricane 
Can't get away in the dark 'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now 
Only God believes you know this now 
Just hold on to faith when we're still young 
We were born to run 
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now 
Only God believes you know this now 
Just hold on to faith when we're still young 
We were born to run 'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now 
Only God believes you know this now 
Just hold on to faith when we're still young 
We were born to run 
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now 
Only God believes you know this now 
Just hold on to faith when we're still young 
We were born to run 'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now 
Only God believes you know this now 
Just hold on to faith when we're still young 
We were born to run
