how am i 
supposed to feel 
i thought we had an agreement 
and really not 
i believed it 'cause always we'd 
ignore your demons 
the world is full of victims pray 
disappointment 
an' it betrayed you and you wanted out 
yeah you you got out it's a band 
it's a bowl 
you saw something to live for 
i saw more than hands 
was plain as from steps it made me sick 
and i still haven't fully 
comprehended it this world cannot be saved 
true love will not be found 
it's all on stable ground 
i've always understood 
where you came from but you were wrong 
yeah we were wrong it's almost done 
it is the last fuck up 
the last song i'll ever write for anyone 'cause we wanted out 
and you you got out
