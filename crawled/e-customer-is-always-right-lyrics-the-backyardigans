There's a problem here, what do you mean? 
We came to see something we haven't seen 
That's not our fault, we really tried 
Well not enough, we're not satisfied 
And I don't mean to be a jerk 
But let me tell you 'bout how these things work See, I am the customer 
And the customer is always right 
She's right 
I am the customer 
And the customer is always right We've done the best that we can do 
This awesome ride is almost through 
This awesome swamp with awesome stuff 
Well, I just think it's not enough 
And you think right my purple friend 
And I'd say this is not the end Cause I am the customer 
And the customer is always right 
Oh, yeah 
You are the customer 
And the customer is always right
