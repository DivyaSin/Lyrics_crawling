I drank the poison, 
You took the pills, 
It didnt get us anywhere. 
We called the help line to confess our crimes, 
There wasnt anybody there. Like a self-portorat of Vincent Van Gough, 
Like a traveler in the rain, 
Like a mother finally letting go, 
We all learn to live with pain. I know why you hurt me, 
I know why I let you, 
The more you hurt me, 
The more I can feel you. 
It's strange, so strange, this pain, 
This pain that I love. The fortune tellers they forge the future, 
They never give you the bad news, 
So I went undercover, 
I saw your lover, 
But Im still here with you. Like a self-portorat of Vincent Van Gough, 
Like a traveler in the rain, 
Like a mother finally letting go, 
We all learn to live with pain. I know why you hurt me, 
I know why I let you, 
The more you hurt me, 
The more I can feel you. 
It's strange, so strange, this pain, 
This pain that I love, that I love. I know why I let you, 
The more you hurt me, 
The more I can feel you. 
It's strange, so strange, this pain, 
This pain that I love, that I love.
