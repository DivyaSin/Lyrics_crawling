On the edge of reason, beyond understanding 
Silent she waits, perfect oblivion 
She's crawling to the end, perfect oblivion I live behind mirrors within a prison without any bars 
Yet I remain lost to the world 
In hell I'm suspended within a prism 
So many walls, so many years, so many lives 
Too often I've watched them die Images of yesterday feeling so far away I can't let go of the past, the years, the sweet romance 
I am a ticking time bomb waiting in a trance 
I need you more tonight than you will ever know 
I swear to never forget this heartbreaking dance The hell of being trapped is simply not a match for death 
Heaven awaits 
Now I know not to be afraid of the end 
My love awaits, will you be there? Take me away 
I'm ready, I'll be home soon Images of yesterday feeling so far away I can't let go of the past, the years, the sweet romance 
I am a ticking time bomb waiting in a trance 
I need you more tonight than you will ever know 
I swear to never forget this heartbreaking dance Beautiful pure silence, come on! Embrace me 
Sweet perfect nothing swallow my fears, come on 
If I had just one wish I'd choke prophets, hang angels, burn children 
Oh, I'd drink oceans, eat the moon, flood the world, end everything Breathe in, breathe out 
We could run far away but then how would we sleep at night I've been looking for the words to say our last goodbyes 
Hold on to fleeting hopes that I just might survive Give in to the pleasure 
Make it last forever 
Hold on hold on to everything we are
