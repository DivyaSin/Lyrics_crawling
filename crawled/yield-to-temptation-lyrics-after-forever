They told you not to yield to temptation 
And opened their arms, 
Make your own inferences... Inscrutable chaos in my head, inevitably 
Greed will take its toll 
Why? 
There's no place to hide 
Let me free myself The anathema's driving millions, 
Together in the pustules of our earth 
Greed and self-denial, 
The cause of unimpeded desecration of the truth They told you not to yield to temptation, 
But offered you only hypocrisy and ruin The phantom of damnation 
Threw her coat over humanity They told you not to yield to temptation, 
But offered you only hypocrisy and ruin They told you not to yield to temptation, 
But offered you only hypocrisy and ruin Captive in the shackles of this indoctrination, 
Depraved souls wished to be pure 
Delight in deformity, 
The last convulsions are building up 
A bridge to a new era The assumption of a faded supposition, 
Never shall I be a marionette The embrace that smothers...
