Break out all the mechanical 
Step right up to the freaky and tangible 
Hands uncuffed, take the leash on this animal 
If it's getting hyphy hit me with a night stick 
Slip right into your stripper shoes 
Roll the dice, I got snake eyes and deja vu 
Poppin' off, fire melted with bally-hoo? 
Tune in (tune in) 
Turn on (turn on) 
Drop out Going down the rabbit hole 
Get away from all we know 
Come on, follow 
Come on and follow me 
Going down the rabbit hole 
Even hoes and gigolos 
Come on, follow 
Come on and follow me Quick slow high or low 
You're never gonna know for sure 
See in stereo 
Down the rabbit hole Catnip and honey, teatime and all over town 
(all over town, all over town) 
Houses of candy, build 'em up and then burn them down 
(burn 'em down, just burn em down) 
It melts in your face and not in your arm? 
It starts in the bass and it ends in the crystal ball Going down the rabbit hole 
Get away from all we know 
Come on, follow 
Come on and follow me 
Going down the rabbit hole 
Even hoes and gigolos 
Come on, follow 
Come on and follow me Disco rodeo 
My kaleidoscope 
Cleopatra knows 
What's down the rabbit hole Going down the rabbit hole 
Get away from all we know 
Come on, follow 
Come on and follow me 
Going down the rabbit hole 
Even hoes and gigolos 
Come on, follow 
Come on and follow me Quick slow high or low 
You're never gonna know for sure 
See in stereo 
Down the rabbit hole
