Go on with a smile your joints so out of place 
Miles from the world so far from the human race 
On your wildest face paint I see the tracks of tears 
Running around like a mouse in a cage for a thousand years Drinking wine to take away your pain 
Collect all the tears you cry 
Collect them all for me 
What's a girl gotta do to get your attention 
Well and nothing's ever happened no oh 
What's a girl gotta do to have some fun with you 
Shut your mouth put your lips on me I feel guilty waiting for you to notice me 
Should I write it on my forehead do you need it on TV 
Can't you see I'm a freak for you as sweet as tea and lime 
And it so clear to me you are empty as can be Drinking wine to take away your pain 
Collect all the tears you cry 
Collect them all for me 
What's a girl gotta do to get your attention 
Well and nothing's ever happened no oh 
What's a girl gotta do to have some fun with you 
Shut your mouth put your lips on me How does one equal three 
Sometimes it is hard to find 
Sometimes to my surprise 
Cause all I want to do is die When you touch me 
Yeah you want me 
When you touch me 
Yeah you want me No sir don't Buh doomp buh duh doomp 
Buh doomp buh duh doomp What's a girl gotta do to get your attention 
Well and nothing's ever happened no oh 
What's a girl gotta do to get your attention 
Well and nothing's ever happened no oh 
What's a girl gotta do to get your attention 
Well and nothing's ever happened no oh 
What's a girl gotta do to have some fun with you 
Shut your mouth put your lips on me 
Shut your mouth put your lips on me Dali llama caught you ah caught you ah
