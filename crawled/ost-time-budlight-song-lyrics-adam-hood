I hope you find a friend to lean on 
hope you make a name for yourself 
hope you find a man that deserves you 
hope nashville treats you well But you hope that I lose sleep at night 
you hope I die a lonely death 
You say I never cared about you 
you hope that I burn in hell I never did anything wrong 
I made you number one, and 
those days are over and gone 
I'm making up for lost time 
I'm gonna get drunk tonight I'm sorry I never gave you 
one hundred and ten percent 
nobody will ever treat me 
anywhere as good as you did I'm not afraid to love somebody 
I'd just rather keep to myself 
I need to take care of own, and 
not have to worry bout someone else I never did anything wrong 
I made you number one, and 
those days are over and gone 
I'm making up for lost time 
I'm gonna get drunk tonight 
pound 25 cold bud lights, and 
sleep in a strange girls bed tonight
