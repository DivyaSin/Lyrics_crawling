I feel the wetness oh her tongue 
That slides across my skin 
The viruses crawl over me 
And feel for some way in 
Cut you with my cock Cassie likes it in her hand 
Cassies dead inside I came to fuck the open wound 
So hold it open wide 
Cassie loves to swallow this bleeding will it stop 
I left Cassie hollow cut you with my cock 
Take me into the ocean 
Lay me out on her shore 
Wake me when the sun burns out 
And we'll run forever more 
We're all gonna die tomorrow 
The freaks are screaming burn it down 
She can't feel the weather 
I can't touch the ground 
Pale and twitching, twisting to the cold dance 
Watching the room grow old a funeral romance 
Somewhere, someone's, screaming that the worlds gone 
Smear me with your blood and let these dead boy play their grave songs 
Slide across the warm red floor to meet me 
Lock the bathroom door before they crawl to eat me 
Cut her throat and whisper that we're going home 
Twitching to the cold dance they suck the meat from her bones
