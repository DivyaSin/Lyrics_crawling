Sing me a sweet song where I can find comfort inside 
Meet me halfway my dear, we'll build a bridge of our own kind 'Never let go honey', you say this to me all the time 
But trust me when I say I'll always be here by your side The stars we find light up the sky, we'll stay up till sunrise 
Stay real close by the sea it gets cold, we'll have fun chasing tides 
We'll have fun chasing tides Stay awake count sheep I'll make sure the lights on for you 
Breathe your air, run my fingers through your hair 
We'll both share the same moon 
We both share the same moon
