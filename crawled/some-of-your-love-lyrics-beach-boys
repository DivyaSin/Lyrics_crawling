(Dip, de, doody, doo, ah, ah) You gotta see my favorite little acrobat 
She really got her every little move down pat 
She's got my vote for number one in the class 
I couldn't help but try to make a forward pass Some, some, some of your love

(Dip, de, doody, doo, ah, ah) There's nothin' like a-romancin' in the stands 
Walkin' down the hallways a-holdin' hands 
Punchin' up our juke box favorite band 
Cuddlin' up in summer moonlight in the sand Kiss me, baby 
Hold me tight tonight Some, some, some of your love
