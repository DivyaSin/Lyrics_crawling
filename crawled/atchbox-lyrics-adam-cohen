I just want my lips to taste of you 
My heart, my breath to race with you 
I know this may sound out of turn 
But oh how the thought of you, burns 
And now I got a 
Matchbox with your name and your number on it 
Im not gonna wait 
No, Im gonna call it 
I can picture us tangled our lips in a lock 
But these are just thoughts, little matchbox 
I know your heart must be a busy port 
With so many people coming back and forth 
Is it foolish to feel like I do 
We only spoke for a moment or two 
And now I got a 
Matchbox with your name and your number on it 
Im not gonna wait 
No, Im gonna call it 
First we'll do coffee, then we'll small talk 
I can picture us tangled our lips in a lock 
In some motel room where the springs are all shot 
We'll leave the door open and hope we get caught 
But these are just thoughts, little matchbox 
Yeah I know this may sound out of turn 
But oh how the thought of you, burns 
Now I got a 
Matchbox with your name and your number on it 
Im not gonna wait 
No, Im gonna call it 
I can picture us tangled our lips in a lock 
But these are just thoughts, little matchbox
