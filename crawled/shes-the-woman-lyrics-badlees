She's the woman I chose to own me 
She's the woman I gave the reigns 
She picks me up when I'm feelin' lonely 
She pays the bills, I can't complain She's the woman who understands 
She's the woman who loves her man She's the woman who stayed in college 
She's the woman got an MBA 
She's using all her higher knowledge 
She got me where I am today She's the woman who understands 
She's the woman who loves her man She's the woman I've been looking for 
She wakes me up and helps me off the floor She's the woman who does the drivin' 
She takes me there, then she gets me home 
I don't have to be out there buyin' 
She sits with me while I drink alone She's the woman who understands 
She's the woman who loves her man
