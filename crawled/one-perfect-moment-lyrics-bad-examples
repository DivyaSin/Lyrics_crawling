Maybe we don't belong together 
I won't tell if you won't worry 
There's time enough for time to tell 
What's going on - I'm in no hurry 
Don't look now, the sun is creeping 
Another night without sleeping 
(chorus) 
It's not a perfect world 
But it's still good to be alive 
If you don't know by now, you'll probably never understand 
The way it feels to want to live 
One perfect moment You been acting mighty fresh 
Lay down, it's time we did some talking 
I'm afraid of what we've done 
Starting something we'll have trouble stopping 
And I don't care if you spend my money 
Someone might as well, honey Chorus It's one of those days I can't stand up 
Seems like gravity's getting stronger 
I'm crashing through my cartoon life 
Looks like I'll make it one day longer 
And maybe I'm right, and maybe I'm wrong 
Maybe this is just another pop song
