I gave up my home and I fell out there 
What have I become 
Reach to the preacher 
Is there nothing else to feel 
That I can't find 
And all my questions that I sought 
In my mind 
I gave up my voice cause I can't favor 
Well I can't follow What if I had some 
What if I had some sound again Come on maker 
Is this something that I'm missing 
That I have lost 
And all my trust is being wasted out at sea 
And I can't find it 
Waiting around for my angels to say nothing 
That I can't follow What if I had some 
What if I had some sound again 
Well I have the seed 
With half love again Give up my voice cause I can't favor 
Well I can't follow 
And all my angels have been wasted out at sea 
When I can't find it Come on maker 
Is this something that I'm missing
