I am the youngblood 
I am my mother's son 
I am the youngblood 
I am my mother's son 
I have my father's eyes 
And an addictive appetite 
I have rode the pale horse 
Into a town of whores and thieves 
I married a drug who constantly cheats 
Oh, the change in the blood 
Oh, the change in the blood 
Oh, the change in my brother, my blood 
Oh, the change 
You always told me to pray to God 
But he is not listening to you 
He has been talking to me 
And he wanted me to tell you 
Things will never be the way you want them to be 
And I am not sorry 
And neither is he 
I am the youngblood 
I am my family's trade 
A fucking mistake 
Oh brother, tell me of the man that you'll become 
Oh brother, tell me what it's like to be the perfect son 
Oh brother, tell me how you live with yourself making our mother cry 
Oh brother, tell me how you live with yourself letting your brother die 
Oh, the change in my blood 
Oh, the change in the blood 
Oh, the change in the blood 
Oh, the change in my brother, my blood 
Oh, the change 
I am the youngblood 
I am my mother's son 
I am the Youngblood 
I am my mother's son
