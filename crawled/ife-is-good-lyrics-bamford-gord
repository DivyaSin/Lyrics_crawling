We really dont have it that bad though We know some people do, 
We catch ourselves complaining Sometimes, 
Feeling down and blue, 
What do we have to complain about When we look around us and see, 
A roof over our heads, a shirt on our Backs and some jingle in our jeans Life, is good, 
Even when things aren't goin quite the Way we know they should, 
Knock, on wood, 
Life is good! Their might be a stack of bills to pay Sittin' on our kitchen table, 
But we'll get around to them one by one As long as we are able, 
Speakin' of that, 
Hey!, 
We've been blessed, 
Each and everyday, 
And I hope it takes forever, 
To count the many ways that... Life, is good, 
Even when things aren't goin quite the Way we know they should, 
Knock, on wood, 
Life is good! Things aint bad if your livin' and Breathin', 
No, things aint bad if your learnin' and Teachin' (teachin' x3) And... Life (life), is good, 
Even when things aren't goin quite the Way we know they should, 
Knock, on wood, 
Life is good! Life, is good, 
Even when things aren't goin quite the Way we know they should, 
Knock, on wood, 
Life is good! Ya life is good!
