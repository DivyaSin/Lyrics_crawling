A man and a woman walking down the street 
With a son and a daughter it was oh so sweet 
When Mummy turned to Daddy and she said: "My dear 
Write out your will the end is near" 
Then she pulled out the gun 
I saw the sparks 
Messed up the suit that he'd bought from Marks 
Because She'd heard the voices from Outer Space 
She'd heard the voices from Outer Space 
She'd heard the voices from Outer Space 
Saying "Never trust a man with egg on his face" 
Three months later Mrs be stands 
A smile on her face, blood on her hands 
The kiddies got scared and have run home to bed 
The headlines in the papers said that 
She was the victim of an awful plan 
Announced through the mouthpiece of a little green man 
She'd heard the voices from Outer Space 
Saying "Never trust a man with egg on his face" 
Never trust a man with egg on his face La-La, La-La, La-La, La-La, La-La, La-La 
La-La, La-La, La-La, La-La, La-La, La-La 
La-La, La-La, La-La, La-La, La-La.
