A barbaric land where the sword is the law, 
and killing is the way of life. 
An infernal wasteland and down a barren plain; 
A warrior stands the test of fate. 
His face is cracked from the wicked hands of time, 
and scars from war have past, 
Taking the reins from a shadowy steed, 
I shall kill the foyus at it's layer! Morbid Scream! Skulls and bones lie relics in the sand; 
Remembrance of men that came before. 
The ground is scorched from the dragon's breath, 
and corpses burned to stench and ash. 
I awake in fury when the dragon attacks; 
Advancing in anger - spitting fire. 
Our barbarous laws, my thundering axe, 
yet we'll fight the beast to it's death!
