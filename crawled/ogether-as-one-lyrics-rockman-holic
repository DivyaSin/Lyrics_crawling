(Finding the courage inside of you 
Just close your eyes and believe) Look back at the days 
and remembering the dreams that we had 
The possibilities were endless 
We all believed in superpowers 
(Flying to the sky! 
Trying to find your own heaven) Reliving the days 
all the promises we've forgotten 
Just like another fading picture 
Where have all the memories gone inside you Finding the courage inside of you 
Just close your eyes and believe That nothing ever stays the same 
We're changing every day 
There's no turning back 
Just look ahead 
(Crying through the night 
Trying to find your own heaven) It's when my broken heart starts remembering again 
A dream that keeps replaying inside of my head 
Shrouded in mysteries it's almost like deja vu Reality is never just the way that we want it to be 
but without it dreams would never shine 
deep down you'll find the light inside of you Courage that you gave to me is priceless, 
together as one, together as one 
You & I will make it, dreams will last forever, 
we will face a brand new day 
All the days you gave to me are priceless 
together as one, together as one 
It's time for us to open new doors step out 
There is nothing to fear Look back at the days 
And remembering the dreams that we had 
The possibilities were endless 
We all believed in happy endings (Praying for a chance 
Try to find your own heaven) The years that have passed 
The ambitions that we've forgotten 
Just like another shooting star 
When did we all become so lifeless (Don't you give it up 
Don't you let it slip away) (Pre-Chorus) Reality is never just the way that we want it to be 
But without it dreams 
would never shine deep down 
you'll find the light inside of you (Chorus) Courage that you gave to me is priceless 
Together as one, together as one 
You and i will make it, dreams that last forever 
We will face a brand new day All the days you gave to me are priceless 
Together as one, together as one 
It's time for us to open new doors 
Step out, there's nothing to fear (Solo) Nothing ever stays the same 
We're changing every day, there's no turning back 
Just look ahead 
So don't forget that i'm here with you Everything we thought we had 
Was nothing but a dream 
And all that is left for us to see 
The time has come now for us to believe (Chorus) Courage that you gave to me is priceless 
Together as one, together as one 
You and i will make it, dreams that last forever 
We will face a brand new day All the days you gave to me are priceless 
Together as one, together as one 
It's time for us to open new doors 
Step out there's nothing to fear
