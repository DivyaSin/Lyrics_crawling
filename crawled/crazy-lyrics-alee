Tall dark and handsome doesn't come close to you 
And those baby blue's 
Ain't looking for no substitute, honey it's no use 
No way you'd ever lose I don't know what to say 
Each and every single day 
Can't explain how you make me feel Just a little bit 
Crazy 
I love everything about you 
Baby 
When you treat me like I'm the 
Only girl 
In the world 
That makes you feel 
The way I do 
Your hugs and kisses got me thinking 
We should be together always 
Baby are you feeling it too? 
Just a little bit 
Crazy And that smart little attitude 
Can't help but love what you say it's true 
You make me wanna be next to you 
It's that kind of feeling you just fall into I don't know what to say 
Each and every single day 
Can't explain how you make me feel Just a little bit 
Crazy 
I love everything about you 
Baby 
When you treat me like I'm the 
Only girl 
In the world 
That makes you feel 
The way I do 
Your hugs and kisses got me thinking 
We should be together always 
Baby are you feeling it too? 
Just a little bit 
Crazy Some things you don't know when or why 
Like how 
Everybody's got that someone to find 
And boy this feels so right Just a little bit 
Crazy 
I love everything about you 
Baby When you treat me like I'm the 
Only girl 
In the world 
That makes you feel 
The way I do 
Your hugs and kisses got me thinking 
We should be together always 
Baby are you feeling it too? 
Just a little bit 
Crazy
