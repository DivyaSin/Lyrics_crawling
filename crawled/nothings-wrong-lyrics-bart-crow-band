I know that you're leavin', it feels like you're gone 
I tried to stay by your side, and I tried to be so strong 
I tried to stay and be everything that I could for you 
Daddy sunshine rain all I bring to you are cloudy days and you're gone You left on a late night train, headed out of town in the pourin' rain 
Left me cryin' all alone 
Didn't even say goodbye, just a note on the pillow that made me cry 
Said that you're leavin', turned and gone, oh but you said I did nothin' wrong I know that I was not the right guy then for you 
But I stayed by your side and I tried to be so true 
If I did nothin' wrong, then I guess the blame's on you 
How many hearts will you break before your daddy buys one good enough for you? 
Good enough for you, oh You left on a late night train, headed out of town in the pourin' rain 
Left me cryin' all alone 
Didn't even say goodbye, just a note on the pillow that made me cry 
Said that you're leavin', and turned and gone, oh but you said I did nothin' wrong
