She's gonna be a perfect mother 
Perfect mother 
In her mind there's no doubt 
Though no one could show her how to be 
A perfect mother, perfect mother 
People say she's too young 
Should a child have a child? Hers is gonna be a perfect baby 
Raised according to the old prescription 
Cuddle it daily and smother with kisses 
'Cause there's nothing more important 
Just make sure that she never misses A perfect mother, perfect mother 
People say she's too young 
No one could ever show her how Babies grow, then they tend to leave us 
That's how it's always been and always will be 
Deep down inside you never stop wishing 
For the hope to be certain that your 
Boy or girl 
Will be forever needing you
