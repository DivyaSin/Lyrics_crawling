Sometimes I feel, a bit of heaven. 
It's still lingering in the air. 
Then I see memories everywhere. 
And our room is full of heartache. 
Every time when I look around. I'm on my own. 
Since you've been gone. 
I don't who's to blame. 
And I don't know what to do now. 
The only thing I know. 
That I can't stop loving you. I feel the rain in my heart little baby. 
Rain in my heart tonight. 
And I see visions of blue. 
Visions of you are running through my mind. 
I feel the Rain in my heart tonight. 
Rain in my burning eyes. Oh baby I want you near. 
Want you to be here. I want you back in my arms. 
You broke my heart without a warning. 
When you simply told me goodbye. want to know. 
Every reason why. So was it me who did you wrong? 
Why can't I keep your loving alive? 
Please let me know. What can I do?
