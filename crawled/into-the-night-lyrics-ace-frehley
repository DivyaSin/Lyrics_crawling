Two a.m., on a downtown street 
There on the corner, two strangers meet in the night 
And then until the daybreak they're gonna love 
And before the light a heart may break, there in the night Look in the alleys, along the roads, it's there the losers stand 
There in the ring, they bide their time, hustling what they can 
They beg just to get 
That bottle in their hand There in the night, somewhere in the night 
Oh, how they do, what they do 
Just to get through 
There in the night, in the night Then on the street in the heart of town 
A lady in black, she turns around, in the night, yeah 
She stares at the man in the Cadillac 
He drives by but he'll be back for the night, there in the night See the guy along the road, who can he be? 
Wait awhile, he'll turn around 
See the man is me 
'Cause when I sing my dreams, my dreams will set me free There in the night, somewhere in the night 
Oh, how they do what they do 
Just to get through 
There in the night, in the night When the sun goes down 
And the light grows dim 
Slowly moving for the kill If you would come back again 
It would take away this pain 
But I don't know if you ever will Love in the night 
Would feel so right 
So love me tonight, in the night Into the night, it feels so right 
How could you do what you do? 
Yes you, only you 
There in , there in the night , somewhere in the night
