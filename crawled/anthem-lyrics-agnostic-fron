Changes that were hardly noticed 
Until time itself became a chain 
Once hot blood began to cool 
My ever slowing heart beat in vain From the nightmare I wake in another dream 
And stare at an unbroken sky 
Try to distill a cure for the plague 
That's put to rest everything--I once felt inside 
To never again be bound by united blood 
A sense of purpose lost forever more 
Is this the way I'll die? no! 
I'll find the sense of honor that I held once before The blood the honor the truth 
Thought it would never end 
The blood the honor the truth 
Can be part of our lives again
