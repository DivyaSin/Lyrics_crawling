[Repeat: x4] 
Digital... CD Ya don't say 
that I'm pretty 
or the simple things 
that a man would say well baby there is 
where you messed up 
movies, 
flowers, hours, 
not knowing where you are 
or who you're with 
There is where you messed up [Chorus: x2] 
You keep 'n actin' like 
we'll never be together 
You get your act together 
Thank you for holdin' on 
waitin' for you forever- 
and baby there is where 
you messed up! I don't need your 
money or a dinner 
when I got jewelry 
Winner to loser 
and baby there is where 
you messed up Ooh... Don't take me 
for granted 
and expect me to stay right here 
to wait on you while you have your fun 
there is where you messed up [Chorus: x2] You head straight for the gate 
to cut up a rug, yeah you 
there is where you messed up 
I heard it all 1,000 times 
tryin' to mess with my mind 
and baby there is where you messed up For treatin' me like a dog 
baby, that's where you went wrong 
uh-uh, I don't need ya, dawg 
so there is where you messed up 
She don't need ya dawg, that's where you went wrong [Chorus: x3] And baby, there is where you messed up!
