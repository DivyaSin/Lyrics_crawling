We are the now generation 
We are the generation now 
This is the now generation 
This is the generation now I want money 
I want it, want it, want it 
Fast internet 
Stay connected in a jet 
Wifi, podcasts, blasting out an SMS 
Text me, I'll text you back 
Check me on that iChat 
I'm all about that HTPC 
Your a Pc, I'm a Mac I, want it, 
Myspace in your space 
Facebook is that new place 
Dip, divin' socializing, 
I'll be out in cyberspace Google is my professor 
Wikipedia the checker 
Checking my account 
Logging in and logging out Baby, I, want it now 
This is the now generation 
This is the generation now 
We are the now generation 
I, I want, I want it now 
I, want the, cold hard cash 
I, I want, I want it now And I just can't wait, 
I need it immediately 
And I just can't wait, 
I want it immediately 
Cause time can't wait then I sure can't wait 
I ain't got no patience I sure can't wait 
Not today We are the now generation 
We are the generation now 
This is the now generation 
This is the generation now 
I want money 
I want cold hard cash I'll take your dollar and your Euro 
And go have a blast 
So take your debt, and your credit 
And stick it up your ass, and do it now I want it now 
Big money, give me mo money 
I want it now 
I need cash, oh I need it bad 
I want it now 
Quick in a hurry, 
Like your name was Flash 
I want it now 
You make me wait? 
And Ima whip your ass 
I want it now 
I want it now baby (now) 
I, I want, I want it now Fast, rapido 
Really quick like torpedo 
Need for speed is my credo 
You need to feed this negrito 
Sender, buyer, brother boat 
Wrap it like a thunderbolt 
Activate it, rock the vote 
Just ask Barack, who brought the hope 
To now 
It was a now generation And I just can't wait, 
I need it immediately 
And I just can't wait, 
I want it immediately 
Cause time can't wait then I sure can't wait 
I ain't got no patience no I just can't wait 
Not today Expedite 
No time for procrastination 
Expedite
