You're so engraved your face in my mind flowing 
You're so enslaved erased a witness to nothing 
You're such a cage to me you keep me weak and vain 
But I need your salty skin and your sweat On me 
Intoxicating me 
Isolating me 
It seemed so long a wait You're so engraved your face in my mind flowing 
You're so enslaved erased still I blister and stain 
And you're such a cage to me it can't be wise to remain 
But I need your salty skin and your sweat On me 
Intoxicating me 
Isolating me 
It seemed so long You're so overcome by weeds 
Still I feel the same 
You're here you're finally here and it seemed so long a wait 
And you're so overcome by weeds 
Still I feel the same 
You're here you're finally here and it seemed Your healing sweat 
On me 
Intoxicating me 
Isolating me 
It seemed so long a wait 
It seemed so long 
You're here you're finally here 
It seemed so long a wait 
You're here finally here 
It seemed so long a wait
