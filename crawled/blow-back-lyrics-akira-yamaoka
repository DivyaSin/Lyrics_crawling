Daylight 
Dark light 
Blinds me 
Am I fading in light? I can see through the fear, nice try 
Just a matter of time, it's another lie 
When the fire turns cold, who's here? 
It sure looks like it's me Closer to the source of my pain 
Mirror yours Oh, I'm not myself 
My God, what have you done? 
Oh, the memories of them keep coming home... And the nightmares are good, so good 
Will I ever wake up? 
Am I here right now? 
Was the question too hard? 
Dad was right 
He said nightmares are good Mommy, Am I dead now? 
Tell me 
Why do we...?
