I hear noises 
Awoken from my sleep 
I'm haunted by the thoughts, I creep 
If the earthquake starts, buildings fall 
I'm pulling pictures off, from our bones, till you say 
Here, here I am 
Oh, and here, here I am 
Oh, oh All the ghosts 
They float, float around us 
How they turned all our dreams into dust 
We saved your mother 
But darling there was no spark left for us 
We won the battle, but lost the heart 
And now I know that here, here I am 
Oh and here, here I amOh, hard to believe 
It's said and done, hard to believe 
It's not dead and gone 
I want to believe 
All is well that ends well 
But I just can't convince myself Can't touch the stars, or make them shine 
Fight the tide, until the day we die 
Can't touch the stars, can't make them shine 
But you know I'll try 
Can't touch the stars, or make them shine 
Fight the tide, until the day we die 
Can't touch the stars, can't make them shine 
But you know I'll try 
For you I'll try
