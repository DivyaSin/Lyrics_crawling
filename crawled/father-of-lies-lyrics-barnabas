A lot of people think i'm a cute little guy 
With pointy horns and a cute little tail 
Well, that's fine with me, 'cause i get my work done 
If people don't believe that i'm real i'm lucifer 
The father of lies 
Just call me satan; don't act so surprised 
i'm the prince of darkness; i'm coming after you 
'Cause i want your soul, and to hell with you Some people actually worship my name 
They think that i'm really cool 
They even believe that i care for them 
Some people are such little fools i know i haven't got too much time 
Pretty soon we're all gonna burn 
i'd really love to take you along 
When we get there you're gonna learn
