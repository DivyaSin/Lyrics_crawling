In a minute Imma lose my crew scrit 
Well one, give the full 98 
Like fuck coach, Im cutthroat, so what goes? 
Do you head for the year they say might be the end? 
Better look within Glisten the glamors, we pose for the cameras 
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with the hammers 
Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals 
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my Hamper 
Clothes in my hamper, that bathing ape camouflage 
Brands from japan, you would think I was a samurai 
Drop-crotch, jeremy scott pants, bitch its hammer time 
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized 
Life is what you need, wont you take a Z ? Feel the breeze 
Smoke the Sour Deeze, hit that shit and please act at ease 
Wouldnt you wanna be like the Black Eyed Peas, all these 3s 
Star, thats Hollywood, wont you rest in peace? So thick you are, shining like the star 
With your head in the clouds, some fighters shoot you down 
Hands on the ground, back against the wall 
Tell me who youd call when no one else around
