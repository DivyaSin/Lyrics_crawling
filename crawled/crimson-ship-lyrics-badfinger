My life was colored, painting pictures out of tune 
You came from nowhere in a song 
It might have been the way I laughed, he made the jokes 
Could only show me what was wrong He took me flying on his crimson ship 
He never left me his number 
He took me flying on his crimson ship 
Then he was gone and I wondered Who put the knots on all the crosses on the hill? 
Why did the old man wash his hands? 
Who grew the flower that was big enough to kill? 
And blew the trumpet in the van, a-an He took me flying on his crimson ship 
He never left me his number 
He took me flying on his crimson ship 
Then he was gone and I wondered 
Oh-oh, oh-oh When they were busy throwing kisses at the moon

And though they knew the resurrection would be soon 
The time was spent, they carried on, o-on He took me flying on his crimson ship 
He never left me his number 
He took me flying on his crimson ship 
Then he was gone and I wondered Wondered wondered wondered
