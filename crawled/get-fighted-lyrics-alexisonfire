So make sure you love 
Like you've never been hurt 
And when you dance, dance 
Like there's no one watching you 'Cuz you can waste your time 
(Redefining the day that music died) 
Or you can spend your life 
(Guilt free and ostracized) 
'Cuz all the fashion 
(In the world cannot save you now) 
(It's something, I'll write it down for you) So make sure you love 
Like you've never been hurt 
And when you dance, dance 
Like there's no one watching you Oh, 'cuz this shit's not about pants 
And this shit's not about shirts 
And this shit's definitely not about hair 
(This shit is 'bout having a good fucking time) 
Maybe the music isn't dead 
Maybe the music isn't dead 
Maybe we all just forgot what it fucking sounded like They Forgot 
THEY Forgot! 'Cuz you can waste your time 
(Redefining the day that music died) 
Or you can spend your life 
(Guilt free and ostracized) 
'Cuz all the fashion 
(In the world can't save you now) 
(It's something, I'll write it down for you) My greatest gift to you 
Is a dance floor 
Free from insecurity
