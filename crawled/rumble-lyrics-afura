I'm a problem child, I'm my own worst enemy 
No matter what happens in life, precise and nothing scares me 
Even the bombs is exploding all around me 
I be the type of man, who stand his ground, firmly I'm compulsive, psychotic in the mental 
A walking fear factor, seven thirty, it's that simple 
I've been exposed to a universe of negative fallout 
The fact that I move on nothing, it makes me wanna ball out Instead, I put vocals to the beats and get it popping 
The harm glare right through the track, I feel like rocking 
But back to the program, damn 
My evil and is taking over like I'm sinking in some quicksand Really I feel like going up in a blaze, hot damn 
I'm a cross of Jack the Ripper and the Son of Sam 
It's like I'm living five lives and of five guys 
With five million ways to bust heads, so forgive my slide I said yo, yo, do you wanna rumble? 
Come and rumble with me 
I've been working out these problems in my mind Imagine yourself free falling, falling and falling 
A thousand story's, after diggin' some stars in scrolls 
That's how I feel, 24 hours a day 
From Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 
Friday and even on Saturday, it's like I'm trapped in a box Uh-huh, going to war with myself 
So I can't stop thinking about killing myself 
So I do what I do, to do what I do, to break the rules 
Only form of therapy is to spit it for you Charismatically drastic with this rap shit 
Thoughts are falling off but send them back like elastic 
Get the politic sorrows in the music game 
I'm trynna make sense of corruption in my brain I hope this part of my life, don't want war with my seeds 
Masturbation of pornos, wrapped in best flame 
The little things, that's gon' drive me insane I said yo, yo, do you wanna rumble? 
Come and rumble with me 
I've been working out these problems in my mind 
Yo, do you wanna rumble? 
Come and rumble with me 
I've been working out these problems in my mind I'm in hell, raised in lyrically blazing 
To make a long story short, I'm half man, half amazing 
Sometimes I don't know whether I'm coming or going 
So I dive head first into the track and keep flowing and flowing My hearts on my sleeve, my loves growing and growing 
That's how I like, from the music I make rumble 
From the forty come licks, that's right I watch 'em crumble 
Survival of the fittest, this business means business 
Gotta say what I mean, gotta handle to my business I'm one soldier fighting against a whole army 
I'm little with bullets, yeah and none of them harming 
My third eye, six stones, the eyes on the prize 
Going from knowledge, build the wise And if I ain't successful 
In the back of my mind, I gotta wonder why 
I keep my nose, yeah, fit to the grindstone 
Going and showing and growing top of these fucking poems I said yo, yo, do you wanna rumble? 
Come and rumble with me 
I've been working out these problems in my mind 
Yo, yo, do you wanna rumble? 
Come and rumble with me 
I've been working out these problems in my mind Yo, yo, do you wanna rumble? 
Come and rumble with me 
I've been working out these problems in my mind 
Yo, yo, do you wanna rumble? 
Come and rumble with me 
I've been working out these problems in my mind And do you wanna rumble? 
And do you wanna rumble? 
And do you wanna rumble? 
And do you wanna rumble?
