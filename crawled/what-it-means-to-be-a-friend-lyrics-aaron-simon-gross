Patrice: 
A friend's not a cheap little phony creep 
Or a jerk trying to make a deal 
A friend is a person who, most of all, 
Cares about what you feel; 
And nothing is harder 
Than learning a friend isn't real A friend sends notes back and forth all day 
And doesn't care that you can't spell 
A friend knows you've got a crush on your teacher, 
But a friend would never tell 
A friend's outside waiting 
The minute you both hear the bell And if your heart is always breaking 
Cause the world is just not fair 
When you're at your worst 
Your friend's the first one there 
Giving you something to lean on 
And that's what it means to be a friend A friend wont smoke when she's in your room 
Or laugh at the poems you write 
A friend won't go start kissing your brother 
The minute that you're out of sight 
A friend is the person 
You call sixteen times every night And if your heart is always breaking 
And you want to run and hide 
When your hope is gone 
Your friend is on your side If someone moves in round the corner 
And you want to show him you care 
So you give him all your last month of vacation 
And all of the time you can spare 
But then, on the first day of classes 
He acts like you're not even there, 
Then he doesn't know 
He doesn't know! 
He'll never know what it means 
To be a friend
