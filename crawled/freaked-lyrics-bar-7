I'm here and now and everywhere's going out on the road 
In my hotel room I hear a knock on the door 
I think it must be the boys telling me 
That it's time for making some noise 
For the freaks 
The world is a freak 
The world is a freak and so are you 
The world is a freak and we know that it's true That's when I see me some a' little fresh swish 
Ah, can't help a'knockin' me out 
She waves a smile and I know 
For after the show 
Like all the other ??? that's as good as it goes 
'Cause we're freaks 
The world is a freak 
The world is a freak and so are you 
The world is a freak and we know that it's true It's when you're slidin' 'cause you know it's almost ??? 
You know what's going on and everybody's encouraged 
Freaks 
You fucking freaks 
Freaks I'm here, I'm there 
I'm everywhere 
And no matter where you're going in this world that we share 
Stop here, put your head in the sea 
The world's a freak just like me 
What a freak 
The world is a freak 
The world is a freak and so are you 
The world is a freak and we know that it's true It's when you're slidin' 'cause you know it's almost ??? 
You know what's going on and motherfucker ??? 
Freaks 
The world is a freak 
You know I'm a freak

The world is a freak 
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak You're freakin' me out, man
