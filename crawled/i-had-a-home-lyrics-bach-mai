I had a place to live 
A warm bed to sleep in 
And I had a home 
'Til you took the hammer and broke it down 
And she had her hopes 
'Til you showed your face and tore it all apart And I know what you have done 
We've bared all of your sins 
And I know what I have seen 
You are dark and a liar within 
And I know that you will fall 
You're destined to bleed And I know what you have done 
We've bared all of your sins 
And I know what I have seen 
You are dark and a liar within 
And I know that you will fall 
You're destined to bleed 
'cause you are responsible 
For an emptiness in me You've killed home 
You've murdered memories 
You've deceived your own sons 
Withdrawn from all empathy 
You've buried your past 
Hidden under your lies 
But now you've dug too deep 
Broken all of your ties And I know what you have done 
We've bared all of your sins 
And I know what I have seen 
You are dark and a liar within 
And I know that you will fall 
You're destined to bleed And I know what you have done 
We've bared all of your sins 
And I know what I have seen 
You are dark and a liar within 
And I know that you will fall 
You're destined to bleed 
Because you are responsible 
For an emptiness in me
