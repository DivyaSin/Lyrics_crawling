The swords held high fire in the sky 
and the warcry sounds like beasts 
they fight for the gods 
with sword and shield for freedom 
high above in the sky Old great master 
how beautiful you are 
I saw your eye in the sky 
and touched the great star We did it all just for you 
oh god 
you sent us the virgins 
and we're running out of life Every time I touch the ground 
I'm closer to your arms 
my love is a deathmatch 
but I'll see walhalla one day We did it... The swords held high... We did it...
