You said you need a groom this evening 
I told you I'm leaving till you begged me to stay 
You got your high heels on to tease me 
You promised to please me, then you take it away The fire's fading, baby, stoke it up 
And let it roll up your sleeves 
Why can't you tell me that we're breaking up 
And that I need space to breathe? If you can't wait any longer 
Let it out, let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger 
Let it out, let it in, let it out You used to keep me up till the morning 
Keeping me warm until I had to be gone 
And now you can't find a room in your head 
You see, you got out of bed, well, that my coffee ain't on The door is open, do you lock it up? 
And then you threw out the key 
Why can't you tell me that we're breaking up 
And that I need space to breathe? If you can't wait any longer 
Let it out, let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger 
Let it out, let it in Let it out, let it in 
I can't wait 
Let it out, let it in 
I can't wait, no If you can't wait any longer 
Let it out, let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger 
Let it out, let it in Let it out, let it in 
I can't wait If you can't wait any longer 
Let it out, let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger 
Let it out, let it in, let it out No, I can't wait 
Till you let me in 
I can't wait, no, I can't wait 
Got to let it out
