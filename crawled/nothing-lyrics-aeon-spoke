If it was between us 
Then I'm still amused So let me go 
I've got more damage to do on myself 
I'll just go 
There's nothing left to lose 
Nothing If it was the pressure 
Then I'm blowing up So let me go 
I've got more damage to do on myself 
I'll just go 
There's nothing left to lose 
Nothing Let me go Let me go 
I've got more dying to do 
In myself 
I'll just go 
There's nothing left for you 
Nothing
