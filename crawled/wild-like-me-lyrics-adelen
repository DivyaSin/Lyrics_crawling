A storm is on the horizon 
Five years been onto sky 
Time to break the silence 
Wild like me, w-w-wild like me 
We are living the wild life They're trying to hunt us down 
We come alive in the night time 
Wild like me, w-w-wild like me 
You and me underneath the sun 
We're living while we're young 
Hey, won't you come get wild like me? Wild like me 
Hey, we're too hard to bring us down 
Tonight we're going loud 
Hey, won't you come get wild like me? Wild like me 
W-w-wild like me 
W-w-wild like me 
They're trying to tame us 
Cage me like an animal They can't never ever change us 
Wild like me, w-w-wild like me 
We're the Z generation 
Oh no no, no, we don't stop 
Good girl but no angel 
Wild like me, w-w-wild like me You and me underneath the sun 
We're living while we're young 
Hey, won't you come get wild like me? 
Wild like me 
Hey, we're too hard to bring us down 
Tonight we're going loud 
Hey, won't you come get wild like me? Wild like me 
W-w-wild like me 
W-w-wild like me (Hey!) 
They're trying to hunt us down 
Down, down, down, down 
(oh no no no, oh no no no) 
But they can never hunt us down 
Down, down, down, down 
(oh no no no, oh no no no) 
They're trying to hunt us down 
Down, down, down, down 
(oh no no no, oh no no no) 
Wild, wild, wild, wild like me 
Wild, wild, wild, wild like me 
W-w-wild like me 
W-w-wild like me
