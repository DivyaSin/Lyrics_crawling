The difference between us 
Is negative one, The math is simple 
Subtract attractive opposites 
Open, my bottle, fizzing you shake me out 
And go implode, this hollow-body interior 
Kingpin crumbles 
Fade, fade, fade, fade 
Where's my remote control 
Where's my remote control 
Where's my remote 
Where's my 
Where's my remote 
Crooked, mangled, melted, spoil 
It's funny but true, oh looked what I cooked up 
Boring, missed out, habitual umbilical 
You say "Gravity Pope, you're strange and real" 
It's not easy sleeping 
It's not too late, too late, too late 
Where's my remote control 
Where's my remote control 
Where's my 
Where's my 
Where's my self control 
Where's my remote control 
Where's my remote control 
The difference between us is negative one
