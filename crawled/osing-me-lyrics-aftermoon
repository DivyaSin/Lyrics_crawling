Verse 1: 
Time flies 
Memory remains. 
I cried, 
But it was in vain. 
It`s so hard to accept 
Things we cannot change How can I live with the loss 
I`m tired of bearing this cross 
Since you`ve been gone the world 
Became so blank and cold Refrain: 
Save me 
Don`t go 
I`m here 
All alone Time flies. 
So slow. 
I`m here. Alone Verse 2: 
Time won`t heal this wound, 
But I remember you told me to be strong. 
You taught me never give up 
Because there is always a way out. I promise I'll be what you want me to be, 
And I swear you`ll be proud of me. 
Nothing can ever replace you 
Oh how I miss you. Refrain: 
Save me 
(I believe, I live, don`t leave, don`t go) 
Don`t go 
(I`m here, I`m near, I`m all alone) 
I`m here 
(In my soul the cold wind blows) 
All alone 
(On and on and on and on and on) Time flies. 
(I believe, I live, don`t leave, don`t go) 
So slow. 
(I`m here, I`m near, I`m all alone) 
I`m here alone 
(In my soul the cold wind blows) 
All alone Bridge: 
Give me your strength to carry on 
Give me something to live for 
Without you all my life like an empty frame 
It`s so inane 
It will never be the same Refrain: 
I believe, I live, don`t leave, don`t go 
I`m here, I`m near, I`m all alone 
In my soul the cold wind blows 
On and on and on and on and on I believe, I live, don`t leave, don`t go 
I`m here, I`m near, I`m all alone 
In my soul the cold wind blows.
