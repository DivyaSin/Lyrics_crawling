Working man's day wage, just piss it away 
Leaves it out in the weather Failure, he said, times two breeds contempt 
Wash your hands of it forever Violence, it ripped through the old dogwood fence 
See the hope, see it unravel Drunk brother said he could reason with them 
While they lied at night, they lied at night, while they lied 
While they lied at night, they lied at night, while they lied The picture was left on the front porch, well that's it 
I love you, don't you ever think of me? My body knows there's a hell with my soul 
We don't even know the difference The dead folks in the clouds, for crying out loud 
While they lied at night, they lied at night, while they lied 
While they lied at night, they lied at night, while they lied And why, did we live so long? 
So long 
So long The house is not the same since we left it that day 
Old friends seem to wonder 
Our parents had cigarettes, wedding bells 
While they lied at night, they lied at night, while they lied 
While they lied at night, they lied at night, while they lied And why, did we live so long? 
So long 
So long While they lied at night, they lied at night, while they lied 
While they lied at night, they lied at night, while they lied 
While they lied at night, they lied at night, while they lied 
Oh
