Fading colors, changing sounds 
Shades of night come tumbling down 
Bring tomorrow like yesterday 
Fade away Here I am, a wayward man 
Following the light to a distant land 
Come tomorrow, without yesterday 
Fade away High adventure I just begun 
Fame and fortune got me on the run 
Break off the way 
Fade away, yeah Oh yes I am a wayward man 
Following the light to a distant land 
Come tomorrow, without yesterday 
Fade away 
Oh fade away, fade away
