On a planet not so far away 
We were born together 
In the beginning there was just you and me 
Where we was a star up on a ferry 
Suckle on the honey of the Tenessee 
Where we would sleep, in the South sunshine 
I smile at you and you to me And in the dark, I see the moon 
Shine in your eyes, we were so 
And that is when, never left and never been to 
No such thing 
I looked at you, and you looked into me 
And we saw in each other, everything 
We knew no fear as we grooved through 
Best of growing up, we've come to love On this planet not so far away 
We were to stay together 
Go roll over in a dream 
We drift apart, on down the stream 
The honeysuckle taking up in love supply 
The snake that lay in the Sun, so fire 
I smiled at you and you to me And in the night, I'd see the dark 
Inside of you 
Walk from trees to look like wings 
Never knew no better, there was no such thing 
I reached for you like a child between 
Oh we saw in each other, everything 
Everything 
Everything
