Tonight the drunks are infected, we're on our way 
As if they drop by to see me u-n-i-n-v-i-t-e-d 
And I am a walflower, maybe a better father 
This is a job 
For seconds I miss the Bentleys 
Today maybe they'll call, 
You describe every prison you pass through them all 
Then he asked you for your head and I vowed to burn your bed 
Try to pretend, but this is your life, 
somehow, it feels right I'm calling this evolution, I'm falling for institution 
Warm submission enveloping you Tomorrow I'll survive the questions 
Knives buried with cold indifference 
My world is true rendered by you 
Here they come again, I could never find the words 
So I disguised them in verse 
Until it comes out dumb and wrong, 
The simplest song, if you sing along
