In life's troubles 
sorrows and pain 
earnestly I seek Thee 
Fill my soul with peace again, 
earnestly I seek Thee None but You and You alone 
Take my life make it your own 
In my offering build Your home 
Earnestly I seek Thee In life triumphs, 
and victories, 
earnestly I seek Thee 
In the shadow of the almighty, 
earnestly I seek Thee I sing to You 
because You are good 
and Your love is better than life 
I will Live to bring You praise 
I will bless You always
