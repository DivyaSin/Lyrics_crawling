Everything's got to be 
Just how it has to be 
Or he won't play 
And I know that boy wants to 
Approach me and say 
All he's got to say 
Maybe he'll say it today, maybe no There was a slight altercation, oh 
Down at the station, oh, today 
There's blood on hands and steps 
I'm holding my head 
She's got some front, oh 
Did you hear what she said? I'm so sos if I neglected you 
I mean you no harm, mean you no harm 
And I'm so sos if I disrespected you 
Mean you no harm 
Oh look around, it's true 
Tonight, I'll be chasing you I took one draft of life 
Paid only the market price 
Now I'm estranged 
And I'm so lonely now 
Though I'm not alone 
Licking her boot 
Maybe I'll work from home
