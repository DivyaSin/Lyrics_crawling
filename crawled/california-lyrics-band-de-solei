I'm going to California 
Turn the corner turn the key 
Unlock the secret garden 
And throw away the key 
Don't care how long it takes me 
Don't care what I have to do 
Crawl across the great divide 
Just to get back to you 
My God, how did it come to this 
Wallowing in my own pit 
Some birds that sing had to sacrifice 
Their wings 
Can you save me 
Save me from myself I'm going to California 
Let the sun melt down my heart 
There'll be no fighting crying 
No more stumbling in the dark 
And when all of the king's horses 
And all of the king's men 
Come to visit me in California 
Well, I'll gladly let them in My God, how did it come to this 
Wallowing in my own pit 
Some birds that sing had to sacrifice 
Their wings 
Can you save me 
Can you save me 
Can you save me 
Save me from myself I'm going to California 
Turn the corner turn the key 
Unlock the secret garden 
And throw away the key
