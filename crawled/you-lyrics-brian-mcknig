For once, in my life 
I finally found what I was looking to find 
When I first, saw your eyes 
I saw right through your heart 
And climbed into your mind 
I never thought I would ever have the thing 
I believe other lover do 
Now I do [Chorus] 
Baby with you 
All my life I've been waiting for you 
And there ain't no mistaken it's true 
I've been saving forever for you 
Girl my only desire is you 
Baby I'm so on fire for you 
It's not hard to believe, I love you There's no war, I can't fight 
There's no river to wide 
There's no mountain to high 
With you, by my side 
From the moment I wake up, till deep in the night 
I never thought I would ever have the thing 
I believe other lovers do 
But now I do [Chorus]
