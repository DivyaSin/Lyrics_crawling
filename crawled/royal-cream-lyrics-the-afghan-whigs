I know you're sleeping with another demon 
Love destroyed by love 
I know you couldn't care because we're legion 
Love demeaned by love This all night or get it right 
Loaded to the teeth 
Once a malady 
Since a rhapsody 
Love thy neighbor 
Love thy neighbor Bow down or kill the crown 
The Royal Cream is love diseased by love 
Come back, you dirty rat 
Behold the dreamer 
Love believed by love This all night or get it right 
Rolling thru the reeds 
This apology kills a part of me 
Love thy stranger 
Love thy stranger If I would become what I dreamed as a child 
I'd be fearless, devoted, alive Jump back or kiss the jack 
This lowlife's feeling low 
Run now or take a bow 
You'll only hear this once I know you're sleeping with another demon 
Love destroyed by love 
Come back, you dirty rat 
Behold the schemer 
Love deceived by love 
Redeemed by love If I have a breath inside of me 
I'll drink the blood of royalty 
They're runnin'
