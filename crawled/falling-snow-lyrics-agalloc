The water pours its embracing arms around the stone 
Decay drips from the unquiet void where the ice forms, where life ends 
The stone is by the crimson flood, swallowed 
The red tide beyond the ebon wound, contorted 
My sacrifice bids farewell in this river of memory... a wave to end all time 
Red birds escape from my wounds and return as falling snow 
To sweep the landscape; a wind haunted, wings without bodies 
The snow, the bitter snowfall 
You wish to die in her pale arms, crystalline, to become an ode to silence 
In the soul of a mountain of birds, fallen 
The cascading pallor of ghostless feather 
The snow has fallen and raised this white mountain on which you will die 
and fade away in silence.
