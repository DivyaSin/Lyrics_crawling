You go without me I'll hold right here 
That gleam in your eyes it still fills me with fear 
The more you see that I'm not like the others 
The harder you try to take my hands in yours Cold grey and callous reaching out for me 
Whatever's over that hill it scares the fuck out of me 
Still you step closer so that your eyes can meet 
Tell me know one knows me like you do And then, you say that I can't play this game forever 
No you are the king of killers. 
I've seen what you do 
Carving through the hearts and souls of many With cloven hoofs you stomp the dreams of men 
Of men far greater than me. 
I'm not going I'll hold there
