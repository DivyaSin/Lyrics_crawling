Look outside, it's already light 
And the stars ran away with the night 
Things were said, words that we'll try forget 
It's so hard to admit I know we made mistakes 
I see through all the tears 
And that's what got us here If love is an ocean wide 
We'll swim in the tears we cry 
They'll see us through to the other side 
We're gonna make it When love is a raging sea 
You can hold on to me 
We'll find a way tonight 
Love is an ocean wide I'll stay right here, it's where I'll always belong 
Tied with your arms 
Days like this I wish the sun wouldn't set 
I don't wanna forget What made us feel this way 
You see through all my fears 
And that's what got us here If love is an ocean wide 
We'll swim in the tears we cry 
They'll see us through to the other side 
We're gonna make it When love is a raging sea 
You can hold on to me 
We'll find a way tonight 
Love is an ocean Wide enough to forget 
Even when we think we can't 
Think we can't Love is an ocean wide 
We'll swim in the tears we cry 
They'll see us through to the other side 
We're gonna make it When love is a raging sea 
You can hold on to me 
We'll find a way tonight, we'll find a way tonight 
Love is an ocean wide 
Love is an ocean wide
