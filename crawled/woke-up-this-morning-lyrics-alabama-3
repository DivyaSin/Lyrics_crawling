I'm gonna take you down 
Deep down to the front lines You woke up this morning 
Got yourself a gun, 
Mama always said you'd be 
The Chosen One. She said, you're one in a million 
You've got to burn to shine, 
But you were born under a bad sign, 
With a blue moon in your eyes. You woke up this morning 
All that love had gone, 
Your Papa never told you 
About right and wrong. But you're looking good, baby, 
I believe you're feeling fine, (Shame about it), 
Born under a bad sign 
With a blue moon in your eyes. You woke up this morning 
Got a blue moon in your eyes 
You woke up this morning 
Got a blue moon in your eyes You woke up this morning 
The world turned upside down, 
Thing's ain't been the same 
Since the Blues walked into town. 
But you're one in a million 
You've got that shotgun shine. (Shame about it) 
Born under a bad sign, 
With a blue moon in your eyes. 
You woke up this morning 
Got a blue moon in your eyes 
You woke up this morning 
Got a blue moon in your eyes When you woke up this morning everything was gone. 
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong. 
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes, 
Like a voice trying to tell you there's something you should know. 
Last night you were flying but today you're so low 
Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if 
You'll ever know the meaning of things as they appear to the others; 
Wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers. 
Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you 
Didn't think beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink? 
Well you do so make up your mind to go on, 'cause 
When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone. Woke up this morning, 
Woke up this morning, 
Woke up this morning, 
You want to be the Chosen One. Woke up this morning, 
Woke up this morning, 
Woke up this morning, 
You got yourself a gun.
