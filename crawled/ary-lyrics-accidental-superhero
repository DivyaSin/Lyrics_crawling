you can't tell me 
anything at all 
all your knowing 
will never stand, it'll fall but i've tried you see 
and it's time to move along 
you can't poison me 
if i'm never here at all you don't know mary 
she's never bothered you 
you don't know mary 
she's turned her back on you so much that's said 
has fallen on deaf ears 
you don't know how far 
inside the darkness spread but the truth, it lied 
as it wandered to your soul 
she don't know about knowing 
you need to let her go you don't know mary 
she's never bothered you 
you don't know mary 
she's turned her back on you she won't be held down 
she won't be around long 
she's gone of to wander you don't know mary 
she's never bothered you 
you don't know mary 
she's turned her back on you
