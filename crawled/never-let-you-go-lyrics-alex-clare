No you're not small 
You're big enough to fill my heart 
Surprised myself when I made room for someone else 
Who'd ever thought I'd fall so far to pull myself back up 
Life can be crazy sometimes I was filled with hope 
When I saw your face 
I just can't be sure 
If tomorrow will be better babe 
One thing that you should know 
One thing that you should know Is I will never let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
I will never let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
Never gonna let you go There's a lot of minds 
Who tell you how to think and feel 
And a lot of times pull you this way and that way 
If not around, listen to what your heart says I'm so filled with hope 
When I see your face 
I just can't be sure 
If we'll ever find a better way 
One thing that you should know 
One thing that you should know Is I will never let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
I will never let you go 
Never gonna let you go And I will never let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
I will never let you go 
No no no 
Never gonna let you go Never, never, never let you go 
Never, never, never let you go 
Never, never, never let you go 
Never, never, never let you go ? you sunrise (never, never, never let you go) 
I'll be yours and you'll be mine (never, never, never let you go) 
One thing that I'll let you know (never, never) I will never ever let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
And I will never let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
And I will never let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
Never, ever let you go Never gonna let you go
