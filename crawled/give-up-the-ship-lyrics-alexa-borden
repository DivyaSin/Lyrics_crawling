In a staggering ocean 
I find myself at peace 
And all that inner commotion 
Came rushing to a cease It was a terrifying dive 
Into the murky waters deep 
And though I'm floating so serenely 
All your pressure's drowning me Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Just give into it Just one rush of an upsurge 
Disoriented me 
And I know I shouldn't try to find 
A way to navigate the sea But every mouthful swallowed 
Fills a hollow cavity 
And though I'm lucid in your water 
All your pressure's drowning me Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Just give into it No heaven, no bliss 
Could ever amount to this 
No high, no fix 
Could ever amount to this I'm giving in 
I can't live like this 
Though no regrets 
I'm desperate to forget 
Desperate to forget Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Don't give up the ship 
Just give into it And a calm is overflowing 
And I am sinking to a grave 
No need to cry, for it was I 
Who tied this stone around my leg
