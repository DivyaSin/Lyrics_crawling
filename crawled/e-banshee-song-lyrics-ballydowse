Closed my eyes by a violent river filled 
with thoughts that left me shiver 
longed for a land to be delivered 
where the young don't catch the ship 
fair voice ran cross my ears 
sadness drenched for many years 
she'd had enough of the children's tears 
their cries had reached the judgement seat i heard the banshee mark the day of the death 
of kings both strong and cruel 
forgive me father if my eyes are dry 
but i've seen too much of their rule thought she dwelled only in stories 
but there she stood on the green before me 
pale blue eyes and a terrible glory 
of one who sees the end of thing 
thru wars and workhouse she had traveled 
watched so many lives unraveled 
held her breath upon the gavel 
now would justice come at last i saw the bansee in the houses of power 
she was beautiful beyond all belief 
this time she came for the heartless killers 
and no one found any grief woke again with a sudden shiver 
found a land still undelivered 
thru myself in a violent river 
and swam against the cursed pull 
all our myths and dreams and longings 
filled with tyrants' final fallings 
gardens lost and echoes calling 
adam, where are you? i saw the banshee in the hands of my Lord 
only mercy held her release 
but nothing's forgotten and 
nothing's overlooked 
everything sowed is reaped 
nothing's forgotten and 
nothing's overlooked 
the eye of God never sleeps
