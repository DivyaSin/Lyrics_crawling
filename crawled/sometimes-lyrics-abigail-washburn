Lonely lake in Minnesota 
Dying tree in Ashtabula 
Rains came in yesterday 
Fleeting hearts are here to stay 
Sometimes I change my mind 
Sometimes I think it's fine Crying boy in Baton Rouge 
Troubled men in this town too 
Passing strangers touch my sleeve 
All I do is think of me 
Sometimes I change my mind 
Sometimes I think it's fine Burning house in tupelo 
Devil's fire from down below 
Politician sang to me 
Someday girl we'll all be free 
Sometimes I change my mind 
Sometimes I think it's fine
