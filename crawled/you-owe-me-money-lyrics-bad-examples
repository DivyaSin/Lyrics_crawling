I think I'm gonna like this 
Cutting you down to size 
I've never been a bully -- I think it's about time 
Gonna take you in the alley 
Cut you up against the wall 
Makes me feel so big -- makes you look so small You owe me money 
You owe me money 
You owe me money 
I'm gonna get it all You're a real James Dean 
Another rebel on the run 
You gotta pay a price 
For having other people's fun Don't mess with me baby 
'Cause I've been standing in your shoes 
They got it out of me 
I'm gonna get it out of you
