So many times he crossed the line, overboard, overdrawn, over looked, it's over now 
She looks at herself no one to turn to, then she wonders how it got this far 
Led to pain and plight she renders false pretense to make him fight harder Lift him up to watch him crawl, so simple when we're young 
Laughing as it all unfolds, self-righteous grudge is sold Retrospect never shined so bright, different goals, different lives, never saw eye to eye 
Inflated stories, rumor mills, run their course, back to the source, words in circles or lies 
He tries to make her feel so used, plans her pain, all in vain, so he can close the door Lift her up to watch her fall, her broken heart grows numb 
Laughing as it all unfolds, Self-righteous grudge is sold All that you breed will become your disease and will only hurt ourselves, 
It's the love that you make, not the love that you take and that keeps us alive 
And you give and you take and you learn from mistakes and we all will survive 
And the sky may grow dark and the sun will then set but tomorrow's another start 
People try to hold you down, success eats them alive, if you falter you will soon find, quick responses from behind 
But if you prevail they'll turn inside out, act as if they never even had a doubt Lift us up to watch us fall, naive that we've caught on. Jealous right from the start 
We've only just begun
