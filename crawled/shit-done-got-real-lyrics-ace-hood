The Renegades.. 
Motherfuck this industry, God bless my enemies 
Too many lame niggas shy to speak, so they find a beat it don't bother me 
But um, any nigga can't rap, get'em out ASAP, talkin' bout they trappin again 
Hop in the booth, I've been the truth, got proof guess who was the popular kid 
Theres me in the drop top, with the glock out, pop shots in the back of ya head 
aiming at your esophogus, no kind of surviving *something* 
Damn, I'm so pissed off just a little, like a flow with a riddle, let her ass cheek jiggle uh 
I'm a dog and I'm all in the middle, fuck her *something* got balls all in'em what 
Damn I can't call up a nigga bust that real faithful all of my niggas 
got a man but fuck that nigga, I'm good anywhere like a sun passing'em 
god damn my flow so amazing, ask Renegades they can quote that statement 
Your bitch wanna have my baby, nigga fuck you pay me 
(chorus) 
Okay it's money over them bitches, coffins go to them snitches 
Talkin' outta your ass you gon' need a little more than those stitches boy 
shit done got real x4 
any given day you could be victimized, 
just pray and hope one day you see them heaven skies 
shit done got real x2 
(Busta Rhymes) 
I dont really think you niggas get it, I'mma decorate your face kinda like upholstery nigga 
it's gettin kinda real up in this motherfucker, I don't really think you really even should approach me nigga 
lay down motherfucker you ain't heard what i said, why you tryna play me closely nigga 
and now you wanna talk, I'm already by the door while you stranglin,and really tryna choke me nigga 
tell that nigga that I cut a nigga til you see the white meat, but I don't really eat poultry nigga 
fuck it it don't matter anyway, cause you know about to lay up in a box in a cozy nigga 
it be getting kinda bad *something*, when a dude be acting like he know me nigga 
and I had to let her go *something* 
*something* eat slowly nigga 
*something* make a nigga strip down, bare, *something* nigga 
I know it's unbelievable, well bitch you better believe it *something* 
*something* if watch lookin like a ceremony nigga 
and when I'm finished with them, then I go and get his little bitch and say blow me nigga 
I wanna cry for your friend, why you tryna front when you got so much to lose 
the problem is that i'm the one that show you the truth, they'll talk about you when a nigga get in the booth 
you niggas better know the deal when i come through better learn or your gunna feel *something 
shit done got real shit done got real! 
(chorus) 
Okay it's money over them bitches, coffins go to them snitches 
Talkin' outta your ass you gon' need a little more than those stitches boy 
shit done got real x4 
any given day you could be victimized, 
just pray and hope one day you see them heaven skies 
shit done got real Yela got a deal 
shit done got real, Yela got a deal
