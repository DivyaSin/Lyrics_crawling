I've been here, been there 
I've been every god damn where 
You're a robber of life 
And if you were a woman would you be my wife I'm no loser in the end 
Don't tell me that you understand 
'Cause everything is just a frame 
Come on I'm no sucker you can bend 
I've got a rendezvous in hell 
Life for me is just a game 
Where everybody's crazy! I know that Jesus was a fool 
Maybe he was kinda wool 
But I don't know what to do no more 
When everybody's crazy I've been here, been there 
I've been every motherfuckin' where 
You're a robber of life 
And if you were a woman you would be my wife, I swear Tonight you want to do some 
Tonight you want to be one 
One of 'em guys who sold their souls 
For the rock n' roll remote control 
You switch your channel and do what you're told 
I can't lie, I won't cry 
But maybe I'll meet him before I die 
Too soon it's too late, man 
Am I angel or concrete hate? 
But I got horns and I got wings 
But I won't fly until my angel sings for me 
They say fly, they sing 
They say die, I say why? 
But I won't let 'em in the ring 
It's gonna take some time 'til my angel sings
