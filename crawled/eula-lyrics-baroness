Settle down 
This wont last long 
Ive been out 
And I want back in 
So why not completely fade away When my bones begin to break 
And my head begins to shake 
Its my own blood When my house becomes a cage 
And the neighbours turn away 
Its my own blood Settle down 
This wont last long 
Ive been out 
And I want back in 
So why not completely fade away Where the butchers hand is home 
Laughs the blade above the throne 
Its my own blood Oh, this apple makes me sick 
Cries the pig upon his stick 
Its my own blood And I cant forget the taste 
Cant forget the taste of my own tongue 
And I cant forget the taste 
Cant forget the taste of my own tongue And If I had a heart 
Id waste it on you 
But its all together far too long 
Since I took you down Settle down 
This wont last long 
Ive been out 
And I want back in 
So why not completely fade away When weve licked all of the lips 
And the salt-stained fingertips 
Its my own blood When our lambs and lions made 
Debts no righteous man can pay 
Its my own blood And I cant forget the taste 
Cant forget the taste of my own tongue 
And I cant forget the taste 
Cant forget the taste of my own tongue
