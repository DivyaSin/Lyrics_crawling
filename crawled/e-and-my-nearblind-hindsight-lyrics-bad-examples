Theres other girls, and then theres you 
And then theres me trapped between and wondering what to do 
You push me away, but I wont go 
And Im not sure which one of us to blame anymore 
If you could sell me to the camel drivers 
Id be led away blindfolded in the night 
Me and my near blind hindsight 
Theres honesty and then theres truth 
And theres a thin but unmoving line between the two 
Youve never lied through your teeth 
Unless you count the things you hid from yourself as well as me 
If you could sell me to the camel drivers 
Id be led away blindfolded in the night 
If you could feed me to the lion trainers 
Youd let the gods decide if I was wrong or right 
Theres me and my regrets, and me and my excuses 
Theres my brilliant misdirections and my adamant confusion 
Theres me and all the things that I never could get right 
And me and my nearblind hindsight 
Theres other girls, and then theres you 
And then theres me trapped between and wondering what to do 
I should have known, but I dont know yet 
That the human heart can only love the things it can forget 
Me and my near blind hindsight 
Me and my near blind hindsight 
Me and my near blind hindsight
