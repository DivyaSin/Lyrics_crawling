You I see 
Sitting waiting for me 
By the station in a blue ride 
Wearing red for the first time You are free 
But yet you choose to be rated 
While I'll be dancing 
In the moonlight You I see 
Sitting waiting for me 
By the station in a blue ride 
Wearing red for the first time You are free 
But yet you choose to be rated 
While I'll be playing 
With the stars tonight 
Tonight
