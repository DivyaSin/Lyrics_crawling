I can't deny 
Things have been good 
But I don't know why 
They don't quite seem what they should 
My only evidence is my sixth sense 
Tellin' me 
You're doing all the things you used to do again I know your history 
But I don't think you can do those things to me When the cat's away the mice will play 
But think about the price you pay 
You can run, you can hide 
Deny and lie 
But words travel faster than the speed of light 
So when the cat's away the mice will play 
But don't you play that stunt on me 
Cause I spy with my little eye 
And if I catch you, bye bye Well, hear me out 
When I'm out of town 
It doesn't give you a license to fool around 
I feel it 
You haven't changed 
I believe it 
You're back to playing your ol' games I know your history 
But I don't think you can do those things to me When the cat's away the mice will play 
But think about the price you pay 
You can run, you can hide 
Deny and lie 
But words travel faster than the speed of light 
So when the cat's away the mice will play 
But don't you play that stunt on me 
Cause I spy with my little eye 
And if I catch you, bye bye x 2 They say 
That you can't teach on old dog brand new tricks 
And baby my friend's tallin' me that you won't change 
And maybe they're right, there's just one thing you should know 
If you break the promise you made to me 
On the count of three 
You, be, out When the cat's away the mice will play 
But think about the price you pay 
You can run, you can hide 
Deny and lie 
But words travel faster than the speed of light 
So when the cat's away the mice will play 
But don't you play that stunt on me 
Cause I spy with my little eye 
And if I catch you, bye bye x 3
