Secrets they were killing me 
Pulled me under in too deep 
All those shadows they don't let go 
Easily But everything I covered up 
Is opening inside Your love 
Let Your grace illuminate 
The heart in me Oh, You're bringing me to life 
And I'm finding who I am in You 
Who I am in You 
Oh, You're changing me inside 
And I'm finding who I am in You 
Who I am in You Breath Your breath into my soul 
Let my heart beat with Your own 
I need Your mercy 
Even when it hurts 
Please shine on me 
Shine on me Oh, You're bringing me to life 
And I'm finding who I am in You 
Who I am in You 
Oh, You're changing me inside 
And I'm finding who I am in You 
Who I am If there's anything I try to hide 
I pray that You will bring it to the light 
Strip away the lies that I pretend 
Teach me how to be a child again Resting in Your arms 
Resting in Your arms 
And I could feel Your love changing me Oh, You're bringing me to life 
And I'm finding who I am in You 
Who I am in You 
Oh, I've finally realized 
That I'm finding who I am in You 
Who I am 
In You 
Who I am in You 
Who I am in You
