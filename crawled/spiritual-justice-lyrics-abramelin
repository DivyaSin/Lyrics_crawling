Waiting to die, waiting to die 
The lonely horror of this concrete hell 
Eating my last supper 
I recall the lives I've swallowed Priests and guards now at my room 
Cold and heartless stares 
My throat is dry, my heart pounds 
Struck with terror cold sweat runs Sitting in my death throne 
Arms and legs strapped tight 
Electric crown, my sure demise 
Adorns my shaven head The switch is thrown, a power surge 
The lights begin to dim 
My bowels give way, my brain implodes 
My blood starts to boil Darkness falls, no more pain, awaiting my damnation 
Biding my time for eternity 
A light appears, a blinding light, brighter than a thousand suns 
A darkened figure reaches out takes me by the hand No time wasted, pain begins 
Repayment time, for all my sins 
Descending into a world of hate 
Vast swelling clots in an ocean of blood Agonizing torment, death so divine 
Clawing with my fingers, rasping at my eyes 
Tears of blood streaming down my face 
Howling in pain separating flesh from bone Rich pain pours from crying wounds 
Countless souls in putrid tombs 
Crimson mountains, landscapes of gore 
No redemption for me
