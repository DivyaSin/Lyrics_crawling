I'll give you time and I wont mind 
I feel so tired from all the thoughts running through my head 
I'll stay inside and wait it out cause I haven't felt 
This way before It's gone straight to the soul 
But It's all in my head I've been here far too long waiting for the news, for the news 
And you've played me like a fool now it's time to choose, who's gonna loose? I'll comb my hair and brush you out like I couldn't care 
Cause I feel taller, the old me would take the fall 
You've had some time to find yourself 
To find the truth, you lost yourself I've been here far too long waiting for the news, for the news 
And you've played me like a fool now it's time to choose, who's gonna loose? You've had some time to find yourself 
To find the truth, you lost yourself I've been here far too long waiting for the news, for the news 
And you've played me like a fool now it's time to choose, who's gonna loose?
