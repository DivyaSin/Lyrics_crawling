Rap 
In our world, this is my dedication, some times is good to have a patient, you dont have to break the rules or regulation, check out this hook, it sound like revolution, dont expect your downfall, pushing life forward sometimes will make your hands full, things gonna be better, when dose problem line up pray about it and learn how to deal with it, is not that the world is passing you, but it takes time to get up from back to that paradise, live because you are breathing, breathe because you are living, also keep on believing, and just keep life moving, things maybe a little bit hard, dont ask why, keep having hope, whether life is good or bad , is gonna be a pain if you bump your head, and it n't gonna look fine, as Bob said, is gonna be alright. Chorus 
I know everything is gonna be alright just keep your head up and be strong ok , we've got to push along and keep it real, it's gonna be alright, sometimes you've go to make a fist raised to the sky like this and scream out i'll be strong ! Rap 
You will never stay out off the line, now get up and party, God gave you life to live, get up and love it ,to protect it, you better dont hate it, you know that the blessing of God will be coming out soon, now get up and have it, Yo, no need to play game before you come through, I gonna make mine and I hope you make yours too, the world is yours if you do what you have to, is good you count one before you count two, apply courage and get ready to cross the line, if you feel slow change to the faster lane, but remember not shed blood with your fingers, dont worry soon you gonna tell the world you are the men not a stranger, good life is something some deserve but many they deny, just do something with your life, surely God will provide, me and you know real Gs will always have good God on their side so. Chorus 
I know everything is gonna be alright just keep your head up and be strong ok , we've got to push along and keep it real, it's gonna be alright sometimes you've go to make a fist raised to the sky like this and scream out i'll be strong !
