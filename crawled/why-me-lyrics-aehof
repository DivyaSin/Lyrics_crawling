Why me? Why me? 
Please set me free! 
Trapped in this soulless cage, 
Screaming at the bars, 
Venting my pathetic rage. Chorus: 
Why me? Why me? 
Free me, free me! 
Agony, agony! 
Melodies, melodies, 
All cry, 
Why me? Why me? 
Why? Why me? Why me? 
Won't let me be! 
Tears my weeping soul asunder, 
Leaving my raw being open, 
Open to the blood and thunder. Why me? Why me? 
Screams the constant melody, 
Ripping my head from side to side, 
While in my heart 
I've gracefully died.
