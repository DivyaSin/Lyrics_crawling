We found a broken wooden boat 
And with a hammer and some nails 
Those old blue sheets from our bed 
We got it to sail I was afraid to go out too far 
You didn't want to leave the shore 
But we pushed it in the water 
And found what we were looking for We set sail on a little boat 
Right out to sea 
On this great adventure 
Just a paddle, you and me 
You and me We drifted out on the water 
Underneath the moon's light 
It never mattered where we were going 
We had the stars as our guide But we went out to deep 
And when couldn't see the shore 
You started the battle 
And I brought the war The waves came crashing in 
I watched you try to hang on 
It was too late to pull you back 
You were already gone We set sail on a little boat 
Right out to sea 
On this great adventure 
Just a paddle, you and me We set sail on a little boat 
Right out to sea 
On this great adventure 
Just a paddle, you and me 
You and me I flew a plane across the ocean 
Hoping to find you in the sea 
I saw you standing on dry land 
And her staring back at me Storm clouds came rolling in 
Lighting striking down 
There was nothing I could do 
I had to let our little boat drown We set sail on a little boat 
Right out to sea 
On this great adventure 
Just a paddle, you and me 
You and me We set sail on a little boat 
Right out to sea 
On this great adventure 
Just a paddle, you and me 
You and Me (Spoken) When we love someone 
They become a part our heart 
When we loose someone 
They take a part of our heart with them
