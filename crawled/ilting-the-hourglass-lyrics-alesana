You take my breath away... 
But Ill never again taste your lips 
As fate keeps me locked away 
I must close my eyes to see your face Emptiness has darkened my eyes 
As I hopelessly beg for my life to end 
...tell my why... 
My iron eyes tell the tale 
Heroes always pay in their blood 
I can be only this I see the fear growing in their lost eyes 
My purpose is so clear...I am the ax 
I am the ax and this is why I must not fear the end 
And when I'm gone will you forget me? 
Pen wears its steady course across the page 
Resigned to its designs to take the hive Emptiness has darkened my eyes 
As I hopelessly beg for my life to end 
...tell my why... 
I wish I could make you see, I wish I could make you see through the pain 
Through the end, I wish I could make you see the greater purpose that 
I have to serve...no one else will fight...no one else will fight...so I must 
My iron eyes tell the tale 
Heroes always pay in their blood 
I can be only this ...I am the ax... 
Fear has been lost to faith 
The darkest night has come before the end 
Of which we must prevail 
Amidst the pitch of steel we shall arise 
I will destroy all those who oppose me My iron eyes tell the tale 
Heroes always pay in their blood 
I can be only this I see the fear growing in there...
