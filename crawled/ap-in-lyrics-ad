[Verse 1: AD] 
Give it to 'em like woo 
What you say now? 
Once it clean, I go 8 rounds 
By the way, ay 
Grab life like it 8 mile 
Want a feature, hit the PayPal 
Say round, woo 
Fuck a stop sign 
It's a go to the cop shop 
Want some Yeezys, I'mma cop mine 
Anybody tryna stop mine 
Same nigga on the way up 
I'm all live 
Wait, wait a minute, I ain't playing with it 
Kobe blowing up my line while I lay up in it 
Damn, run your mouth, I'mma stay offended 
Labels tripping, staying independent 
Got me like woo 
It's so many right now 
Going through and make it happen 
For the team right now 
I'm looking clean right now 
You still get a beating right now 
Give it to 'em like woo [Hook: Nef The Pharaoh & (AD)] 
Lame ass niggas play hard 
Come last, [?] 
(I give it to 'em like woo) 
From the Bay to LA 
We the niggas in charge, come through you better tap in 
(I give it to 'em like woo) 
Like woah, give it to 'em 
Give it to 'em like woah 
(I give it to 'em like woo) 
Like woah, give it to 'em 
Give it to 'em like woah 
(I give it to 'em like woo) [Verse 2: Nef The Pharaoh] 
I give it to 'em like woo 
It's for my niggas in the shoes 
I never switch, I love my crew 
I pour it up, I sip juice 
I had 4 sets too 
I hit that [?] on you 
I got payroll on you 
Back roll full of [?] 
Yeah I ball like the hoop 
Make it, call it a shoot 
Now your family miss you 
They got family issues 
I'm just playing my crew 
I got duties to do 
I got money to take 
I got checks in the bank 
I kiss girls in they face 
Fall asleep off the drank 
I go hard in the paint 
You rapping like you a real nigga 
But you ain't 
[?] 
And put that bitch on skates 
And I just knock a hoe 
And sent that bitch on dates 
I been in it for a minute 
My recognition is late 
[?] 
I'm the great, nigga say it to my face [Hook: Nef The Pharaoh & (AD)] 
Lame ass niggas play hard 
Come last, [?] 
(I give it to 'em like woo) 
From the Bay to LA 
We the niggas in charge, come through you better tap in 
(I give it to 'em like woo) 
Like woah, give it to 'em 
Give it to 'em like woah 
(I give it to 'em like woo) 
Like woah, give it to 'em 
Give it to 'em like woah 
(I give it to 'em like woo) [Verse 3: E-40] [Hook: Nef The Pharaoh & (AD)] 
Lame ass niggas play hard 
Come last, [?] 
(I give it to 'em like woo) 
From the Bay to LA 
We the niggas in charge, come through you better tap in 
(I give it to 'em like woo) 
Like woah, give it to 'em 
Give it to 'em like woah
