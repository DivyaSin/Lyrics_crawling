What is home? 
Pack your possesions and leave us alone 
Forget your colour and creed 
Your sexuality embarrassed us all 
Take off your Asian tag and hit the road 
The word is why I need a God 
I need a God to impress 
Get off my soul 
So many nerds have we found them all 
C-A-F-F-E-I-N-E

I don't want to find a new home

Caffeine They would prefer it if you lived off drugs 
It's not a curable disease 
Your sexuality confounded their world 
Take off you Asian tag and hit the road 
The word is why I need a God 
I need a God to impress 
Get off my soul 
So many nerds have we found them all C-A-F-F-E-I-N-E

I don't know why I need a God 
I need a God to impress 
Confused my soul 
So many words do we need them all
