I've noticed, people, they all have motives. 
Different, yet all the same. 
I fumble through every word that is spoken, 
And I barely knew your name. 
I'm tongue-tied, it runs through my blood and my insides; 
Some things we can't escape. 
But if we try, if we try, we can leave this behind. It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we waited for. 
A simple question, kid, "are you with me or not at all?" Your eyes wide, always ahead of the curve tide, 
Quiet, and confident. 
Oh, we stood there, awkward and youthful, we tangled; 
A piece of my soul escaped. 
Oh, we are restless and tired, sleeping with giants, 
A model make out with the egos of fire and it seems like it's been a lifetime, 
A lifetime we've waited for. 
A simple question, kid, "are you with me or not at all?" Are we wasting time or is it wasting us? 
It's been a lifetime waiting for now, now. 
Well, you've got to find a way, 
You've got to find a way, 
You've got to find a way, 
You've got to find a way, 
You've got to find a way before you fold in. It's been a lifetime, 
A lifetime I've been waiting for. 
A simple question, kid, "are you with me or not at all?" It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we waited for. 
I need an answer, kid, you're either with me or not at all, no, no. 
Are we wasting time or is it wasting us? 
It's been a lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime, yeah. 
Well, you've got to find a way, 
You've got to find a way, 
You've got to find a way, 
You've got to find a way. 
Said you've got to find a way, 
You've got to find a way, 
You've got to find a way before you fold in.
