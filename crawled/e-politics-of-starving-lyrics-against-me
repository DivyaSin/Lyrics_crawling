It's time for some real world politics 
Economics, history, math and english. 
There are some of us who have, and some that go without. 
America and justice are not synonymous. 
For all the fights, for all the songs, all we said. 
All we have are these pictures of us. 
If it doesnt matter now, then it never really did, 
And without this, we might as well be dead. 
They're all black and white people, 
And that doens't have anything to do with us. 
After all these years its still an arms race, 
After all these years they still dont fucking get it. 
Lives and cultures matter more than capitalist interest. 
It's the FBI; its the CIA; the SAF; the IMF, from HMOs to MTV. Fuck you. 
For all the fights, for all the songs, all we said. 
All we have are these pictures of us. 
And if it doesn't matter now, then it never really did, 
Without this, we might as well be dead. 
When you are so hungry that you'd believe anything. 
They're selling you the politics of starving. 
what the fuck does that mean to us.
