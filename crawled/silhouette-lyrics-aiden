Sillhouettes In the entrance of your faded Yellow hallway 
From the light of the street lamp on your corner 
And in time, oh the hours and the minuets 
But lately as the seconds stare 
and all the years. And I know that its hard to fall 
On your own 
so im here 
so you dont have to fall alone So I'm here so you won't have to fall alone..
