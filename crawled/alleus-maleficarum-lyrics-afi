Open my eyes as I submerge 
And I won't deny what I've been since birth 
I'll die drowned by your standards 
Breathe in the life of the summers death 
As the orange and red breathe their first breath 
So welcome as they're burning through We all begin to burn 
Autumn's flame dances in my eyes 
Set alight for all we've learned 
My ashes falling My skin is singed but it heals my heart 
And with glowing pride I'll wear my scars 
Honored by your hatred 
Leaves fall we arise again 
And the end impending it will begin 
So welcome as it's burning through We all begin to burn 
Autumn's flame dances in my eyes 
Set alight for all we've learned 
My ashes falling, can you feel me? Go, woh oh oh, go, woh oh oh 
Go, woh oh oh, go, woh oh oh oh oh Ashes fall and I'm rising up again 
Ashes fall and I'm rising up again 
Ashes fall and I'm rising up again 
Ashes fall, ashes fall, fall, fall 
Ashes fall as we all arise We all begin to burn 
Autumn's flame dances in my eyes 
Set alight for all we've learned 
My ashes falling, can you feel me? Go, woh oh oh, go, woh oh oh 
Go, woh oh oh, go, woh oh oh oh oh
