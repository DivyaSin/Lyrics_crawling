Love the coal 
Love the way you're waiting 
I love your kind patience Dust and water, water and dust 
Water and dust Did you think I'd leave you here forever? Dust and water, water and dust 
Water and dust How long can dust wait? 
Ask the moon but ask him soon 
Ask him soon Dust and water, water and dust 
Water and dust Dust and water, water and dust
