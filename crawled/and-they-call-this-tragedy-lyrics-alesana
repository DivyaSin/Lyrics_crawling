You make me sick I'll tear out those diamond eyes I can't bear to see 
Crimson spills on paper skin 
They call this tragedy 
Remembering the nights when you'd whisper to me soft, "forever more my heart is yours" 
Realize those words have died [Chorus] 
As the life fades from your eyes 
All that I can say is it may not be too late 
Try again, make it perfect, make me worth it 
Or else die for all I care If I can not be loved then none shall be 
Think of this as I softly kiss your blood glazed lips once more 
On this night this thing you call love dies 
Your face disgusts me, smile and bear your lies 
This broken trust will become your demise [Chorus] After today silence will haunt you 
Expect no forgiveness for your life will end tonight 
Now I grit my teeth and finish what I know must be done 
To kill the memory of you, and you said this would be forever [Chorus]
