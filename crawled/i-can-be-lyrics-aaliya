Maybe I'm just wrong 
For feelin' the way I do 
Thoughts indecent 
Want to put those down to you 
I know you have a girl 
I don't want to lie 
When your free one night just make those hours mine [Chorus] 
I can be another woman in your life 
I can be another reason you're up at night 
I can be all the things you thought she might 
I can be on the side 
That would be alright, alright, alright Love just ain't my thing 
But half of you might be 
Enough for two or more 
No her to me and you 
Fine like expensive wine 
Drunk off one glass of you 
I think that might be to much 
So weekends for me are cool [Chorus: x2]
