Voices in the air, drifting from afar 
Evening finds her waking, dancing with the stars 
And when I'm waiting for the sun to smile upon my face 
Moongirl's softly sleeping, daylight dreams away 
Silence stepping by, lightly on the ground 
Movng like a butterfly, never makes a sound 
And when I'm waiting for the sun to shine so I can see 
Comes the dancing moongirl, watching over me 
(Love of my life) Moongirl shines her light on me 
Moongirl, she's the one I see 
Takes me to the places where I long to be 
She moves me, she moves me
