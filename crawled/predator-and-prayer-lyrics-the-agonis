We hear you, we don't care 
We hear you, we don't care 
We hear you, we don't care You sit and soak in your beliefs 
You cling to ice and think 
You'll float away to your demise 
And won't regret a thing Allow me to shatter your fantasy 
Your childhood dream 
I'll crush your reality 
The gabled roofs make it easy I know you aren't kidding 
I can't help but find it fitting We're the ones who hear your prayers 
We won't answer, we don't care 
So, let your demons in 
This is where your life begins I'm selfish and responsible. I want the credit and I'll take the blame. Earth created man, man created God - I'm not passive enough to allow some invention to take it all. I'm part of a macrocosm 
That is the living Earth 
And like a body or cell 
It is my will to keep the Earth in health We're the ones who hear your prayers 
We won't answer, we don't care 
So, let your demons in 
This is how your life begins How are you so gullible? 
So easily swayed? 
I just want to shake you 
Break through your daze Our brains aren't sophisticated enough to understand the complexity and wonder of Nature. God is a man-made invention to allocate power and responsibility to a tacitile body. We're the ones who hear your prayers 
We won't answer, we don't care 
So, let your demons in 
This is when your life begins Believers prefer to be right than correct 
In an environment for change, turn left 
Sight through mind is imagination 
Hallucination mimics perception 
Bridge the chasm between blindness and sight 
The machinery of the brain generates the theater of the Mind We hear you, we don't care 
We hear you, we just don't care
