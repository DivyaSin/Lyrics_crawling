Came to your border 
Looking back into the night 
Falling down on the city lights far away 
Tell me the answer 
Who knows the wrong from the right? 
Years may come and years they go 
You've seen your bridges burning 
And the wheels of time keep turning Like a ship in the night 
You passed along the highways of my life 
And now my mind you're always in 
And the ten-thirty flight will soon be headed my way 
As she sails across the skyway of Berlin Oh, and to think of all the changes you have seen 
Oh, and reflect upon the way it might have been Like a ship in the night 
You passed along the highways of my life 
And now my mind you're always in 
And the ten-thirty flight will soon be headed my way 
As she sails across the skyway of Berlin
