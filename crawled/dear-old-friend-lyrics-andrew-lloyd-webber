Bathing beauty, on the beach Very nice, Meg 
Do you think so, mother, really? 
You've come a long way since the beginning of the season 
Does he agree? 
It's been three months, he never comes to see the show 
Even a word from him, just one You may get more than that 
He has been composing again, late at night 
Not this cheap Vaudeville trash, something glorious 
For, for me? 
Continue to work hard 
Make yourself useful to him Mother 
Patience, Gustave, first I must find the stage manager 
My dressing room, the musical director 
Then we'll go look for our friend and go see the island? 
I'm sure he'll send for you when he's ready 
Well, excuse me, miss, would you mind? Heaven help me, could it be? 
No, it couldn't possibly 
Sorry, do I? 
Yes, I think you do Have we? 
Go on, take a guess 
Wait, it can't be, is it?

It can't be you 
Is this a jest? 
How can this be? We've come to work 
At whose request? 
The contract's here 
I want to see My God, the price 
It's rather high 
Why, it's absurd 
Oh, yes, I know Inform your boss 
That by the by 
The fee goes up 
Or else we go My dear old friend 
Here's how things appear, old friend 
He who pays the bill 
Times two or three 
Be sure he will 
And handsomely And dear old friend 
Now that we are clear, old friend 
That's all very well but till you're gone 
You'll wait upon my boss' whim 
Ah, yes, your boss and who is that? 
It's him Sorry, did I hear you right? 
Here to sing 
Tomorrow night? 
I'm afraid there must be some mistake You can't be performing 
Why? 
Mainly, dear 'cause so am I 
I'm in fact the star, for heaven's sake What are you to sing? 
Just one little thing, an aria 
Please you needn't fret 
I'm sure you will get your due Him? 
That's what I said 
You work for him? 
Now so do you And my poor wife 
We thought him dead 
She'll be appalled 
Unless she knew Darling, please, are you alright? 
(Tell me now, that music, who was its creator?) 
Darling, please don't squeeze so tight 
(Something's going on here, I'll deal with you later) Did you know? 
How could I know 
Why would they come? 
Why won't they go? My dear old friend 
Can't believe you're here, old friend 
Speaking as your host 
As an artist 
What a surprise 
To say the least Yes, dear old friend 
That's a happy tear, old friend 
I can't conceal, try though I may 
The way I feel so I pretend 
I'm sure it's clear 
To such a dear old friend You mustn't stay 
Why would I leave? 
Why are we here? 
Don't play naive What dear old friends 
Don't we all live here, old friends? 
Nothing has been changed 
And never will 
Just rearranged 
And yet we're still Such grand old friends 
Such devoted and old friends 
Words cannot suggest 
What's in my heart 
And for the rest 
Why even start? My dear old friends
