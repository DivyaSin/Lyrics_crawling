Her skin is like satin 
It looks so smooth and white 
Her eyes like black coffee 
Are all I need tonight She's wearing a long dress tonight 
I don't know what's hiding inside 
And I know they say that less is more 
But I want to love her so Amor, amor gitana, amor gitana, amor gitana 
Canta Copacabana, con mi guitarra, con mi guitarra 
Amor, amor gitana, amor gitana, amor gitana 
You know you make me wanna, you make me wanna, 
You make me wanna Have you heard about this pretty girl 
With a naughty smile how they call her 
Has golden hair, like a fairytale 
Everyone is watching her tonight 
I will try my luck I won't be shy If I get a dance 
I will take my chance She's wearing a long dress tonight 
I don't know what's hiding inside 
And I know they say that less is more 
But I want to love her so Amor, amor gitana, amor gitana, amor gitana 
Canta Copacabana, con mi guitarra, con mi guitarra 
Amor, amor gitana, amor gitana, amor gitana 
You know you make me wanna, you make me wanna, 
You make me wanna Amor, amor gitana, amor gitana, amor gitana 
Canta Copacabana, con mi guitarra, con mi guitarra 
Amor, amor gitana, amor gitana, amor gitana 
You know you make me wanna, you make me wanna, 
You make me wanna
