Her daddy's knockin' at the bedroom door 
Cocked and loaded with a forty four 
I got one in the hand and two in the bush 
I'm in no man's land and it's a hell of a rush I got just one wood, six holes to play 
Things ain't fair on this fairway What's eating you is eating me 
What's eating you is eating me 
Say you and you and me makes three 
What's eating you is eating me Mama's in the kitchen swingin' a date 
With a new milkman and his best friend's mate, oh yeah 
The house is rockin' to the ground 
But daddy ain't happy, no, he's missin' out I got just one wood, six holes to play 
Things ain't fair on this fairway What's eating you is eating me 
What's eating you is eating me 
Say you and you and me makes three 
What's eating you is eating me 
What's eating you? What's eating you is eating me 
What's eating you is eating me 
Say you and you and me makes three 
What's eating you is eating me What's eating you is eating me 
What's eating you is eating me 
Oh, say you and you and me makes three 
What's eating you is eating me
