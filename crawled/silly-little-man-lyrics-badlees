My how you have changed 
You silly little man 
Now everybody loves you 
For reasons they don't understand 
And it was all in the name of getting you 
The things you knew that you had coming 
You silly little man You say you're not to blame 
You silly little man 
It's all part of a game 
That can't be changed 
You take it while you can 
It's all in the name of getting you 
The things that you know you have coming 
You silly little man You're with the beautiful people now 
You've made yourself a name 
You silly little man 
Your critical acclaim 
And newfound fame 
Have made you understand 
It's all in the name of getting to a place 
Where you feel like you're something 
You silly little man You're with the beautiful people now 
Now I think I understand 
What the old man meant 
Sitting at the kitchen table 
With his head between his hands 
Chew what you can't swallow 
Then spit it on the ground 
Smiles stop the screaming 
'Til your time comes around My how you have changed 
You silly little man 
Now everybody loves you 
For reasons you don't understand 
And it was all in the name of getting you 
The things you knew 
That you had coming 
You fucking stupid silly little man You're with the beautiful people now
