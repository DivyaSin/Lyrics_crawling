Under suburbia the energy flows 
Into the night slowly the city goes 
I know, you're out there are thinking of me 
Take away my troubles, make me see clearly Don't wanna look the future straight in the eye 
Time passes by, I just up and die 
Life plays a game that I know, I can't win 
Deadlines, commitments they keep comin' back again Runaway , is there really any hope? 
Runaway, my life is goin' up in smoke 
Apathy 
Gotta get out of the city The days pass by like a rush hour day 
There's still no sign, I keep pluggin' away 
Pushed to the point of a breakdown again 
Kicked in and dented but somehow still standin'
