No, woman, no cry, 
No, woman, no cry, 
No, woman, no cry, 
No, woman, no cry. 'Cause, 'cause, 'cause, I remember when we used to sit 
In the government yard in Trenchtown, 
Oba - obaserving the 'ypocrites 
Mingle with the good people we meet. 
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost 
Along the way. 
In this great future, you can't forget your past, 
So dry your tears, I seh. No, woman, no cry, 
No, woman, no cry. 
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears, 
No, woman, no cry. Said, said, said, I remember when-a we used to sit 
In the government yard in Trenchtown. 
And then Georgie would make the fire lights, 
As it was logwood burnin' through the nights. 
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, 
Of which I'll share with you, 
My feet is my only carriage, 
So I've got to push on through. 
While I'm gone Everything's gonna be all right! 
Everything's gonna be all right! 
Everything's gonna be all right! 
Everything's gonna be all right! 
Everything's gonna be all right! 
Everything's gonna be all right! 
Everything's gonna be all right! 
Everything's gonna be all right! So, no woman, no cry, 
No, no, woman, woman, no cry. 
I say, oh little oh little darling, don't shed no tears, 
No, woman, no cry. No woman, no woman, no woman, no cry 
No woman, no cry, one more time I've to say 
Oh little little darling, please don't shed no tears, 
No woman, no cry No woman, no woman, no cry
