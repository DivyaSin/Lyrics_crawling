The house lights dim 
Base shakes the floor 
Shadows appear 
The audience roars 
Amplifiers ring 
Banging of heads 
Music made to wake the dead 
And right there in the middle of it all 
Is my baby singing White noise 
White noise 
She loves her heavy metal 
So come on boys 
Play it loud 
She wants that 
White noise I love the girl 
She loves the band 
Likes to get high 
And rock out in my Chevy van 
And sometimes I think 
I'm being used but, 
I can take a little abuse 
When my baby's on my shoulders 
Shaking her fists to that. White noise 
White noise 
She wants her heavy metal 
So come on boys 
Play it loud 
She digs that 
White noise Sometimes I think 
I'm being used but, 
I don't mind a little abuse 
When my baby's on my shoulders 
Shaking her fists to that. White noise 
White noise 
She wants her heavy metal 
So come on boys 
Play it loud She wants to hear that white white white noise 
She wants to hear that white white white noise 
She wants to hear that white noise
