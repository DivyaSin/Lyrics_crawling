Music: jones Lyrics: Miss america, music lover, a dancer in the uso 
A one time loser a two time fiend, 
Says she even likes black crowes 
Bought a faux fur now she's a hip girl 
Head full of acid and pearls 
The cops said no, so we left idaho 
Heading to the cost for the show 
Said she's a sinner but you know she's a saint 
Still she's trouble with a capital "t". (chorus): 
Cause you know she's gonna 
Rock and roll 
Miss america is 
Rock and roll 
She gotta lip for the fool 
And you know she's gonna 
Rock and roll Keep your head up 
And look for the cup 
Fill it with the wine from the still. 
Miss america, music lover 
Spent the last 20 years on the pill. 
Said she's a sinner but you know she's a saint 
Still she's tripping with a capital "t". (chorus) 
(chorus) Got divorced, left court broke, of course 
Baggin' alimon' for the jag 
Quit cigarettes so she's tired and tense 
Just a 50 year groupie in drag. 
Said she's a sinner but she knows she's a saint 
Still she's trouble with a capital "t". (chorus)
