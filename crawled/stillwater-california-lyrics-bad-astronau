Still waters death defying 
Cesspools from stagnation 
Wading the quicksand channel 
Slow moving light focus 
Anywhere but here bogus 
This perfect world captivates you And it survives you 
Hey Derrick 
Soils you 
Hey Jason 
Silences you 
Hey Bomer 
Dogs in the still water wade 
Until they drown On to the escalators 
Down on the elevators 
Vagrants and wayfarers 
Prime real estate to be homeless 
Quality in quantity 
In seemingly endless sunny 
Sand filled hourglass of death And it shined on you 
Hey Derrick 
Lied to you 
Hey Jason 
Gagged on you 
Hey Bomer 
Dogs on the still water drown 
Before their small town
