I met a girl on a Friday night 
She ran her mouth and she caused a fight 
Heading for the exit door 
I never made it off the floor More a lover than the fighting type 
I never claimed to be the great white hype 
Oh no, I'd rather have a broken heart 
Than have my body torn apart I believe, I believe, I believe in something 
I believe, I believe, I believe in running 
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run I remember back in school 
I always had to play the fool 
Whenever there was choosing sides 
I would always be denied When I was waiting for the bus 
There always seemed to be a fuss 
I could never walk alone 
'Cause I was in a danger zone But I believe, I believe, I believe in something 
I believe, I believe, I believe in running 
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run Daddy always said believe in something 
And I believe in staying alive 
But when it comes to blows I ain't worth nothing 'Cause I believe in love, love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love Fast forward, almost twenty years 
Found a girl that was so sincere 
Wouldn't trade me for another guy 
Never leave and I'll tell you why You see, it happened on a Friday night 
She ran her mouth and she caused a fight 
Started swinging and she cleared the floor 
Ran away with her forever more But I believe, I believe, I believe in something 
I believe, I believe, I believe in loving 
I believe, I believe, I believe in something 
I believe, I believe, I believe in loving I believe, I believe, I believe in something 
I believe, I believe, I believe in loving 
Love, love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love
