You make my life a mess 
I feel like losing control 
I know you gave your best 
But for me, baby not enough I don't need your help 
I'm right to find myself 
So go find someone else Don't bother me yet 
Don't cry, don't claim 
I don't want you to stay 
Oh, no, don't tell me who I am 
(Tell me who I am) 
Don't bother me yet I hate me just for loving you 
But hard choices make us better 
I know I'm gonna solve my issues 
That's why... why I'm letting you go 
Forever I don't need your help 
I'm right to find myself 
So go find someone else Don't bother me yet 
Don't cry, don't claim 
I don't want you to stay 
Oh, no, don't tell me who I am (tell me who I am) 
Don't bother me yet 
Don't fight, don't blame 
I just want that you walk away 
So please don't tell me who I am (tell me who I am) 
Don't I don't need your help 
I'm right to find myself 
So go find someone else Don't bother me yet 
Don't cry, don't claim 
I don't want you to stay 
Oh, no, don't tell me who I am (tell me who I am) Don't bother me yet 
Don't cry, don't claim 
I don't want you to stay 
Oh, no, don't tell me who I am (tell me who I am) 
Don't bother me yet 
Walk away 
So please don't tell me who I am (tell me who I am)
