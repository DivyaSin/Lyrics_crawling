Im slowly sinking down 
Feel my universe tumble to the ground 
When I was young I knew truth was easy to understand as true 
Trying to prove that the earth is flat again 
Wishing life was as clear as it should have been 
Crawling into the void, all alone again 
Trying to prove that the earth is flat 
You dont stop breathing 
Just because there is no air you can see 
Born into this world long before there were reasons youd believe 
Trying to prove that the earth is flat again 
Wishing life was as clear as it should have been 
Crawling into the void, all alone again 
Trying to prove that the earth is flat 
Trying to prove that the earth is flat 
Trying to see why these simple things slip away from me 
Im down on my knees bowing to gravity 
And I would settle for proof of anything 
But who am I to see? 
Im so tiny 
A speck of dust in an empty universe 
Are you praying to find somebody to notice your small mass? 
Trying to prove that the earth is flat again 
Wishing life was as clear as it should have been 
Crawling into the void, all alone again 
Trying to prove that the earth is flat 
Trying to prove that the earth is flat 
Trying to prove that the earth is flat
