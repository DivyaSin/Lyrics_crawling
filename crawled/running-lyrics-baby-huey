She's got me running, trying to find her 
like a diesel on tracks behind her 
though I know from me she wants to escape 
fool I am, I won't accept my fate 
So I'm running and I'm so tired 
cant stop now cause she's got such a headstart 
anyday I know I am stepping to find 
another man holding what was mine 
They say love can be so blind 
and it can almost drive you out of your mind 
look at me an educated fool 
loving this woman made me bloat my cool 
So I'm running, trying to find her 
like a diesel on tracks behind her 
anyday I know I am stepping to find 
another man holding what once was mine 
Still running, trying to get somewhere 
Still running momma, Still runing baby 
Still trying to get it together, somehow I know 
Let me tell you one more time 
They say love can be so blind 
and it can almost drive you out of your mind 
look at me an educated fool 
loving this woman made me bloat my cool 
So I'm running, running, running, running, running, running...
