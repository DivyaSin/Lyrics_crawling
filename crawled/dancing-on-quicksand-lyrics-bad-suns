I'll lose myself in a moment 
Can't find my way out for days 
I'll come to you on my hands and knees, on my hands and knees I ran out of luck, when I fucked up 
And nothings going to change that uh woah And when its too much 
You thought time was supposed to make this right again oh Ooooo ooooo dancing on quick sand 
Ooooo ooooo dancing on quick sand I run to the elevator 
You see me but let the door shut 
Don't be upset, its not hard to laugh 
I love you when you're mad I ran out of luck , when I fucked up 
And nothings going to change that uh woah And when its too much, you thought 
Time was supposed to make this right again I ran out of luck, when I fucked up 
And nothings going to change that uh woah And when its too much, you thought 
Time was supposed to make this right again oh Ooooo ooooo dancing on quick sand 
Ooooo ooooo dancing on quick sand 
Ooooo ooooo dancing on quick sand 
Ooooo ooooo dancing on quick sand I think I'm coming around oh yeah I ran out of luck, when I fucked up 
And nothing's going to change that uh woah 
And when its too much, 
You thought time was supposed to make this right again 
I ran out of luck, when I fucked up 
And nothing's going to change that uh woah 
And when its too much, 
You thought time was supposed to make this right again oh Oooo oooo dancing on quick sand 
Ooooo ooooo dancing on quick sand Ooooo ooooo dancing on quick sand 
Ooooo ooooo dancing on quick sand
