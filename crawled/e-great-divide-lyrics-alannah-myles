A fever that makes you wanna shed your skin 
A walking testament to original sin 
Gotta good trick up your sleeve 
Crocodile daydream, you wanna, you wanna believe Strike a truce and stand at ease 
You can choose to slam me to my knees Cheap resistance in my way 
I wanna become your Independence Day 
Give me something for the shape I'm in 
Southern comfort, oh 
Again and again and again and again Missionary if you please 
I fell from grace and landed on my knees Welcome to the great divide 
Fallen angel stuck inside 
All temptation justified I'm a prisoner, baby, with no reprieve 
The kind of chaos you can count on not to leave Strike a truce and stand at ease 
You can even slam me to my knees Welcome to the great divide 
Fallen angel stuck inside 
All temptation And if the money don't get ya, something will 
And if the sex don't get ya, nothing will 
The Bank of Karma won't loan 
Your yin won't yang, the bed don't bang 
And the springs don't sprang 
Again and again and aah Welcome to the great divide 
Fallen angel stuck inside 
All temptation justified Welcome to the great divide, great divide 
Great divide, great divide 
Welcome to the great divide, great divide 
Fallen angel stuck inside, stuck inside Welcome to the great divide 
Welcome to the great divide 
Welcome to the great divide 
Ahh, great divide, great divide
