It's just you and me 
And there's no one around 
Feel like I'm hanging by a thread 
It's a long way down 
I've been trying to breathe 
But I'm fighting for air 
I'm at an all time low 
With no place to go 
But you're always there When everything falls apart 
And it seems like the world 
Is crashing at my feet 
You like me the best 
When I'm a mess 
When I'm my own worst enemy 
You make me feel beautiful (beautiful) 
When I have nothing left to prove 
And I can't imagine 
How I'd make it through 
There's no me without you 
No me without you, no no You hear what I say 
When I don't say a word 
You are my rising sun 
You're the place I run 
You know how it hurts When everything falls apart 
When everything falls apart 
And it seems like the world 
Is crashing at my feet 
You like me the best 
When I'm a mess 
When I'm my own worst enemy 
You make me feel beautiful (beautiful) 
When I have nothing left to prove 
And I can't imagine 
How I'd make it through 
There's no me without you 
No me without you There's no me without you 
No me without you And when you say "baby, it's gonna get better" 
I believe you 
And I wish that somehow I could see me 
The way you do 
With my imperfections 
You think I'm perfect 
When it's not easy 
You make it worth it When everything falls apart 
And it seems like the world 
Is crashing at my feet 
You like me the best 
When I'm a mess 
When I'm my own worst enemy 
You make me feel beautiful (beautiful) 
When I have nothing left to prove 
And I can't imagine 
How I'd make it through 
There's no me without you 
No me without you, no no No me without you (no me without you) 
No me without you, no no (no me without you) no
