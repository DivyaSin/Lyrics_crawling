You know if I'd seen her comin' 
I'd probably tried to hide 
But I came around the corner 
And she caught me by surprise 
There was no ice cold shoulder 
There was no ugly scene 
She just smiled and didn't say 
The things I thought she'd say to me It was nothin' like that rainy night 
She left and slammed the door 
Not only she don't love me 
She don't hate me anymore I felt like some neighbor 
Just some guy she once knew 
You'd never know she loved me 
And I broke her heart in two 
Was she hidin' her emotions 
Or did she really get that strong 
Right then she turned and 
Introduced me to her new friend John I could tell the way he shook my hand 
He'd never heard of me before 
Not only she don't love me 
She don't hate me anymore There was no ice cold shoulder 
There was no ugly scene 
She just smiled and didn't say 
The things I knew she'd say to me I guess she got so caught up in him 
My memory's gone ignored 
Not only she don't love me 
She don't hate me anymore I know it might sound crazy 
But I don't know what hurts me more 
Is it the fact that she don't love me 
Or she don't hate me anymore
