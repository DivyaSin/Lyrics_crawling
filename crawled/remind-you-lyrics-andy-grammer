It doesn't mean you're weak 
Or that you got low self-esteem 
We all got hearts that forget why they beat 
We are brilliant, we are unique 
But we forget so effortlessly And when you're questioning your worth in the way that we all do 
And your version of amnesia starts to seep on through 
And you know that you are great but you can't remember why 
I will be there by your side I will remind you, I will remind you 
I will be, I'll be your memory 
I will remind you, I will remind you 
All you need is someone else to see 
I will remind you We get a little bit lost like ships at sea 
We don't remember right where we're supposed to be And when you're questioning your worth in the way that we all do 
And your version of amnesia starts to seep on through 
And you know that you are great but you can't remember why 
I will be there by your side I will remind you, I will remind you 
I will be, I'll be your memory 
I will remind you, I will remind you 
All you need is someone else to see A little bit of love from someone you trust 
Can bring you back to life, a little bit of love 
A little bit of love from someone you trust 
Can bring you back to life, a little bit of love 
A little bit of love from someone you trust 
Can bring you back to life, a little bit of love 
A little bit of love from someone you trust 
Can bring you back to life, a little bit of love I will remind you, I will remind you 
I will be, I'll be your memory 
I will remind you, I will remind you 
All you need is someone else to see 
I will remind you
