Nightly, you retrace your steps again to return to the scene of the crime 
It's uncanny how you hover in the air of the wreckage that you left behind [Chorus] 
I want you but you're a poltergeist 
I want you but baby the price is high 
I want you and now I've said it twice so Mary dim the lights Really when you come into the room it's not helping me, seeing you down 
It's not easy in this phosphorescent gloom telling waking dreams apart anyhow [Chorus] Cups and saucers crashing in but Houdini applauds the gag again and no one's a true believer [Chorus] Cups and saucers crashing in but Houdini applauds the gag again
