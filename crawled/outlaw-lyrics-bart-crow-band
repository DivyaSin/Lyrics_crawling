So your boots, theyre old and dusty & lying down on the floor 
And a candlelight, its burnin outside your door 
And youre gonna keep staying single, man, you never stayed to long 
And that highways gonna kill you before too long Chorus: Cause youre always out runnin, tryin to get by 
You never even noticed how hard that she tried 
Smokin away those nighttimes, drinkin away your days 
Its all gonna catch up to you one of these days 
Just a modern day outlaw runnin with the wind 
Find you a good heart and youll shoot it down again 
Well youre just a sad song on another rainy day playing on your radio Said an outlaws life, man, its no place for a girl 
You keep a picture in your wallet and you lock her outside your world 
And shes waiting by telephone but you never call 
And shes screamin at your picture, you never could at all Chorus Now youre drivin down that freeway and you aint got far to go 
And you thinkin while youre speedin man, that you might give her a call 
But your voice, it starts to crack, you try to say hello 
Yeah, you broke her heart so many times, you gotta let her go, you gotta let her go Chorus Youre just a broken dream when youre stereo plays 
Youre just a sad song on that somehow got away playing on your radio 
Youre just a sad song on another rainy day playing on your radio
