You said "you see" 
You see all around 
But you don't 
Want to go down 
You're afraid 
Afraid of the moves that you make 
Because they're so quick to judge 
You go back 
You said you have to go back 
You go way 
You couldn't be late 
But it's down 
It's down from the hill 
You won't have a new thrill 
You won't fill up 
With some kind of space 
You have to go down 
Now you're gone 
Tomorrow's long over due 
I'll be thinking of you 
And lights go out 
And I know it's you I'm just like you 
Easily confused 
And I'm mark by your views 
Blinding me with truth 
Smile and decide 
Somethings you hide 
I can't forget the moment 
I'm thankful to you to end of time(?) You know, you had 
What you do 
It's a shame 
We all seem to be, who to blame 
But I won't ask you again 
You had me win but I won't 
Never a one but I can 
Never a one but I can I'm just like you 
Easily confused 
And I'm mark by your views 
Blinding me with truth 
Smile and decide 
Somethings you hide 
I can't forget the moment
