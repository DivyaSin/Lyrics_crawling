The moon was shining bright above us 
The flames danced to sky and our old town 
Breathed a knowing sigh, a wreath to our love 
Golden Days and warm nights 
Dancing in the streets to lift our hearts 
And to ease our minds, Save me save me Hey! Seemed the world stopped spinning round 
And the sky came tumbling down 
As we listened to the sound of summer 
You gave me hope when I was down 
I was lost and I was found 
We were living through, the sound of summer 
The sound of summer People watched and waited 
And wondered if their lives could be the same 
And if they would see their children smiling 
Please stay close beside me 
'Cause nothing on this earth can touch you now 
Oh you shine so bright, my sorrow's fading
