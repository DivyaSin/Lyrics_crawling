Pretty darling stop running down my street 
The tears are dropping like a nuclear meltdown 
I never meant to let it come to this 
Can we blame it on timing not chemistry? All night long, I'll sing the same somber song 
Attack my decisions and the horse they rode on 
Everything seems to be less than zero 
A mascara hero with a heart of zinc I never should've kissed 
I never should've And I never should've kissed those lips before 
I never should've let you out my door 
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph The words you chant, I never thought they'd 
Be so true, dancing in my head 
So pause this moment till we meet in our next life 
A black tabby house cat, a bottle of Xanax All night long is one repeated love song 
When have I became this tree 
Till we meet in our brand new world 
I'll count the rings if you tie a string I never should've kissed 
I never should've And I never should've kissed those lips before 
I never should've let you out my door 
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph 
Alright And I never should've kissed those lips before 
I never should've let you out my door 
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph And I never should've kissed those lips before 
I never should've let you out my door 
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph And I never should've kissed those lips before 
I never should've let you out my door 
But now I'm stuck here with your photograph 
Alright
