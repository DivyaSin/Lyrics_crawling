So the aliens have landed 
They'll be moving through you and i 
And as the family disbanded 
They dragged the sadness into the light No more tears and no more pain 
Only things to keep you sane 
Only fun And in the distance there's talk now 
Everyone wants to go home 
I hope you know you're not leaving 
For the night has just begun And if i live to stay a day 
Words are left to fade away
