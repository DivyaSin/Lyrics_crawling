i was dancing when i was twelve 
i was dancing when i was twelve 
i was dancing when i was ahhh... 
i was dancing when i was ahhh... 
i danced myself right out the womb 
i danced myself right out the womb 
is it strange to dance so soon 
i danced myself right out the womb 
i was dancing when i was eight 
i was dancing when i was eight 
is it strange to dance so late 
is it strange to dance so late 
i danced myself into the tomb 
i danced myself into the tomb 
is it strange to dance so soon 
i danced myself into the tomb 
is it wrong to understand 
the fear that dwells inside a man 
whats it like to be a loon 
i liken it to a balloon 
i danced myself right out the womb 
i danced myself right out the womb 
is it strange to dance so soon 
i danced myself into the tomb 
but then again once more 
i danced myself right out the womb 
i danced myself right out the womb 
is it strange to dance so soon 
i danced myself into the tomb 
i danced myself into the tomb 
i danced myself into the tomb
