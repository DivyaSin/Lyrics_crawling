[Hook: AD] 
You ain't never had a thug 
You ain't never had a thug 
Beat it all night 'til you had enough 
You ain't never had a thug 
Buss it down for a cup 
Best friend said she only want a blood 
You ain't never had a thug 
Wait, wait a minute 
Wait, wait a minute 
You ain't never had a thug 
Wait, wait a minute 
Wait, wait a minute 
You ain't never had a thug [Verse 1: AD] 
You ain't never had a thug 
Tired of these lame ass niggas in the club 
I ain't here to play games, I ain't lookin' for the love 
Let your man date you, I'm the one to beat it up 
Do it 'tll it hurts on the turf, gotta bang mine 
Hit you from the back while I'm throwin' up my gang signs 
Take you to the hood, let you cruise around the mainline 
Hit the blunt and lick the middle at the same time 
Damn, bet you never had it that way 
Bring your friend, she ain't with it, send her that way 
Take a loss, get it back, that's the fast way 
And I can still make money on a bad day, wait a minute 
Come and fuck with a thug nigga 
Only hangin' round with G's and them drug dealers 
Look, you need a rider, not a punk 
Hit a nigga line, give it to you what he want [Hook: AD] 
You ain't never had a thug 
You ain't never had a thug 
Beat it all night 'til you had enough 
You ain't never had a thug 
Buss it down for a cup 
Best friend said she only want a blood 
You ain't never had a thug 
Wait, wait a minute 
Wait, wait a minute 
You ain't never had a thug 
Wait, wait a minute 
Wait, wait a minute 
You ain't never had a thug [Verse 2: YG] 
You ain't never had a Blood 
Westside middle finger touch my thumb 
My Crip bitch take dick like
