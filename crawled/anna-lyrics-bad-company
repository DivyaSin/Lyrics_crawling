I got a sweet little angel and I love her so 
She's there when I need her, she understands when I say go 
In the night, when she says "Hold me", it makes me feel so strong 
Living with her unfolds me, she gives me strength to carry on I don't need anyone else 
If I did I would be fooling myself 
Anna, Anna And I know if she left me, my world would turn cold 
She's the best little lady that a man could ever hold 
When I'm down, she knows what to say 
She clears my blindness away 
And in the night, she says "Hold me", it makes me feel so strong I don't need nobody else 
If I did I would be fooling myself 
Anna, Anna
