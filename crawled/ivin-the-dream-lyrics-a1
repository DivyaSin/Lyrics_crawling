Where have you been all my life? 
Where have you come from? 
Is this your first time too? 
It's like I've known you in some other lifetime. 
We're part of the great plan. 
Like two stars the shine. [pre-chorus:] 
I stood here watchin', while it only ever happened to friends. 
Now I don't have to pretend. [chorus:] 
I can't believe we're living the dream 
We're diggin that scene. 
We finally made it through the fire. 
Something 'bout you blows me away, like night over day. 
Kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah. True love, true love. 
Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? I've been waiting for you all my life 
Anticipating with ever dream ever night. 
Destiny's moment we all share in time love is the message. 
And I know I've got mine? [pre-chorus] [chorus] True love, true love. 
Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
True love, true love. 
Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? [chorus] [outro:] 
True love, true love. baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
True love, true love. baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me?
