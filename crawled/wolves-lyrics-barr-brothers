Hunt like a wolf, run like a river 
Put your hand on the chest 
Of a heart that is beating 
You lie in debt to a lover beholden 
Trained on the thought of a singular union Drive a hole through the mountain 
Drive the car from the East 
To the Western ocean 
Back to a time when a promise 
Was more easily broken 
These were the seeds of the terrible winter Your mother was old 
When she said to you 
It's not just how you see it 
But it's how you're gonna see it through 
I know you want to give it up 
But who you gonna give it to? 
Guilty like the sun Out of the womb, into the ether 
Feel the rain on your head 
And the tundra beneath ya 
A sudden blow and nobody 
With a body can reach ya 
A dog needs a bone, and that ought to teach ya Your mother was old 
When she said to you 
It's not just how you see it 
But it's how you're gonna see it through 
I know you want to give it up 
But who you gonna give it to? 
When you love that's incomplete 
It's twice as bitter and half as sweet 
Guilty like the sun 
Guilty like the sun The rattle in your bones 
The salt in your tears 
That bating of your breath 
The ring in your ears 
And it's clear 
You're getting closer 
To your fears 
Hunt like a wolf, run like a river 
Put your hand on the chest 
Of a heart that is beating 
You lie in debt to a lover beholden 
These were the seeds of the terrible winter
