she wrote dear john I love you but all good things must end 
I've gone to live in Manchester with your best friend 
I must have been so nieve I must have been a fool 
she must have been two timing me and I never knew 
slaughter house slaughter house 
I gave her everything that I ever had 
What's he got that I ain't got its driving me mad 
Thrown to the slaughter house for somebody new 
I'm gonna break that bitches neck that's what I'm gonna do 
Slaughter house slaughter house 
Now I'm sitting in an empty room with no one as a friend 
Just thinking what she's doing with him I'm going round the bend 
Now all that I think of is getting my revenge 
I wonder if they think of me when they're in bed 
Slaughter house slaughter house
