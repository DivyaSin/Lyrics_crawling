I have decided 
That what I see on the T.V. 
And what I read in those magazines 
Means nothing to me 
I am free from everything and anything you want me to believe 
Cancellation has come and I'm pulling out 
Dismissal 
It's not going to happen anymore 
I've been through it too many times 
Assaulted by standards asking for decline 
Drop off the pressure 
Consistent and pure 
Dispense the appropriate 
Meaningless meaning 
Well it's no longer working 
Your shit means nothing to me 
Your shit means nothing to me 
This is dismissal 
And if it don't make sense to me 
It don't deserve to breathe 
This is dismissal 
Your shit means nothing to me
