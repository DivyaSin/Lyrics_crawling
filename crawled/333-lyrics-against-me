Feeling like I need to fall down some stairs 
Maybe lay face down in the river and float 
Perfect weather for a head wound 
Or studying sophisticated nuances of putting holes in your lungs 
One fifty Marilyns, the war and the bomb 
All reasons to be fearful but every day still new to wake up 
Three hundred and thirty three, say that they knew me 
Three hundred and thirty three, bring it all back to me All the devils that you don't know 
Can all come along for the ride 
I wanna be as close as I can get to you 
All the devils that you don't know 
Can all come along for the ride 
I wanna be as close as I can get to you I saw the 'Renown Orders of the Night' in person 
Why would I ever meet that with irony or cynicism? 
Planned views and elevations walking through your tarot garden 
Visible mutations fading right before your fucking eyes 
Cycles of death and regeneration, sensations of absence and loss 
Wish you had been there by my side to see it all 
Three hundred and thirty three, say that they knew me 
Three hundred and thirty three, bring your love back to me All the devils that you don't know 
Can all come along for the ride 
I wanna be as close as I can get to you 
All the devils that you don't know 
Can all come along for the ride 
I wanna be as close as I can get to you
