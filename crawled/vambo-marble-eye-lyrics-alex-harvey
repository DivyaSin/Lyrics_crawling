Hobo villa, Hobo need 
Even dead, fear alone indeed 
Even dead fear marble eye 
He been living in a lullaby Machinery overheat 
Vambo teaching mastery 
Over shaka, shake her fast 
Even old marble eye go past him Chorus: Vambo comin' to the rescue (3 times) Up the go go river 
Give away, lobster hobo, say OK 
Long, long lover 
She say goodbye 
He been living in a lullaby Chorus Vambo never, show him face 
Hold him head in no disgrace 
Hobo villa on the Hobo need 
Even the dead fear alone indeed Even dead fear marble eye 
Ain't no way for he to die 
Tell me no story, tell me no lie 
He been living in a lullaby Chorus: Vambo Comin' to the rescue 
Vambo rule OK, Vambo rule
