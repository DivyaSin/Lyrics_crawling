In just about any given situation 
I'm wasting my patience 
Even though my heart is open 
I'm broken, so broken down 
I'm broken down I defy the laws of science 
And physics, well, even logic 
Come on, let's erase my existence 
Annihilation, exuberating Feel it running on and on 
I've broken down 
Feel it running on and on 
I've broken down Feel it running on and on 
(On and on, on and on and on) 
Feel it running on and on 
(On and on, on and on and on) Feel it running on and on 
(On and on, on and on and on) 
Feel it running on and on 
(On and on, on and on) I'd swear my mouth is open 
It's open, I'm screaming 
But still my world is silent 
So silent, so alone Feel it running on and on 
I've broken down 
Feel it running on and on 
I've broken down Feel it running on and on 
(On and on, on and on and on) 
Feel it running on and on 
(On and on, on and on and on) Feel it running on and on 
(On and on, on and on and on) 
Feel it running on and on 
(On and on, on and on) Everyday, everyway 
Always losing my mind 
Spinning round in rhetorical questions 
Perpetually wasting my given time Feel it running on and on 
(No more decaffeinating) 
Feel it running on and on 
(I'm done procrastinating) Feel it running on and on 
(Consider this my resignation) 
Feel it running on and on
