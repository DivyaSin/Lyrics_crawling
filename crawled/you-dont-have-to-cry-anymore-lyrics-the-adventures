Hey! You don't have to cry anymore 
I know you think I've done it all 
I'm ten feet tall 
Do you still blame me for what life's put you through 
Your self respect, the all time low 
Wake up and show 
Change this face so blue, to the one I once knew Hey! You don't have to cry anymore 
It's not like before 
Make it happen 
Hey! You don't have to cry anymore 
Take your wings up and soar 
Make it happen If you really tried you'd make the grade 
You're so afraid 
There's no gain in sorrow 
You put yourself down 
I still believe there's left inside 
Your gleaming pride 
Kill this tired charade 
Put your heart on parade Hey! You don't have to cry anymore 
It's just not like before 
It won't happen 
Hey! You don't have to cry anymore 
You can walk through that door 
As long as the sun keeps shining 
I don't want to see you crying crying
