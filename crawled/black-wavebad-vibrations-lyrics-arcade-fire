We can reach the sea 
They won't follow me, shadows, they fear the sun 
We'll make it if we run! 
Run from the memory 
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent Left my name with the border guards 
A name that I don't need 
Ce sera un long voyage 
Sur les vagues de l'oubli Run from the memory 
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent Stop now before it's too late 
Bean eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate 
Nothing lasts forever 
That's the way it's gotta be 
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me Stop now before it's too late 
Bean eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate 
Nothing lasts forever 
That's the way it's gotta be 
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me For you 
For me 
It's always for you Stop now before it's too late 
Bean eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate 
Nothing lasts forever 
That's the way it's gotta be 
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me Stop now before it's too late 
Your lover was for hire 
Have you noticed he's been late? 
Nothing lasts forever 
That's the way it's gotta be 
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me For you 
For me 
It's always for you 
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet 
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet 
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet 
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
