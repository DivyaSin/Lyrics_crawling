Ten minutes til' twelve o'clock, 
That's when the hammer drops, 
CYANIDE in the chamber, 
Until the HEARTBEAT stops, The last BREATH (Dying BREATH), 
OF a dying democracy, 
PAX americana, 
From SEA to shining SEA, [Chorus:] 
Lockdown, America Lockdown, 
America Lockdown, America... Solution in THIS LAND, 
Is LOCK HIM in a cage, 
Sweep IT under THE RUG, [Chorus] Lock him in a cell, 
STRIP him of his rights, 
One latch a time, MARCH HIM UP A HILL 
STRIP HIM OF HIS SOUL 
One latch at a time, [Chorus]
