And your knowledge are only a burden 
The wind will always pass by 
And leave nothing behind Look for a new road! 
Don't open someone else's map! 
When you raise your eyes that were looking at the ground you'll become zero Are we dreaming? 
Are we believing in future? 
Afraid of nothing, careless of what's our place 
As reckless as we are 
Are we dreaming now? 
We should be as brand new as a child 
Let's tear off the chains that controlled us 
Change your mind 
Change your mind 
We don't need to know anything Beginner! Adults failed and felt ashamed 
And suffering has become their trauma 
Thinking they don't want to feel such pain again 
They have become smart Challenges are laughed upon 
What are you protecting with your silly calculations 
In order to avoid risks? Are we alive? 
Do we want to be alive tomorrow? 
We pretend we understand, we feign a knowing look 
While we haven't dreamed in a long while 
Yeah, are we alive? 
Aren't we wasting our life? 
Feel now the rhythm pulsing through your veins! Stand up! Together! 
Remember the day you were born! 
Everyone's a beginner! 
Stand up! Right away! 
It won't go well 
Easily from the beginning 
Stand up! Together! 
You just need to go back to the beginning 
A beginner again 
Stand up! Right away! 
Be defiant, be defiant 
It will happen somehow 
Tear away the old page 
Come on, let's begin! 
We can be reborn all the time Are we dreaming? 
Are we believing in future? 
Afraid of nothing, careless of what's our place 
As reckless as we are 
Are we dreaming now? 
We should be as brand new as a child 
Let's tear off the chains that controlled us I can't do anything 
I can't do it well 
And so? 
We're still young 
I can't do anything 
I can't do it right away 
That's why we have possibilities The rain has stopped 
The wind has stopped 
A light we've never seen before 
Is shining 
Now's the time You are a reborn beginner!
