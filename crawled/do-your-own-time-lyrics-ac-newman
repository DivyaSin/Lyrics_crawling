You showed up dressing down, 
Wearing absolutely nothing. 
Both in life, the talk of town, 
With your bookmark full of visa. You did not come to raise the bar, 
You came to tear it into pieces, understand. 
You showed me, even though you showed your plan. 
And said do your own time, go back to your own kind There was lipstick left in the room 
Yes, and it was absolutely crucial. 
A flashing card that it disappeared, 
It must have been magic to her new soul. 
The oldest trick in this young life, 
But its the only bag were packing in this town. 
Were packing up and carry it around. Do your own time, go back to your own kind. 
Do your own time, go back to your own kind. Whatever you, whatever you need me to do 
Whatever you, whatever you need me to do, 
Need me to do, need me to do, need me to do. And its the only sign were tracking in this town 
Were stacking out against the love youve found. Do your own time, go back to your own land. 
Do your own time, go back to your own kind. Whatever you, whatever you need me to do 
Whatever you, whatever you need me to do, 
Need me to do, need me to do, need me to do.
