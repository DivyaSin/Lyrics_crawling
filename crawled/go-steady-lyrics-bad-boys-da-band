Made up my mind, I agree that we are ready 
On a steady pace for love Ready and I'm ready for love 
So do you boy 
Do you want a taste? What I see when I look at you 
A rugged dude, but a gentleman too 
With your hat tilted to the side I get a chill from those pretty brown eyes 
Rippled chest and how you dress, I'm so impressed 
Can't get you off my mind, I'm so excited 
Can't wait to be with you tonight So can we hook up around 8 so 
Try not to be late boy, it's on

Tell ya boys bye, it's about time Gonna make it hotter than July 
And make it worth your wait and I 
I like it when you say, 'Don't be shy' When I'm with you, you make me feel so sexy, ooh 
Made up my mind, I agree that we are ready 
On a steady pace for love Dim the lights, I turn my two-way off and close the door

I like it when you say, 'Don't be shy' When I'm with you, you make me feel so sexy, ooh 
Made up my mind, I agree that we are ready 
On a steady pace for love No more waiting, contemplating 
'Cuz I know it's love, I'm so anxious to start makin' 
Goin' steady now, go 'head boy, tear it up Look playa, I admit it was a game I played 
But now I see things different, girl you changed my ways 
You never know you got good fate 
Till it's gone and you feel, you bein' hoodwinked, then it's on Listen, you never told me you ain't want me to grissle 
'Cuz I kept you hot and now it's somethin' official 
You kept a pistol in ya pocket but the government issue 
Look, I seen too much to tell you I miss you Or tell you I love you, all day kissin' and huggin' 
Listen, bottom line if I ain't wit you I'm fuckin' 
I never fucked wit ya sister, never fucked wit ya cousin 
No fussin' and fightin' tonight, we under the covers tusslin' Paradise where the water is blue 
And grab a snack 'round a quarter to 2 
Me and boo, hoo and I ain't gotta give you ecstasy 
For you to wanna have sex wit me, that's my specialty When I'm with you, you make me feel so sexy, ooh 
Made up my mind, I agree that we are ready 
On a steady pace for love When I'm with you, you make me feel so sexy, ooh
