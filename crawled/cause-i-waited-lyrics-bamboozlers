words: Jim Rhodes music: Steven Rhodes 
Gave up on my dreams 
Lost my only love 
Threw away my chances 
To take the next step up 
Chorus: 
Cause I waited for tomorrow 
And tomorrow never comes 
No, tomorrow never comes 
She turned and walked away 
Took all my final hopes 
While I stood right there 
And watched her go 
Chorus: 
What does it mean 
Feels like I'm losin a dream 
But I know 
Chorus: 
My place in life is empty 
Only pain has it's place 
Watch the world go spinning 
As I cryout into space
