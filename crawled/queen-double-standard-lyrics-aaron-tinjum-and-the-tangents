[Verse 1] You played the damsel in distress 
Damn desiring another man's caress 
Under the sheets of some forbidden silk 
With a thread count that could cover up the guilt 
From your scandal [Chorus] Queen Double Standard 
You made your bed 
Now won't you sleep in it, too? 
When you want to 
Whatever you're out to prove 
Well, who needs proof 
When all the truth 
Was left to you? [Verse 2] You had an empire and a fantasy 
Brought down by foreign and domestic enemies 
You played the victim in a tragic scene 
Ain't it fun to play pretend and make believe? 
I will not pander [Chorus] Queen Double Standard 
You made your bed 
Now won't you sleep in it, too? 
When you want to 
Whatever you're out to prove 
Well, who needs proof 
When all the truth 
Was left to you? [Bridge] Why should I explain when you know what you did? 
Bounced around some beds 
Disappeared for the weekend 
Ring ring goes the bells of your phone 
Knock knock knock but no one's home Why should I explain when you know what you did? 
Bounced around some beds 
Disappeared for the weekend 
Ring ring goes the bells of your phone 
Knock knock knock but no one's home Who dethroned me? 
Took my crown and exiled me? 
And defiled everything about me 
Until I'm screaming jealously 
"it's all for you" [Chorus] Queen Double Standard 
You made your bed 
Now won't you sleep in it, too? 
When you want to 
Whatever you're out to prove 
But who needs proof 
When all the truth 
Is left to you? Who needs proof 
When all the truth 
Is lost on you?
