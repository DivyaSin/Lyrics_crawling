Ten-thirty-five and I hope I've made 
The right decision 
Heart is beating I'm alive 
But I don't call this living 
Rationalize 'til I'm blue in the face 
You cannot lose if you throw the race 
I'm still searching for the 
Ants invasion Ten-thirty-six and I hope I've made 
The right decision 
Ninety eight point four's the bore 
With twenty twenty vision 
You want a thrill so you come and see me 
A cheap line in fantasy 
But I'm still searching for the 
Ants invasion If I'd the courage 
I would make my way home 
Too many antics in the forbidden zone Ten-thirty-eight and I think I've made 
The wrong decision 
Another lifeless man with a strange incision 
I hope that insect doesn't see me 
He's not renowned for his courtesy 
I'm not searching for the 
Ants invasion
