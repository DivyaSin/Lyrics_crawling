Four to five and we're still waiting for the call tonight 
And we can hide the distant feeling buried in our eyes And stand down there's no place to run 
Stand down it's come undone 
And reach out and say what you've done 
For everyone He who takes a beating more than once can last forever 
And we can stand this rain but ever lasting stormy weather And stand down there's no place to run 
Stand down it's come undone 
And reach out and say what you've done 
For everyone One and half three quarters build it back with bricks and mortars And stand down there's no place to run 
Stand down it's come undone 
And reach out and say what you've done 
For everyone It's everlasting 
It's everlasting 
It's everlasting 
It's everlasting 
It's everlasting 
It's everlasting Lyrics Written By: A. Wasiliev
