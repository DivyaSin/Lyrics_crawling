Well, the morning was complete 
There was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat 
Several hours or several weeks 
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak! It's the beginning of the end; the car went up the hill 
And disappeared around the bend; ask anyone, they'll tell you that 
It's these times that it tends 
The start to breaking up, to start to fall apart 
Oh! Hold on to your heart Do me a favor, break my nose! 
Do me a favor, tell me to go away! 
Do me a favor, stop asking questions! She walked away while her shoes were untied 
And the eyes were all red 
You could see that we've cried, and I watched, and I waited 
Till she was inside, forcing a smile and waving goodbye Curiosity becomes a heavy load 
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold 
Curiosity becomes a heavy load 
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold And do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help! 
She said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself! 
How to tear apart the ties that bind 
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind 
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind
