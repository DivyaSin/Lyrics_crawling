There's a light, a certain kind of light that never shone on me 
I want my life to lived with you, lived with you 
There's a way everybody say to do each and every little thing 
But what does it bring if I ain't got you, ain't got? Baby You don't know what it's like, baby 
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, to love somebody 
The way I love you In my parade, I see your face again, I know my frame of mind 
You ain't got to be so blind and I'm blind, so, so, so very blind 
I'm a man, can't you see what I am? I live and breathe for you 
But what good does it do if I ain't got you, ain't got? Baby You don't know what it's like, baby 
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, to love somebody 
The way I love you You don't know what it's like, baby 
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, to love somebody 
The way I love you You don't know what it's like 
You don't know what it's like 
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, to love somebody
