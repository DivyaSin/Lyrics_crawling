I was raised in a trailer Never thought that I would get outta there Always told that I was a failure Never fit in with the other kids My father kicked me out when I shaved my hair Singled out because of where I lived I got the music the music's got me I learned to fight at an early age Court 22 my aluminum cage The underground sound I got beat I got punched and kicked Always sets me free I never ever felt like I belonged I thought that everything I did was Cause I didn't fit in their social clique Fuckin' wrong Punk rock was my only escape I turn up the music and feel the beat A new found spirit no one could break It's the only thing I ever want to keep
