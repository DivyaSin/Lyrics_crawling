There is a game you know that we always go to when the rain is hard 
You start with memories and you sail them to me in the humblest of arks 
So many years could go and I still wouldn't know just when I thought I was 
Don't let the windows close, no we open them wide and we cheer the thunder on 
When I'm far from my home, look above and below, let the anchors down, when you say you're sure. 
Oh I want to know how you held on so, when the water's far from the rower's arms and the rower's mark There is a story I always try to remember when the first snow falls 
The ending wanders along and it settles down on the ice when the river's warm 
Your boat's gone loose from the ropes and you said there is hope still frozen with the oars 
A finer side to be on, oh I wouldn't know one lovelier than yours 
When I'm far from my home, look above and below, let the anchors down, when you say you're sure. 
Oh I want to know how you held on so, when the water's far from the rower's arms and the rower's mark 
When I'm far from my home, look above and below, let the anchors down, when you say you're sure. 
Oh I want to know how you held on so, when the water's far from the rower's arms and the rower's mark
