Better way 
(Go) 
That you go 
(I know) Your shadow and it covers on my Halloween 
You remember nights when you slip away Run away 
(Go) 
Down this road 
(I know) Your shadow and it covers on my Halloween 
You remember nights when you slip away Lord of the light and the darkness 
Don't forget the 13 stairway 
Lord of the light and the darkness 
Don't forget the room number 308 Whoa, oh 
Don't forget the room number 308 
Whoa, oh 
Don't forget the room number 308
