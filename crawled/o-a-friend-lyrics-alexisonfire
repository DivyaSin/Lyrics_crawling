I'm thinking that its time to get out 
My patients are fading fast 
The mind bruises just a little bit easier 
In dark times and shadows cast What are you suffering for? 
Your pride or some kind of personal war? 
And will you throw it all away? 
For nothing more than a simple taste? 
I stay in time and watch you pass by 
Paranoia woven deep beneath my skin 
And I draw this line 
Breath slow 
You shouldn't have to fight alone 
You shouldn't have to fight at all 
It's nobody's battle but your own Panic holds me like a gun 
Firm and steadfast bleak and cold 
I think it's time to kill the drama 
This lifestyle is getting old Faces threaten from behind closed doors 
Eyes spy from dark windows 
Plotting minds that seek to harm me, or maybe not There is 
Something 
Waiting 
For me 
In the 
Darkest 
Part of 
My imagination This is just self-induced terror 
There's more to come 
This is just a glimpse 
I tell myself its all in my head 
But I'm pretty hard to convince Oh, there's no relief 
Oh, this wold can offer 
Oh, there's no relief 
Oh, this world can offer me I stay in time and watch you pass by 
I draw this line 
And hope you'll take my side 
You shouldn't have to fight alone 
Its nobody's battle but your own
