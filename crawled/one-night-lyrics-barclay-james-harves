You took all my money 
I gave you no name 
My love and my money 
Did you think I would chase it in the rain? 
My eyes are now open 
But what do I see? 
One ride after midnight 
Had I thought it would mean that much to me? CHORUS: Everybody needs someone to love 
Everybody needs a friend 
Everybody needs someone to care 
Do you think you can make it in the end? 
Do you think that you can make it, my friend? I thought it was easy 
But what did I know 
Of old men and first blood 
Or the drunk who gets taken blow by blow? The dice are all loaded 
You pay by the throw 
But you pay the loser 
Seems the rain is turning into snow CHORUS We stand round your doorways 
You hang on the walls 
Your frames are your windows 
Put your bodies on the stalls 
You take all our money 
We leave you no name 
We're dealt just the one card 
But the dealer plays in every game CHORUS
