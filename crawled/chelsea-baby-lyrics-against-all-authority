Chelsea baby, let's run away 
To some third world country 
Exploit the workers, rape the land 
Get money for dope from your old man Chelsea baby, what's with your pops 
Each time I call, he sends the cops 
Meet me at the Crumbs' show tonight 
Pack your shit, we'll be alright Auntie Tipper raided your underwear drawer 
And burned your Riot Girl shirt 
And called you whore and playing 
The fascist P.M.R.C role She wiped her butt with M.R.R 
Chelsea hates her mom and Chelsea hates her dad 
Chelsea hates the state she finds it very sad 
So grab your shit tonight and man 
We'll flee and squat under a bridge in the Florida Keys
