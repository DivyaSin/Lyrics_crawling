You're always bringing me down 
Why did I always stick around? 
You tell me how to feel 
You tell me what to say 
You say I gotta see things your way 
I've gotta make a change 
I've gotta get away 
From my biggest mistake It's been a long time coming to this 
Oh, wait don't tell me this is finally it 
Never thought I could live without 
I'll always sort it out You can't fire me, I quit! How does it feel to be wrong? 
Fucking stupid for so long, yeah, yeah 
So why you gotta yell 
Don't you think I heard? 
Always wanna have the last word 
You say you're gonna leave 
That I won't be the first 
To hit you right where it hurts It's been a long time coming to this 
Oh, wait don't tell me this is finally it 
Never thought that I could live without 
I'll always sort it out 
You can't fire me, I quit! I can't believe that I 
Put up with all the lies 
The fights, the sleepless nights 
Now Baby, it's my time 
Gotta move on with my life, yeah! It's been a long time coming to this 
Oh, wait don't tell me this is finally it 
Never thought that I could live without 
I'll always sort it out 
You can't retire me, you don't get to fire me, you can't fire me, I quit! 
Ooh, you can't fire me, I quit! 
Ooh, you can't fire me, I quit!
