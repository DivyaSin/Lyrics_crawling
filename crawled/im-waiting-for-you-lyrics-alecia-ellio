(alecia elliott/gary baker/frank j.myers) 
I've heard your voice,I've felt your touch 
But only in dreams have I felt this much 
I've not seen your face,I don't know your name 
But here in my heart you have a place 
I'm not for sure,but I believe 
You're out there waiting for me I'm waiting for you,biding my time 
Keeping my heart from crossing over the line 
Counting the days until my dreams come true 
I'm waiting for you,taking it slow 
Until the moment that I can let go 
One day I know I'll say I do 
I'm waiting for you I can go on a date and have a good time 
But you're always there in the back of my mind 
I'll know it's you when you take my hand 
And right by your side is where I will stand 
I know how good it's gonna be 
The moment that you find me I'm waiting for you,biding my time 
Keeping my heart from crossing over the line 
Counting the days until my dreams come true 
I'm waiting for you,taking it slow 
Until the moment that I can let go 
One day I know I'll say I do 
I'm waiting for you
