On the path of life, I wish you well 
With urgent chariots, we will meet again in Hell 
Kept my head down and moved 
'Til every friend I'd known was gone Then one day, I was not alone 
Everything had changed 
Everything was strange 
Everything had changed 
Everything was strange When in rags and when in wealth 
A solemn promise never to give too much of myself 
Despite the hopeful words I've said 
I've lived my life inside my head Then one day, I was not alone 
Everything had changed 
Everything was strange 
Everything had changed 
Everything was strange I hold my breath and count to ten 
I hate it now, hated it then 
Seen it all before 
A failure and a bore 
That's what friends are for So it seems I must have won 
As I survey the ashes of the damage that I've done 
Everyone I've ever known 
Is just as closed off and alone Then one day, I was not alone 
Everything had changed 
Everything was strange 
Everything had changed 
Every thing
