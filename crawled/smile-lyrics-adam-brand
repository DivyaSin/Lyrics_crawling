Sometimes love is what we make it 
Sometimes we're not making love at all 
Sometimes when our hearts are breaking 
Should we give up or should we give our all There's so much that we don't understand 
But we can bring the magic back again 
Take a lesson from a little child 
They can always find a smile Sometimes life is what we make it 
Sometimes we don't make it much at all 
Sometimes it's so hard to take it 
The world's so big and we feel so small When the magic flies away from us 
We could use a little fairy dust
