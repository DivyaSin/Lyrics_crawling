Met an old friend the other day 
Recognized from a different age 
Like a ghost in a photograph 
Distant memories of the past There was Nico and Limpopo 
Ipaminandas and young Nero 
All the old friends we've known so well 
With all the stories they'll never tell Paraiso dos Cavalos 
Paraiso dos Cavalos All it took was a photograph 
To bring the memories chasing back 
Of summer sunshine and cool green wine 
And all the good times we'd left behind We'd take the road down to Almansil 
If I had known then we'd be there still 
We left our hearts in the soft sea spray 
With every Quinta Do Lago day Paraiso dos Cavalos 
Paraiso dos Cavalos 
Paraiso dos Cavalos 
Paraiso dos Cavalos The wind in your hair 
The sun in your face 
The feeling of the power 
The beauty and grace Paraiso dos Cavalos Through our minds move the souls of our bygone years 
As we ride through their ancient tears 
To a place to a time where we'd all be saved 
To gallop on in the breaking waves At Paraiso dos Cavalos 
Paraiso dos Cavalos 
Paraiso dos Cavalos 
Paraiso dos Cavalos
