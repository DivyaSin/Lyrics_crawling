So, I'll go do my own thing 
Know that I should say something 
Oh, its driving me wild Estimating my timing with you 
Estimating the where; and when; and how I should do it, girl 
I'm taking guesses and wagering bets from the outside 
Do you want to know what's hiding up my sleeve? 
I've been thinking of ways to tell you this for a long time 
I guess I'm really not that confident, afterall I'm wondering if everything will be the same 
And I'm calculating guesses in this guessing game 
I'm looking at the odds from the outside 
But, I'm falling for you deeper on the inside 
I'm thinking that everything is gonna change 
And, if it all goes wrong, I have myself to blame 
But, do you really want to know if it feels the same? 
that's the risk that I take I'm kissing your face 
It looks so good in my dreams 
Did you hear thtat? I said I've been dreaming of you in the night time But, I'll go do my own thing 
Know that I should say something 
Oh, its killing me inside I'm wondering if everything will be the same 
And I'm calculating guesses in this guessing game 
I'm looking at the odds from the outside 
But, I'm falling for you deeper on the inside 
I'm thinking that everything is gonna change 
And, if it all goes wrong, I have myself to blame 
But, do you really want to know if it feels the same? 
that's the risk that I take Am I going crazy? 
Am I going crazy? 
Am I going crazy? Yeah Am I going crazy? Can you tell me 'cause I can't take this no more. 
Am I going crazy? Or has this train pulled up the platform? 
Please exit from this brain 'cause its driving me insane I'm wondering if everything will be the same 
And I'm calculating guesses in this guessing game 
I'm looking at the odds from the outside 
But, I'm falling for you deeper on the inside 
I'm thinking that everything is gonna change 
And, if it all goes wrong, I have myself to blame 
But, do you really want to know if it feels the same? 
Man, that's the risk that I take That's the risk that I take
