Murderer

Murder 
Your insides must be hollow 
How does it feel to take the life of another Yes, you can hide from man but not your conscience 
You eat the bread of sorrow drink the wine of violence 
Allow yourself to be conquered by the serpent 
Why did you disobey the first commandment 
Walk through the valley I feel no pestilence 
God is my witness and he is my evidence 
Lift up mine eyes from whence cometh help 
You coulda never escape this judgement Murderer 
Blood is on your shoulders 
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow

Your insides must be hollow 
How does it feel to take the life of another I tell you, all men are created equal 
But behind the trigger it's a different sequel 
Some are murdering people to collect medals 
Stop committing dirty acts for the high officials 
You could wash your hands until you can't wash them any more 
It is like an epidemic and you won't find a cure 
Upper class you could be rich, middle class wheter you are poor 
Only the righteous won't feel insecure 
Have you ever thought about your skill getting bored Murderer

How does it feel to take the life of another Drinking sulphur bitters won't bitter like your end 
Only God can help you, no family or friend 
Don't let the curse be upon your children's children 
Abdenigo, Shadreck, Meshek, Daniel in the eden 
Jonah in the whale's belly, but he was never condemned 
Job with the leprosy, and he still reached heaven 
He will do for you everything He has done for them. Murderer
