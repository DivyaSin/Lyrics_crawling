Walked in the pub, ordered a pint 
Put it on the table, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Put it on the table, sat alone for an hour or more 
So I talked to Mabel, oh, oh, oh, oh, poor Mabel Who spilt my beer, who spilt my beer? 
I'm asking you to tell the truth who spilt my beer? 
Who spilt my beer, who spilt my beer? 
I'm asking you to tell the truth who spilt my beer? Second, third and the fourth 
All came to an end, oh, oh, oh, oh 
A very quick end got the call of mother nature 
Went to see her friend oh, oh, oh, oh, it's closing time again Who spilt my beer, who spilt my beer? 
I'm asking you to tell the truth who spilt my beer? 
Who spilt my beer, who spilt my beer? 
I'm asking you to tell the truth who spilt my beer? Oh, oh, oh, oh, come on in 
Let's go and buy me a beer, oh, oh, oh, oh 
If one of you out doesn't own up pretty soon 
I'm gonna be very angry, oh, oh, oh, oh Who spilt my beer, who spilt my beer? 
I'm asking you to tell the truth who spilt my beer? 
Who spilt my beer, who spilt my beer? 
I'm asking you to tell the truth who spilt my beer? Who spilt my beer, who spilt my beer? 
I'm asking you to tell the truth who spilt my beer? 
Who spilt my beer, who spilt my beer? 
I'm asking you to tell the truth who spilt my beer?
