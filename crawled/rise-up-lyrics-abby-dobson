Ive been running into trouble 
Well mostly Ive been walking 
Having conversations with God 
Where I do all the talking Just to find the will to live 
Is a search that takes me far and wide 
Sometimes the suburbs of paradise 
Leave a lot to be desired Will I rise, will I rise up? 
Will I rise, will I rise, up? As I crawl around my house 
I think I could just disappear 
I keep looking in the mirror 
Just to see if Im still here Maybe we could overthrow 
The political campaign 
With all this blood on our hands 
Weve only got ourselves to blame Will we rise, will we rise up? 
Will we rise, will we rise up? 
Will we rise... up? 
Will we rise... up? The road ahead is all the shiver 
But is the past through with me yet? 
All the sins of the father 
That Im trying to forget Whys it take a world of love 
To let just a little in 
Theres a murmur in my heart 
But it might be only spring Will it rise, will it rise up? 
Will it rise, will it rise up? 
Will we rise... up? 
Will we rise, will we rise up? 
Will we rise... up...?
