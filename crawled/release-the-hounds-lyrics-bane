all swelled with pride, your chest blown out 
face the flag as you declare 
"we are the greatest country in the world 
richest, smartest, most advanced?who can keep up with us?" 
and where has it gotten us? 
take a look around 
as miserable as we have ever been 
violent, mean, pulling our hair out 
as fourteen year olds march through metal detectors 
bitter, unhealthy, empty 
most dissatisfied of societies 
my granddad weeps for the simple days 
everything that you could ever dream of 
five minutes from our fingertips 
prettied, processed, packaged, 
shipped right to your door 
we need everything in every color 
to feel that wee alive 
wee got to brag to all the world 
about all our toys 
just like when we were five 
i hear you chant 
"everything is alright, it gonna be alright" 
as you rush to your night job 
everything is gonna be alright 
knuckles white as you grip your purse 
you scream that things could not be better 
as the flames lick at your face 
and i as fucked as anybody 
the bright lights catch my eyes 
i as scared as anyone 
the blood rains from the sky 
we can tell what we want from what we need 
or which one matters more 
it all a spinning mobile 
it all a catchy lullaby 
everything is gonna be alright 
so suck your thumb
