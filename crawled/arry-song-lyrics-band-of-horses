I'll marry my lover in a place to admire 
I don't have to even ask her, I can look in her eyes 
And thank god that I am forgiven 
I thank all my friends 
To say I've been truer or they forgotten Marry my mind is to say the least 
It's been awful hard to just stand on my feet 
I think I'll slow down if I am able 
I won't drown in the ocean 
For starving my place at the table Lucky ones are we all 'till it is over 
Everyone near and far 
When you smile, the sun it peaks through the clouds 
Never die for always be around and around and around How is your sister and what of your brother? 
Extend hellos to your father and mother 
What in the world would cause you any sorrow 
Like tea in your loaf 
And see how I killed the wheel barrel I borrowed
