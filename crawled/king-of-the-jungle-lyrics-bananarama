Lurking, he knows your face 
He waits and bides his time 
Mind clocks your every move 
Till you step out of line 
Stalking streets by night 
Pushing guns by day 
He knows it isn't right 
But he wants to make his name 
He's working harder 
Gotta make another, make another martyr 
(Chorus) 
Hide your eyes 
They are moving closer 
But you know you're not allowed to look them in the face 
Hide your eyes 
Coz you're the loser 
Before you even start to run you've lost the race 
You'll never know the place 
Until your time has come 
It'll be a sunny day 
Until his work is done 
Doesn't care what pain you feel 
Can't see your mother's tears 
As she counts the cost of the life that's lost 
And twenty wasted years 
Gone and made another, made another martyr
