She's thunderstorms 
Lying on her front 
Up against the wall 
She's thunderstorms I've been feeling foolish 
You should try it 
She came and substituted 
The peace and quiet 
For acrobatic blood 
Flow constanting her? 
Her cheating heartbeat 
Rapid fire She's thunderstorms 
Lying on her front 
Up against the wall 
She's thunderstorms Hear who's your host 
Sounds as if she's pretty close 
When the heat starts growing horns 
She's thunderstorms She's been loop-the-looping 
Around my mind 
Her motorcycle boots 
Give me this kind of 
Acrobatic blood? 
Constanting her? 
Cheating heartbeat 
Rapid fire She's thunderstorms 
Lying on her front 
Up against the wall 
She's thunderstorms 
In an unusual place 
When you're feeling far away 
She does what the night does to the day She's thunderstorms 
Lying on her front 
Up against the wall 
She's thunderstorms 
Thunderstorms 
Thunderstorms
