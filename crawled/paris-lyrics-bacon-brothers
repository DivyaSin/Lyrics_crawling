Strings written and arranged by Michael Bacon "A guide book for the paranoid." KB I'm in Paris, won't be here long 
But after all it's Paris, guess I'd better write a song 
It's so wonderful, so magical, so romantic 
Note to self to change that line, it's too pedantic But it's Paris, I've come so far 
I've made it all the way from the bed

I'm terrified of what's outside beyond that door 
I'm a prisoner, I'm a prisoner 
A prisoner of 424 Brought a girl to Paris, she didn't like the food

See I'm in this room and this room is who I am 
And if you don't like that I don't' give 
A good God Notre Dame I'm a prisoner, I'm a prisoner 
I'm terrified of what's outside beyond that door 
I'm a prisoner, I'm a prisoner 
A big strong guy like me, imagine that 
I'm a prisoner, I'm a prisoner 
A prisoner of quatre deux qua
