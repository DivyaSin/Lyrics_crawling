He'd say can't never could do nothin' 
And weights what broke the wagon 
There ain't no fence between right or wrong 
Sometimes you gotta fight if you wanna get along 
You better stand up when that flag gets raised 
Or down on your knees when it's time to pray 
But the greatest thing about him to me 
Was the fact that he believed [Chorus] 
He believed in the good Lord above 
A straight shootin' rifle, and the power of love 
He believed in why the blood was shed 
And if he couldn't be free, he'd rather be dead 
And to never give up on your dreams 
But most of all, yeah, most of all he believed in me Well, he had his own opinion 
About the world and its condition 
Spare the rod, spoil the child 
You'll reap what you sow if you let it grow wild 
You just gotta deal with the hand you're dealt 
Never give up, and you'll never really fail 
But the greatest thing about dad to me 
Was the fact that he believed [Chorus] [Bridge] 
Oh, and just because of him I know who I am today 
And just because of that I know where he's gone to stay [Chorus]
