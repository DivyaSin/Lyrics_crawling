Look at me 
Look at me now Do you remember me 
Now that you see my eyes again 
The ones that fell silent in the rain 
When my life went dark amidst the pain - the pain Now do you remember who I was 
The violent night that made my world insane 
Left me there to die in my own blood 
Ripped the smile right off my face, And now 
Do you see the ghost that you fear 
Do you hear my cries, do you now hear 
When my thunder roars amid the storm 
Then you will remember me once more We knew this night would come 
When I'd open my eyes again 
Does my broken body haunt your dreams 
I can't forget the hell you made for me - the hell you made for me Now do you remember who I was 
The violent night that made my world insane 
Left me there to die in my own blood 
Ripped the smile right off my face, And now 
Is it armageddon you fear 
Do you hear the rage, do you now hear 
When my thunder roars amid the storm 
Then you will remember me once more The memories ride in and find you 
As the shame and lightning strike you 
The voice that you silenced long ago 
Is the voice that calls the storm once more 
I call the storm once more Do you see the ghost that you fear 
Do you hear my cries, do you now hear 
When my thunder roars amid the storm 
Then you will remember me once more Now that you remember who I was 
The violent night that made my world insane 
Left me there to die in my own blood 
Ripped the smile right off my face, And now 
Is it armageddon you fear 
Do you hear the rage, do you now hear 
When my thunder roars amid the storm 
Then you will remember me once more Take one more look 
Then you will remember me once more 
Take one last look 
Then you will remember me once more
