January starts without much sympathy,

To silence fights, the beating drums, 
the eloquence, the yet to know, 
the "will it hurt?", the "will it hold?" This night won't satisfy me, 
This fear won't bring me to the ground. 
I know you're scared of hiding, 
I know you're aching to be found. 
I know you're aching to be found. 
I know you're aching to be- This night won't satisfy me, 
This fear won't bring me to the ground 
I know you're scared of hiding 
I know you're aching to be found. 
I know you're aching to be found. 
I know you're aching to be-
