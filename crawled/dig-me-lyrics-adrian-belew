It's here I sit amid this ruin and rancor 
Like tire irons, toothy grills, and car parts before me 
The acid rain floods my floorboards, 
Burns my pores, and rots my upholstery 
Once I was worshipped, polished magnificently 
Now I lay in decay 
By the dirty angry bay I'm ready to leave 
I wanna get out of here 
I'm ready to ride away 
I don't wanna die in here 
I'm ready to ride My skin is metallic now, now longer an elegant powder blue 
My body unhinged and sleeping in the jungle 
Of motor block manifolds and metal relics 
What was deluxe becomes debris, 
I never questioned loyalty, 
But this dead end demolishes the dream 
Of an open highway Dig me. 
But don't 
Bury me
