She probably still keeps herself inside herself 
Her head it ruled her heart with a tune I'll never hear 
Summer, like self-portraits we were hit or miss Never the same hues twice 
The second layer's applied before the first one's were even rendered I guess her wall's still high and wide 
With the writing on the inside 
Its meaning's reapplied to who's in fashion CHORUS Time's a perfect crime for a mystery girl 
The veil distorts the rhyme for a mystery girl Somewhere tonight a lonely shadow's painting in the rain 
And most of what is captured will be in vain You try to keep away the dogs of memory 
The hungry and the restless ones just come at different angles A cigarette at midnight in a slow, dark room 
And they're scratchin' at your door The corner of your mind you pared to eloquence now rambles 
And the rain sounds like a freight train 
Don't it always come the same When your hunger meets the pain of her resilience CHORUS I guess her wall's still high and wide 
With the writing on the inside 
Its meaning's reapplied to who's in fashion CHORUS
