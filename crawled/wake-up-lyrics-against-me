Well I'll wake up around 4:05. 
Eat, shower, and get dressed in about an hour's time. 
Take my vitamins, check my messages, and call around to some friends, 
make plans for dinner and drinks sometime after 9:00. 
We're definately going to call it in early tonight. 
Well, I need to dry out and take some time to clear my mind. 
Now before you know it here I am again, it's fucking 2:00 in the morning, 
standing in a bar, with a drink in hand. How low can you go before you can't turn around? Now seriously, this is my last and final time. 
Well I'm making some big, big changes in my life. 
No, you won't catch me down here again, waiting to score sweaty money palmed into my hand. 
What the fuck are you cutting this with anyway? 
Because I have got some really, really big plans. 
And today's the day I'm putting them into action. 
But before you know it, here I am again. It's fucking 6:00 in the morning. 
Rolled up dollar bill in my hand. How low can you go before you can't turn around? And I'm sick of feeling like I'm losing my mind. 
Sick of doing the same things night after night. 
Sick of self-loathing and self-absorbtion, 
self-destructive narcissism. 
I'm sick to death of being constantly fucking sick of. I don't know who I can trust. 
Thought there was us, now there is no one.
