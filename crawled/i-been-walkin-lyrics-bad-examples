I been walkin? in the lord 
Been walkin? next to buddha 
Been walkin? with the president 
But I don't know where to go 
Been walkin? with my mother 
Been walkin? with my son 
Been walkin? in the water 
But I don't know where to go And I think it's been in vain 
And I think it's been in vain Been walkin? with jesus 
Been walkin? with sting 
Been walkin? with your mother 
She could not tell me a thing I been walkin? on a sky scraper 
Been walkin? on my hands 
Been walkin? after midnight 
I still don't understand Oh but what the hell --that's the way it goes these days 
Oh what the hell --that's the way it goes ... Been walkin? with the lord 
Been walkin? with the buddha 
Been walkin? with my best friend 
But I still don't understand Been walkin? in the sunset 
Been walkin? in the stars 
Been walkin? in the forest 
Oh you know where you are Oh but what the hell --that's the way it goes these days 
Oh what the hell --that's the way it goes these days... 
The way it goes these days ... been walkin? after midnight
