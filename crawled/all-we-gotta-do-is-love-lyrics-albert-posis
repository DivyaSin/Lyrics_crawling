VERSE 1: 
We're back at it again. 
No need to pretend. 
Just another fight 
This don't feel right. No. 
You're yelling on the phone. 
You say you can't this anymore. 
You're sick of it. 
About to quit. But. BRIDGE 1: 
Girl I know it's get hard sometimes 
But we gotta stop fighting. 
Just gotta keep trying, flying. 
Girl I know it feels like you can't do it. 
But here I am, just take my hand. 
Cause together we'll pull right through it. CHORUS: 
Because we're made to be together. 
There's no one I'd rather be with. 
Baby just stay with me forever. 
It's only you, girl believe it. 
Baby just trust. 
Ain't gon give up. 
Cause I got you. 
All we gotta do 
Is love. VERSE 2: 
Girl I know it's hard. It's like 
Distance is tearing us apart. 
But I want you to know. 
That I'll never go. Oh. 
Cause I'm so in love you. 
Baby you're my dream come true. 
Can't imagine my life 
Without you by my side. No.
