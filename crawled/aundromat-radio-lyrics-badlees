This town ain't much to look at, there ain't that much to do 
With the local Joe's at the stop and go and the class of '42 
We go down to the laundromat and listen to that station 
Find out where the fire was at and see what's in rotation Good morning to you, good morning to you 
Laundromat radio Last year's reader's digests, weight watchers magazines 
Discussions on arthritis with dirty welfare queens 
With a case of light beer and a pack of light cigarettes 
We try to minimize the damage but still raise our consciousness Good morning to you, good morning to you 
Laundromat radio Tomorrow I think I'll get up and march on down to Sears 
And buy all those appliances I've been dreamin' of for years 
Then I'll get on of those stereo receivers of my own 
So I can be bored to tears from the comfort of my home Laundromat radio
