I'm keeping my affair in a book 
so this is how a villain feels 
they're running seasons in my chest 
and I'm only to keep them Chorus: 
Maybe it's not true 
love on the TV 
just like we imagine it 
and it's so hard to do 
when theres always some distraction 
a shiny red balloon 
that spoils everything I'm keeping my affair in a book 
such practical and harmless vice 
but I'm feeling it could end up painfully 
and the TV should apologize Chorus: 
Maybe it's not true 
love on the TV 
just like we imagine it 
and it's so hard to do 
when theres always some distraction 
a shiny red balloon 
that spoils everything I'm keeping my affair in a book 
my long and lonely compromise 
how can you live like that my dear 
well we do love on the TV 
just like we imagine it 
and it's so hard to do 
when theres always some distraction 
a shiny red balloon 
that spoils everything Chorus: 
Maybe it's not true 
love on the TV 
just like we imagine it 
and it's so hard to do 
when theres always some distraction 
a shiny red balloon 
that spoils everything It spoils everything (7x)
