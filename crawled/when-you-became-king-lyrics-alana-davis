I don't know when you became king of my dreams 
I only know when you go that everything around me 
falls apart at the seams 
I've never known someone so much like me 
Yet you're your own and parts of you 
remain a sweet mystery 
And I am falling 
Falling into a dream 
And you you are calling 
Calling to be your queen 
All the world is a stage when you're around 
Everyone's acting their parts but nothing is real like 
this love that I've found 
With you my baby 
And when you lift me up there's no coming down 
I get so high I could float on a feather like a fairy crown 
And I am falling... 
The willows howls as the lazy sleep 
And the lucky stars fall away as they weep
