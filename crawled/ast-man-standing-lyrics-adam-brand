There's a tyre on the rope above the swimming hole 
Where Danny and Dave and Tim would go 
Make up stories 'bout girls they know 
Brothers and best friends 
Now the dam's dried up and the rope is frayed 
Danny and Dave they ran away 
Timmy he just had to stay 
'Cause he's the last man standing on this ground 
He was raised on this land and he ain't leaving now 
All the other boys have packed up and gone 
Leaving him to carry on 
"Cause he's the last man standing 
Mama took a job at the General Store 
Timmy built a ramp from the front porch door 
"Cause Daddy can't do much round here anymore 
He just sits and stares 
And it breaks his heart not to lend a hand 
He says "There's too much work for just one man" 
Timmy says "Dad don't you understand?" 
"Cause I'm the last man standing on the ground 
I was raised on this land and I won't let you down 
All your other boys have packed up and gone 
You can count on me to carry on 
"Cause I'm the last man standing 
Sometimes late at night he dreams 
Of places he won't see 
But he says "All they've got is me" 
Now he's the last man standing on this ground 
He was raised on this land and he ain't leaving now 
All the other boys have packed up and gone 
Leaving him to carry on 
He's the last man standing on this ground 
He won't let his mama and his daddy down 
All the other boys have packed up and gone 
They can count on him to carry on 
"Cause he's the last man standing.
