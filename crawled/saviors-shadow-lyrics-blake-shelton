I'm standing in my Savior's shadow 
He is watching over me 
I feel the rain, I hear the thunder 
As he cries for me I'm standing in my Savior's shadow 
Grace will lead to where I'm free 
I take his hand, we walk together 
And his light shines on me Though the devil try to break me 
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me 
When I'm in my Savior's shadow 
Where I'm supposed to be I'm standing in my Savior's shadow 
Following his footsteps there 
Every mountain, every ocean 
He hears my every prayer Though the devil try to break me 
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me 
When I'm in my Savior's shadow 
Where I'm supposed to be Though the devil try to break me 
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me 
When I'm in my Savior's shadow 
Where I'm supposed to be 
When I'm in my Savior's shadow 
I'm who I'm supposed to be
