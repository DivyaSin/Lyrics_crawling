I don't need no TV, I don't need no news 
All I need is a bumping beat, to bump away my blues 
I don't give a damn what the people say 
I'm gonna do it my way, gonna do it my way Boom, boom, boom, a bang, bang, bang 
I gotta let it all out, do my thing 
Boom, boom, boom, and a bang, bang, bang 
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang 
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang Do your thing, do your thing 
Make my body swing 
Do your thing, do your thing 
Your thing, my thing, oh, oh, oh, oh Shut up your mouth, you're in a fatal tizz 
Free the mayhem in your mind, release the need inside of you 
You're going to suffer, because the crowd's so far 
Do your thing, do your thing Boom, boom, boom, a bang, bang, bang 
I gotta let it all out, do my thing 
Boom, boom, boom, and a bang, bang, bang 
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang 
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang Do your thing , do your thing 
Make my body swing 
Do your thing, do your thing 
Your thing, my thing, oh, oh, oh, oh And a boom, boom, boom, and a bang, bang, bang 
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang 
And a boom, boom, boom, and a bang, bang, bang 
Do your thing, do your thing And a boom, boom, boom, and a bang, bang, bang 
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang 
And a boom, boom, boom, and a bang, bang, bang 
Do your thing, do your thing Do your thing, do your thing 
Do your thing, make my body swing 
Do your thing, do your thing, 
Do your thing, your thing, my thing, oh, oh, oh, oh
