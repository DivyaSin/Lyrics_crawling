When will I ever grow up 
When will today be enough 
When will I learn to be here now? 
It's on the other side of the door - that's what I'm looking for 
I have what I need - why do I want more? more? 
Put a lot of pavement on my shoes 
Made a lot of payments on my dues 
I'm running out of patience just like you 
I'll be in the waiting room tomorrow just like today and yesterday 
Why am I still waiting my life away? 
Where will I find the will to stop running and just stand still 
And take a look at the bird in my hand? 
How can I find the faith to drop out of the human race 
And let the future crawl back to it's cage?
