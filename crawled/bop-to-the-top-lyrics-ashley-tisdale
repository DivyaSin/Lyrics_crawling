Mucho gusto 
Ay, que fabulosa! 
Ay ay ay, arriba! 
Quieres bailar? 
Mirame I believe in dreamin shootin for the stars 
Baby, to be number one youve got to raise the bar 
Kickin and a scratchin, grindin out my best 
Anything it takes to climb the ladder of success Work our tails off every day 
Gotta bump the competition, blow them all away 
Caliente! Suave! Yeah, were gonna bop bop bop, bop to the top 
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm 
Jump and hop, hop til we drop 
And start again 
Zig zag zop, pop like a mop 
Scoot around the corner 
Move it to the groove til the music stops Do the bop bop bop to the top 
Dont ever stop, bop to the top 
Gimmie gimmie, shimmy shimmy Shake some booty and turn around 
Flash a smile in their direction 
Show some muscle, do the hustle Yeah, were gonna bop bop bop, bop to the top 
Wipe away your inhibitions 
Stomp, stomp, stomp, do the rump 
And strut your stuff 
Bop, bop, bop, straight to the top 
Going for the glory 
We'll keep stepping up and we just wont stop 
(Stop) 
Til we reach the top! 
Bop to the top!
