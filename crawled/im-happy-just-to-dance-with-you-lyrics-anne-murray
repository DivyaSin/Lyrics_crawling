Before this dance is through, 
I think I'll love you too, 
I'm so happy when you dance with me. 
I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand, 
If it's funny, try an' understand. 
There is nothing else I'd rather do, 
'Cos I'm happy just to dance with you. 
I don't need to hug or hold you tight, 
I just wanna dance with you all night, 
In this world there's nothing I would rather do, 
'Cos I'm happy just to dance with you. 
Just to dance with you is everything I need, 
Before this dance is through, 
I think I'll love you too, 
I'm so happy when you dance with me. 
If somebody tries to take my place, 
Let's pretend, we just can't see his face. 
In this world there's nothing I would rather do, 
'Cos I'm happy just to dance with you. 
Just to dance with you is everything I need, 
Before this dance is through, 
I think I'll love you too, 
I'm so happy when you dance with me. 
If somebody tries to take my place, 
Let's pretend, we just can't see his face. 
In this world there's nothing I would rather do, 
I've discovered I'm in love with you. 
Oh, oh 'cos I'm happy just to dance with you. 
Oh, oh.
