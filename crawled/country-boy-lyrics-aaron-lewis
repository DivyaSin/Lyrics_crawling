Now, I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know 
My pop's picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks back in 1964 
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day, he put him down 
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskey's known to change a man, but That's not me 
I rarely drink from the bottle but I'll smoke a little weed 
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go 
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road 
And a country boy is all I'll ever be Now, its been twelve years since I sold my soul to the devil in L.A. 
He said sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs, they all will play 
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee 
He said "you want to sell a million records boy, you better listen to me" 
He said "change your style, whiten your smile, you can lose a couple of pounds 
If you want to live this life, you better lose that wife, do you need your friends around?" And I said, no, that's not me 
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family 
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts 
And a couple extra pounds never really hurt 
'Cause a country boy is all I'll ever be 'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive 
You'll never catch me out the house without my .9 or .45 
I got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck 
And my idea of heaven is chasing whitetail bucks 
And as a country boy, I know I can survive Now, two flags fly above my land that really sum up how I feel 
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue 
The other one's got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made 
"Don't Tread On Me" is what is says and I'll take that to my grave Because this is me 
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs 
And I've said it before but I'll say it again 
'Cause I've never needed government to hold my hand 
And I've said it before but I'll say it again 
'Cause my family's always fought and died to save this land 
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
