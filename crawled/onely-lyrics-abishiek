I AM LONELY , 
OH VERY LONELY , 
OH NO WHAT TO DO NOW? 
I AM LONELY , 
OH VERY LONELY , 
OH NO WHAT TO DO NOW? 
I WANDER ON STREETS IN MY BICYCLE 
TO LOOK FOR A PERSON WHO JUST LIKE ME ......... 
I WANDER ON STREETS IN MY BICYCLE 
TO LOOK FOR A PERSON WHO JUST LIKE ME ...... 
I AM LONELY , 
OH VERY LONELY , 
OH NO WHAT TO DO NOW? 
I NEED SOMEONE WHO'S NOT GREEDY NOR SELFISH OR NOTHING LIKE ELSE.... 
OH I AM LONELY .... 
COZ OF MY ANGER 
I HAVE LOST EVERYONE .. 
EVEN MY PARENTS AND ALMOST EVERYONE..... 
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY LIFE 
I AM SITTING ALONE IN A CORNER AND THINKING ABOUT PAST 
I AM LONELY , 
OH VERY LONELY , 
OH NO WHAT TO DO NOW? 
THERE WAS SOMEONE IN MY LIFE WHO CAME WITH A SMILE AND MADE MY LIFE CHANGE... 
IT WAS THEN THE TURNING POINT OF LIFE. 
SUNRISE IS IN YOU 
SUNSET IS IN ME 
THERE JUST A 
SHORT DISTANCE LOVE BETWEEN YOU AND ME... 
THEN SHE ALSO LEFT ME BECAUSE OF MY ANGER AND EGO..... 
AND I BECAME LONELY 
OH VERY LONELY , 
OH NO WHAT TO DO NOW? 
LONELYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
