Too much is never enough. Super-size, my eyes like satellites. The say live faster. The say die harder. I've got my TV on channel zero all night long. My volume knob's turned up to eleven... 4, 5, 6... 24/7. Everybody wants a redder red, blacker blues, and deader deads. Everybody wants a broken heart yeah, yeah. Fill me to the top and baby don't stop. I want sixty jolts per minute. More volts, gimme lightning bolts. I want my radio to blast that static all night long. My volume knob's turned up to eleven... 4, 5, 6... 24/7. Excess, access always on. Excess, access all night long.
