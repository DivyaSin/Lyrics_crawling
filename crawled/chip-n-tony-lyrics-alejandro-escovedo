I'll I ever wanted was a four piece band 
Yeah we're coming on strong 
Just like an accident 
Are you standing up 
Are you laying down 
Are you growing up 
You start sleeping around 
Chip & Tony said, it was against the law 
C'mon Up on the mound 
I was ten feet tall 
Had my black turtleneck 
Just like my Marshall Up on the mound 
Up on the mound 
Everybody looking 
Their not going down 
Chip & Tony said, it was against the law 
C'mon I'm torn picture postcard of a California dream 
I'm the last drink of water from salt & sea 
I love you now, like I loved you then 
I love you now, like I loved you then 
Chip & Tony said, it was against the law, c'mon 
Chip & Tony said, it was against the law, c'mon
