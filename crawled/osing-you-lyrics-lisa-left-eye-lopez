sometimes I cant find the words to explain exactly how I feel 'cause it deep, real 
deep and I just hope you can see how deep it is, by listenin to this song....... now let me open up my heart and let you read just what I wrote when you, had 
took the final steps of death and left my heart broken in two, but you had to, 
damn, I wish that I can have a talk with the eternal man, I wish that you was 
here with me right now holding my hand, I feel I cant go on and don't nobody 
understand, it makes me wonder why, and if I have to die why is this my biggest 
fear, I can only look above and just let heaven wipe my tears.... CHORUS 
'cause if I'm losin you 
and if I'm losing you 
to who will I confide 
who will hear my cry 
and if I'm losing you 
then will u see me thru 
thru the day thru the nights 
oh you've gone will u stay by my side got on my knees this morning talking to the Lord, my father, thanks for 
blessing me when the others didn't bother, life goes on, got to stay strong, 
Ida done some wrong, but Ida done some right too, cried some lonely nights too, 
and in my heart nobody knows the pain I tends to hide it, holdin back my tears 
I tends to fight it, but its buildin up inside of me, this heavy load, help me 
lord before I explode, please take my soul...... CHORUS see I don't know if I can say goodbye to yesterday, 'cause when you leave and go 
to heaven its so far away, 
and I cant even stop to think to wipe my tears away, but maybe he thought it 
was best for you to come and stay, what can I say, just keep your peoples close 
to you, so you can cherish every memory they stood thru, and stood true, so if 
you meet that cross road, then you could say, that you opened up your heart, 
and just let heaven wipe your tears away...... CHORUS (X2) 
and if I close my eyes at night 
will I see you in heaven 
and if the lord takes my life 
I hope I see you in heaven 
just wipe the tears away before today 
and when he comes be prepared for a brighter day 
take me away....... CHORUS I'm losing you (and i hope you could see how deep it was by listening to the 
word of the song) I'm losing you when your far away, there's nothin I can say 
but hope and pray, for a better day 
and if there's a way, for you to stay 
stay in my life ohh forever 
I'm losing you , 
if I'm losing you
