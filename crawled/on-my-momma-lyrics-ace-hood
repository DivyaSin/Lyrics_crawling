Mama can finally smile 
Pray for a better life 
Just to see me through them tougher nights Spoke to my mama just the other day 
I told her only God can make a way 
I'm hearin' tears they runnin' down her face 
She fed up with the struggle each and every day 
My step pops he be in the way, too many bills my mama gotta pay 
But know I got us no doubt about it on granny's grave 
? 
And now they sweat me line Under Armours and Gatorade 
I pray that one day you see me speak at the VMA's 
And me and Khaled we back to back in the latest things 
Throw up the W, We The Best is the fuckin' gang 
Hard work pays off, go and get it, no days off 
I know they all remember me you recognize the name 
I was that nigga being humble counted out the game 
Now I'm that nigga still humble carryin' the flame 
And everybody said I wouldn't take a walk a shame 
Though about you haters when I copped my pinky ring 
Livin' reality it used to be a great dream 
Hustle hard, erryday, getting money, five ways 
Say old shit, just a different day 
Out here tryna get it, I'm out here gettin' paid [Repeat: x2] 
I'm out here gettin' paid Mama can finally smile, take a look at me now Young nigga, two seater, tatted up cruisin' in a wife beater 
Bad bitch, top down, twenty-fours see us skatin' on the whip now 
I'm just living life hope you do the same 
Keep a buncha real niggas so I never change 
Look at me now, look at em then, 
Went from the Taurus, I'm thinkin' Benz 
I'm taking ends, now I'm thinking big 
I got wit Khaled all the nigga do is win 
See we the best, nothin' less 
It's war time hope you niggas brought a vest 
Got plenty women, from that Penicillin 
Fuck 'em on that Gucci linen she comin' in minutes 
No love intended I'm just tryna wet the willie 
They freed my nigga Jockey posed to have did a life sentence 
I'm from the bottom, came from the mud 
Was given nothing, no love, now I'm beat mode, no hugs 
Back again, sure 'nuff 
I'm the definition of blowin' up 
Look in my niggas eyes better know it's on us 
You better know it's on us [Repeat: x2] 
'Cause I got it sewn up Mama can finally smile 
Take a look at me now
