I had a dream of you and me last night 
Under the stars and moon, so bright 
Lying together we hold each other tight There's nothing better than being just with you 
It's like a dream come true 
Over and over 
Again and again 
I'll say I love you Now we're together 
Never ever will I leave you 
We're together 
No one's gonna take you away from me 
Cause you'll be 
You will always be 
The only one for me When you told me you love me the way I do 
Can't explain my feelings inside 
I feel so alive since I had you by my side There's nothing better than being just with you 
It's like a dream come true 
Over and over 
Again and again 
I'll say I love you Now we're together 
Never ever will I leave you 
We're together 
No one's gonna take you away from me 
Cause you'll be 
You will always be 
The only one for me Never ever will I leave you 
We're together 
No one's gonna take you away from me 
Cause you'll be 
You will always be 
The only one for me Now we're together 
Never ever will I leave you 
We're together 
No one's gonna take you away from me 
Cause you'll be 
You will always be 
The only one for me Now we're together 
Never ever will I leave you 
We're together 
No one's gonna take you away from me 
Cause you'll be 
You will always be 
The only one for me Ohhh ohhh ohhh... 
Wooohhh... 
The only one for me
