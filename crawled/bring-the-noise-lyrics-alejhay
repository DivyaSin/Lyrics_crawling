[Intro] [Verse 1] Whoa Whoa Whoa 
I'm the only one in the room, and I still can't hear myself 
Think I might need some help, see my mind's gone bad with greed 
Hands out, more money please 
How I got this way? I really can't say, but I'm on one 
Fuck everybody, how I feel sometimes 
No it's not personal, just some words that rhyme 
Look, I'm a Gemini...I don't know what that means 
Now tell me your sign, wait, it's irrelevant 
I'm a nervous wreck, like all the time 
If you listen to my lines read between the lines [Hook] This song wasn't meant for you 
This is something that I like to do 
No I don't want you to dance, or show ya ass like you lowered ya pants 
But, you can bring the noise though 
Bring the noise though 
I said bring the noise though [Verse 2] I said bring the noise, like you're arguing 
Be as loud as you want it's a party kid 
Now me myself I gotta mouth on me with a nasty bite, it's just the dog in me 
I bar hop to kill time, Jack Daniel's, margaritas, I fucking hate wine 
If you feeling this I got love for you 
All the haters keep doing what you do 
Bring the noise, c'mon I dare ya don't be scared know, go on and man up 
Put some hair on ya chest say something didn't you hear the hook while your gums was bumping? [Hook] This song wasn't meant for you 
This is something that I like to do 
No I don't want you to dance, or show your ass like you lowered your pants 
But, you can bring the noise though 
Bring the noise though 
I said bring the noise though I said bring the noise and fuck everybody 
I said I walk around the club, fuck everybody ha
