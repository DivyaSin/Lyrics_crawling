Something is wrong I see it in your eyes (your eyes) 
Ohhh Girl 
Where is the joy where is your big broad smile 
Ohh who who who 
Seems you dont trust me anymore 
Showing signs Ive never seen before 
Baby on my own I should get by 
Could I would I? 
How will I know if I dont try? 
Must I deny? 
Clearly you dont trust me anymore ahhh 
Showing signs Ive never seen 
And to erase the mistakes of life and amend 
If I had a chance to do it again 
Id right the wrongs that your little heart 
Would not be singing sad songs 
All the pain is all the past 
That grows and die like grass 
I dont ever want to live without you ohhhh Baby on my own I should get by 
Could I would I? 
How will I know if I dont try? 
Must I deny? 
Clearly you dont love me anymore ahhh 
Showing signs Ive never seen before 
Ahhh ahhh (could I would I) ahhh ahhh 
Clearly you dont trust me anymore ahhh 
Showing signs I have never seen (before) These are restless and sleepless nights 
Alone I cry 
Youre not around me to confide 
Because of your pride 
I tried you said I lied ohhhh 
So fed up Im sick and tired 
Ohhh I say Baby on my own I should get by 
Could I would I 
How will I know if I dont try? 
Must I deny? 
Clearly you dont trust me anymore ahhh 
Showing signs Ive never seen 
And to erase the mistakes of life and amend 
If I had a chance to do it again 
Id right the wrongs that your little heart 
Would not be singing sad songs 
All the pain is all the past 
That grows and die like grass 
I dont ever want to live without you ohhh
