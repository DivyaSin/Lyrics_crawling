(Gary Harrison - Kent Robbins - Gene Miller) I don't recall your number 
Don't reach for you at night 
Don't ask your friends about you 
You're out of my sight, but I'm out of my mind So why am I still in love - can you tell me 
Why I can't forget what you've forgotten 
Why am I still in love - can you tell me 
Why my heart stays in yesterday 
Oh, why am I still in love I found a new apartment 
New friends, new lovers too 
It's not that I've been lonely 
But nothing's changed my love for you
