(Alexander) Mama they must be crazy 
'Cause I can't make heads or tales 
Or someone must have lied 
In your fairy tales 'Cause I tried to walk that straight line 
Sweat clean to pay my bills 
While every lazy, ass kissing, son of a bitch 
Gets paid to say he will Mama don't you know by now 
They'll never get to me 
But I'm still waiting for the truth 
To set me free Mama they must be crazy 
The way they use they're stepping-stones 
It's carve 'em up and throw 'em out 
And disregard the bones You try to keep your senses 
You try to keep your head 
While some anointed yes man 
Parlays your soul to death Mama don't you know by now They'll never get to me 
But I'm still waiting for the truth 
To set me free 
Mama they must be crazy Mama they must be crazy 
'Cause they weren't playing fair 
"Son, shut the door behind you 
And have a seat right over there" Mama don't you know by now 
They'll never get to me 
But I was hoping that the truth 
Would set me free Mama they must be crazy
