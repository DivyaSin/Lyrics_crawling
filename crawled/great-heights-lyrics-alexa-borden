There's a delicacy 
about a silent sea. 
A stillness so great that we 
could build on the shore. A statue of our (wonder) 
Above the concrete tow'rs (wonder some) 
And bursting with birds they'd shower 
out on the sand. The people would ride the ocean tide. 
To photograph as we grin full and wide. They'll see us from such great heights 
and wave at us as we float by. 
We'll light the streets below 
with the warmest glow. 
Oh oh. Climbing the stone. 
Planted on the silent sea. 
Perched there so perfectly. 
There on our throne. And we were so light. 
Our toes lifted off in flight 
the city and sound in sight 
and we ruled the world. The scientists couldn't believe what they had found. 
And soon the people would gather from all around. They'll see us from such great heights 
and wave at us as we float by. 
We'll light the streets below 
with the warmest glow. Larger than the greatest kings, 
our eyes so bright as we sprouted wings. 
Higher than the tall sky scrapers 
They smile at us as we ride on paper, 
on paper planes. They'll see us from such great heights 
and wave at us as we float by. 
We'll light the streets below 
with the warmest glow. The sunlit globe set us off in a twirl 
and carried us farther out of this world. 
The crowds will holler goodbye 
as we wander out. 
Out out.
