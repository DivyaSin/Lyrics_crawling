I'm under your spell 
(Release me) 
I'm losing myself 
(Can't control me) 
I'm captured by the way you entice me 
Me, me, me I can't even function, I feel like I'm hypnotized 
Feel so energized, do I need to slow down? 
(No) 
'Cause right now I can't seem to find it 
I kinda like the way it's flowing It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it 
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it 
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it 
When I try to leave it keeps on pushing me, uncontrollable It's uncontrollable 
It's uncontrollable The pressure is on 
(Tempting) 
I feel overwhelmed 
(I'm speechless) 
My focus is gone by the beat of your drums 
Drums, drums, drums I can't even sleep and I can't even analyze 
Why I'm so tempted by? Do I need to slow down? 
(No) 
'Cause right now I can't even find it 
I kinda like the way it's flowing It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it 
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it 
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it 
When I try to leave it keeps on pushing me, uncontrollable It's uncontrollable 
It's uncontrollable The joy that it brings, it overtakes me 
It fulfills my fantasies, all of my dreams 
The joy that it brings, it overtakes me 
It keeps on forcing me, keeps on pushing me It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it 
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it 
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it 
When I try to leave it keeps on pushing me It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it 
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it 
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it 
When I try to leave it keeps on pushing me, uncontrollable It's uncontrollable 
It's uncontrollable
