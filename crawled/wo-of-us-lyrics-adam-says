Been sitting next to the open sea 
I'm digging my feet into the sand 
pretending that you are beside me 
holding my fingers as the sun goes down 
if I could travel to my future life, 
I wish you see these right by now Living up in day by the day 
I never gonna stop to find where you are 
A girl that I will fall into 
I dont know but surely you'll find me too 
Just around 5 years from now I'll see you 
and sing this music for the two of us Back to the scene of the open sea 
I'm singing through a distance between you and me 
somewhere you're living across the sea 
I'm never gonna stop to pray for you there 
Pretending you out there to smile and see 
a way in front of you that will end with me as I'm living up in day by the day 
I'm never gonna stop to find where you are
