My life, your life 
Don't cross them lines 
What you like, what I like 
Why can't we both be right? 
Attacking, defending 
Until there's nothing left worth winning 
Your pride and my pride 
Don't waste my time I don't wanna fight no more 
I don't wanna fight no more 
I don't wanna fight no more 
I don't wanna fight no more 
I don't wanna fight no more 
Don't wanna fight no more, ah I'll take from my hand 
Put in your hands 
The fruit of all my grief 
Lying down ain't easy 
When everyone is pleasing 
I can't get no relief 
Living ain't no fun 
The constant dedication 
Keeping the water and power on 
There ain't nobody left 
Why can't I catch my breath? 
I'm gonna work myself to death I don't wanna fight no more 
Don't wanna fight no more 
I don't wanna fight no more 
I don't wanna fight no more 
I don't wanna fight no more 
I don't wanna fight no more, ah 
No, no, no, no!
