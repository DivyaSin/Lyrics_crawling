There's colors on the streets 
Red, white and blue 
People shuffling their feet 
People sleeping in their shoes There's a warning sign on the road ahead 
There's a lot of people saying, They'd be better off dead 
Don't feel like Satan but I am to them 
So I try to forget it any way I can Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world There's a woman of the night 
Got a baby in her hand 
Near an old street light 
Down by a garbage can Now she puts the kid away and she's gone to get a hit 
She hates her life and what shes done to it 
There's one more kid who'll never go to school 
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' There's a thousand points of light for the homeless man 
There's a kinder, gentler, machine gun hand 
Got department stores, toilet paper 
Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer There's a man of the people 
Saying, Keep hope alive" 
I've got fuel to burn 
I've got roads to drive Keep on rockin in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Keep on rockin' in the free world
