Sitting in a classroom 
Looking into the sky 
What am I doing here? 
I don't know why Filling my head with history 
When none of it makes any sense to me 
Kids don't care about books or rules 
All they wanna do is burn the schools Kids don't care about books or rules 
All they wanna do is burn the schools 
Burn burn burn em down 
Burn burn burn em down 
Burn burn burn em down 
Burn burn What do you learn when you're at school? 
Only to be everybody's fool 
Teaching us the way to sign 
A wasted generation, what a crime Kids don't care about books or rules 
All they wanna do is burn the schools 
Kids don't care about books or rules 
All they wanna do is burn the schools 
Burn burn burn em down 
Burn burn burn em down 
Burn burn burn em down 
Burn burn And now from the classroom they've taken our hope 
Eleven years of learning and I can't cope 
Useless facts and figures in my mind 
But they never taught me of what I'd find Kids don't care about books or rules 
All they wanna do is burn the schools 
Kids don't care about books or rules 
All they wanna do is burn the schools 
Burn burn burn em down 
Burn burn burn em down 
Gonna burn burn burn em down 
Gonna burn burn
