You have reached 
A number and a name 
But I am gone 
And won't be back again 
If you wish 
To leave a word or two 
Here it is 
You know what to do 
Speak your mind, save yourself some time 
That's what machines are for 
But I'm not here anymore, 
I'm not here anymore Had a friend 
Who had a lady fair 
Took his own life 
Just to prove he cared 
Now her and her new man 
Yes, they're doing fine 
On everything 
He generously left behind 
The note he left said, "Save your breath" 
"Don't ask me what for" 
I'm just not here anymore Once upon a time 
As the story's always told 
The people bowed and prayed 
Around a calf of gold 
Now the weeds are taking over 
Where the garden used to grow 
Some things a man can conquer 
Some things he must let go, 
Some things he must let go I have ruled 
Over a cup and spoon 
And I conclude 
That the kingdom's doomed 
And I have schemed 
I have waited and prayed 
Had my dreams 
Attractively displayed 
So if it's your time, speak your mind 
That's what regimes are for 
But I'm not here anymore Once upon a time 
As the story's often told 
The people bowed and prayed 
Around a calf of gold 
Now the leaves are taking over 
Where the flowers used to grow I'm not here anymore
