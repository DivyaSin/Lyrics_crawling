You look in the mirror 
But you don't like what you see 
Whoever it is you think you are today 
That's not who you want to be 
The grass is looking greener 
In that field across the road 
You've lifted all that weight today 
Time has come to ease your load 
Let me ease your load [Chorus] 
Tilt your head back Angelina 
Close your eyes and drift away 
You've done everything that you can do 
To save the world today 
Don't you tell me where you're going 
Baby I don't need to know 
Just as soon as you are ready 
Angalina I'm coming with you when you go You hang up the phone 
But you don't like what you heard 
They all tell you that they love you 
But you don't believe a single word 
You're sick from all that plastic 
And that one last piece of cake 
You were feeling so elastic 
Now you feel like you could break 
But I won't let you break [Chorus] You were dancing in the kitchen 
You thought I was in bed 
With some imaginary partner 
To some slow song in your head 
And the light shone through your dress 
From the refrigerator moon 
And I dreamed I was your dancer 
And I dreamed this was the tune [Chorus]
