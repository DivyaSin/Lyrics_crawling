Baby, baby, ooh, do you wanna see me? 
Never really want to fight the feeling and I like the color of your eyes 
Baby, baby, many times the words are spoken 
Complicated but unbroken, no doubt somebody will decide Play me and strum me like a guitar 
Play me, you make me wanna, ooh, ah 
Play me, oh baby, baby keep me moving on and on and on Play me and strum me like a guitar 
Play me, you make me wanna, ooh, ah 
Play me, oh baby, baby keep me moving on and on and on Maybe you don't wanna be you 'cause time after time gets riddled 
And I know the price you've paid, turn away 
Someday everything you want and desire 
To find another way move higher 
'Cause I know the price you've paid, turn away Play me and strum me like a guitar 
Play me, you make me wanna, ooh, ah 
Play me, oh baby, baby keep me moving on and on and on Play me and strum me like a guitar 
Play me, you make me wanna, ooh, ah 
Play me, oh baby, baby keep me moving on and on and on Maybe you don't wanna be you 'cause everything we do gets mirrored 
And I know the price you've paid, get away 
Someday everything you want and desire 
Will be the thing that gets you higher 
'Cause I know the price you've paid, turn away Play me and strum me like a guitar 
Play me, you make me wanna, ooh, ah 
Play me, oh baby, baby keep me moving on and on and on Play me and strum me like a guitar 
Play me, you make me wanna, ooh, ah 
Play me, oh baby, baby keep me moving on and on and on It's a flashback baby, woo, woo, woo 
You got me seeing things I never would see before 
And now I flashback, I've hit the roof 
And now you're loving it and you're wanting it 
I'm not losing it over you boy It's a flashback baby, woo, woo, woo 
You got me seeing things I never would see before 
And now I flashback, hit the roof 
And now you're loving it and you're wanting it 
I'm not losing it over you boy Play me and strum me like a guitar 
Play me, you make me wanna, ooh, ah 
Play me, oh baby, baby keep me moving on and on and on Play me and strum me like a guitar 
Play me, you make me wanna, ooh, ah 
Play me, oh baby, baby keep me moving on and on and on
