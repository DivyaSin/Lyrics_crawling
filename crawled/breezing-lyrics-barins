Hey Tony, don't go away, please. 
You're Barins' souce, wow. Someone's trying to stick me a finger now 
But I'm not that type, no. Valpolicella, you're glorious, I feel in a roses sea. 
Tony, we're gonna miss you, bro. O dear windy Brighton and Hove. 
Take this day, go! Well, I wanna know Mexico. Do you think you're free when you do what you're supposed to? 
Do you think you're free when you don't do what you're supposed to?

Fssssiiiiuuuuuu fssiiuuuuu
