Days go by, adrift upon a rolling sky 
The miracles escape my eyes 
But I still hope Time, regret 
Is this as good as life can get? 
It's only when the spirit sets me free I cope If I seek in every corner 
(Aah) 
If I search in every doorway 
(Aah) 
When the water turns to wine, will I believe? 
(Aah) If I navigate the river 
(Aah) 
Would you take me to your island? 
(Aah) 
Sing the siren song so I can never leave 
(Aah) Long and wide 
Eternity from side to side 
Lead me through the rapids 
Guide me to the shore There's a place 
That's far beyond this time and space 
When each of us comes face to face with something more If I open up the channel 
(Aah) 
Would you send me information? 
(Aah) 
If you tune me to your station I'll receive 
(Aah) If I navigate the river 
(Aah) 
Would you take me to your island? 
(Aah) 
Sing the siren song so I can never leave 
(Aah) Ooh 
Plans can fail 
But only fail to understand 
The pyramid will turn to sand and I'll be here I will be here 
And I'll be here 
I will be here 
(Ooh)
