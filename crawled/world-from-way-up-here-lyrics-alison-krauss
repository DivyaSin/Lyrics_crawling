Wish I may. Wish I might. Upon my favorite star. Let me see, let me feel the world from where you are. Someday soon, Mr. moon I will touch your face. I'll flutter by, lady butterfly. Challenge eagles to a chase. Round and round, and up and down. No boundaries no fears. My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here. Mountain high, valley low. Where the wind is free. I will see, I will know the world the angels see. Mr. sun, I will run rings around your sky. Down below they'll finally know that this heart was made to fly. Round and round, and up and down. No boundaries no fears. My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here. Way up here, playing hide and seek in rainbows. Way up here, where I'm supposed to be. My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here. My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here.
