If the world has got you down 
And it's more than you can take 
You can't get your feet back on the ground 
All you need is that lucky break If your pockets are empty 
If the Wheel of Fortune lets you down 
You gotta hang loose 
Get ready for the Wheel to turn around If you've lost the only love you had 
And you think you've got a reason to be sad 
All your self pity and recrimination 
Are'nt gonna help to make the best of a sick situation So don't sit there crying 
If the Wheel of Fortune lets you down 
Hang loose 
Get ready for the Wheel to turn around I've had my share of bad luck 
And I never find a reason or a rhyme 
The only thing that I'm sure of 
Is that worrying is just a waste of time Sooner or later 
You're gonna wake up 
You're gonna realize 
Just because you lost the battle 
Well that ain't no need to loose the fight Well if every little thing that you planned 
Has crumbled into dust 
And you can't work it out and you can't understand 
You thought that you had the whole thing sussed Pull yourself together 
Nothing's stopping you 
You're not gagged and bound 
Hang loose 
Get ready for the Wheel to turn around Don't sit there crying 
If the Wheel of Fortune lets you down 
You gotta hang loose 
Get ready for the Wheel to turn around
