Los Angeles 
Shameful city 
I've been taken by the world below 
Los Angeles 
(No!) Here I am again 
Watching the world go by 
Right before my eyes 
All the things I should have known 
Have started to hit home But you won't 
But you won't 
But you won't let go 
But you won't 
But you won't let go Los Angeles 
Shameful city 
I've been taken by the world that's down below 
Los Angeles A flickering light casting a silhouette 
Of someone I used to know 
But that person is gone 
I gotta try to keep tellin' myself 
I got it under control But you won't 
But you won't 
But you won't let go 
But you won't 
But you won't let go Los Angeles 
Shameful city 
I've been taken by the world that's down below 
Los Angeles It's times that I remember when 
I'd do it all over again Los Angeles 
Shameful city 
I've been taken by the world that's down below Los Angeles 
Shameful city 
I've been taken by the world below 
Los Angeles 
Los Angeles 
Los Angeles
