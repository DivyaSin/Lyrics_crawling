City gents on the 8:15 am 
Waiting there in line for real love 
Everyday I'm afraid if I start to dream again 
I'll become just another broken heart And I like kissing you, dear 
But for now, better listen to my fears, yeah 
Every night I'm wishing you're here 
But for now gonna listen to my tears Let the light that you're needing light up 
When your heart could break 
Let it be your fire, yeah, yeah Let the light that you're needing light up 
When you can't escape 
Let it lead you higher, yeah, yeah City lights flicker out at 5 am 
Lying here all alone with a beating heart 
And the voice in my head goes around and around again 
And I know I should stop way before I start And I like kissing you, dear 
But for now, better listen to my fears, yeah 
Every night I'm wishing you're here 
But for now gonna listen to my tears Let the light that you're needing light up 
When your heart could break 
Let it be your fire, yeah, yeah Let the light that you're needing light up 
When you can't escape 
Let it lead you higher, yeah, yeah And always calling my name 
And how you got me to stay, stay And I'll love every last minute of it 
I know that I'll love every last minute of it, ooh, woah 
I'll love every last minute of it, ooh, yeah 
I'll love every last minute of it Let the light that you're needing light up 
When your heart could break 
Let it be your fire, yeah, yeah Let the light that you're needing light up 
When you can't escape 
Let it lead you higher, yeah, yeah Let the light that you're needing light up 
When your heart could break 
Let it be your fire, yeah, yeah Let the light that you're needing light up 
When you can't escape 
Let it lead you higher, yeah, yeah
