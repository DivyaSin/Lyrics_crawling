I was dancing when I was twelve (X2) 
I was dancing when I was ahh (X2) I danced myself right out the womb (X2) 
Is it strange to dance so soon 
I danced myself right out the womb I was dancing when I was eight (X2) 
Is it strange to dance so late (X2) Ahh I danced myself into the tomb (X2) 
Is it strange to dance so soon 
I danced myself right out the tomb Is it wrong to understand 
The fear that dwells inside a man 
What's it like to be a loon (X2) Ahh I danced myself right out of the womb (X2) 
Is it strange to dance so soon 
I dance myself right out the tomb I danced myself right out the womb (X2) 
Is it strange to dance so soon 
I danced myself right out the womb 
Ahh 
Ohh
