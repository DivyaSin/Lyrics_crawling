You know girl, all my life 
I've been looking for someone like you 
And you know true love 
Is so hard to find 
Since we've been together 
True love is forever 
So let's be lovers for life We were meant for each other ain't no doubt in my mind 
We were put here together that's the way love's designed 
So that we could be happy it's up to us to decide 
This uncredible feeling could be passing us by 
What's the point in giving up when, when we're doing fine 
We don't need to be lonely when our love is so right 
I wanna be true True lovers who care for each other (let's be two) 
Two lovers, lovers for life (I wanna be true) 
True lovers who cherish each other, lovers forever, true lovers 
For life I know what makes you happy, I know what makes you cry 
I know how to excite you make it last thru the night 
All that we been through it's been me and you 
You stood right by my side Don't you think that it would be crazy if we just let it all die 
What's the point in giving up when we're doing fine 
We don't need to be lonely when our love is so right 
I wanna be true Hook Didn't it seem like things were just right 
Didn't we have it all 
Tell me girl what went wrong, why couldn't we hold on 
Didn't feel right, didn't seem like, didn't we have a ball 
What is the point in love, if we're giving up 
Can't we just be strong, why can't we be true Hook Now we're true lovers for life 
True lovers for life 
Yes we're true lovers for life
