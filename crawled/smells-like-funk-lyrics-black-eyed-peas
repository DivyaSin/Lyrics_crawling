Yeah that's funky (funky) 
Yeah that's funky (funky) 
Yeah that's funky (funky) [Chorus] 
If it smells like funk it must be us 
Funk funk out chickies dank your stuff 
If it smells like funk it must be us 
Funk funk out chickies dank your stuff 
If it smells like funk it must be us 
Funk funk out chickies dank your stuff 
If it smells like funk it must be us 
Cause nobody's funky as us 
Cause we keep it stinky, (stinky) 
We keep it stinky ( stinky) 
We keep it stinky (stinky) stinky stinky stinky The funk phenomenon 
We funk you on and on 
There's no need to hold your nose 
Cause this funk stink like a rose 
Big booty funk toe jam funk underarm funk 
Like you headlockin' a skunk 
Reakin' like disease, athletes feet 
The stench didn't come 'til after this beat 
Smellin' like draw's, no reason no cause 
Put your hands up on the speaker 
And get smelly like ours 
You knew we was coming 
Before we entered the door 
Cause you was smellin' rhyme 
When we walkin' down the hall 
We bring the funk worse than we dog 
Stinkin' like that ladies shittin' out 
We drop enough shit to keep the toilets clogged 
To keep the people jumpin' 
Like them in full force 
The first one who smelt it, is the one who dealt it 
The Black Eyed Peas keep the scent fly like Delta 
Funky like onions, you cryin' 
(You always cryin') girl you ain't [Chorus] Yo, you funkin' with the funk family 
The non-fabricated factual faculty 
We formulatin' up in a factory 
Focusin' on a the energy, the fluid flow free 
We flawless, everything is flaw free 
We flourish and we flaunt our flavor freshly 
Can you believe we flipped the frequency 
And freakin c's they all leave frantically 
But our intentions are to be friendly 
But they frighten when we start the free stylin' frenzy 
I funk up your flat 'til your girlfriend leave 
Fillin' all anatomy 
Bringin' me flat 
Should be diggin' these rhymes fatty beats like cellulite 
Lyrics all flappy 
We bring the funk to your festivities 
If you think something stink, it must be the Peas [Chorus] Cellulite overweight stinkin' MC's 
Stench smell so strong its unsanitary 
Cause you sense me a mile away 
So junky the funk sound from Serengeti 
Meaty fat nasty like Miss Fat Booty 
Stripes getting dirty like mud fights and dirt bikes 
Turning these draw's black that's used to be white 
And shittin' on these tracks that you gonna need to wipe 
The odours so contagious that it shows up in your dreams 
Man you can pick me out like food in between 
Your two front teeth 'cause you be like in the streets 
We got beefy ass beats that we bumpin' in the street 
We salty not sweet like stink box of feet 
Sour underarm funky, we ain't washed in a week 
Now man we be reakin' every damn weekend 
We can all bounce to the funk and the season [Bridge] 
Bounce, bounce, bounce 
Yeah that's funky 
Yeah that's funky 
If you smellin' somethin' funky 
Then you know it got to be 
Nobody other than Apl 
Well, let's say funk 
Cause you know that if you 
Smell funk, then it must be us 
If you smellin' fat funk then it must be us If you smellin' somethin' funky 
Then you know it got to be 
Nobody other than Apl 
Well, let's say funk 
Cause you know that if 
It smells like funk 
Smellin' elephants, than it must be us If you smellin' somethin' funky 
Then you know it got to be 
Nobody other than Apl 
Well, let's say funk 
Cause you know that if 
It smells like funk 
Elephant shit, it must be us Elephant, it's what you want 
Cellulite, it's all right 
Elephant, it's what you want 
Cellulite, it's all right Some thing's that are fat you should not get rid of 
But there is some fat you should burn...
