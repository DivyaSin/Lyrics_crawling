Summer wishes, winter dreams 
drifting down forgotten streams 
Songs and faces, smiles and whispers 
come from far away 
to visit me this day 
Yesterday has come to tea 
sitting here across from me 
Dressed in faded flowers 
and rambling on for hours... 
And hours... 
I'd love to stay 
but I must meet today
