Bombers in the sky 
No one's asking why 
We have to duck and cover 
When the bullets start to fly When the bullets start to fly 
We have to duck and hide 
Just a game of cat and mouse Cruise missiles in production 
That are locked and set 
Annihilate the cancer 
Of the US deficit Spend a little more 
Fix it with a war 
Just a came of cat and mouse Work a 60 hour week 
Still can't pay the rent 
Tax away my wages 
To bomb another tent Bomb another tent 
How much money's spent 
Just a game of cat and mouse Treason to contest 
Where the money goes 
Building shelter, buying clothes Where does the money go 
Where does the money go 
Just a game of cat and mouse Hawks and doves Blood all over 
A gangster debt 
Tanks on CNN 
Propaganda TV set Propaganda TV set 
Propaganda TV set 
Just a game of cat and mouse Borders we've established 
To keep each other out 
Serve the purpose all too well 
To even talk about Lock each other up 
Lock each other out A child lays bleeding 
From a random shot each day 
We can't stand the pain 
So we quickly look away The time has come today 
Do not look away 
Just a game of cat and mouse Lock each other up 
Lock each other out 
Blow it all to hell 
In wars we cannot win Wars we cannot win 
Wars we cannot win 
Just a game of cat and mouse
