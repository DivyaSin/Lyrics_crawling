Fools, out of desperation 
Cursed to repeat this ancient hand 
While all their friendly gestures 
Are just a part of your grand plan No cause for celebration 
Your self-destruction lies ahead 
Weakened, frigid from the terror 
No absolution shall be fed It's time to play with fire 
Chase the visions from the past 
And never stop till the very end From the womb and through life 
We're born and bred just to die 
Can we redeem for our crimes? 
Tangled and swollen in lies OBEY! 
You are a servant to my will 
Part of the system 
Swear your loyalty to me 
Or pay the price Please can you forgive me? No, I won't let you disguise 
All the schemes that you tried to untie 
There's no way out now from the pit 
You must realize Please won't you release my soul? From the womb and through life 
We're born and bred just to die 
Can we redeem for our crimes? 
Tangled and swollen in lies It's time to play with fire 
Chase the visions from the past 
And never stop till the very end From the womb and through life 
We're born and bred just to die 
Can we redeem for our crimes? 
Tangled and swollen in lies. [x2]
