I never fail to deliver the mail 
I never fail to deliver the mail 
Tyrone the mail man, Tyrone the mail man 
Tyrone the mail man does no fail When you need to send a letter 
Or send a card or even better 
A birthday gift to show you care 
I'm the guy who gets it there I never fail to deliver the mail 
I never fail to deliver the mail 
Tyrone the mail man, Tyrone the mail man 
Tyrone the mail man does no fail Not rain or snow or gloom of light 
Mosquito bites or busted light 
No smelly smells or scary sounds 
Will keep me from my post route An envelop or package, a parcel or a box 
Or a 53 pound bag of dirt and bricks and rocks 
The size it doesn't matter, the weight I just don't care 
As long as there's a postal stamp the mailman gets it there I never fail to deliver the mail 
I never fail to deliver the mail 
Tyrone the mail man, Tyrone the mail man 
Tyrone the mail man does no fail
