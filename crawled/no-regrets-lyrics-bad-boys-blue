No regrets. No. We will have no regrets. 
As you leave. I can say Love was king! Though for only a day. 
No. No regrets. No. Let there be no regrets. 
Why explain? Why delay? Don't go away. Simply call it a day. 
Pleading moments we knew. 
I will set them apart. Every look, every sigh. 
Will be burned in my heart. 
But no tear will be shed. There'll be no one to blame. 
That it always be said. We attempted what came. Pleading moments we knew. 
I will set them apart. 
Every look, every sigh. 
Will be burned in my heart. 
But no tear will be shed. 
There'll be no one to blame. 
That it always be said. 
We attempted what came.
