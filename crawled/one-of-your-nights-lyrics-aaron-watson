I've had one of those days 
Good for nothing kind of days 
I've had hard luck, bad luck and no luck at all 
Girl I need you to be my soft place to fall So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed 
I turn it on and on 
When I turn off those bedroom lights 
Say you want me to stay 
Kiss my worries away 
Far away 
I've had one of those days 
Before nothing kind of days 
Baby I need one of your nights I want to hold you tight 
Fine wine and candle lights 
I've had red lights, bar fights 
Bright lights blinding me 
Girl I need your touch to set me free So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed 
I turn it on and on 
When I turn off those bedroom lights 
Say you want me to stay 
Kiss my worries away 
Far away 
I've had one of those days 
Before nothing kind of days 
Baby I need one of your nights Girl we got that kind of romance 
One that will dance without even touching the ground 
Remember that night on your street 
I said I'd sweep you of your feet Well forever is forever 
And I'll never gonna let you down 
Never ever gonna let you down So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed 
I turn it on and on 
When I turn off those bedroom lights 
Say you want me to stay 
Kiss my worries away 
Far away 
I've had one of those days 
Before nothing kind of days Baby I need one of your nights 
One of your nights I've had one of those days 
Good for nothing kind of days
