Darlin dont you lay yourself down 
We live in a fable 
We live in a make-believe town 
All cardboard and dust 
Its not so important Darlin there are tears in your eyes 
Youre weakened and wearied 
You feel compromised 
And though they long to carry 
My arms can only surround Dont you lay yourself down Even if the battle is won 
The war is not over 
Its only begun 
If theres one still standing 
One still standing his ground 
Dont you lay yourself down 
Dont you lay yourself down Baby, be strong for me, please Even if the battle is won 
The war is not over 
Its only begun 
If theres one still standing 
One still standing his ground Dont you lay yourself down 
Dont you lay yourself down 
Dont you lay yourself down
