Let's show this world we can be alright, 
Without it's sponsors word 
I think my mind is almost washed, 
America might change it's time line if The media fucked off 
And quit filling kids with lies. 
I just can't let this record play (play now I can't find) 
'Cause I feel like the masses are quietly lied to, And they don't discuss the way (way now I can't find) 
We treat foreign country's who oppose our policy 
And I feel (and I feel) 
So hollow Like a trapped soul inside of a desperate heart, 
And I feel (and I feel) 
So hollow 
This pledge of resistance is about to start now, I just can't sing this song with out (without my heart I feel so) 
My heart cause I'm so alive ya I'm so alive 
And I know this empire is run on (faith in an empire now) 
Fear and this greed sets apart from innocence And I feel (and I feel) 
So hollow 
Like a trapped soul inside of a desperate heart, 
And I feel (and I feel) So hollow 
This pledge of resistance is about to start NOW, 
(Now)-This-(This)-Pledge-(Pledge) of resistance now won't you 
This-(This)-Pledge-(Pledge) of resistance now won't you "We have nailed our names in the pages of history enough for today" 
Let's light this world on fire 
And watch it burn 
Let's light this world on fire
