Do you feel this 
I know you feel this 
Are you ready? 
I don't think so Somebody give me my truck 
So I can ride on the clouds 
So I can turn up the bass like Somebody pass my guitar 
So I can look like a star 
And spend this cash like What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo? 
Why you standin' on the wall? 
Music startin' everywhere 
So why don't you just move along? I see you lookin' at me 
Like I'm some kind of freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? I see you lookin' at me 
Like I got what you need 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? Now you're all in my grill 
'Cause I say what I feel 
Only rocks on what's real 
Baby bump bump 
But I can't do that with you 
Only here with my crew 
I can roll if you can 
Don't be a punk punk What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo? 
Why you standin' on the wall? 
Music startin' everywhere 
So why don't you just move along? I see you lookin' at me 
Like I'm some kind of freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? I see you lookin' at me 
Like I got what you need 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? I see you lookin' at me 
Like I'm some kind of freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? Na na na na na na na 
Uh 
Na na na na na na na na na I see you lookin' over here 
Can't you tell I'm havin' fun 
If you care like I know 
You would stop 
Starrin' at us 
And get your own space 
And do somethin' I see you lookin' at me 
Like I'm some kind of freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? I see you lookin' at me 
Like I got what you need 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? I see you lookin' at me 
Like I'm some kind of freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? Fuck 
Do somethin' 
Ow 
Why don't you do somethin'?
