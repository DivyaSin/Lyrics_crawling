Take a trip 
And trip inside your mind from where you are 
Make a wish 
And wish upon a star from near or far I keep hopin' for a dream 
I keep searchin' for the mircale in you 
You can feel your destiny 
If you hold on tight the dream will carry you Trippin' through your mind yeah 
Trippin' through your mind yeah 
Your mind 
In your mind Close your eyes 
And let your spirit fly from where you are 
Take the time 
To purify your mind from where you are I keep hopin' for a dream 
I keep searchin' for the miracle in you 
You can feel the destiny 
If you hold on tight the dream will carry you Trippin' through your mind yeah 
Trippin' through your mind yeah 
Your mind Through your mind 
Through your mind 
Through your mind...
