Oh, freedom, oh, freedom 
Oh, freedom over me 
And before I'd be a slave 
I'd be buried in my grave 
And go home to my Lord and be free No more weepin', no more weepin' 
No more weepin' over me 
And before I'd be a slave 
I'd be buried in my grave 
And go home to my Lord and be free No more worry, no more worry 
No more worry over me 
And before I'd be a slave 
I'd be buried in my grave 
And go home to my Lord and be free Oh, freedom, oh, freedom 
Oh, freedom over me 
And before I'd be a slave 
I'd be buried in my grave 
And go home to my Lord and be free
