When the day, when the day falls to the light 
At the end, oh the end of my time 
I call to the dark take the bones off my back 
And I chant to the black you were my lady divine 'Cause my children are in hiding 
Mortor and pestle they grind Those songs whistled through white teeth do scuff the days 
With songs for children to sing 
Those songs whistled through white teeth do scuff the days 
With songs for children to sing When the chairs are tucked into the fading song 
And the silver of their pours has grown long 
Oh, they call to the dark, take the bones off my back 
And they chant to the black you were my lady divine 
And they bloat like a bitter wine in their bellies 'Cause the bones have been removed 
From their hunched over backs 
And their children are all grown now 
Mortor and pestle they grind Those songs whistled through white teeth still scuff the days 
With songs for children to sing 
Those songs whistled through white teeth still scuff the days 
With songs for children to sing 
Those songs for children to sing
