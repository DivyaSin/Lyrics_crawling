Fuck is up? What's happening? 
Yo, tell you a fucking story 
Tell you a fucking story Here we go, huh! Once upon a time in a city called Shit 
Lived a man named "What The Fuck?!?!?" He used to clown around with his dick in the ground 
And one day his dick got stuck He was kicking and screaming and yelling 
and cussing and asking everybody for help Then he ran into a man named "Fuck You Too" 
And he told 'em he should help himself He was so frustrated with his dick getting? 
And he had no one to call Then he gained control climbed out the hole 
Motherfucker you better save his balls Now everytime I think about "What The Fuck!?!?!" 
I think about you And how he changed and took all the pain 
When he ran into "Fuck You Too" Hey yo peel the fuck out 
Pop the clock, weave through the traffic, backwards once 
Straight from the Wasteland, modern luck 
Tainted, baked, and ate in hot sun 
It ain't the same when I murk the surf 
In above the whimp truck to? swervin 
We play the game like bitch you? 
And Ace in a hole like. You talk nervous! 
My mind is filled with a thousand kills 
But no? MC's can face this skills 
Pop the peel, bug the fuck out, brake the fuck out when I grab that steel 
The neutrilizer, the equilizer, meet the heat? 
Burn your high riser 
Roof on fire and so is the first floor 
Keep sticking you, until it don't hurt no more I've seen modern thugs with a virtual headset 
Programmed modern but those who ain't dead yet 
And yet vets turn into? 
Sick of how murdering men became into? set Nuts and bolts, programming gears 
And shots to targets, head gets clear 
Try to play brave from a bottle of bear 
But you can't play hero if you're cape say's "Fear" Fuck you too! 
Man, fuck you too! 
Fuck you too! 
Fuck you're all crew! Welcome to the circus of stars 
Sit down! Mind reach collapse rat, fractured clown! 
I was? with a stop of four year old recording 
And smiling with? for a boy who was born pour through mourning 
In the morning, escape my glory 
The citys on fire but I can't stop warming 
Sick with the vision of my? burning 
Stick with what I mention and I'll splif you lip 
Warning! They wanna jump into the battle and earn their respect 
Well get the fuck up! Let me cash this check 
I'm still on deck with a mouth fill of poison 
Spitting at you and your crew when your? in 
Raining parades leave stains on a blade 
I came with the raid and I'm leaking with your head 
I walk home alone from the terror dome 
FULL! Because hungry wolves need to be fit Yo, I punch strokes and I crunch the clock 
THEREs sharks in the moat and? in the? 
WHERE cops and kids bust shots not to live 
Bitch, shut your ball park and talk to the fist Marksmanship and the parks don't slip 
You marks get lit up and hit him so quick 
It's dark in the pit you betta watch what you do 
Fuck you motherfuckers! Fuck you too! Once upon a time in a city called shit 
Lived a man named "What The Fuck?!?!?" He used to clown around with his dick in the ground 
And one day his dick got stuck He was kicking and screaming and yelling and cussing and asking everybody 
for help Then he ran into a man named "Fuck You Too" 
And he told 'em he should help himself He was so frustrated with his dick being? 
And he had no one to call Then he gained control climbed out the hole 
Motherfucker you better save his balls Now everytime I think about "What The Fuck!?!?!" 
I think about you And how he changed and took all the pain 
When he ran into "Fuck You Too"
