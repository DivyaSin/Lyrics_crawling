Looking back on my life 
It doesn't seem to be very clear 
When I've lost my fear 
I've lived my life 
I've taken my chances 
Staring down my reflection 
Sometimes, I feel like I've lost my mind 
It's a waste of time 
I'm asking you 
but I never get an answer 
I'm falling in 
I'm falling out 
I'm walking the straight and narrow. 
I'm falling in 
and I'm falling right out 
I'm breaking down again 
CHORUS 
I never thought you'd hear me say: 
"I'm better now, so I don't need your sympathy" 
So taking this life day by day 
I'll be indifferent 
Indifferent 
I never thought you'de hear me say: 
"I'm better now, no, I'm nobody's tragedy" 
I'm taking this life day by day 
to be indifferent 
I'm indifferent 
As I turn to look to the future 
I see my life in a different way 
It's a brand new day 
A stretch of road 
Uscathed I'm taking 
The only thing on my mind 
Is leaving this place so far behind 
'Cause it's my time 
I'll find a better way 
To keep myself from breaking 
I'm falling in 
I'm falling out 
I'm walking the straight and narrow. 
I'm falling in 
and I'm falling right out 
I'm breaking down again 
CHORUS 
I never thought you'd hear me say: 
"I'm better now, so I don't need your sympathy" 
So taking this life day by day 
I'll be indifferent 
Indifferent 
I never thought you'de hear me say: 
"I'm better now, no, I'm nobody's tragedy" 
I'm taking this life day by day 
to be indifferent 
I'm indifferent 
INSTRUMENTAL 
CHORUS 
I never thought you'd hear me say: 
"I'm better now, so I don't need your sympathy" 
So taking this life day by day 
I'll be indifferent 
Indifferent 
I never thought you'de hear me say: 
"I'm better now, no, I'm nobody's tragedy" 
I'm taking this life day by day 
to be indifferent 
I'm indifferent 
I'M! Indifferent! 
Oh-OHOH! 
I'M! Indifferent!
