Taking your time, I don't mind 
I'll wait for you to paint your eyes 
Just to comfort you every time you get high or low 
Everyone knows that I don't wanna feel like this at all 
I still let it be, and watch them fools fall away Whoa oh oh oh, I know first of all 
And maybe worst of all 
I'm a fool whoa baby no 
Whoa oh oh oh, things still haven't changed since years before 
And I don't want to be here anymore 
Not with you, no baby not with you Wasting my time and now I 
Try to keep it close and tight 
Just to steal those wandering eyes 
All I know wherever we go 
People always stop to tell me "well you should have known" 
So I see that fool fall away Whoa oh oh oh, I know first of all 
And maybe worst of all 
I'm a fool whoa baby no 
Whoa oh oh oh, things still haven't changed since years before 
And I don't want to be here anymore 
Not with you, oh never with you
