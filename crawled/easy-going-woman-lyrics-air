Don't let the routine kill our life 
Do you still want to be by my side 
Remember the time we were both right 
Like on the photos that you hide Alright, alright, alright, alright 
Just be an easy going woman 
Alright 
Easy going woman I tried so hard to please you 
That i forgot my own happiness - happiness 
Don't play that game like you used to do 
Do you believe what you say - what you say Alright, alright, alright, alright 
Just be an easy going woman 
Alright 
Easy going woman I still believe that people can change 
Please let me know if you want me to 
How many years do we have to wait 
For understanding each other - each other Alright, alright, alright, alright 
Just be an easy going woman 
Alright 
Easy going woman Alright, alright, alright, alright 
Just be an easy going woman 
Alright 
Easy going woman
