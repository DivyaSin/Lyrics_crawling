Sometimes the sun goes behind the clouds 
You forget the warmth that could be found 
Born slippy, born slippy 
If you hear a knock at the door at midnight 
It has come to stay and steal the light 
Born slippy, born slippy And the years gone by 
And the maids been gone 
She remembered to leave the keys at home 
There are more of us than there are of them 
Every time you stop, I begin Arms were falling off as heads rolled away 
What did they want, why won't they say? 
Born slippy, born slippy What happened, I was so excited 
What happened, I was so excited 
What happened, I was so excited 
What happened, I was so excited 
What happened, I was so excited 
What happened, I was so excited 
What happened, I was so excited 
What happened? And the years gone by 
And the maids been gone 
She remembered to leave the keys at home 
There are more of us than there are of them 
Every time you stop, I begin Is the moment gone? 
The party we begun 
All the things we said 
Taking back yesterday All my needs took you down 
Like you were a belief 
Don't tell me to stop 
Cause you'll notice soon 
You'll notice soon Is the moment gone? 
The party we begun 
All the things we said 
Taking back all the dead You know, you know, you know 
You know, you know, you know 
You know, you know, you know 
You know, you know, you know 
You know, you know, you know 
You know, you know, you know
