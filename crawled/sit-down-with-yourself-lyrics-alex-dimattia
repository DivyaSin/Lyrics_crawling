Let it sink in 
She doesn't care about your soul 
And so you find yourself alone 
In a crowded room of friends 
Sometimes it don't make sense 
Those words still echo in your head 
When Ray said Sit down with yourself 
Or anyone or whatever 
Cause it doesn't have to be clever this time 
Gather up your thoughts 
And just boil 'em down for the better 
And see what you have left inside, inside So let it sink in 
She doesn't care about your song 
And so you find yourself alone 
With a guitar in your hands 
It all starts making sense 
And you can almost feel the end 
When you begin To sit down with yourself 
Or anyone or whatever 
Cause it doesn't have to be clever this time 
Gather up your thoughts 
And just boil 'em down for the better 
And see what you have left inside, inside Come on 
Reach in deep, and aim up high 
Build your Castle in the sky 
You know the 
Life you seek, and the love you find 
Will fit together when it's right So let it sink in 
Now you've all but moved along 
And her regrets will come on strong 
When she rings your bell again 
Don't you let her in 
And you may find you'll open up to 
Someone new When you sit down with yourself 
Or anyone or whatever 
Cause it doesn't have to be clever this time 
Gather up your thoughts 
And just boil 'em down for the better 
And see what you have left 
see what you have left 
see what you have left inside 
inside, inside, inside
