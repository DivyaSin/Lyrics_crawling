If the Hollywood sign catches on fire baby, 
If the Hudson river drowns the Liberty Lady, 
If the London Bridge finally did fall, 
If they take every stone off the Great China Wall If the countdown to the end had just begun 
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 thing I'd wanna tell you before we're done 
Thank you for being so beautiful 
For making business as usual 
So beautiful Farewell New York City, farewell Bethlehem 
So long Willy Shakespeare, so long Mary Ann 
Forget the trip to Venus, forget the Internet 
Forget baby Jesus, forget all of it If the countdown to the end had just begun 
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 thing I'd wanna tell you before we're done 
Thank you for being so beautiful 
For making business as usual 
So beautiful I love you, I love you - these are not just words 
I love you, I love you - it's borderline absurd 
And I already know how I want the end to go 
I wanna close the show like Juliet and Romeo 
I wanna dim the light and watch this whole thing explode Oh beautiful 
Thank you for being so beautiful 
And I love you, I love you, I love you, 
I love you, I love you, I love you, 
I love you, I love you, I love you, 
I love you, I love you, I love you, 
If the Hollywood sign catches on fire baby, 
If the Hudson river drowns the Liberty Lady, 
I love you, I love you, I love you, 
I love you, I love you, I love you
