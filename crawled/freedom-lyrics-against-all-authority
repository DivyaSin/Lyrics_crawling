Everyday I listened to you and nothing's ever good enough 
You're always complaining about something you act so goddamn tough 
But all you ever do is let someone do your thinking for you 
And you have no respect for my opinion 
Well at least I think for myself I'm not brainwashed 
To think like people that rule I'm not a pool and I'll rise I won't compromise 
And I'll never give up, I won't walk walk walk away 
There won't be another day when I can say hey hey hey, freedom 
You talk to me I see your lips move But the words that come out aren't yours they're someone else's 
You dangle from their strings beneath the wings 
Of the eagle you push but I'll never fall I'm not the only one whose willing to stand up 
We've had enough your laws just benefit you 
We watch you get richer as we get sicker 
And we'll rise with battle cries and we'll never give up
