Chorus: I'm still livin' with your ex-girlfriend 
We're as happy as we could be 
I get so kinky with your ex-girlfriend 
You wouldn't believe the good things she does to me Don't get mad about it 
It's nothin' to do with you 
There's no vengeance here, there's no spite 
It's nothin' about the way you messed my life around 
The girl just makes me feel all right And I love sleepin' with your ex-girlfriend 
We're as happy as we could be 
I get so horny for your ex-girlfriend 
You wouldn't believe the good things she does to me 
Your ex-girlfriend Let's be gentlemen, let's be cool about it 
There's no reason to get mad at me 
Call us up and come have dinner with us 
One big happy family Chorus Your ex-girlfriend And I been lookin' at your new girlfriend 
She would look pretty nice with me 
But I'm so happy with your ex-girlfriend 
You wouldn't believe the good things she does to me 
Your ex-girlfriend Chorus Your ex-girlfriend And I'm still livin' with your ex-girlfriend 
I'm still livin' with your ex-girlfriend 
Your ex-girlfriend
