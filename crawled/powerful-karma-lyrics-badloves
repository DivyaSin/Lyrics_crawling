So, you've finally found the time 
Making molehills out of mountains 
What's yours is surely mine 
Let's not argue over nothing 
It's all in your mind 
Powerful karma 
Has never failed 
It's never been tried 
Powerful karma 
It's going to take over peace in my mind 
So, a life is what you find 
You find forgiveness somewhere 
It's a lonely, lonely ride 
By the time you find a reason 
You're under the ground (way down) 
Powerful karma 
Has never failed 
It's never been tried 
Powerful karma 
It's going to take over peace in my mind 
And now the guns been fired 
And it's time to be a hero (it's all in your mind) 
Tell me, where did all the fear go? (it's all in your mind) 
Will you trade your superstition 
For a hole in the ground? 
Powerful karma 
Has never failed 
It's never been tried 
Powerful karma 
It's going to take over peace in my mind
