Countdown to takeoff 
engine roar the night sky 
and in your favorite chair 
you are hanging from a thread i'll be your war 
i'll be your astronaut 
and in your favorite chair 
i am the dog ear on your page countdown to impact 
engine hold the night still 
and in the pilots chair 
i am dying to feel something
