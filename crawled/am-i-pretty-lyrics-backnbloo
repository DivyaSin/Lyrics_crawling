I've been waiting all my life for someone like you 
Do you like me 
Am I pretty You've got all the things I'm looking for, you're perfect 
Do you see me 
Am I pretty Chorus 
And I've been watching you for quite a while 
I like your smile 
Your last name doesn't sound so bad with mine 
Shivers down my spine She's been waiting all her life for someone like you 
Soft and seething 
Is she pretty You've got all the things she's looking for, you're perfect 
Barely breathing 
Is she pretty Chorus 
And I've been watching you for quite a while 
I like your smile 
Your last name doesn't sound so bad with mine 
Shivers down my spine Just take the brick and throw it in the hive 
I'm by your side 
The shovel buries, makes another space 
Time to replace Bridge 
Who's that you were kissing in the garden 
Who's that you were kissing in the park, it was after dark 
All the glass has finally shattered 
A melted heart I've been waiting all my life for someone like you 
Do you like me 
Am I pretty
