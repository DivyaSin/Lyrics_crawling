Well, she walked up to me and she asked me 
if I wanted to dance 
she looked kind of nice and so I said 
I might take a chance 
when we danced she hold me tight 
and wne I walked her home that night 
all the stars were shining bright and then she 
kissed me 
Each time I saw her I couln't wait 
to see her again 
I wanted to let her know that she was 
more than a friend 
I didn't know just what to do, so I whispered "I love you" 
she said that she loved me too and then she fucked me. 
She kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed 
kissed, kissed before 
she kissed me in a way that I want to be kissed 
forver more 
I knew that she was mine, so I gave her all the love that I had 
and one day she took to meet her mum and her dad 
Then I asked her to be my bride and always be right by my side 
she felt so happy, she almosed cried and then she kissed me 
Then I asked her to be my bride and always be right by my side 
she felt so happy, she almosed cried and then she kissed me 
and then she fucked me, and then she kissed me.
