This girl is smooth as day old whiskey 
as tough as day old bread 
a 2 ton tire tread 
Someday I know that she'll be leaving 
And I'll sit here believing 
I'll see those eyes again 
But I'm gonna go insane right now if I dont talk to her 
If she's not coming back this time I swear She's my heroine 
My heiroine 
She's my heroine Got high on the 50 yard line 
Cops showed up and got fined 
They chased us round the bend 
We sat on the hill at nighttime 
Just looking at the sky line 
Just talking to the wind
