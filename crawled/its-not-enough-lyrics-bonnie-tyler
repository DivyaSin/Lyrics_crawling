When I wake up, in the morning 
And I turn around and you're not there 
Oh it hurts to know you're still so far away 
Though I know deep inside you still care 
And I want you, ooh, really want you 
Oh, anyway and anyhow 
I've waited such a long time for your sweet love 
And I need you back home with me now 
'cause it's not enough to say that you love me 
And it's not enough to say that you care 
And it's not enough when you say that you need me 
If I wake up and still you're not there 
And it's not enough to say that you love me 
It's not enough to say that you care 
And it's not enough when you say that you need me 
If I wake up and still you're not there 
Oh do you care? 
Oh, please believe me, it's not easy 
When you're so many miles from home 
Oh I need you here to hold and comfort me 
I'm so tired of being alone 
'cause it's not enough to say that you love me 
And it's not enough to say that you care 
And it's not enough when you	say that you need me 
If I wake up and still you're not there 
You gotta try to understand 
That a woman like me just needs a man to love 
(oh, yes she does) 
I know you love me loud and clear but if you're not here 
It's not enough, you know... 
It's not enough to say that you love me 
And it's not enough to say that you care 
And it's not enough to say that you need me 
If I wake up and still you're not there 
It's not enough to say that you love me 
It's not enough to say that you care 
And it's not enough when you say that you need me 
If I wake up and still you're not there 
If I wake up and still you're not there, oh 
Oh no, no, no, it's not enough 
Oh no, no, no, it's not enough
