I can see you ahead of me 
But I'm not always forward thinkin' 
I tell you what you want to hear 
It depends on what I've been drinkin' Cause everything I do or say 
Makes it hard for you to stay 
We both know what it is Now-a-days we talk too much 
Like your forgetting all the good shit 
You decide what's wrong with me 
I always used to let you say But now I like to think out loud 
Your runnin' with some different crowd 
We both know what it is I don't know you anymore 
Supposed to be the man 
That I live my life by 
And your attitude become a bore 
And I'm so tired I cant even cry Mr Ultra sensitive 
I'll never let myself forget you 
Messed each other up you know 
So I'm sorry if I upset you Tomorrow is another day 
So I'll call you cause that's OK We both know what it is I don't know you anymore 
Supposed to be the man 
That I live my life by 
And you're attitude become a bore 
And I'm so tired 
I can't even cry Relationship doesn't remain 
We resonate on different flames 
I could cut you down again 
If you were like all other men 
If you were like all other men 
I know that I could shut you down again 
But my friend, but my friend I don't know you anymore 
Supposed to be the man 
That I live my life by 
And your attitude become a bore 
And I'm so tired I cant even cry I don't know you anymore 
Supposed to be the man 
That I live my life by 
And your attitude become a bore 
And I'm so tired I can't even cry
