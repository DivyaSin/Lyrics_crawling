I object to this line of questioning 
There is something festering behind your eyes 
Beneath your words misplaced 
And in my face 
You are not just telling me what you think 
But swinging some rusty axe that has been weighing you down 
Speaks volumes about your inability to understand 
This scene, this struggle, that has existed so long before 
You and will continue happily without you 
You remain so unclear 
You have no idea 
What this music's about or 
Why we stand here before you always 
Striving, always melting 
Bleeding crying into these instruments 
And for what 
Not you 
This has nothing repeat nothing 
To do with your ignorant arrogant ass 
Or some preset image of some preset scene 
Of some set of rules 
As safe and as boring as a ride on a carousel 
You have come to the wrong tree to bark 
And your wishes they fall on deaf ears 
And our wheels roll on 
And while you sit at home and wish that you could 
Stay the same 
What have you ever risked, pulled your heart out for 
The world to judge, created something out of nothing 
Punched holes in what used to be 
Set fire to what is supposed to be 
Then shut your mouth about what you want this to be 
We don't care
