You never wanted to be able 
you never wanted to be labeled 
you always wanted something stable 
damn them and their eyes 
I can be pride whenever they want 
blakes broken leg 
an unlucky stunt just like Paul says 
left of the dial they stare at the sun 
and quickly lose sight 
I never wanted to be aimless 
I never wanted to be shameless 
and always I was acrophobic 
to wuthering heights 
but from the first frame 
it can be spliced that sound that you make 
the day that you break perfect 
from now on anyone can see narrow 
bandwidth and low fidelity but 
I know it always short lived success 
I never liked it to begin with 
I never wanted to be in it 
I never wanted to be in it 
here's to everytime 
I can pride whenever you want 
the failure to be the dead 
industry nowhere to rise nowhere to fall 
I don't wanna be some unlucky stuntman 
I don't wanna be so unlucky 
I always wanted to be off the list 
I always wanted to be off it 
here's to your laugh your lies
