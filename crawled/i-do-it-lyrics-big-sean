Okay I'm westside, westside till I'm riding underneath them tulips 
You bordo like Enrique, I'm toupee, I'm three-pee 
I'm looking like I'ma sweepstakes 
But I treat ya girl like a cheap skate 
Cause I need a crib, a big estate 
I need a boat and that need a lake 
I need some salmon, that need a plate 
That need a chef so I feed my safe 
My crew is who I'd be widdy-be-wid-it

The most zaniest, insaniant 
Pulling up in Merced-iance 
Rolling up like I'm Damian 
I love girls that Arabian, Albanian, Caucasian 
I ride around gettin' cranium 'cause my dick is hard as titanium

And party hard like I'm finna do it big
