My heart just sank the moment I, saw you, 
You're the image of a girl, that I used to know. 
Don't be alarmed if it seems hard, for me to explain, 
But every detail of your face, makes me recall the name. 
Hmm I'm treading water, 
I keep, treading water! Maybe it's another chance, 
To mug myself again! 
Maybe it's another chance, 
I'm sure I'll mess things up in the same way 
Maybe it's another chance, 
To mug myself again Can you forgive the things I do, 
That I can't amend? 
Not the way I yearn for her, 
I hope you can't pretend 
Girl you're a fire and you'll find, 
That I want to get burnt, 
No matter what you can teach me, 
I'm sure I'll never learn. 
Hmmm treading water, 
I keep, treading water Maybe it's another chance, 
To mug myself again 
Maybe it's another chance, 
I'm sure I'll mess things up in the same way 
Maybe it's another chance, 
To mug myself again It's my concentration, 
Seems spread too thin, 
And when you speak, my eyes glaze over 
I'm sorry girl, it's not you it's her And you're another chance, 
To mug myself again 
Baby you're another chance, 
I'm sure I'll mess things up in the same way 
Baby it's another chance 
Baby it's another chance 
To mug myself again, 
Baby you're another chance, 
I'm sure I'll mess things up in the same way. 
Baby It's another chance, 
To mug myself again.
