And it's cold outside 
It's cold but you won't let me 
in your heart 
Your heart is broken inside 
It's broken but you won't let me make it alright again Trying to ignore the dark surrounding me 
Failing's another way to keep me here 
Trying to remember everything 
Prevent me from falling down Will you stop to rise 
Don't stop here 
Break these habits of your mind 
Your mind prevents the fall 
Prepares you just to go ahead 
You'll get it all back Trying to ignore the dark surrounding me 
Failing's another way to keep me here 
Trying to remember everything 
Prevent me from falling, falling down again
