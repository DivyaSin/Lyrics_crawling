Ohhhh, 
Where did I go wrong, 
Ohhh, 
Ohhhhh, 
Girl when you went away, 
You took a part of me and, 
You told me not to wait, 
You said you want to be free, 
But I thought we'd be together, 
Never thought that I'd be here alone, 
I used to think you would never, 
You'd never leave our happy home. I thought that we were fine, 
And everything was cool. 
But maybe I was blind, 
Maybe I was being the fool, 
Cause I didn't see this comin', 
Didn't know that you would walk away, 
So I'm searching for the answers, 
And maybe you can just tell me Where did I go wrong? 
And how can I make it right? 
Tell me where did I go wrong? 
You know I want to make it right, 
And make you come back it me. Although we're miles apart, 
I'm still here missing you and, 
You know you're in my heart, 
You know I'm wanting you, 
And I can still remember, 
All the joy that you have brought to me 
And I thought we'd stay together, 
Now I'm here just wondering, Where did I go wrong? 
And how can I make it right? 
Tell me where did I go wrong? 
You know I want to make it right, 
And make you come back to me. You know you'll always be there in my heart, 
I still think about you everyday (Think about you everyday) 
I never thought that we'd be apart, 
Didn't realize I pushed you away. 
Now I think I would do anything, 
Just to have you again, 
And I keep wondering , wondering.. Where did I go wrong? 
And how can I make it right? 
Tell me where did I go wrong? 
You know I want to make it right, 
And make you come back to me
