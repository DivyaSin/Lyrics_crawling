Well, honeybuns 
It's been fun 
But I gotta run Oh, sweetlips 
Stay a little while longer won't you 
No, it's very late baby 
I really got to go But look at the weather 
You'll catch cold out there 
And I would never forgive myself 
Oh you Come on 
Just one more night cap 
No I shouldn't 
Come on No well 
I really can't stay 
But baby it's cold outside 
I got to go away 
But baby it's cold outside This evening has been 
And hoping that you drop in 
So very nice 
I'll hold your hands 
There just like ice My mother will start to worry 
Beautiful what's your hurry 
And father will be pacing the floor 
Listen to the fireplace roar So really I better scurry 
Beautiful please don't go 
Well maybe, just a half drink more 
Put some records on while I pour The neighbors might think 
But baby it's bad out there 
Say, what's in this drink 
No cabs to be had out there I wish I knew how 
Your eyes are like stars tonight 
To break this spell 
I'll take your hat 
Your hair looks swell I oughta say, No, no, no sir 
Mind if I move in closer 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
What's the sense of hurting my pride I really can't stay 
Baby don't hold on 
Ah, but it's cold outside Well I must say 
This couch is very comfortable 
It's not a couch, puddin' pop 
It's a love seat Oh, how you talk? 
Oh Barry, I simply must go But baby it's cold outside 
The answer is, No 
But baby it's cold outside 
The welcome has been 
How lucky that you dropped in So nice and warm 
Look out the window 
At that storm My sister will be suspicious 
Gosh your lips look good delicious 
My brother will be there at the door 
Like waves upon a tropical storm 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
Gosh your lips are delicious Well maybe just a cigarrette more 
Never said your blues will be for 
I've got to get home 
But baby you'll freeze out there Say darling can you lend me your comb 
It's up to your knees out there 
You really been grand 
I thrill when you touch my hand But don't you see 
How can you do this thing to me 
There's bound to be talk tomorrow 
Think of my life long sorrow At least there will be plenty implied 
If you caught pneumonia and died 
I really can't stay 
Get over that hold out 
Ah, but it's cold outside Well I don't know 
I don't got to go home 
Hey look it's starting to snow 
Oh you arranged that didn't you? See now you gotta stay 
Well, I guess I won't be able to find a cab 
Yeah, no cabs 
And the buses they never run 
They'll never run in snow like this Let me take your coat 
Well, tomorrow is Sunday isn't it? 
And I don't have to go to work 
See isn't that better And who knows how long it will keep snowing 
It can snow for a long time, Kate 
What are you doing? 
Well now, yeah
