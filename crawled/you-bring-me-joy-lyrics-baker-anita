You brimg me joy 
When I'm down 
Oh, so much joy 
When I lose my way your love comes smiling on me 
I saw your face 
And them I knew 
We would be friends 
I was so afraid but your arms, they'd say `come to me' 
So I'd say to you 
"Can we talk for a while?" 
You'd say "alright" 
When you love me, I smile 
I feel you hands and you feel mine 
You bring me joy 
You bring me joy 
Don't go too far away 
If I can't see your face, I will remember that smile 
But can this be right 
Or should we be friends 
I get lonely sometimes and I'm mixed up again 
'Cause you're the finest thing I've seen in all my life 
You bring me joy 
My joy, my joy 
I believe this is gonna be what you want it to be 
I just love you, I just love you, can`t you see 
That you're the best I've seen in all my life 
You bring me joy 
My joy . . . you're my joy 
My joy . . . my, my joy 
Thank you, baby, thank you, baby 
I just love you, baby 
When I lose my way, your love comes smiling on me
