I'm tired of thinking about this morning 
May as well just dream of what tomorrow brings If this is your last photograph 
Just smile, stand tall, and you could have it all 
Color your soul, to make it whole 
And use this day, what of it remains 
If it's your reality, if this is your reality 
Let it be Ten feet tall, but feeling small 
You raise those plans 
Take a hold with your hands 
This photograph could be your last 
A final prize, a moment in time 
If it's your reality, if this if something you can see I'm tired of thinking about this morning 
May as well just dream of what tomorrow brings Ascend your soul, reach your goal 
Blue-eyed one, hope against hope 
Taking that fall, unwrapped it all 
Bring it back, like the blood of the triad If it's this reality, if this is all just let it be I'm tired of thinking about this morning 
May as well just dream of what tomorrow brings I'm tired of thinking about this morning 
May as well just dream of what tomorrow brings Just when you think that you could never find it 
Just then you realize your future is all in your hands One day we'll look at this and laugh about it 
Until then just realize the future is all in our hands I'm tired of thinking about this morning 
May as well just dream of what tomorrow brings
