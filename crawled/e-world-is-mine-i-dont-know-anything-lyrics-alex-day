My strings are broken and my heart is out of tune 
I wanted quiet but all I see is you 
I don't know anything I stumbled forward and you let me walk away 
We both know I'll be running back to you someday 
I don't know anything The earth is spinning but my feet are standing still 
And the wind is biting but I'm fighting off the chill 
I don't know anything So let's pretend for just one minute 
The world, the world, the world, the world 
The world is mine but you're not there 
The world, the world, the world, the world 
The world is mine but you're not there They say time's a healer but my watch can't tell the time 
The left hand's stuck six months ago and I can't find the right 
I don't know anything The pen is stronger than any sharpened sword 
But everything I write to you makes me feel like a fool 
I don't know anything The earth is spinning but my feet are standing still 
And the wind is biting but I'm fighting off the chill 
I don't know anything So let's pretend for just one minute 
The world, the world, the world, the world 
The world is mine but you're not there 
The world, the world, the world, the world 
The world is mine but you're not there I feel like I can do anything 
Why don't you understand 
I feel like I can do anything 
Why don't you understand Why don't you see what I could be 
Why don't you see what I could be 
Why don't you see what I could be 
Why don't you see what I could be So let's pretend for just one minute 
The world, the world, the world, the world 
The world is mine but you're not there 
The world, the world, the world, the world 
The world is mine but you're not there Why can't you see 
I'd trade in the world for you
