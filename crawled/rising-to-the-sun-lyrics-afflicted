Guide me... 
hrafn blots godi... 
guide me... 
hratn ass... 
Odhinn 
Odhinn... 
Odhinn, hear me... 
hrafnass, hear me... 
lend me, Sleipner 
so I cantride 
between the worlds tonight I sit on my skin rug under the mesmerizing moon 
the show falls but I do no freeze 
this night is calm and the sky is clear 
and the shadows of my life dance on the trees Spirit, spirit dance with me 
dance with me tonight 
spirit, spirit dance with me 
as he flames we rise and fly The drum is my horse and it rides through the woods 
we swim on the starsea as one 
I close my eyes when I hear the wolves 
the howls of Geri and Freki, guide me! Wolf, wolf howl with me 
howl with me tonight 
wolf, wolf howl with me 
guide me now! The rhythms of the beating of my drum fades away 
and I see that the wolves stand awaiting for me 
my naked feel leave no trace in the snow 
as I run through the woods with the wolves With my drum I ride the wind 
and travel in what you call dreams 
I let my spirit rise and fly 
to nine worlds invisible to our eyes My journey has gone beneath the worlds 
I praise Odin for lending me sleipner 
clenching my fists, I scream to the sky 
my dreamquest has begun! A pagan soul born a thousand years too late 
I have the spirit of the old 
and my path is set by fate 
One of the faithful few I am one of the last 
who worship pagan gods and claims 
the heritage of our pagan father's past
