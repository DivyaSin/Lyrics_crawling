Abandoned broken and bleeding 
A feast for their eyes a spectacle 
A murder of the forsaken 
A scapegoat for their suffering 
Burn me alive x2 
I feel the hatred behind their eyes 
Burn me alive 
In eager circles to watch me die 
Burn me 
As Silence falls through the masses 
The cruelest display of sacrifice 
A savior for the abandoned 
A scapegoat for their suffering 
Burn me alive x2 
I feel the hatred behind their eyes 
Burn me alive 
In eager circles to watch me die 
Burn Me 
Abandoned broken and bleeding 
A feast for their eyes a spectacle 
A murder of the forsaken 
A scapegoat for their suffering 
Burn Me Alive x3 
BURN ME
