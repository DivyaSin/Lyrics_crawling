Cranky, cranky, make a pest a pet 
It stops annoying me 
Mosquito burst from, too much my exotic red 
A good year, but rotten grapes 
To find me one escape 
Cranky, cranky, cranky, cranky 
I licked the ocean, they bury me in a tree 
Branch on pull outside, beat by a baseball bat 
Beat by a baseball bat, beat by a baseball bat 
Beat by a baseball bat, beat by a baseball bat 
Beat by a baseball bat, ohhhh, yeah 
Make a pest a pet, make a pest a pet 
Make a pest a pet, pest a pet 
Make a pest a pet, make a pest a pet 
Make a pest a pet, make a pest a pet, oh oh ohh, yeah 
Beat by a baseball bat, beat by a baseball bat 
Beat by a baseball bat, beat by a bat
