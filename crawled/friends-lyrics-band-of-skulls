All my life I've been searching for something 
Something I can put my finger on 
Baby, I've been living for the weekend 
Baby, I've been living for this cyber soul Every Friday just about midnight 
All my problems seem to disappear 
Everyone that I miss when I'm distant 
Everybody's here I need love 'cause only love is true 
I need every waking hour with you 
And my friends 'cause they're so beautiful 
Yeah, my friends they are so beautiful 
They're my friends All my life I've been wasting, wasting 
Wasting all my money, all my time 
All the time that I'm waiting, waiting 
Waiting for the moment you are mine The song about yeah, I'm thinking, thinking 
Thinking all the things that I've done wrong 
All the time yeah, I was forgetting 
You were mine all along I need love 'cause only love is true 
I need every waking hour with you 
And my friends 'cause they're so beautiful 
Yeah, my friends they are so beautiful I need love 'cause only love is true 
I need every waking hour with you 
And my friends 'cause they're so beautiful 
Yeah, my friends they are so beautiful 
They're my friends They're my friends 
They're my friends 
They're my friends 
They're my friends They're my friends 
They're my friends 
They're my friends 
They're my friends
