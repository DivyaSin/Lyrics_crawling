tick-tock, i saw the clock 
but you felt so good that i couldn't stop 
and all along i thought it was wrong 
'til you sang a new song and you came along 
with those eyes you could hypnotize 
i reached for you but was paralyzed 
i thought i sank down deep enough 
but i couldn't quite love you off the cuff so i thought i'd stop to talk the talk or 
walk the walk to find a way to stick around 
all a sudden you had your grasp 
i lost my breath and hit the ground 
pound round for round, i tried to stand 
felt your breath and touched your hand 
man, i reminisce the kiss i miss 
don't know if i can handle this let me be free it used to be i'd walk a mile 
to taste your laugh and see you smile 
now all that's left is circumstance 
with cheap perfume and cheap romance 
still i knew that i would feel 
all wrapped up tight in your little pill 
chewed up, spat out, walked upon 
tried to drink the cup but your grace was gone ten past ten i tried again 
to unlock the door and let you in 
when like a draft you crept within 
blew up, blown up, like the wind chill 
factor, faster than i could 
if i knew you weren't gonna love me then i 
never would have gone inside your heart 
where lies abide, and tried to stay alive let me be free woke up at the break of dawn 
you locked me in and you were gone 
woke up at the break of dawn 
i should've seen it coming, all along let me be free
