I know you might come out right now 
You might even bring me support 
On my doorstep in the storm 
A miracle, miracle Might approach in a heavy coat(?) 
The sound of better things 
I let my guard down just this once, 
So be good to me, good to me Ooooooh 
Then you'll ask for more 
Then you'll ask for more One wish granted and others dodged 
Lots of anger inside the house 
Lonely hands beg to fight 
But no one dies, no one cries 
Except for you, you aching soul 
I know you must have a heart of gold 
So come on in, come inside 
And make things right, make things right Ooooooh 
Then you'll ask for more 
Then you'll ask for more I will keep your hat & keys 
Until our love runs out 
But when it does, I've just the thing 
We'll lose the rings, lose the rings I know you might come out right now 
You might even bring me support 
On my doorstep in the storm 
A miracle, miracle Ooooooh 
Then you'll ask for more 
You'll come around again 
Always comes around
