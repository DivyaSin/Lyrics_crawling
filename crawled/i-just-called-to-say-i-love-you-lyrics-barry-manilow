No New Year's day to celebrate 
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away 
No first of spring, no song to sing 
In fact here's just another ordinary day No April rain, no flowers bloom 
No wedding Saturday within the month of June 
But what it is, is something true 
Made up of these three words that I must say to you I just called to say I love you 
I just called to say how much I care 
I just called to say I love you 
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart No summer's high, no warm July 
No harvest moon to light one tender August night 
No Autumn breeze, no falling leaves 
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies I just called to say I love you 
I just called to say how much I care 
I just called to say I love you 
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart I just called to say I love you 
I just called to say how much I care 
I just called to say I love you 
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart 
Of my heart, from my heart, from my heart
