"You heard about what's goin' on in there?" 
"Heard a lotta bullshit cocked, I know that much" 
"This isn't bullshit, my friend" 
"Do you know somethin'?" 
"Don't listen" "What'd you know?" 
"Maybe I do and maybe I don't" 
"What I say is that they ain't got no business negotiating" 
"We gonna be goin' back in, they're wit' a bullet for every yard" "Is that right?" 
"We do it now, we do it later, later it can be new use" 
"Am I right Al?" 
"Well, wait, wait minute, Frank" 
"We gotta a lotta angry guys in, they're black Muslims 
Panther's, Young Lord" 
"Besides you average anti-social" 
"So we gotta go in right, clean they're clocks" I hit the loose juice, and pulls up in the deuce 
He gives me the scoop about the fake ass troops 
And how nigga's out they're wanna play 
I take another hit of the way and then I blast away 
How far playa? Far enough to go off the edge 
I push another nigga off the ledge 
So I stumble as I slide to the chevy 
Yeah, my eyes kinda teary and gun kinda heavy 
I'm a walking, dead man is what they call me when I'm comin' Got the big S on my chest, so I'm kinda gunnin' 
High powered on my way to the west side 
To check upon on some chickens, it's a hell of a drive, so drive on 
As I hit my dodo stick to the break of dawn 
Crime fighting's what I do, and nigga's in my crew 
Don't take lightly, to you busta's, and so we say fuck you 
Then buck you, tuck you in for the night 
As you think about the paper at the funeral sight 
So when I'm hangin' wit' the click and we in demand 
I feel good that the city of angel's call me "Black Superman" Now everybody sing, 'Black Superman' 
Now everybody know, Black Superman 
Everybody sing, 'Black Superman' 
Now everybody know, Black Superman Now everybody sing, 'Black Superman'

Always tryna come up, and yeah, that's a G 
Uh, 'cuz when I bomb it's like a curse 
'Cuz see once in a lifetime, everybody did some dirt 
I guess it got to me the same 
So at the age of 15, I entered the dope game 
I had my cane locked up tight 
In the day I went to school, but I clarked all night And when I went to class I always feel asleep 
But I was out like a motherfucker, if somebody beeped 
My teacher said, "Boy, can't it wait?" 
I said, "Naw I got to put some mo' icin' on my cake" 
I think I saved about 50 G's 
I bought a truck, a house, and a coup on D's 
Mom's is trippin' but she really don't know 
All I'm thinkin' is she ain't on the county no mo' 
Before my mama fucked wit' the county again I'd rather take the risk of doin' 5-10 
I'm not takin' a chase, I'm straight makin' a chase 
So now we deserve to get what we wanna get

Because y'all motherfucker's just don't care 
Uh, you really wanna know why I sold scum? 
Because my mama to me comes number one
