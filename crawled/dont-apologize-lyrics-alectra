Every shot I take's a miss 
If that's what gets you through the night 
There's no more lonely way to live 
I will turn all of the tides I might have to climb up past rock bottom 
But you'll need a whole army to stop me Don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know I'm imperfect 
Don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know that I'm worth it 
I don't need you to approve, I approve 
So don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know I'm imperfect Every step I take's a trip 
I won't let this weigh me down 
Give me all you have to give 
I won't carry it around I might have to climb up past rock bottom 
But you'll need a whole army to stop me Don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know I'm imperfect 
Don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know that I'm worth it 
I don't need you to approve, I approve 
So don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know I'm imperfect There's no weather that we're under 
I took the rain I stole the thunder Don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know I'm imperfect 
Don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know that I'm worth it 
I don't need you to approve, I approve 
So don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know I'm imperfect Don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know I'm imperfect 
Don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know that I'm worth it 
I don't need you to approve, I approve 
So don't apologize, don't apologize 
I know I'm imperfect
