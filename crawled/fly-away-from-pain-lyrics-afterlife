I wish I could fly away 
From this world today 
Nobody knows me, Nobody needs me 
Why am I here when everyone hate me I wish that I could fly away 
I wish I would not be here to day 
I want to go home 
where I belong 
where all the good people stay I'm flying with my angel 
Away from worlds danger 
Fly away from pain 
I can't take any more shame I don't believe that you know it 
How to be fated, so very hated 
I can't sleep at night 
Because I never feel right
