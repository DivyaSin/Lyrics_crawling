See the clouds are creeping 
Towards the sun 
I'm drifting away 
Unseen by anyone 
The light is turning gray, 
The day is done 
The water is cold 
And heavy on my mind 
I dreamed of walking with you 
But I fell behind 
Looking for a rose 
I could not find 
Now the ice is stirring 
And spring is near 
There is no one calling 
But the sound is clear 
Though I'm not yet gone, 
I'm still not here
