In my dreams our love was lost. 
I lived by luck and faith. 
I carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn't be too late. 
Now i'm standing on this empty road, where nothing moves but the wind. 
And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again. 
Back in your arms, back in your arms again Oh once I was your treasure, and I saw your face in every star. 
But these promises we make at night, oh that's all they are. 
Unless we fill them with faith and love they're empty as a howlin' wind. 
And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again.. 
Back in your arms, back in your arms again. 
Back in your arms, back in your arms again. You came to me with love and kindness, but all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness. 
I met you with indifference, and I don't know why. Now I wake from my dream, I wake from my dream to this world. 
Where all the shadow and darkness and above me a dark sky unfurls. 
And all the love I've thrown away and lost, I'm longing for again. 
Now darling I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again. 
Back in your arms, back in your arms again. 
Back in your arms, back in your arms again. 
Back in your arms
