There is someone 
Walking behind you, 
turn around, look at me. 
There is someone 
Watching your footsteps, 
turn around, look at me. There is someone 
Says they loves you, 
Here's my heart, in my hand 
Turn around, look at me, understand. There is someone 
Standing beside you, 
Turn around (turn around), 
Look at me (look at me). 
There is someone 
To love and guide you, 
Turn around (turn around), 
Look at me (look at me). I'll be waiting 
for now and forever 
for you, to come to me. 
Turn around, look at me, 
turn around, look at me.
