In those days 
I had no reason for grieves and tears 
All the actions I took was just for me and myself 
Loving was only for fun Well, now those days are gone 
I'm in the autumn of my years 
And I feel such a void when I'm a lonely in my bed 
And I wake up the very same way Come to me 
Lay down next to me 
Keep me company 
You put a song in my heart Come on and take my hand, we're off to Wonderland 
I hear a symphony, each time you're here with me 
Heavenly, that's what my life could be 
Come on and take my hand, we're off to Wonderland Oh, way back then 
I used to change the rainbow's end 
But my paradise found turned into paradise lost 
There's always a price to be paid Well, now those days are gone 
And when I look back at my life 
All the pictures are blurred and all those nights feel like one 
And the parties weren't really that fun Oh, come to me 
Lay down next to me 
Keep me company 
You put a song in my heart Come on and take my hand, we're off to Wonderland 
I hear a symphony, each time you're here with me 
Heavenly, that's what my life could be 
Come on and take my hand, we're off to Wonderland Oh, I used crave attention from every stranger in the night 
I used to fear the morning, the early morning light 
But when the ecstasy subsided and the good times went away 
You found me there, so stay with me and keep me company 
Come on and Come on and take my hand, we're off to Wonderland 
There is a place for us, there is a hope for us 
Heavenly, that's what my life could be 
Come on and take my hand, we're off to Wonderland Take my hand, we're off to Wonderland 
(Making love was just for fun) 
(Now those days are really gone) 
I hear a symphony, each time you're here with me 
(I'm in the autumn of my life) 
(And when I wake up, I'm alone in my bed) Heavenly, that's what my life could be 
(Making love was just for fun) 
(Now those days are really gone) 
Come on and take my hand, we're off to Wonderland 
(I'm in the autumn of my life) 
(And when I wake up, I'm alone in my bed) Making love was just for fun 
Now those days are really gone 
I'm in the autumn of my life 
And when I wake up, I'm alone in my bed
