I choose my words like wise men do 
And tonight 
I'll get you right I rule my world , like great men do 
And I fight 
I fight for mine And you look so good 
On the floor 
Put my mind in a dirty zone 
If they watch 
Let them watch 
Not losing you tonight Oh oh 
Im coming to get you 
Oh oh oh 
Im running im gunning for you 
Oh oh

U want me to I lost my mind some where 
Between your face 
And your perfect shape Found a pleasure watching you 
Having fun 
Fooling around Coz you look so good On the floor 
You make me wanna leave her now 
If they talk 
Let them talk 
Not losing you tonight Oh oh 
Im coming to get you 
Oh oh oh 
Im running im gunning for you 
Oh oh
