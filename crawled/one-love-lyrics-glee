One love, one heart 
Let's get together and feel all right 
Hear the children crying (One love) 
Hear the children crying (One heart) 
Sayin' give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right 
Sayin' let's get together and feel all right Let them all pass all their dirty remarks 
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One heart) 
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner 
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own? 
Believe me One love, one heart 
Let's get together and feel all right 
As it was in the beginning (One love) 
So shall it be in the end (One heart) 
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right 
Let's get together and feel alright 
One more thing Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (One love) 
So when the Man comes there will be no no doom (One song) 
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner 
There ain't no hiding place from the father of creation Sayin' one love, one heart 
Let's get together and feel all right 
I'm pleading to mankind (One love) 
Oh what about the one heart (One heart) Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right 
Let's get together and feel all right
