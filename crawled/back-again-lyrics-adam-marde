I never thought I'd be the one 
To say goodbye 
To say we're done 
My vital signs have all shut down 
'Cause when it comes to you 
There's just too much to figure out I don't know, why I stayed 
Just so you could get your way 
I guess I thought that you would change 
But when it comes down to it 
There's just nothing left say Isn't it obvious? 
This is the end of us 
And I'm not coming back again I'm not coming back again 
I'll tell you to listen up to me my friend 
I said I'm not coming not coming back again 
Caught in my head once 
But never again 
Caught in your head once 
But never again I went against my common sense 
I didn't listen to my friends 
Then paid the price later on 
When I heard the message 
That he left you on your phone You played your game 
Yeah, you played it well 
Had me fooled and then I fell 
Even more in love than before 
But I'm over it 
I'm over us 
I'm headed for the door Isn't it obvious? 
This is the end of us 
And I'm not coming back again I'm not coming back again 
I'll tell you to listen up to me my friend 
I said I'm not coming not coming back again 
Caught in my head once 
But never again 
Caught in your head once 
But never again 'Cause I didn't notice what you were doing 
When I wasn't there 
Said "it won't happen," in the beginning 
When I thought you cared 
But you gave me a reason 
Not to believe in you 
And I'm not coming back again Just shut your lips, don't holler back girl 
It's time to grow up and learn to face the world 
You and your crew kicking it with your internet phones 
ringtones, laying low, picking bones is all you know 
No one said growing up was gonna be easy 
Fast cars travel far, do you know who you are? 
When you come up with your head hanging low 
No matter what happens I just wanted you to know I'm not coming back again 
I'll tell you to listen up to me my friend 
I said I'm not coming not coming back again 
Caught in my head once 
But never again 
Caught in your head once 
But never again I'm not coming back again 
I'll tell you to listen up to me my friend 
I said I'm not coming not coming back again 
Caught in my head once 
But never again 
Caught in your head once 
But never again
