Precious Lord take my hand 
Lead me on let me stand 
For I am tired I am weak I am worn 
Through the storms through the night 
Lead me on to the light 
Precious Lord take my hand and lead me home 
Well I remember when I was a lad 
Times were hard and things wee bad 
There's a silver lining behind every cloud 
Just poor people that's all we were 
Trying to make a living out of outback dirt 
We all get together in a circle and sing out 
loud Daddy sand bass Mama sand tenor 
Me and little brother would join right in there 
Singing seem to help a trouble soul 
One o these days it won't be long 
We'll all join in this song 
We'll all get together up yonder 'round the throne 
No the circle won't be broken 
Bye and Bye Lord Bye and Bye 
Daddy sang bass Mama sang tenor 
Me and little brother would join right in there 
In the sky Lord in the sky
