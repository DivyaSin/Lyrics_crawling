I wish that this night would never be over 
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die 
So lets just stay awake until we grow older 
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes 
Our eyes 
Never 
I don't wanna let a minute get away 
Cuz we got no time to lose 
None of us are promised to see tomorrow 
And what we do is ours to choose 
Forget about the sunrise 
Fight the sleep in your eyes 
I don't wanna miss a second with you 
Let's stay this way forever 
It's only getting better 
If we want it to 
But you know I wish that this night would never be over 
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die 
So lets just stay awake until we grow older 
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes 
Our eyes 
Never 
It's so hard to think this would fade away 
What goes up must come down 
Why can't we just live life with no consequence 
And always live in the now 
Forget about the sunrise 
Fight the sleep in your eyes 
I don't wanna miss a second with you 
Let's stay this way forever 
It only gets better 
If we want it to 
You know I wish that this night would never be over 
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die 
So lets just stay awake until we grow older 
If I had my way we'd never close our eyes 
Our eyes 
Never
