If somebody would've told me 
One woman could hold me 
And leave me weak as a baby 
I'd have told 'em they were crazy Love hit me like a 
ten pound hammer 
A ten pound hammer 
with a five foot swing I used to play it so cool 
Lord knows that I was no fool 
No chains would ever bind me 
But those days are all behind me- 
you see Love hit me like a 
ten pound hammer 
A ten pound hammer 
with a five foot swing I never saw love's power 
Just the hearts and the flowers 
When I fell it was frightening 
It struck me down like lightning- 
when Love hit me like a 
ten pound hammer 
A ten pound hammer 
with a five foot swing I used to live like a rolling stone 
Nobody had a hold on me 
All it took was a kiss from you 
To bring me right to my knees Love hit me like a 
ten pound hammer 
A ten pound hammer 
with a five foot swing Yeah, that's all she wrote
