[Chorus] 
Baby you can have the world 
Girl I promise, girl I promise 
This love ain't for them other girls 
Baby I promise, baby I promise , promise 
Girl I promise, promise 
Tonight's gonna be all yours It's the perfect time to let go lose you 
Self reacts your mind now 
You got my attention and grand your body 
Hearing might erect you Give me your hand we can dance through the night,night,night 
Nobody else matters it's just you and I, I [Chorus] Whatever you imagine I can make it happen 
Travel around the planet, let's go 
I love all your fashion, got me in a transcend 
I can't help but want you more Give me your hand we can dance through the night,night,night 
Nobody else matters it's just you and I, I [Chorus] So it's just gonna be you and I 
And you should know we'll own the night 
Baby you can have the world 
Girl I promise, promise 
Tonight's gonna be all yours I promise baby 
I promise baby 
I promise baby 
I promise baby
