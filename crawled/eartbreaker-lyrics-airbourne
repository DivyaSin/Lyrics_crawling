She's so hot, she's so fine 
I thought it out a thousand times 
It's dangerous, no fear 
But what she wants, I got right here I'll bite and howl and tear her to bits, yeah 
She is the one to scratch my itch 
Oh yeah, she's my pill, she's my fix, oh yeah Give me one more night

Down on your knees 
Heartbreaker Just one more night

So what, it's bought and sold 
Ten to one, but no chance 
I took the odds for the Devil's dance I sealed the deal and she said, "Yes" 
So, I put my hands right up her dress 
And she said, "What's been taking you so long" Give me one more night
