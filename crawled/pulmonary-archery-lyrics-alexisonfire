Let's go! 
It's never too late to be early 
Or try and maintain 
Some scrap of integrity and certainty 
I guess. (My fingers) 
Won't apologize 
(Are blistered and bleeding) 
And 1977 
Was a long time 
(Was a long time) 
Time ago 
(Time ago) 
I don't care. I don't care how things 
Were and I won't 
Apologize. 
I won't apologize. 
Fuck you. And the Alamo penetrated 
And there is little hope 
For the white man so 
Hop on your rainbow 
And ride
