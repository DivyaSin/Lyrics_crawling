Hm my Baby 
Heaven sent you to me 
All the worlds been praying 
Who will Save? 
But who am I 
That here tonight 
I hold the one 
Who'll Bring us life Hallelujah, 
We've been found 
A child is born 
To save us now 
Hallelujah light has come 
A Savior who will set us free 
A Promise for those who believe Do you hear the Angels 
Sing for you my baby 
Men and kings have come to 
Bow to you 
But here in my arms So close to me 
The son of God 
Now all can see Hallelujah We've been found 
A child is born to save us now 
Jesus Hallelujah light has come 
A savior set us free So praise to God on high 
He has heard our cry
