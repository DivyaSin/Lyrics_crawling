Something you're not sure of, uh-huh 
Something you're not sure of 
There's something you're not sure of, uh-huh 
This thing you're not sure of, uh uh uh People, meet me 
Ask if, I've got the money to lend her 
Find her, tell her 
She is, still on the agenda 'Cause pretty soon we'll be dancing 
We'll be using our feet 
Just like we always had it easy 
Just like we always knew we'd meet You're not sure of 
Maybe, maybe not sure of People who, see me 
Think I, vibe on the attention 
I just, think they're 
Hoping, that they'll be getting a mention But I don't know what the chance is 
That I'll be finding my feet 
And if they know what "to dance" is 
The kind of people I don't need (find, your, feet) After, this song 
I will, be earning a fat cent 
I'll be, working 
On my, American accent And pretty soon we'll be dancing 
Yea we'll be using our feet 
Just like we knew it'd be easy 
Just like we always knew we'd meet Ooh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh (feed, the, fish)
