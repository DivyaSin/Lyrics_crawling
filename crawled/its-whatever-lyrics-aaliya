[Chorus] 
It's whatever 
Whatever 
Oh,whatever Just like a bird 
That whistles in the trees 
At peace 
So happily 
Well you're my tree 
And through the storms you stood strong for me 
Kept me warm as can be 
Like a candy to an apple 
Oh we go together 
You're so sweet on me (oh so sweet) 
I can say that I do believe 
This is destiny 
It keeps calling me [Chorus] Now it's me and you 
It's you and me 
And it's whatever 
Whatever you want it to be 
I'm telling you 
If it's up to me 
Whatever is whatever 
It's whatever with you and me (Whatever's whatever) Just like a breeze 
In the middle of a Summer's Eve 
When You Come Through 
You Come For Me 
If I'm a drink 
You're my lemon squeeze (oh) 
Oh you got that flavor boy 
You go good with me 
So boy don't play or tease me 
Oh keep me together 
You've got what I need 
Now it's getting late 
It's after three 
So quit your stallin' 
My body's callin' [Chorus] Now it's me and you 
It's you and me 
And it's whatever 
Whatever you want it to be 
I'm telling you 
If it's up to me 
Whatever is whatever 
It's whatever with you and me Whatever's whatever 
It's whatever 
It's your world 
I put that on everything 
It's your world (your world) 
Your world 
Yeah [Chorus] Oh now it's me and you (me and you) 
And you and me (you and me) 
And it's whatever you want it to be (you want it to be) 
I'm telling you (I'm telling you) 
If it's up to me (up to me) 
Whatever is whatever 
Whatever's whatever 
Baby (baby) Whatever's whatever
