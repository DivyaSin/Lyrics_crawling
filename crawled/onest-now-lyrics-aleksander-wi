Like staring into light 
Sometimes there is hard to see 
What separates you and me 
And somewhere under the weather 
I could be better off without 
The goodbyes left in letters never sent Let's save now for later 
And let the minutes fade away 
Pretend that we never said goodbye 
Let your voice linger 
Be my sinking afterthought 
Maybe you are What I need Singing honest now I think that I saw what was missing 
A minute, it was gone 
Time moves slower now 
There is more in every second spent holding on Watching you singing Sitting on the floor 
Singing about a little less 
Sorrow than before 
I love the second chances and how you never run out 
Better than me In every way 
And I wont let us disappear 
Like two ships in the night 
Slipping quietly 
Out of sight Singing honest now 
I think that I saw what was missing 
A minute, it was gone 
Time moves slower now 
There is more in every second spent holding on oooh 
Singing honest now Singing honest now I think that I saw what was missing 
A minute, it was gone 
Time moves slower now 
There is more in every second spent holding on oooh 
Time moves slower now 
There is more in every second spent holding on
