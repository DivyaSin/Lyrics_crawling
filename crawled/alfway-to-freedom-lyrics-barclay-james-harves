You got to sing a new song 
'Cause the way that we're going 
Is far too long 
Alone, when you can't hear a sound 
And you're halfway to freedom 
It can't be found 
But we've got the love 
And the feeling's strong 
And we're going on 
And we can't go wrong 
Halfway to freedom 
Sing out the word 
Tables are turning 
We're learning 
Our voice can be heard 
Towers are falling 
See how they burn 
Hope for each other 
Our brothers 
All over the world Love like a cry in the night 
We reach out for each other 
Peace to find 
Hear, when the bells start to chime 
And you're halfway to freedom 
It's hard to find Halfway to freedom 
Sing out the word 
Tables are turning 
We're learning 
Our voice can be heard 
Towers are falling 
See how they burn 
Hope for each other 
Our brothers 
All over the world
