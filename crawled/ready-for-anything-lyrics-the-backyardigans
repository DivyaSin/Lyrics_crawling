We've landed on Mars 
On the red and rocky ground 
Now it's time to get going 
And look for that sound But it's an alien world 
Who knows what to expect 
So before you explore 
Make sure your gear is checked We're ready for anything 
Anything, anything We brought lots 
And lots of gear 
Let's go down the list 
And make sure it's all here Maps and shovels, check 
Cables and ropes, check 
Flashlight and sneakers, check 
Bubble bath soap, check Sunblock and towels, check 
Grappling hooks, check 
I even brought crayons 
And coloring books We're ready for anything 
Anything, anything There's so much equipment 
Packed on Rover 
But it's pack real well 
So it won't tip over We're ready for anything 
Anything, anything We're ready for anything 
Anything, anything We brought a whole lot 
But why take a chance 
And while we're exploring 
We might sing and dance We're ready for anything 
Anything, anything
