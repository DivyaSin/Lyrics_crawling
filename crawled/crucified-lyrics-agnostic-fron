They ask why we dress this way 
Live for now, stand today 
See the kids but don't hear what they say 
Close your eyes and look the other way 
You say the end justifies the means 
They'll lock us up throw away the keys 
Crucified, crucified for your sins [Repeat x2] 
They don't know our feelings 
Only our desperate cries 
They seek protection through distorted eyes 
Can't tell the truth from their lies 
We've got to learn to fight to live 
Before they grind us under heel 
We're the targets so easy to find 
We're the ones that. 
Won't stay in line I find myself nailed to a cross 
For something that I didn't do 
It's your fault you've ruined our lives 
But we're the ones you crucify 
You're the ones who commit the crimes 
But it's always us who do the time
