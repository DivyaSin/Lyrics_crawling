Erasing the earth through the wave of your hand 
Your life means much more than mine 
Gathering strength you await your command 
We've stared at the sun until all eyes are blind Guardian of fire, who's sworn to you? 
Enlightened one, secreting the truth Wait bide your time 
Desecrater 
Souls lost to time 
Suffocator Rise from your knees, avenger 
Live to disease, betrayer 
Rise from your knees, avenger 
Live to disease, betrayer From chaos you reign with the world on a leash 
Jerking the chain to force a cry 
Obedience now subservience next 
We do as you will or we scream when we die Hymn to disaster, sing it to the land 
The chilling strains of man destroying man Wait bide your time 
Desecrater 
Souls lost to time 
Here forever Rise from your knees, avenger 
Live to disease, betrayer 
Rise from your knees, avenger 
Live to disease, betrayer The streets wet with blood and the sky spitting fire 
No one escapes from the clutch of the damned 
Ascend, ascend to the throne of your madness 
A skeletal knight with a scepter in hand Rise from your knees, rise from your knees 
Rise from your knees, rise from your knees Rise from your knees, rise from your knees 
Rise from your knees, rise from your knees Your coming foretold and we watched all the signs 
And still we failed to recognize 
Begged your solutions to damage your planned 
Deserving no mercy deserving your lies Lord of the slaughter, who's sworn to you? 
Oh, chosen one, lead us to our doom Now is your time 
Violator 
Gifts from the blind 
Desecrater Rise from your knees, avenger 
Live to disease, betrayer 
Rise from your knees, avenger 
Live to disease, betrayer Rise from your knees, avenger 
Live to disease, betrayer Rise from your knees 
Rise from your knees 
Rise from your knees 
Rise from your knees 
Rise, rise, rise, rise
