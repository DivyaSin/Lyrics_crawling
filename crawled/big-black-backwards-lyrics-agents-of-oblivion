deep as the terrible sky 
that you fell from this 
this terrible beauty is born 
dethroned 
I haunt the saltmines 
a living wound 
living, breathing wound deep was the ocean and wide 
that I slither from 
terrible beauty is born 
dethroned 
I haunt the saltmines 
a living wound 
living,breathing wound...
