[Repeat: x2] 
I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends 
You can always make new friends (oh no) 
But it's not always worth as much (oh no) Now this bridge is ashes 
It might as well have never been built 
It might as well have never been built 
Little river that it crossed 
Looks like an ocean now, looks like an ocean now Times change and people change with them 
Some people love to play the victim 
(love to play the victim) 
Your caution to the end 
Washed away these few last tears for nothing 
(wasn't all for nothing) 
Keep it on wax Your not the only one 
Who's making these sacrifices 
Who's making these sacrifices 
And time won't heal shit 
When you got your hands in my pocket 
When you got your hands [Repeat: x2] 
Kick, kick, kick 
Scream, scream, scream 
Won't change a god damn thing (it won't change) 
Kick, kick, kick 
Scream, scream, scream (a god damn thing) I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends 
I guess, the only thing cheap is your friends [3x] Oh, what a fucking shame 
Oh, that you had to mess things up this time Times change and people change with them 
Some people love to play the victim 
(love to play the victim) 
Your caution to the end 
Washed away these few last tears for nothing 
(wasn't all for nothing) [Repeat: x2] 
It's gone, it's gone 
There's nothing left 
Keep it on wax
