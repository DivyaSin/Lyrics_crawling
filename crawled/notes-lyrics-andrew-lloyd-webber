[FIRMIN] 
"Mystery 
after gala night," 
if says, "Mystery 
of soprano's flight!" 
"Mystified 
baffled Surete say, 
we are mystified - 
we suspect foul play!" 
Bad news on 
soprano scene - 
first Carlotta, 
now Christine! 
Still, at least 
the seats get sold 
gossip's worth 
its weight in gold . . . 
What a way to 
run a business! 
Spare me these 
unending trials! 
Half your cast disappears, 
but the crowd still cheers! 
Opera! 
To hell with Gluck and Handel - 
It's a scandal that'll 
pack 'em in the aisles! [ANDRE] 
Damnable! 
Will they all walk out? 
This is damnable! [FIRMIN] 
Andre, please don't shout . . . 
It's publicity! 
And the take is vast! 
Free publicity! [ANDRE] 
But we have no cast . . . [FIRMIN (calmly)] 
But Andre, 
have you seen the queue? 
Oh, it seems 
you've got one too . . . [ANDRE] 
"Dear Andre 
what a charming gala! 
Christine enjoyed a great success! 
We were hardly bereft 
when Carlotta left - 
otherwise 
the chorus was entrancing, 
but the dancing was a 
lamentable mess!" [FIRMIN (reading his)] 
"Dear Firmin, 
just a brief reminder: 
my salary has not been paid. 
Send it care of the ghost, 
by return of post 
P.T.O.: 
No-one likes a debtor, 
so it's better if my 
orders are obeyed!" [FIRMIN/ANDRE] 
Who would have the gall 
to send this? 
Someone with a puerile brain! [FIRMIN (examining both letters)] 
These are both signed "O.G." . . . [ANDRE] 
Who the hell is he? [BOTH (immediately realizing)] 
Opera ghost! [FIRMIN (unamused)] 
It's really not amusing! [ANDRE] 
He's abusing 
our position! [FIRMIN] 
In addition 
he wants money! [ANDRE] 
He's a funny 
sort of spectre . . . [BOTH] 
. . . to expect a 
large retainer! 
Nothing plainer - 
he is clearly quite insane! [RAOUL] 
Where is she? [ANDRE] 
You mean Carlotta? [RAOUL] 
I mean Miss Daae - 
where is she? [FIRMIN] 
Well, how should we know? [RAOUL] 
I want an answer - 
I take it that you sent me this note? [FIRMIN] 
What's all this nonsense? [ANDRE] 
Of course not! [FIRMIN] 
Don't look at us! [RAOUL] 
She's not with you, then? [FIRMIN] 
Of course not! [ANDRE] 
We're in the dark . . . [RAOUL] 
Monsieur, don't argue - 
Isn't this the 
letter you wrote? [FIRMIN] 
And what is it, that we're 
meant to have wrote? 
(Realizing his mistake) 
Written! [ANDRE] 
"Do not fear for Miss Daae. 
The Angel of Music 
has her under his wing. 
Make no attempt to see her again." [RAOUL] 
If you didn't write it, who did? [CARLOTTA] 
Where is he? 
[ANDRE] 
Ah, welcome back! [CARLOTTA] 
Your precious patron - 
where is he? [RAOUL] 
What is it now? [CARLOTTA (to RAOUL)] 
I have your letter - 
a letter which I 
rather resent! [FIRMIN (to RAOUL)] 
And did you send it? [RAOUL] 
Of course not! [ANDRE] 
As if he would! [CARLOTTA] 
You didn't send it? [RAOUL] 
Of course not! [FIRMIN] 
What's going on . . .? [CARLOTTA (to RAOUL)] 
You dare to tell me, 
that this is not the 
letter you sent?! [RAOUL] 
And what is it that I'm 
meant to have sent? 
(RAOUL takes the letter and reads it) 
"Your days 
at the Opera Populaire are numbered. 
Christine Daae 
will be singing on your behalf tonight. 
Be prepared 
for a great misfortune, 
should you attempt 
to take her place." [ANDRE/FIRMIN] 
Far too many 
notes for my taste - 
and most of them 
about Christine! 
All we've heard since we came 
is Miss Daae's name . . . [GIRY] 
Miss Daae has returned. [FIRMIN (drily)] 
I trust her midnight oil 
is well and truly burned. [ANDRE] 
Where precisely is she now? [GIRY] 
I thought it best 
that she went home . . . [MEG] 
She needed rest. [RAOUL] 
May I see her? [GIRY] 
No, monsieur, 
she will see no-one. [CARLOTTA] 
Will she sing? 
Will she sing? [GIRY] 
Here, I have a note . . . [RAOUL/CARLOTTA/ANDRE] 
Let me see it! [FIRMIN (snatching it)] 
Please! [FIRMIN (Opens the letter and reads. The PHANTOM'S 
voice gradually lakes over)] 
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the 
most amiable nature, detailing how my theatre is to be 
run. You have not followed my instructions. 
I shall give you one last chance . . ." [PHANTOM'S VOICE (taking over)] 
Christine Daae has returned to you, 
and I am anxious her career 
should progress. 
In the new production of "Il Muto", 
you will therefore cast Carlotta 
as the Pageboy, and put Miss Daae 
in the role of Countess. 
The role which Miss Daae plays 
calls for charm and appeal. 
The role of the Pageboy is silent - 
which makes my casting, 
in a word 
ideal. 
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in 
Box Five, which will be kept empty for me. Should 
these commands be ignored, a disaster beyond your 
imagination will occur. [FIRMIN (taking over)] 
"I remain, Gentlemen, 
Your obedient servant, O.G." [CARLOTTA] 
Christine! [ANDRE] 
Whatever next . . .? [CARLOTTA] 
It's all a ploy to help Christine! [FIRMIN] 
This is insane . . . [CARLOTTA] 
I know who sent this: 
(pointing an accusing finger) 
The Vicomte - her lover! [RAOUL (ironical)] 
Indeed? 
(to the OTHERS) 
Can you believe this? [ANDRE (to CARLOTTA, in protest)] 
Signora! [CARLOTTA (half to the MANAGERS, half to herself)] 
O traditori! [FIRMIN (to CARLOTTA)] 
This is a joke! [ANDRE] 
This changes nothing! [CARLOTTA] 
O mentitori! [FIRMIN] 
Signora! [ANDRE] 
You are our star! [FIRMIN] 
And always will be! [ANDRE] 
Signora . . . [FIRMIN] 
The man is mad! [ANDRE] 
We don't take orders! [FIRMIN (announcing it to EVERYONE)] 
Miss Daae will be playing 
the Pageboy - the silent role . . . [ANDRE/FIRMIN] 
Carlotta will be playing 
the lead! [CARLOTTA (waxing melodramatic)] 
It's useless trying to 
appease me! 
You're only saying this 
to please me! 
Signori, e vero? 
Non, non, non voglio udire! 
Lasciatemi morire! 
O padre mio! 
Dio! [GIRY] 
Who scorn his word, 
beware to those . . . [CARLOTTA (to MANAGERS)] 
You have reviled me! [GIRY] 
The angel sees, 
the angel knows . . . [RAOUL] 
Why did Christine 
fly from my arms . . .? [CARLOTTA] 
You have rebuked me! [ANDRE/FIRMIN] 
Signora, pardon us . . . [CARLOTTA] 
You have replaced me! [ANDRE/FIRMIN] 
Please, Signora, 
we beseech you . . . [GIRY] 
This hour shall see 
your darkest fears . . . [MEG/RAOUL] 
I must see her . . . [CARLOTTA] 
Abbandonata! 
Deseredata! 
O, sventurata! [GIRY] 
The angel knows, 
the angel hears . . . [RAOUL] 
Where did she go . . .? [CARLOTTA] 
Abbandonata! 
Disgraziata! [ANDRE/FIRMIN] 
Signora, sing for us! 
Don't be a martyr . . . [RAOUL/GIRY/MEG] 
What new surprises 
lie in store . . .? [ANDRE/FIRMIN] 
Our star . . .! [CARLOTTA] 
Non vo' cantar!
