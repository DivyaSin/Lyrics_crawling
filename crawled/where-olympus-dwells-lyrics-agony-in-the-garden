Where Olympus dwells 
Made of blood and bone 
When the walls come crushing in 
To cover you in stone 
Where Olympus dwells 
Daylight never dies 
So remember well 
Etched in blood and bone 
Somewhere in-between 
You find your way home 
Where Olympus dwells 
Daylight never dies Where the world dwells on small details 
Just to find our graves in the snow 
You ask the measure of my mind 
To this you already know 
Stand your ground 
Don't back down 
This grave you dug so shallow 
Curse the hell where you dwell There'll be times in your life 
Where you can only feel pain 
Always darkness in light 
Some things will never change 
You can't kill what won't bleed 
Let them do what they will 
When the walls come crashing down 
Find a new place to dwell Where Olympus dwells 
Made of blood and bone 
When the walls come crushing in 
To cover you in stone 
Where Olympus dwells 
Daylight never dies 
So remember well 
Etched in blood and bone 
Somewhere in-between 
You find your way home 
Where Olympus dwells 
Daylight never dies How many days have you felt this way 
Heard the breaking of your heart 
You asked someone to stand by your side 
They watched you fall apart 
Stand your ground don't back down 
This grave you dug so shallow 
Curse the hell where you dwell There'll be times in your life 
Where you can only feel pain 
Always darkness in light 
Some things will never change 
You can't kill what won't bleed 
Let them do what they will 
When the walls come crashing down 
Find a new place to dwell Where Olympus dwells 
Made of blood and bone 
When the walls come crushing in 
To cover you in stone 
Where Olympus dwells 
Daylight never dies 
So remember well 
Etched in blood and bone 
Somewhere in-between 
You find your way home 
Where Olympus dwells 
Daylight never dies
