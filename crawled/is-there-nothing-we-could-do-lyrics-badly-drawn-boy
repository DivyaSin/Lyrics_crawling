Rushing round in circles 
To brighten all the corners 
Busy making friends with all your enemies 
You finger through your bible 
Whilst looking through your window 
The look you gave erased a thousand memories Ooooh I am sorry, ooooh I am sorry 
This page in your story won't turn 
Who am I to ask you why 
You feel the way you do 
If you feel the way you do 
Is there nothing we could do? With advice I'd warn her 
Don't idolise your neighbour 
Maybe something else is the enemy 
But who put out the fire 
What you asking me for 
The simple things you need for a remedy Ooooh I am sorry, ooooh I am sorry 
This page in your story won't turn 
Who am I to ask you why 
You feel the way you do 
If you feel the way you do 
Is there something we could do? If only you could know there is life through your window 
Oh but even so I don't know where would you go 
The time you waste would still turn into memories Who am I to ask you why 
You feel the way you do 
If you feel the way you do 
Is there nothing we could do? Couldn't you just ask me why 
You feel the way you do 
There's one thing I'd say to you 
There must be something we could do Just go ahead and ask me the question
