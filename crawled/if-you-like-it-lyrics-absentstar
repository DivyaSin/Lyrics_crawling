If you fight it, it will fight you back 
If theres one chance 
Then youve got one more 
If you like, it will like you back Uninvited but you welcome more 
And all that youre waiting for is gone 
Although it wont go very far Its never too late whatever the case 
Its here to stay, wish it all away 
But it still remains, Im learning to say 
Its never too late to start again 
And it all begins where you think it ends You deny it like at heart attack 
Undecided, it keeps coming back 
You re-write it, change it front to back 
Youre reminded of your false control And all that youre waiting for is gone 
Although it wont go very far Its never too late, whatever the case 
Its here to stay, wish it all away 
But it still remains, Im learning to say 
Its never too late to start again 
And it all begins where you think it ends Every time you ever wanted out 
Oh, youve been to hell and back again 
But finally figured out And every time you ever thought out loud 
But youve lost your voice 
So just enjoy the way it all plays out 
If you like it, it will like you back Its never too late, whatever the case 
Its here to stay, wish it all away 
But it still remains, Im learning to say 
Its never too late to start again 
And it all begins where you think it ends
