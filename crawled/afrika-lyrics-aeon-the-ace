Verse 1 
Its funny how people knock the country that they came from, made from, raised from, and even got their names from, why/ isn't it televised for what it is (and) cut the lies and show more than juss the poverty retrospective side/ I testify I been a victim sucked into a vision given makin me to be juss another product of the system/ without a proper cause or even tryna listen/ taught to judge but now I know u can't feed on what u given/ yea there's kids I can't deny they can't find food to eat/ can't forget about the homeless who have nowhere to sleep/ the country's full of medics but they got no money for the fees/ theres the wars and all the men they claim be swingin from the trees../ Well I mean/ that's all they really show us on T.V/ The malnutrition poor people and conniving thieves/ I told u Ive been tellin ya you buyin what they sellin ya but what they don't show, is third world in AMERICA! Chorus 2x 
This is my journey my hunger I made it I was out numbered through these stereotypical individuals who belittle u/ they judge and class u their intentions to get rid of u listen/ whatever happened to good morals and principles Verse 2 
First generation African American forced to settle in a place we don't control and then they claim we pick our presidents no/ how can we call this place home/ the government with eminent domain can even take the place that I own/ they tappin our phones harass and neva leave us alone/ takin our diamond stones they killin for in Sierra Leone/ yea they know its wrong but still they do it/ I guess they didn't care much for all theamputees whove became a product through it. Maybe its me /but I aint neva see the logic to it/ kids hungry cryin with nothin bein provided to um/ it makes me sit and wonder thinkin if they blinded to um/ or infatuated wit continuously lying [to um]/ in America the father of fathers/ indeed there's a problem when other countries follow our problems/ makin it harder to solve em/ mixing the right wit the wrong good wit da bad/ we see a ghetto to them that may be all that they have................. Chorus 2x 
This is my journey my hunger I made it I was out numbered through these stereotypical individuals who belittle u/ they judge and class u their intentions to get rid of u listen/ whatever happened to good morals and principles Verse 3 
Its crazy/ and possibly/ Id be rockin deas droppin dese rhymes awkwardly/ up outta me/ kickin to yall prophecy/ logically no stoppin me/ swearin to yall solemnly/ truth without robbery/ coined it I-Ology/ my street odysseys/ get money to gain property as a monopoly I must control results of my philosophy/ we ought to see but brought to be victims of our society/ and forcefully we labeled as criminals were minorities/ they claim we kill rape and steal as our priorities. / Its funny how they got minorities killin minorities. Dear diary I swear/ that everything is everything aint nothin free so soon they will be chargin for air /the end is soon to come I say to run and be prepared/ with rifles swords and armor world war three could be near/ since God is number one no other man I shall fear/ who bleed the same and tear the same as I shall beware./ Chorus
