words and music: Justin Moore 
Your eyes, your smile, 
When I'm with you, it drives me wild 
Your voice, sound so sweet 
You call my name, it makes me weak 
Pre-Chorus: 
But I'm scared, I won't stay strong 
Oh I'm scared, you won't stay long 
Chorus: 
Baby, you're me heart, you're my soul 
And I gotta let you know (I said) 
Baby, when I'm with you, I feel alright 
And I try to make it show 
Your feel, your touch 
All I want is just your love 
I can't hold back, I can't restrain 
I wanna hold you again 
Prechorus: Chorus: 
Prechorus: Chorus: 
I want you closer 
Girl I need you closer 
Oh my hearts on fire 
And the flame won't go out 
I want your body 
Up against my body 
Wanna hold you close 
Until the end of my life
