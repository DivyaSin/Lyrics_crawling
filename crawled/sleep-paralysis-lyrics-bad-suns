Carve your name in a tree or just run your fingers through wet concrete yeah 
A mark, a mark worth leaving 
What's self worth, the moment's fleeting 
Carve your name in a tree or just run your fingers through wet concrete yeah 
A mark, a mark worth leaving 
What's self worth, the moment's fleeting The sand runs through your fingers, it's gone but a feeling lingers 
I've been out in the street, mixed with sweet paralysis I can't scream, no, 
But I can't watch, can't watch them leaving 
And I wake up and wind up leaving 
Who knows where these dreams come from 
I know what I can't become Hold my hand whoever you are, woah oh 
Take me there, no matter how far, I'll go Hold my hand whoever you are, woah oh 
Take me there, no matter how far, I'll go
