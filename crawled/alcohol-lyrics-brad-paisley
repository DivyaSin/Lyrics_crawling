I can make anybody pretty 
I can make you believe any lie 
I can make you pick a fight 
With somebody twice 
Your size Well I've been known to cause a few breakups 
And I've been known to cause a few births 
I can make you new friends 
Or get you fired from work. And since the day I left Milwaukee 
Lyncheburg Bordeaux, France 
Been making the bars 
With lots of big money 
And helping white people dance 
I got you in trouble in high school 
And college now that was a ball 
You had some of the best times 
You'll never remember with me 
Alcohol, alcohol I got blamed at your wedding reception 
For your best man's embarrassing speech 
And also for those naked pictures of you at the beach 
I've influenced kings and world leaders 
I helped Hemingway write like he did 
And I'll bet you a drink or two that I can make you 
Put that lampshade on your head And since the day I left Milwaukee 
Lyncheburg Bordeaux, France 
Been making a fool out of folks 
Just like you 
And helping white people dance 
I am medicine and I am poison 
I can help you up or make you fall 
You had some of the best times 
You'll never remember with me 
Alcohol, alcohol And since the day I left Milwaukee 
Lyncheburg Bordeaux, France 
Been making the bars 
With lots of big money 
And helping white people dance 
I got you in trouble in high school 
And college now that was a ball 
You had some of the best times 
You'll never remember with me 
Alcohol, alcohol
