I want you now 
Like we're burning in a five alarm fire 
I need you now 
Cause' every second it's getting hotter, hotter, hotter 
I want you now Sweat dripping from my brow 
Hearts pumping hight speed 
Jugging this water down but I'm still thirsty 
Only getting worse to close to you stand next to me 
Are you warm 
I feel my clothes sticking to my body 
Should I take them off 
If I keep staring in your eyes 
I might get a little lost 
If I start walking over now it seems the whole room starts to close 
I'm starting a storm Oh 
Nothing can cool me down 
Look how I'm feeling right now 
You've got my attention 
Call 999 
It's a problem I want you now 
Like we're burning in a five alarm fire 
I need you now 
Cause' every second it's getting hotter, hotter, hotter 
I want you now 
Like we're burning in a five alarm fire 
3, 4, 5 alarm 
3, 4, 5 alarm 
3, 4, 5 alarm 
Fire Engines ring in my ear 
The heats gonna start to burn 
Come and whisper to me 
Give me chills 
With your dirty words 
I can't keep myself away 
The separation only hurts 
How do you feel? Oh 
Nothing can cool me down 
Look how I'm feeling right now 
You've got my attention 
Call 999 
It's a problem I want you now
