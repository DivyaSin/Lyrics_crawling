Duh, duh, duh 
Duh, duh, duh 
Duh, duh, duh 
Ah, ah Where have all the good men gone 
And where are all the gods? 
Where's the street-wise Hercules 
To fight the rising odds? Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed? 
Late at night I toss and turn And dream of what I need 
I need a hero 
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night 
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast 
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight 
I need a hero (New Directions: hero) 
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light ('til the morning light) 
He's gotta be sure and he's gotta be soon 
And he's gotta be larger than life, larger than life Duh, duh, duh 
Duh, duh, duh (Oh whoa!) 
Duh, duh, duh (Oh!) (Yeah!) Ah, ah! Somewhere after midnight 
In my wildest fantasies 
Somewhere just beyond my reach 
There's someone reaching back for me Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat 
It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet (oh!) I need a hero 
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night 
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast 
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight 
I need a hero 
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light 
He's gotta be sure and he's gotta be soon 
And he's gotta be larger than life 
I need a hero 
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night Up where the mountains meet the heavens above 
Out where the lightning splits the sea 
I could swear that there's someone somewhere watching me Through the wind and the chill and the rain 
And the storm and the flood 
I can feel his approach is like a fire in my blood Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood 
Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my 
Blood, blood! Oh! 
I need a hero (hero) 
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night 
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast 
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight 
I need a hero (hero) 
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light 
He's gotta be sure, he's gotta be soon 
And he's gotta be larger than life 
I need a hero (hero) 
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night 
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast 
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight 
I need a hero
