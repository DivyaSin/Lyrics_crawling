Call me Up You came to me- a shadow in the Night 
a Love Connection hiding from the Light 
In Darkness here again-true Agents of the Wind 
Conspiracy is never out of-never out of sight. We'll rendezvouz in Paris or L.A 
In secret Bars or in Midnight Cafes 
Beneath the Velvet Moon 
the time will pass real soon 
before we part I have to say to you Call me Up- 
Right away 
I'll do anything you want or say 
Secret Love 
Hidden Doors 
And the Night Time will become our Day 
Let me into your Heart-promise me that we'll never part. 
Only you know that I am your undercover Love. In Gaslight avenues we have our Fun- 
With Jungle Heat-and tigers on the Run 
Is Life too short to play- 
The secret Agent Way- 
Can Lovers on the Airways be as one Call me up...
