Head in the clouds 
You never touch the ground 
You're in such a hurry 
You might lose what you've found. In and outta town 
Time for you to settle down 
Stand back, take a look around you 
You're runnin' from the pressures of the restless world 
Hush for a moment, baby just be still. Here, now 
Spend a minute next to me 
Slow down 
Take the time to let it be 
I want to show you there's no place better than 
Here right now. Maybe where icebergs 
Melt in the sun 
Let all the ties that bound you 
Come undone. Open up, you're alive 
I miss the fire in your eyes 
Give a sign, tell me that you want me 
When you're overwhelming life becomes too much 
Take another breath and you will see. Here, now 
Spend a minute next to me 
Slow down 
Take the time to let it be 
I want to show you there's no place better than 
Here right now. Here right now 
Here right now. Remember how we'd laugh and carry on (carry one) 
Long before the madness had begun 
Yeah yeah - yeah! Here, now 
Spend a minute next to me 
Slow down 
Take the time to let it be 
I want to show you there's no place better than 
Here right now. Here, now 
Spend a minute next to me 
Slow down 
Take the time to let it be 
I want to show you there's no place better than 
Here right now. Here right now 
Here right now.
