I found it hard to share my trust, I let you have it 
I swore to them, I'd never go back I forgot my nasty habit 
These lips are sore and will never heal 
From kissing your feet since we were only sixteen Maybe you we're wrong 
Maybe we we're on for too long 
I gave you my heart, You said it wasn't enough 
I've done this before You wouldn't keep your hands 
Out of my pockets and I tried 
To hold this anger back I once left aside 
My legs are always sore and my knees are never clean 
From the time I've wasted at your door 
Forever I Would kneel My legs are always sore and my knees are never clean 
All the time wasted at your door 
Just saying how I feel Maybe you we're wrong 
Maybe we we're on for too long 
I gave you my heart, You said it wasn't enough 
I've done this before You kept pulling me back and stringing me in 
I'm done with this talk I'm not starting again 
Because darling, oh darling Maybe I was wrong 
Maybe we we're on for too long 
I gave you my heart, You said it wasn't enough 
I've done this before I gave you my heart, You said it wasn't enough 
I've done this before
