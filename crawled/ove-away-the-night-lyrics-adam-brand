You're always in the fridge or on the phone 
How the hell would you know you're never home 
I go to work, to keep this family fed 
Good try pal but you won't even get out of bed I can't believe you spent that much on shoes 
Look I got them on sale and you'll never know the money I save you 
So I suppose you bought a bag, a dress and a hat 
Well, you've got your race car want to talk about that You look so damn cute when you get mad 
It melts away my troubled heart and you don't seem so bad 
When I see that twinkle in your eye 
We take the phone off the hook and put the kids to bed 
Forget what we said and love away the night You're always on the couch watching football 
Bring me a beer and keep it down, will ya 
I don't want to miss the score just like you missed our anniversary 
Well, I'm sorry babe, but you should have reminded me
