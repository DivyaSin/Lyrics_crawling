And right now were bringing you some in-flight entertainment one of our first class passengers would like to sing you a song inspired by one of our coach passengers. And seeming as we let our first class passengers do pretty much whatever they want here he is ..... Adam Sandler 
I wanna make you smile, 
Whenever you're sad. 
Carry you around when your arthritis is bad. 
All I wanna do, 
Is grow old with you. I'll get you medicine, 
When your tummy aches. 
Build you a fire if the furnace breaks. 
Oh it could be so nice, 
Growin' old with you. I'll miss you, kiss you, 
Give you my coat when you are cold. 
Need you, feed you. 
Even let you hold the remote control. 
So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink. 
Put you to bed when you've had too much to drink. 
Oh I could be the man, 
Who grows old with you. I wanna grow old with you.
