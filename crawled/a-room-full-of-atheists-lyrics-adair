running for the hills 
and i'm running for my room 
i'm running for cover 
yeah i have been terrorized. 
so please hold my head 
while i lie here and bleed my life away 
i have been sold out again 
and i'm running out of time 
and i'm running out of chances 
and i'm running to wherever you are 
i need you back. i've been stabbed by my brother 
won't stop to pull the knife out of my back 
his eyes painted black 
cold and empty just like his heart. 
and he won't take my hand 
no he won't even look me in the eye. 
we have been sold out again. 
and i'm running out of lines 
and i'm running out of patience 
and i'm running to wherever you are 
'cause i need you now 
i need you now. 
pull out my insides 
hold them up for everyone to see. 
i'm praying the gospel 
to a room full of atheists. 
These faceless friends, they've got no love 
They've got no heart. 
They don't believe in a single god damned thing. 
May the righteous stumble and fall. I'm running out of time. 
Running out of believers 
And I'm running to wherever you are 
'cause I need you now. 
Need you now.
