Standing in the red light of a Bourbon Street French Quarter 
Where I met a Spanish Porter who obliged me with his grin 
He asked me for my time, I said I'd take a glass of wine 
And in my altered state of mind I opened up, he jumped right in Oh, some things never turn out right 
Oh, some things never turn out right [Chorus: x2] 
Mister, Mistress, Mistress Of Erzulie He kissed me in the lobby on the way to Pat O'Briens 
No, it didn't take much science to discover what was next 
W'suddenly a woman with a shrunken-headed necklace 
She made me feel so reckless, sexless in my innocence Oh some things never turn out right She led me to the levy, I was helpless as a lamb 
"Don't you know who I am," she said, "Your Nemesis is free" 
I was wired like a weapon, I was dancin' like the Dirvish 
When I woke up feverishly looking down at me [Chorus: x4] From the coveted Ark, To Noah in Asia 
Sodom and Gomorrah, the light and the dark 
Chased by the demon to the caves of the Burren 
Imprisoned by the truth in the tales of the Turrin 
From original sin to original blame, for shame, for shame [Repeat: x2] 
Oh some things never turn out right [Chorus: x4]
