I was thinkin' out loud 
Talking to myself 
I was up on a cloud 
There was nobody else 
No, no I did not call 
I never was allowed 
To speak up at all 
I was just thinkin' out loud Transylvania train, circus never came 
The heroes are all gone 
No trampoline, fell without a scream 
Who's looking for a job Before I realized, I was hypnotized 
Flashback to the past 
Cross-eyed jack, monkey on his back 
We knew it would not last Room service gone off duty 
The bellman has retired 
This hotel is a beauty 
Even the house dick's been fired 
Then the sky came crashing down 
And knocked me off this cloud 
When I fell to the ground 
I was just thinkin' out loud
