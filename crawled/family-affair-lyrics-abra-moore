I sleep all day, what makes me feel this way? 
When everything's a bust, when everything keeps losing my trust 
Where do we begin with this unhappy ending? 
Where do we begin after all that we've done? 
How do we begin to say I forgive you? 
And how do we begin to repair this family affair? I think about the never ending way 
That my day never seems to want to end 
I think about the loneliness of losing a friend 
Don't take it away from me 
Don't take away the one love that matters And I'll get well, you'll see 
You're all I have, you're my family 
Is there ever enough love, ever enough? 
Where do we begin picking up the pieces? 
Where do we begin after all that's been said? 
And how do we begin to say I still love you? 
And how do we begin to repair this family affair? Don't take it away from me 
Don't take away the one love that matters 
And we'll get well, you'll see 
We're all we have, we're family, family 
Where do we begin?
