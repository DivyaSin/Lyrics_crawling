So I'm thinking we should maybe 
Just run away from here 
With no plan of coming back. 
We can stay away forever 
Our anguished love will be all we have and I will save your life 
Its happening again, 
Its happening again 
I won't watch you die 
Its happening again, 
Its happening again I can see its not the first time 
You have come and taken her from me 
Rest assured it's not the last time, 
I'm going to set you free. You took her once 
Shame on you 
Oh 
You took her twice 
Shame on me Whisper softly 
And tell me that you love me 
I'm losing you, 
I don't know what to do 
Please forgive me 
And know that I am sorry 
I'm losing you, 
I don't know what to do Trapped inside a memory. 
(save you) 
I'm falling apart Do you realize its over 
There's no chance of leaving here alive 
You don't realize what you're saying, 
Without me you can't survive. You took her once 
Shame on you 
Oh 
You took her twice 
Shame on me Whisper softly 
And tell me that you love me 
I'm losing you, 
I don't know what to do 
Please forgive me 
And know that I am sorry 
I'm losing you, 
I don't know what to do Trapped inside a memory, 
(save you) 
Ive lost it all 
I'm falling apart You've ripped out my heart. 
(I'm falling apart) 
I don't know where to start I don't want to go 
Its happening again, 
Its happening again 
But I cant let it show 
Ill be with her again, 
Together to the end 
If I have to go 
Its happening again, 
Its happening again 
Ill be damned if I'm alone 
Ill be with her again 
Together til the end. Whisper softly 
And tell me that you love me 
I'm losing you, 
I don't know what to do 
Please forgive me 
And know that I am sorry 
I'm losing you, 
I don't know what to do Trapped inside a memory, 
(save you) 
I'm falling apart 
I've lost it all
