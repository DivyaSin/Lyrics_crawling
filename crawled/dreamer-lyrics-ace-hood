now i've been through so much shit in my life dog and i can't take it 
and i can see my goals right in front of my eyes, talking i'm gonna make it 
and you can bet your box of dollars, that i won't quit, nah, not me 
and i'ma keep pushing, hustling, my grind, yeah triple black whip em in the city day dreaming 
sipping while im trippin duck behind the tinted leanin 
ride in the 2012 hell they ain't seen it 
rolling on a arm lubiton thanks nemin 
throwin duces to my niggas when i ride by 
pistol on me, see my haters through my side eye 
i just drive by, all my bitches top notch 
reminiscence how i'm living boy does time fly 
in a state of mind, or in a state 95 
in conversation with gods who stay in suit and ties 
7 figures, i'd figured that i would beat the odds 
sorry that's your lady fucking over nigga broads 
never mind me, i'm just a black man 
let them tell it i won't make it less i'm light skin 
say my past is jealous of all my future plans 
cause i'm 7 figures up they say i never can 
i'm involved with them conversations 
so when they talking phantoms i just might elaborate it 
dream chasing, fuck haters, mama crib gated 
koolaid crusaded up in 2 ladys 
had 2 babies looking like they damn daddy 
still at it, the swag is so illmatic, it's so illmatic 
i'm day dreaming the instrumental is real magic now i've been through so much shit in my life dog and i can't take it 
and i can see my goals right in front of my eyes, talking i'm gonna make it 
and you can bet your box of dollars, that i won't quit, nah, not me 
and i'ma keep pushing, hustling, my grind, yeah back at it, fienin like crack addicts 
doing your main lady, i'm sorry, it's bad habits 
she in love with the life, i deliver the pipe 
i'm addicted to money, i usually say it twice, yeah 
lord blessed me in the major way, negotiation with money 
my only major pain 
now my lady's problems ain't that damn bad 
went from time to find a dollar to them brown bags 
now it's louie 50 pattern every hand bag 
ask my lady, she gonna do whatever i desire 
grip that ass like a brand new pair work pliers

jeep wagon sazonzys on 26 tires 
Ridin wit a asian bitch who love street fighters
