England may keep the faith 
For what's been done and said 
We know their dreams enough to know 
They dreamed and they are dead 
Too long, too long a sacrifice 
Can make a cold stone of the heart 
But when will it suffice? 
That is Heaven's part, our part 
To name the name upon the name 
Like a mother names her babe 
When rest at last has come 
On limbs that have run wild 
What is it but nightfall 
Oh no, not night but a death 
And needless death after all
