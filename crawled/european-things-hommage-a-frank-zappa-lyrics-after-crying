(...God seems so far...) 
Europe often tries to forget 
About a Barbarian State 
Saved it from halfmoons of Allah 
And was beginning to date 
Evolution brutalized us 
Revolution sweats in vain 
Again 
Rock and roll-plague lies in our brain 
Contraceptive ice n' cigarette 
Contraceptive sunshine 
Contraceptive dance n' prayers 
Help to lose the time 
Seven headed Ciccolinas 
Spew sulphurous brands 
Love ends 
Businessmen's oomph ooze from pure hands 
Think so the sky is really 
Artificial silk 
The birds fly certainly 
To the ancient paradise 
Where sadist cast agonize 
The sufferIngmar Bergman 
Befould his pants 
Cause saw a man was not a pervert 
Ars Longa Vita Brevis Est 
Of course to err his human 
My head weeps on her gold chain 
N' hurts 
She the Glory is an awful flirt 
By her little lies I've so burned 
She's the Philosophy 
Europe often tries to crush me 
Oh, let me fly 
Lose the measure of danger in the fight 
The madness can't be mad 
This enemy star 
Moves in piquant red 
God seems so far 
Dear suicide 
I'm the sad cyanide in your drink 
Oh, suicide, 
Waits for you a lonely ride 
In the deep Dark 
Singes your heart 
He singes you 
By wind
