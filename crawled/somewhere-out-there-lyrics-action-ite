Six billion people in the world 
But all i need is you 
Ten million seconds i've wasted 
I would waste them again with you 'Cause it's a big, big world 
Big, big hearts got so much love to give 
If you could show me how to find you now 
And somehow let me in Ohhh, i know you're out there, somewhere out there 
Ohhh, i know you're out there, somewhere out there 
And i won't give up until i find that someone 
Ohhh, i know you're out there, somewhere out there I wonder where i'll be, will you find me, or will i crash into you? 
Just hope that the clock strikes at midnight 
And i know the right thing to do 'Cause it's a big, big world 
Big, big hearts can't be alone too long 
And if your heartbeat seems to get too weak 
I'll show you love so strong Ohhh, i know you're out there, somewhere out there 
Ohhh, i know you're out there, somewhere out there 
And i wont give up until i find that someone 
Ohhh, i know you're out there, somewhere out there Could you be, closer than it seems? 
I know it's a struggle, and it feels like there's something in between 'Cause it's a big, big world 
Big, big hearts got so much love to give Ohhh, i know you're out there, somewhere out there 
Ohhh, i know you're out there, somewhere out there 
Now i wont give up until i find that someone 
Ohhh, i know you're out there, somewhere out there
