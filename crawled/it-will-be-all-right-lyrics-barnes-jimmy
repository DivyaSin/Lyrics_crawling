Well a passing glance across a room 
Brought me to your side 
And the words you spoke like melodies 
Made my spirits high. 
If forever seems too long for you 
I'll gladly set you free 
But if I always dream of you 
It will be all right with me. 
Well I always felt alone in life 
Until you came along 
You took away my darkest fears 
And made me feel so strong 
Well I know that nothing stays the same 
I'll have to let you be 
But if I always dream of you 
It will be all right with me 
(BRIDGE) 
You and I are the same 
We need to be loved some time 
But we're scared of the pain 
We find if we waste our time 
Sometimes you have to choose to walk the line 
Even if you're walking blind 
That's the game we play 
And if forever seems too long for you 
I'll gladly set you free 
But if I always dream of you 
It'll be all right with me 
And if I always dream of you 
It will be all right with me
