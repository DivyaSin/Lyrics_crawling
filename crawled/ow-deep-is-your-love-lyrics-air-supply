I know your eyes in the morning sun 
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain 
And the moment that you wonder far from me 
I wanna feel you in my arms again And you come to me 
in a summer breeze keeps me warm with your love and then you softly leave 
And it's me when you need to show, 
how deep is your love, 
is your love, how deep is your love I really need to know 
'cause when living in a world of fools, 
Breaking us down, 
when they all should let us be 
we belong to you and me I believe in you, 
you know my down to my very soul 
You're the light in my deepest darkness hour 
You're my savior when I fall And you may not think I care for you. 
When you know down inside that I really do 
And it's me when you need to show, 
how deep is your love, is your love, 
how deep is your love I really need to know 
'cause when living in a world of fools, 
Breaking us down, 
when they all should let us be 
we belong to you and me You're the light, you're the light And you may not think I care for you. 
When you know down inside that I really do 
And it's me when you need to show, 
how deep is your love, your love, 
how deep is your love I really need to know 
'cause when living in a world of fools, 
Breaking us down, 
when they all should let us be 
you belong to you and me
