The biding of time getting stuck in my mind is a boat to roll 
Two hours later, back in my neighborhood where everything just stalled 
It still looks the same 
They remembered my name, steppin' in for a cup full 
There's a big city man I used to rumble with him back in high school 
The slow cruel hands of time 
Turn you into molten lava, oh my A place on the rise you can stop for awhile 
Look-out for the police man 
There's no street lamps, only three buildings and one of them's vacant 
It's taking all day the packs feeling heavy and soon the night 
Backwards down the mountain, the axle is grinding, pull into the wrong drive 
The sky is in the yard 
The stringy cotton candy is the fall 
The slow climb, the hard the fall 
Sometimes I don't want it at all 
I've done this so long 
It's something I ought know so long Finally up on the pieces disrupting and the birds fly 
Trapped for a moment, the sheriffs department got the wrong guy 
The towns reveal the law 
Visible wind through the fog 
The slow cruel hands of time 
Turning you back into a child
