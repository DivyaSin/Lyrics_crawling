Five a.m. on the bathroom floor from the night before 
Do you find me dreadful? 
What a shame, such a sad disgrace 
Such a pretty face but she's not regretful Am I beautiful? 
Am I usable? It's killing time again 
Put on your face and let's pretend 
These killing lights won't kill us all again Three a.m. on the city street 
When the air is sweet, I've had my mouthful 
But it seems that I'm tired of screams 
Such a pretty face up in will look dreadful, oh Am I beautiful? 
Am I usable? It's killing time again 
Put on your face and let's pretend 
These killing lights won't kill us all again It's killing time again 
Cover your face and we'll pretend 
These killing lights can't kill us all again You seem to always remember, we never forget a face 
When we cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut you up 
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut they remember 
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut you up, cut you up It's killing time again 
Put on your face and let's pretend 
These killing lights won't kill us all again It's killing time again 
Cover your face and we'll pretend 
These killing lights can't kill us all again, all again, all again 
It's time again, it's killing time
