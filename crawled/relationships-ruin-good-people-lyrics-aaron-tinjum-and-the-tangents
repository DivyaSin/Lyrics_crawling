[First Verse] The stars were shining bright 
In the Argentinean night 
But somehow the constellations 
Got unaligned 
And now I'm standing in line 
In tides 
Rolling with my mind 
And masquerading is fine 
If you've got nothing to hide 
Come on and show me the sweeter side [Chorus] And under a crumbling steeple 
Relationships ruin good people 
And they said 
"God gave us love" 
But the devil in Cain 
Killed Abel's dove 
So it's a different day today [Second Verse] Aaron are you a drifter 
Or do you have a home? 
I'm in a bad place 
And I'm basically alone 
Let's just trade our hats 
When it all hits the fan 
You can have it all back 
Living on this beaten track 
Ain't really living at all [Chorus] And under a crumbling steeple 
Relationships ruin good people 
And they said 
"God gave us love" 
But the devil in Cain 
Killed Abel's dove 
So it's a different day today 
And I feel different day to day [Outro] Yeah, it's a different day today 
And I feel different day to day
