Yo, Kane, let's get 'em 
I'm talking blackout 
Put lives to a name, fuck a tapout 
All in together, we gon' wipe 'em 
Wax in revenge mode, time for some action Yeah, relentless, murderous intentions 
The henchmen's garments is all black, [?] pimp this 
Caught up in my spell, smell exotic, blunt from different trees 
Black gloves, bullet's will fly when the 9's squeezed 
Ghost and [?] these, robbing the whole globe 
Black polo, hooded, with Gucci wheels with a nice grip 
So when the blood hit the floor, I won't slip 
Dynamic with my dial-up, you faggots is hog meat 
Crack your cranium like crab does if you cross me 
Raging bulllet of the bull, Mr. Kane is so raunchy Death Row shit, fuck the lethal injection 
Execute him and chop up his body in sections 
Clean cut butcher knives 
X they're eyes out 
Nail 'em to a billboard 
Let 'em dry out Let me a show you a crime about 'em blowing your minds out 
If you ain't ready to throat a nigga then sign out 
Nickel plated 40's are blowing your spine out 
Old school Caddies with coke, come take a line out 
Stingin' niggas for they're jewels in they're stash house 
Snatch a nigga up by his butterfly, sing him a lullaby 
Closed casket, make sure his mother cry 
You fuckin' woth grimy guys, tunes are suicidal 
And now we ain't homies, they call us the homicidal 
Get ready for the mayhem, just call it my arrival Bash him with a disco ball, it's the 70's 
Drop a set of the Daily News so they remember these 
Black bastards, ruthless killers Watch me thrill ya 
Party killers, we won't die 
Hard body bitch made cats is gonna fry 
Solidify we're champions, youngens we're bonafide 
Wanna swim with the sharks, be my guest, go take a dive 
The name of the game is Blood Sport 
You won't make it out alive 
I see what you trying for so give it up 
We terrorize shit, Kane and Ghost, lit it up
