Well I first saw her by the door 
lookin' better than ever before 
I hadn't known her more than a while 
but when I saw her, I threw my bags in a pile.. 
She's waiting, waiting, waiting, for her prince to come.. 
The empty season has come and gone 
and now I've got my true colors on 
Sometimes it ain't easy to tell 
someone when they aren't doin' so well.. 
She's waiting, waiting, waiting, for her prince to come.. 
Sit watchin' tv, and read the news 
doin', you're thinkin' whatever you choose 
One step behind the line 
still hangin' on, still doin' fine.. 
She's waiting, waiting, waiting, for her prince to come.. 
It's been a long day after all 
havin' a great time havin' a ball 
Come the night time, it's oh, so still 
the crescent moon is on the windowsill.. 
She's waiting, waiting, waiting, for her prince to come..
