They pray to the universe 
To end all their misery 
Caused by their ignorance 
They pray to those who would be king To God's we gave to men 
To God's who never were 
Created by our council to divert 
Their minds while we remain on high Demanding their shame 
All seeing eye fathers of hate Confused in a state of fear 
A panicked mind, an endless tear 
Suffer for our chosen children 
Suffer for their pound of flesh The lie king of king 
The lie crucified 
A paper God attached to strings 
Dances to the songs we sing on high Demanding their shame 
All seeing eye won't look away We're here to remind you 
You are enslaved 
You're chained to your fear 
You are enslaved Though freedom surrounds you 
You stay our slave 
And we stay right here As long as you follow the path you've been given 
We'll reap the harvest of pain we have sown 
Don't open your minds, don't ever ask questions 
We'll gladly play games we have already won Abused into servitude 
You're weakened by your faithfulness 
Cover as you want to do 
Believe the lie you think the best And die the death you've been prescribed 
A victim by design you writhe and supplicate 
Question not and seal your fate The eye 'tis in your mind 
All seeing eye never goes blind We're here to remind you 
You are enslaved 
You're chained to your fear 
You are enslaved Though freedom surrounds you 
You stay our slave 
And we stay right here 
You are enslaved We're here to remind you 
You are enslaved 
You're chained to your fear 
You are enslaved Though freedom surrounds you 
You stay our slave 
And we stay right here
