In the front of the line 
Now I'm back at home 
I want to live my life 
In a bathtub Roll a dirty dice 
And you're playin' blood 
Stole a maxipad 
Because I abandoned love It reminds me of salty candy 
Semen shanties 
Sailboats grindin' 
Up against your back I don't need no sentimental 
Penis stencil 
Feelings rising 
Opposites attract She made me feel so small 
I had no say at all 
She looked so cute they say 
But I don't know her that way Heaven hold me back 
Got 20 lives 
Got my jesus jammies 
Need some exercise Take a walk at night 
Past the dating bar 
I want to live my life 
Like a trackstar Na, na na na na na Na, na na na na na 
Na, na na na na na Na, na na na na na 
Na, na na na na na Na, na na na na na 
Na, na na na na na Na, na na na na na
