Maybe I should go back 
I'm gonna think about that 
A little bit more like I did before 
Miserable and mad This one kicks like a mule, plays me for a fool 
Breaks all the rules 
It's doing it wrong, but it's moving along 
Can be very cruel Right in the door, I'm tired, I'm sore 
Nary A Hi, no welcome home 
Yet the minute I'm up, it's pissing me off 
I was yelling so loud last night 
I thought the cops would surely come Six or six-two-five, Keep me alive, keep me alive 
Now do a little turn, careful with your words 
Everything is fine 
But I'm lucky as fuck, still ain't enough, sick to my gut 
Having to say 
You sit here 'till the coast is clear 
I'll send for you one day I shouldn't repeat it 
This sounds ridiculous 
And I swore a solemn oath 
Never to admit it's the harsh tones of criticism 
Seep in to my bones Now look what I did, I'm happy with it 
Aren't you happy for me? 
I love you so much, I'm gonna throw up 
Watch my stuff, hold this for me please Try not to sound bitter 
Or to fondly remember the dark times of the past 
Like I don't deserve it or I'm not even worth it 
I can do this or that 
This or that
