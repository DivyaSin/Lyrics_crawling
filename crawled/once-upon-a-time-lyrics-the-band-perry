Why didn't ya show me 
Why didn't ya let me know 
Why didn't ya hold me 
Why can't you let me go There's a heart ache in New York City keepin you awake all night long 
Something you forgot to say to make me stay 
If I was the best you never had Why didn't ya show me 
Why didn't ya let me know 
Why didn't ya hold me 
Why can't you let me go Once upon a time 
Once upon a time 
You wanna go back to the night we left behind 
Well maybe I don't know much about nothin, but I know a little bit about lovin' 
There's just no going back to once upon a time You could never be more in love with me 
I saw it in your eyes on that winter night 
But I never, never, never felt so cold 
You hid your heart 
What I don't know can't keep me warm 
So Why didn't ya show me 
Why didn't ya let me know 
Why didn't ya hold me, hold me 
Why can't you let me go Once upon a time 
Once upon a time 
You wanna go back to the night we left behind 
Well maybe I don't know much about nothin, but I know a little bit about lovin' 
There's just no going back to once upon a time Once upon a time 
Once upon a time 
Once upon a time 
Once upon a time 
I coulda, I coulda blown your mind. Once upon a time 
Once upon a time 
I don't wanna go back to the night we left behind 
Well baby 
I don't know much about nothin', but I know a little bit about lovin' 
There's just no going back to once upon a time Once upon a time 
I don't wanna go back 
I don't wanna go back 
I don't wanna go back 
'Cause baby 
I don't know much about nothin', but I know a little bit about lovin' 
There's just no going back to once upon a time Why did ya let me go
