(S. DuboffA. Kornfeld) 
Your father is a V.I.P. 
He thinks he's always right 
Your mother watches her T.V. 
Won't talk to you all night Couldn't help sitting up so high 
He's gotta find love 
He's never seen a flower tree 
Or anything that close And everyday I'll pass and say 
Hey! How is the air up there 
How is the air up there 
How is the air up there 
According to you I just don't care 
I'm falling on the ground First time that you saw me 
Said you'd hope I would change 
Well, your friends took one look at me 
And they sure acted strange Haven't seen you in a month 
And you wonder what it's all about 
Well, next time I'm in prison, love 
Come and, well bail me out And everyday I'll pass and say 
Hey! How is the air up there 
How is the air up there 
How is the air up there 
According to you I just don't care 
I'm falling on the ground You tried to put the blame on me 
You've got a lot of nerve 
You say you're so lonely, well 
It's all that you deserve When you get tired of your 
Love of life in high society 
Well, get some kicks and take a trip 
And come on down with me And everyday I'll pass and say 
Hey! How is the air up there 
How is the air up there 
How is the air up there 
According to you I just don't care 
I'm falling on the ground How is the air up there...
