My mind is under an attack, 
although no one sees 
My past is pounding in the back of my memories 
It's always there to poison my mind with all I do 
Feelings I know so well seem to come back 
as if nothing's ever changed Fear was one of the reasons to crawl away into a world I lost 
I know the rules,I play the game 
but somehow it always stays the same 
In spite of my will,in spite of my hope,in spite of it all So for those who believe in this life, 
spand right on this circle-must be round 
Every turn has its vortex,you'll drown if nobody warns you 
and shows you another circle of life Nothing will change, 
nothing is done for the victim I am forced to remain 
Cause these days make you feel,and you are,on your own Study,work hard,marry,reproduce and become the perfect model 
Can you stand the test of time if life is a vicious circle 
without the mirror of another path So for those who believe in this life 
stand right on the circle-must be round 
Every turn has its vortex,you'll drown if nobody warns you 
and shows you another circle of life
