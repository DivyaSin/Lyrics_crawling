I wonder around the streets so lonely and empty 
Lost in a crowd, but I can't hide 
Is there a place where I can escape to? 
A desert island where I can die 
The Damage of Life is neverending 
There is no escape and we can't hide 
Maybe our time is up, but we don't want to 
Face up to facts there is little that is life 
I see the pain, but do not face it 
Breathlessly peering on a broken plate 
Mirror, Oh Mirror is there any answer?
