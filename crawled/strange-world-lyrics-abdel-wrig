Cork your ears if you don't like what me say 
Cork your ears if you don't like what me say 
Me a go spit out the truth 
Tired to see the youth them clean car glass 
And people a tell them 'bout them claat 
They are the future slipping fast 
Seems like they only aggravate 
Have you ever thought about their case 
Actions, navigate their fate [Chorus] 
I would like to change, living in this strange world 
I would like to change, reality sometimes the blame, 
Living in this strange world, destiny play games Area leaders and thugs a run them turf 
Now shot a buss to blouse and skirt 
Innocent and the guilty getting hurt 
Me like to see the ghetto hold the peace 
But gunshot a spread like it's disease 
News on TV makes me weep [Chorus]
