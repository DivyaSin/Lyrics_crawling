I'll give back your pogo stick 
As soon as you return my wasted time 
And then I'll be fine 
I'll feel so much more nostalgic As soon as all my cheques are countersigned 
I'm sure I'll be fine 
Are you panicking or just groveling? 
I want to empathize So how does it feel 
When the guilt bites into your veins? 
How does it feel 
You cheeky, cheeky little monkey? How does it feel 
When your conscious burns in your brain 
I gotta know 
How does it feel? Been there done that don't like re-runs 
If I do I'll rent the video 
And cancel your show 
Does somebody need a big hug? Call me up when I'm in Mexico 
Spending your dough 
Are you worrying or just sniveling? 
I want to empathize So how does it feel 
When the guilt bites into your veins? 
How does it feel 
You cheeky, cheeky little monkey? How does it feel 
When your conscious burns in your brain 
I gotta know 
How does it feel? Are you shivering, are you anything? 
I want to empathize 
How does it feel? 
How does it feel? How does it feel, cheeky monkey? 
I gotta know 
So how does it feel 
When the knife is stuck in your back? How does it feel 
You cheeky, cheeky little monkey? 
How does it feel 
When your anger boomerangs you? I gotta know 
How does it feel? 
How does it feel? 
How does it feel? How does it feel? 
How does it feel? 
How does it feel? 
I gotta know
