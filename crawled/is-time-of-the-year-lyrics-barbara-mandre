Little girls and little boys 
Dream of worlds full of toys 
This time of the year 
When Christmas is near And evergreens are snowy white 
Sleigh bells ring through the night 
This time of the year 
When Christmas is near And somewhere near a steeple 
People kneel and pray 
And choirs sing carols 
Of Christmas Day Santa Claus is on his way 
With loads of joy on his sleigh 
This time of the year 
When Christmas is near When Christmas is near Oh, Santa Claus is on his way 
With loads of joy on his sleigh 
This time of the year 
When Christmas is near
