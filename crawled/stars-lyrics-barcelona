Tuesday came and I feigned happy 
I'm so lonely here 
This thing between my lungs is 
Making me so tired 
It's bleeding me You know me and how I hate this 
We've said enough for now 
Although it's been three hours 
We haven't spoke at all Oh, inside this empty cabinet 
Nothing shines in here On the edge of night 
We look down on our streets and houses 
You felt sick, so I drove back And if we go back to stars 
We won't need any money 
We won't need these poor hearts This crowd incites my riots 
I'll try to calm them down 
Criminals compound my weakness 
I'm barely hanging on 
They're bleeding me Oh, why can't I feel it? 
Nothing hurts down here On the edge of night 
We look down on our streets and houses 
You felt sick so I drove back And if we go back to stars 
We won't need any money 
We won't need these poor hearts On the edge of night 
We look down on our streets and houses 
You felt sick so I drove back And if we go back to stars 
We won't need any money 
We won't need these poor hearts
