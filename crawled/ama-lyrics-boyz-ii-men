You taught me everything 
And everything you've given me 
I always keep it inside 
You're the driving force in my life, yeah There isn't anything 
Or anyone that I can be 
And it just wouldn't feel right 
If I didn't have you by my side You were there for me to love and care for me 
When skies were gray 
Whenever I was down 
You were always there to comfort me And no one else can be what you have been to me 
You will always be 
you always will be the girl 
In my life for all times [Chorus] 
Mama, mama you know I love you 
Oh you know I love you 
Mama, mama you're the queen of my heart 
Your love is like 
Tears from the stars 
Mama, I just want you to know 
Lovin' you is like food to my soul Yes it is, yes it is, oh 
yes it is, 
yes it is, yes it is, oh You're always down for me 
Have always been around for me even when I was bad 
You showed me right from my wrong 
Yes you did And you took up for me 
When everyone was downin' me 
You always did understand 
You gave me strength to go on There was so many times 
Looking back when I was so afraid 
And then you'd come to me 
And say to me I could face anything And no one else can do 
What you have done for me 
You'll always be 
You will always be the girl in my life [Chorus] Never gonna go a day without you 
Fills me up just thinking about you 
I'll never go a day without my mama [Chorus] Oh 
You are the food to my soul 
Yes you are
