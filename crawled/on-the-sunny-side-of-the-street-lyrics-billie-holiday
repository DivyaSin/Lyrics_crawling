Grab your coat and get your hat 
Leave your worry on the doorstep 
Just direct your feet 
To the sunny side of the street 
Can't you hear a pitter pat 
And that happy tune is your step 
Life can be so sweet 
On the sunny side of the street I used to walk in the shade 
With those blues on parade 
But no I'm not afraid 
This Rover crossed over If I never have a cent 
I'd be rich as Rockefeller 
Gold dust at my feet 
On the sunny side of the street Grab your coat and get your hat 
Leave your worry on the doorstep 
Just direct your feet 
To the sunny side of the street 
Can't you hear a pitter pat 
And that happy tune is your step 
Life can be so sweet 
On the sunny side of the street I used to walk in the shade 
With those blues on parade 
But no I'm not afraid 
This Rover crossed over If I never have a cent 
I'd be rich as Rockefeller 
With gold dust at my feet 
On the sunny side of the street
