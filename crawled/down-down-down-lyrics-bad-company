Well, I'm deep down I saw you baby in the corner of my eye 
You were looking oh so fine 
You drove by me in a purple Cadillac 
Heading for a friend of mine 
I saw you later down on highway 41 
Doin' ?bout a hundred and three 
I tried to catch ya, but baby I lost ya 
Baby won't you come home with me I want to take you down down down 
I'm so deep down in love (down down down) 
Babe you got me fallin' (down down down) 
Babe I'm so deep down in love Come on baby won't you take me with you 
I need a shot of rhythm and blues 
I know to stop, but the band is so hot 
Ain't got nothing to lose 
Oh, mama mama lookin' so cool 
I want to make you mine all mine 
You know baby you're driving me crazy 
You're driving me out of my mind I want to take you down down down 
I'm so deep down in love (down down down) 
Babe you got me fallin' (down down down) 
Babe I'm so deep down in love (Down down down) 
Babe I'm so deep down in love (down down down) 
You know you got me goin' (down down down) 
Babe I'm so deep down in love, no, no, no 
You know that I want ya, got to have ya, want ya, need ya 
Got to, want ya, yeah 
Babe I'm so deep down in love I know 
Yeah, yeah 
Deep down in fallen baby 
Callin? in you
