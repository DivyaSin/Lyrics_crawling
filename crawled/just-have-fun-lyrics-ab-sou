Have some fun out there 
Smells like fucking dope in here 
Son, do the drugs don't let drugs do you 
Son, do the drugs don't let drugs do you 
Son, do the drugs don't let drugs do you 
Son, do the drugs don't let drugs do you 
Son, do the drugs don't let drugs do you 
Son, do the drugs don't let drugs do you Up jumps the Boogie bitch, I boogie board on these instruments 
Riding the wave like a lie detector, if I'm lying I'm flying, nah 
If I'm lying I'm lying, in dirt, that's a metaphor for dying 
Miming like Morpheus foresaw me saving Zion 
More fire, that's more fire, that's more fire, that's more 
(smoke that weed nigga) 
Set that mouse trap, you fuck around, yeah you fuck around and get smoked 
Got that loud pack in these Backwoods like summer camp, burn that (roll that weed nigga) 
We used to dub cassettes but now we poppin' Percocets 
I don't be in no pain, I just like how it feels 
I close my eyes and follow beetles in strawberry fields 
Munchie munchie, Welch's fruit snacks and Mrs. Fields 
Wicked as Aleister Crowley do you niggas know the deal? 
(Son, do the drugs don't let the drugs do you) 
Psy-Psy-Psychedelic savage and I'm telepathic too 
Ask Al Boy and A-Mack about when me and Q did shrooms! 
And that one ho was getting grooved in the next room 
I flow like, Russel Crowe when the beautiful mind 
That's a colorful touch like homosexual hugs and I try to tell these motherfuckers all of the time (roll that weed nigga) 
Don't forget my dash or you'll get left behind! (shake that ass up) 
I'm fast, another one bites the dust just at the sight of us 
They liking us, to lightening striking over Mount Everest 
That ever so, talented establishment 
TDE. Jay Rock, K Dot, ScHoolboy, me, Soul When I cross the street I look both ways 
Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face 
Niggas talk more than bitches These Days 
And the new drugs got a nigga trippy These Days! 
Just Have Some Fun (got that Dopamine, I mean dope) 
Yeah, let's have some fun 
Just Have Some Fun (That Dopamine, I mean dope) 
Yeah, let's have some fun I just wanna teach you all about the mind 
The power in it, the very power of mine 
It makes sense I take interest in the third eye 
Due to my lack of sight, I guess it's a sacrifice 
Cause I've already envisioned what the world looks like 
So when it's handed to me, I won't need to look twice 
That's why I read a lot of books, so I got straight A's 
Katrina cleared my absences so I could walk the stage 
I never paid tuition, but I paid attention 
That's why I gotta make it count when they pay admission 
Took my third hit of DMT and then I melted in 
(Met the devil in God's elbow) 
And this is what he said... When I cross the street I look both ways 
Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face 
Niggas talk more than bitches These Days 
And the new drugs got a nigga trippy These Days! 
Just Have Some Fun (got that Dopamine, I mean dope) 
Yeah, let's have some fun 
Just Have Some Fun (That Dopamine, I mean dope) 
Yeah, let's have some fun Hi my name is Jimmy 
(Hi Jimmy)

You may, you may, also know me as the white Ab-Soul 
I'm from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 
I like Denim Jeans 
And I'm an alcoholic...
