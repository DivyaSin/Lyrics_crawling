There's a lot of ways of saying what I want to say to you 
There's songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true 
But I won't talk of starry skies or moonlight on the ground 
I'll come right out and tell you I'd just love to lay you down Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear 
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear 
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around 
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down There's so many ways your sweet love made this house into a home 
You've got a way of doing little things that really turn me on 
Like standing in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown 
Oh, darling how I'd love to lay you down Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear 
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear 
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around 
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down A whole lot of Decembers are showin' in your face 
Your auburn hair has faded and silver takes its place 
You'll still be beautiful and I'll still be around 
And if I can, I'd love to lay you down Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear 
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear 
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around 
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down 
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down 
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
