I tell you a story, but you won't listen 
It's about a nightmare steeped in tradition 
It's the story of a coked-up pansy 
Who spent his nights in flights of fancy 
Met two fellas over gin and mixes 
They talked for a while and soon got the picture 
One was a soaped-up soho mincer 
The other was a pikey with a knowledge of scriptures The conversation turned evil 
They talked about people
