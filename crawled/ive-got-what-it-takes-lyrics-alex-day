There are so many souls who don't follow their dreams 
Ignoring their passions makes no sense to me 
I could love or waste time to follow the seasons 
But I think I regret it when I fall asleep I don't have super powers, there's no magic spell 
But I remain faithful for things to go well 
I'm not looking for miracles; at least for today 
I know I've got what it takes And it's hard when you start and it's never at ease 
Stars are so far but they'll always be seen 
I can't pretend I just make things with no rhyme or reason 
Boy, the work's worth it when I fall asleep I don't have super powers, there's no magic spell 
But I remain faithful for things to go well 
I'm not looking for miracles; at least for today 
I know I've got what it takes There's no end in sight 
So I'll take my time 
Crossing the lines 
Keep holding on, keep singing this song And if people don't like it, well it won't bother me 
Failure's still something I can say I've achieved 
I won't forget their opinion; moving on isn't easy 
But not doing things would be boring, indeed I don't have super powers, there's no magic spell 
But I remain faithful for things to go well 
I'm not looking for miracles; at least for today 
I know I've got what it takes I know I've got what it takes
