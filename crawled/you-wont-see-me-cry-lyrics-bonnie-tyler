You just walked out my door 
I'm telling you I can't take it 
Can't take it any more 
Everytime you make it happen 
Feels so sad - cold and sad 
Don't you miss my tender love 
Temptation is knocking but you can't fight it -you won't see me cry 
Please baby baby come 
-you won't see me cry 
Please baby baby 
-you won't see me cry 
Please baby baby come 
-you won't see me cry 
Please baby baby I'm begging you not to go now 
Please don't go away 
I just can't take all this heartache 
Baby please stay 
Everytime you make it happen 
Feels so sad and cold inside 
Don't you miss my tender love 
Temptation is knocking but you can't fight it -you won t see me cry
