Give me a world 
That's equal on all sides 
Let freedom flow 
As constant as the tides 
I pray with each sunset 
Don't forget to rise (Don't forget to rise) 
I live without regret for ordinary lives I'm looking at life through my own eyes 
Searching for a hero to idolize 
Feeling the pain as innocence dies 
I'm looking at life through my own eyes 
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day 
I listen to my heart and I obey 
How can I see it any other way 
I'm looking at life (looking at life) 
Through my own eyes I see a land 
With liberty for all 
Yet still I know 
The truth will rise and fall (Oooh, yeah, yeah) 
That's just the way it goes 
A word now to the wise 
The world was made to change 
Each day is a suprise I'm looking at life through my own eyes 
Searching for a hero to idolize 
Feeling the pain as innocence dies 
I'm looking at life through my own eyes 
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day 
I listen to my heart and I obey 
How can I see it any other way 
I'm looking at life (looking at life) 
Through my own eyes And I know when you're looking for the truth (mmmmm) 
If you go 
And read between the lines 
You'll discover how and why I take my heart in to battle 
Give that freedom bell a rattle 
Get my independance signed 
Declare it on the dotted line 
Let the Philadelphia freedom ring 
And patriotic, voices sing 
Red, white, and blue never give up 
You represent America I'm looking at life through my own eyes 
Searching for a hero to idolize 
Feeling the pain as innocence dies 
I'm looking at life through my own eyes (Oohhh yeah) 
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day 
I listen to my heart and I obey 
How can I see it any other way 
I'm looking at life (looking at life) 
Through my own eyes
