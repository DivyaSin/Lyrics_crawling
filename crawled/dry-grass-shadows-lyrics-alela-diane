There are things that I've seen in my head while I'm sleeping in bed 
They do not wither in the morning light 
I'm taken back, oh I'm taken back to the dry grass and the shadows Thinking I'd like to look at your teeth lined up in perfect rows 
A maze of children feeding orchard trees 
Where the flat lands stretch inside your mouth 
And when you laugh all the star thistles stumble out 
The flat lands stretch inside your mouth 
And when you laugh all the star-thistles stumble out Strong spines of valley hills all overgrown in gold 
Look softer than a spool of old silk thread 
But if we walked down with our feet 
I'd be pulling spines and barbs and fox tails from your skin 
Oh, if we walked down with our feet 
I'd be pulling spines and barbs and fox tails from your skin There are things that I've seen in my head while I'm sleeping in bed 
They do not wither in the morning light 
I'm taken back, oh I'm taken back to the dry grass and the shadows 
I'm taken back, oh I'm taken back to the dry grass and the shadows
