I must've been fooled when you touched my heart 
Skies were red and blazing 
I heard a moan in the elms above 
And I knew the day was ending I knew you'd seen your happiest day 
When the next morn the birds were singing 
We felt the same cold from the earth It took the moon to hold the tide 
And set our hearts a spinning 
You'd wait for dark never come again I'll turn my back to the calling sun 
If you'll rise and meet me 
I'll walk the road I took from you 
Oh, stay a while and the red sky is blazing Touch my heart and feel my burning 
For the day you left 
For the arms above To me, those birds are singing
