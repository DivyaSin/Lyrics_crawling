Man it is what it is, 
Can't understand a man if you ain't lived what he lived 
Roaches in the crib, Ain't got no food up in the fridge 
Plus the crime running' rampant and it's screwing up the kids 
Sway, admit - What kind of paradise is this? 
I just want some 40 acres and some carats on the wrist But these snakes is tryna gather in the pit 
Where you get a cottonmouth plucking' ashes off the clip 
Off the rip, now a challenger exists 
And he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this? 
Got thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips 
Sayin' "empty out the drawer" before he pound you with the grip 
Lord, who to call when no one obeys the law 
And there ain't no Iron Man that can come and save us all? Power to the people and Luke Cage the cause 
And the cops got it wrong, We don't think Cage involved 
Look, dog, a hero never had one 
Already took Malcolm and Martin this is the last one 
I beg your pardon, somebody pulling' a fast one 
And now we got a hero for hire and he a black one 
And bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion 
We in Harlem's Paradise tell the captain 
That I'm about to trade the mic for a magnum Yeah, cause this is bulletproof love 
And you already know what a bulletproof does 
So you can take it from a bulletproof thug 
The hood got his back, dog
