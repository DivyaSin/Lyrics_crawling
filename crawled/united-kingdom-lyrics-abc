There`s a gang I`ve just joined 
There`s a gang I`ve just joined 
Three million strong you`d agree 
Four million strong you`d agree 
Enrollment was easy, so easy 
Getting out proves to be the difficulty From Land`s End to John O`Groats 
From Land`s End to John O`Groats 
They are making ends meet 
Mending holes in their coat 
Fasting and feasting on bread and margarine 
Burning dreams build upon buried hopes United Kingdom - you`d better ring them 
You`ve a solution - you better bring them 
United Kingdom - United Kingdom 
You`ve a solution - you better bring them Opportunity, I guess they all came and went 
Finding it hard 
Finding the rent you`ll find it funny 
With your finger running down 
Situations vacant 
In school he was an athlete 
Now he`s not so self-assured 
"After all of these O-levels is this my reward?" 
There`s a silent majority, that`s seen and 
never heard from Charles I, Charles II 
To Charles III United Kingdom - you`d better ring them 
You`ve a solution - you better bring them 
United Kingdom - United Kingdom This busted, rusted, upper-crusted 
Bankrupted done and dusted 
No-man-to-be-trusted United Kingdom Proud to stand beneath the Union Jack? 
Happy dealing up a no ace pack? 
Polishing black boots 
Priming the riot squad 
There go I but for the grace of God 
Covering up the agony with mindless entertainment 
You`ll be happy when they`re ripping up the pavement 
Bringing down the axe on steelworks and foundries 
Someone said love knows no boundaries 
Close your eyes and think of England 
Lie back and think of her United Kingdom - you better ring them 
You`ve a solution - you better bring them
