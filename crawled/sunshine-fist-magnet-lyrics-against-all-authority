A cold December in a sleepy town 
it's no different your a freak 
and they don't want you around 
Got daddy's car on a Friday night 
Just a speed bump in a privileged life. 
There ain't no justice if your not like them. 
You stand out in the crowd like a target with your friends. 
So much more than what they see, 
they're afraid of someone who lives so free. [Chorus: x2] 
Fist Magnet, conform to this decay, 
Fist Magnet, why won't you obey? 
Fist Magnet, more than what they see 
now there's a little less sunshine here today. It's dark outside 
they extinguish your light, 
the ninjas in the Caddie 
roll silently out of sight. 
Got daddy's car on a Friday night 
Just a speed bump in a privileged life. 
It's true we're just like you and we'll carry on, 
and I hope that one day I can be just half as strong, 
and you walk with us to this day 
AND WE'RE ALL BRIAN DENEKE! [Chorus x2] I WALK IN THE LIGHT I REFUSE TO HIDE! 
I'LL BE MYSELF AND I WILL LIVE WITH PRIDE! 
I WON'T BE DENIED! FIST MAGNET 
FIST MAGNET 
FIST MAGNET! [Chorus x2]
