She'd rather wear a pair of cut-off jeans 
Than a fancy evening dress 
And with her windows rolled down 
And her hair all blown around 
She's a hot southern mess She'll take a beer over white wine 
A campfire over candle light 
And when it comes to love 
Oh her idea of, a romantic night Listenin' to old Alabama, drivin' through Tennessee 
A little dixieland delight at the right time of the night 
And she can't keep her hands off of mee! And now we're rollin' down an old back road 
I got the steering wheel in one hand 
We'll find a hideaway where she and I can play 
In mother nature's band Now we're listenin' to old Alabama 
Parked somewhere in Tennessee 
A little dixieland delight and it feels so right 
And it's love in the first degree ee ee! Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane, 
Or some ol' righteous brothers song 
And Barry White ain't gonna work tonight 
If you really wanna turn her on 
Play some back home come on music 
That comes from the heart 
Play something with lots of feeling 
'cause that's where music has to start Now we're listenin' to old Alabama 
And we're drivin' through Tennessee 
A little dixieland delight and it feels so right 
And its love in the first degree Yeah' you know we're listenin' to old Alabama (old Alabama) 
Drivin' through Tennessee (Tennessee) 
A little why lady why at the right time of the night 
Oh and she can't keep her hands off of mee Oh, play me some old Alabama 
Oh, play me some old Alabama 
Won't you play me some old Alabama 
Oh pla ee ay ay, yee haw! So the one you loved just left you for another 
And your down 
Or you lost your job and you need a drink 
You look around and start to think 
That no one understands what you been through
