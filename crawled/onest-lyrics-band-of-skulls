You gotta be honest 
You gotta be guarded 
You sure aren't gonna say Right on the inside 
That is the hardest 
The hardest game to play You sorted it all out 
And managed to slip through 
The night into the day Life and a soul 
Do you ever get lonely? 
I'm gonna take you on Found a way to understand the things I'm learning 
Found a way to understand the time you're burning 
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning 
Found a way to understand the time you're burning Gotta be honest 
You gotta be guarded 
You sure aren't gonna say Right on the inside 
That is the hardest 
The hardest game to play Life and a soul 
Do you ever get lonely? 
I'm gonna take you on Found a way to understand the things I'm learning 
Found a way to understand the time you're burning 
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning 
Found a way to understand the time you're burning I'm gonna take you on Gotta be honest 
You gotta be guarded 
You sure aren't gonna say Right on the inside 
That is the hardest 
The hardest game to play
