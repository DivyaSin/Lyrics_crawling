Before the kids 
Before my wife 
Before I bought the farm 
and bought into this grown up life 
She was there just running on the beach 
A wild island baby 
A little bit out of reach 
With the crazy eyes 
and the coal black hair 
A look that said just take me home 
and I will always be there I'm not the first man to ever write 
a song about K9 Love 
Not afraid to stand in front of you 
today my friends and say it's Jane I love 
She won't sit and she won't stay 
I say come she runs away 
Can't hear worth a damn, but heaven knows 
I'm gonna miss her when she goes Where the water was cold 
where the river ran fast 
The man said that dip you take 
oh might be your last 
She dove in and left me no doubt, no doubt 
There was one way in that raging river 
there was no way out 
I heard her crying 
as I watched her slip away 
now I ain't no hero 
but I risked life and limb that day I'm not the first man to ever write 
a song about K9 Love 
Not afraid to stand in front of you 
tonight my friends 
and say it's Jane I love 
She likes to hunt she likes to kill 
she likes the couch even better still 
Never gonna win a prize but heaven knows 
I'm gonna miss her when she goes You might think I'm a bit sick 
Or maybe I'm a heretic 
Maybe I'm just dyslexic but you see 
That D O G is like a G O D to me I'm not the first man to ever write 
a song about K9 Love 
Not afraid to stand in front of you tonight my friends 
and say it's Jane I love 
She won't sit 
and she won't stay 
I say come she runs away 
Can't hear worth a damn but heavenknows 
I'm gonna miss her when she goes
