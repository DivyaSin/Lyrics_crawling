I used to see the night so anxious, but now I know 
The only thing it ever taught me was a grand illusion 
That comes and goes, the city blanketed of snow What if we die, no end and no conclusion 
How could you smile, just walk away 
Well I don't know 
I don't know I met you at the railroad station, now years ago 
And something happened on the night I last drank with you in the neon glow 
Now I don't see you anymore The Midwestern sky, is gray and cold 
The sun never shines, but that's alright 
And I couldn't find the letters that you wrote me 
What did you write? 
Where'd you go, well I don't know, no
