"OK This is a song called reason 41. 
One two three four" Well I used to wonder why that 
When it's black there is no white 
And why that when it's day 
There is never any night 
I got talking to a soldier and he tried to set things right 
He said, "If you want peace them you will always have to fight" 
Hey I went searching in the desert 
Where it just began to rain 
And I met up with this drunken bum who said he'd "lost his name" 
He said, "I put it in this bottle and it drifted out to sea". 
I said, "there is no water here" and he walked away from me So then I asked for help from a very clever man 
He kept looking down at his figures 
He was a very busy man 
I told him what the problem was He said, "that's sad. I'd like to help you boy but there is nothing I can add" "Guitar" Now my throat was getting dry And I was feeling kinda rough 
But I just kept on searching 'till that I'd had enough 
I came across a doctor he said, "his cure was the best" 
He diagnosed my troubles, but I didn't get no rest "One more time" Now I was really kind of puzzed 
By the things that had been said 
And all the people that I've mentioned started spinning round my head 
I gave it up for lost and it suddenly was clear 
The only reason you are there is 'cos I'm over here Hey!
