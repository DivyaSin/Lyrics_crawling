(Agnetha Fltskog / Bosse Carlgren) You're not the good kind, the soft and sweet kind 
I don't think mom would like your smile. 
The way my ears ring, the way my arms cling 
I know that your kind drives me wild. Golliwog, 
Oooh the way you kiss is really slap-dash, Golliwog. 
Love me, love me! 
Fire, fire, 
Something's burning, something's burning, 
Something's burning, oooh, something's burning! I know that you're a brute 
Always raw and rude and crude, 
But wow, your cheeky ways get me right in the mood! Yeah, you do make me feel all right 
So please just hold me, hold me tight, 
You can stay here with me, you can stay here with me, 
Tell me please that you'll stay all night. You're not the true kind, the only-you kind 
I guess my mom would say you're bad. 
The way you make love, the way you take love 
I know that your kind drives me mad. Golliwog, 
Oooh the way you kiss is really slap-dash, Golliwog. 
Love me, love me! 
Fire, fire, 
Something's burning, something's burning, 
Something's burning, oooh, something's burning! I know that you're a brute 
Always raw and rude and crude, 
But wow, your cheeky ways get me right in the mood!
