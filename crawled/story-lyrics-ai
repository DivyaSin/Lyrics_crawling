There are times I can't explain...what can I say? 
You've given so much to me, memories to stay 
As time goes by I wonder why, I just couldn't be myself 
I didn't want to show my heart, afraid to be apart For so long, I've kept it inside of me 
Didn't have a place where I could let go 
But then you came into my life and I 
Found the strength to be myself again 
There will be no sky too high
