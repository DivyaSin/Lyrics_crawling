Young at heart 
Yet what a start 
Old before their time 
Married young 
For love at last 
It was there only crime How come I love them now 
How come I love them more 
But all I wanted to do when I was 
Old was to walk out the door Young at heart 
Yet not a chance 
To be a child at all 
They told me tales 
They told me lies 
I shouldn't have known at all How come I love them now 
How come I love them more 
But all I wanted to do when I was 
Old was to walk out the door Young at heart 
Should exercise 
Who's right who's wrong 
Two brothers two more hearts 
Too hard to take it all How come I love them now 
How come I love them more 
But all I wanted to do when I was 
Old was to walk out the door
