I'm gone, so numb 
Tryna getcha some, couldn't get a crumb 
You know what I want, even if when you don't 
Imma give it to you anyway you want 
Want, want, look don't stare 
Give it to me now, yeah yeah yeah 
You don't give a fuck, I don't really care 
Put one in the air Spin my body round, like a merry go 
Round n round n round, just can't get enough 
Get it get it up, turn my body on 
You got what I want 
Got a problem, you're the antidote 
Give it to me now, it's okay 
Getti getti up, turn my body on 
I got what you need [Chorus] 
You're looking at the baddest chick in the building 
Don't show love and I don't catch feelings 
Shine all day, play all night 
I could pimp a guy, that's what I feel like 
That's what I feel like, feel like 
That's what I feel like, feel like 
That's how I feel 
Feel like, swear I feel 
Like the baddest chick in here's right here. Come rude boy crash into my bumper What it do boy, move your body closer 
Oh oh oh, gimme that yeah, yeah 
'Till my knees get weak 'n your body drip sweat 
Yeah, A play no games. flip your wig boy go insane 
Go go stupid, loco, whatever 
You already know it's whatever Spin my body round, like a merry go 
Round n round n round, just can't get enough 
Get it get it up, turn my body on 
You got what I want 
Got a problem, you're the antidote 
Give it to me now, it's okay 
Getti getti up, turn my body on 
I got what you need [Chorus] Baddest the slickest no I was never the richest 
We're dealing strictly with business 
So you can call me the fittest 
I'm turning dreams into winning 
So I'm determined to finish 
You looking at the baddest chick on the scene [Chorus]
