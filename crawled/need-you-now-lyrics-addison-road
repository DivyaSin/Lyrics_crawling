I've been trying to win 
Trying to fend for myself way too long 
Living in doubt, living without, I've been so alone 
I know that I need you, and I know that I need you now 
I was wasting my time trying to find 
Something real for my soul 
And now that I am here, you're making it clear 
I'm not my own 
I know that I need you, and I know that I need you now Now, this all I am 
Here, with my outstretched hands 
cause i really need you 
and i know that i need you now. 
Now, I'm giving you everything now I am running in place to try and erase all that I've done 
But you find a way to replace my pain with love 
And I know that I need you, I know that I need you now Now, this is all that i am 
here with my outstretched hands 
coz i really need you 
i know that i really need you When I'm afraid, you comfort me 
When I'm ashamed, you lift me up 
Yeah you lift me up Now, this is all that I want 
Here, is where I belong 
Now, I'm giving you everything now When I'm afraid, you comfort me 
When I am ashamed, you show me how 
I need you now Now, this is all that i am 
here with my outstretched hands 
coz i really need you 
i know that i really need you
