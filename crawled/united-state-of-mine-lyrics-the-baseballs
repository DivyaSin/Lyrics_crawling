Blind by the lights when the music died and the show was done 
The room was a crowd but it felt like we were the only ones 
Where have you been hiding? You're love providing, 
Chorus: 
Now I'm all out of time, I'm all out off time 
To know that you were mine, know that you were mine 
Cause when I realized you left me for America 
Now I'm all out of tune, I'm all out of key, 
The day I realized you left me for America, 
I wake up in the evening and 
I reach for your hand in my bed 
I try to figure out why your side is made and cold instead, 
I wish that you confided, and not try to hide it, 
(Chorus) 
And all the words you said are empy now, 
Just like my dreams, 
they come back to hunt me, 
and if our paths cross once again my dear, 
I'll be hanging on, til I see you, 
(Chorus x2) 
For America (x3)
