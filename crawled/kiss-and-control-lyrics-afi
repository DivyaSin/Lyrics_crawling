Watch the stars 
Turn you to nothing 
Now blush and smile 
as they whisk you away Part your lips a bit more, 
I'll swallow your fear. 
I will show you how 
All the bite marks impress 
A need to be here 
I need to see City lights, like rain 
Dance and explode 
Fall upon debutantes, Reeling from nights that 
Kiss and control 
All of our 
Broken hearts Velvet burns 
Wrists while restraining. 
You blushed and smiled 
And said you would stay. One more time steal my breath 
I'll feed you the sky. 
I will show you how 
Steal the glamour from death, 
And before you die 
Oh, you should see City lights, like rain 
Dance and explode 
Fall upon debutantes Reeling from nights that 
Kiss and control 
All of our 
Broken hearts Our hearts, 
Our hearts "We all want to die like movie stars," 
You said 
As you jumped from the height 
of our cutting room floor. 
While above us 
Glowing, exploding, 
Our dreams 
Burst forth in light and death. Hold me and tell me, 
"We'll burn like stars, 
We'll burn as we fall." 
Watch as city lights dance for us. City lights, like rain 
Dance and explode 
Fall upon the pain of our lives 
As they 
Kiss and control. 
Fall upon the pain of our lives 
As they 
Dance and explode. City lights, like rain, 
City lights so caress me 
Kiss and control 
All of our 
Broken hearts
