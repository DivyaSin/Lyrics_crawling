[Verse 1] 
Another week is coming to the end 
City lights can thrill but they don't mend 
Me not only tired i can stand 
All pleasures are turning to sand [Verse 2] 
Pressure of my dreams don't let me breathe 
I am fully fed up with this peace 
Somewhere I will find the needed keys 
Maybe on the top of highest trees [Chorus x2] 
My mind keeps on traveling 
While i'm stuck in the routine 
It's a decision not a feeling 
This lifestyle has no meaning [Verse 3] 
I'm not too much different it's a trend 
Feeling not much happy but i tend 
Why do all these people shake my hand 
All i want is singing with my band [Chorus x2] 
My mind keeps on traveling 
While i'm stuck in the routine 
It's a decision not a feeling 
This lifestyle has no meaning Tonight we are traveling to the places 
Where our fantasies gonna take us [Chorus x2] 
My mind keeps on traveling 
While i'm stuck in the routine 
It's a decision not a feeling 
This lifestyle has no meaning On travelling. In the routine. Not a feeling. No meaning. 
On travelling. In the routine. Not a feeling. No meaning.
