I'll Take The Tears Don't speak, seal your lips. 
Please don't say a word. 
Maybe I won't remember, 
The words I have not heard. 
I see that you're in love, 
I know it's not with me. 
But I don't want the truth, 
To haunt my memory. It's never too late to relight the fire, 
It never stopped burning from me. 
The flame it never died inside of me. How is it now that I can tell you I love you? 
How is it only now that it's too late? 
What can I do? 
The love that we had is torn in two. 
So you take the smiles, 
From all of our years. 
I'll take the tears. I sit and reminisce 
To times that we once shared. 
You gave me more than love, 
But never thought I cared. 
My feelings were whole for you, 
Although it did not show. 
I only told you on, 
The day I let you go. It's never too late to relight the fire, 
It never stopped burning from me. 
The flame it never died inside of me. How is it now that I can tell you I love you? 
How is it only now that it's too late? 
What can I do? 
The love that we had is torn in two. 
So you take the smiles, 
From all of our years. 
I'll take the tears. Now I realise you're no longer mine. 
But I'm hoping the pain will heal in time. 
Though you're leaving I won't say goodbye. 
Coz I know that you'll be here with me inside, baby... 
Now I realise... How is it now that I can tell you I love you? 
How is it only now that it's too late? 
What can I do? 
The love that we had is torn in two. 
So you take the smiles, 
From all of our years. 
I'll take the tears. How is it now that I can tell you I love you? 
How is it only now that it's too late? 
What can I do? 
The love that we had is torn in two. 
So you take the smiles, 
From all of our years. 
I'll take the tears.
