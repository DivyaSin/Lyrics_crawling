Yeah you do it 
But I bet you don't know it 
Aw drop it! [Hook:] 
You excite me (yes you do) 
You excite me (all the time) 
You excite me (everyday) 
You excite me, baby (oh) Excite me, invite me to your house tonight 
Caress me, undress me then bless me tonight [Bridge:] 
If we take the time tonight to feel the pleasures 
All of your treasures 
Girl I'll hold you so strong 
A love to last forever, oh for so long 
(you and me) [Hook (repeat)] It's secret pleasure, we've found the treasure 
We have no secrets tonight 
Just feel my power (feel it baby) 
By the hour (check the clock) 
Take a shower (you bring the soap) tonight [Bridge (repeat)] - Don't come too quick - 
You and me all night?! Yeah [Hook (repeat)] Just let me peep it, don't want to keep it 
Go slow, don't speed it tonight 
This set is hectic, just was I expected? 
Hold on and wreck it, wreck it tonight! How much? 
Oh boy! You and me all night? 
Break it down? Okay 
You asked for it, you got it 
You excite me, you excite me 
We can go on and on
