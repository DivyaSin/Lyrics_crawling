It echoes in my head 
These words we've left unsaid 
Those things to hard to hide 
Still haunt me somewhere deep inside I know that many others knew 
Thin words that I can see right through 
Fall between the cracks of what we once made 
I'm silent but I feel betrayed The words you sell, I'm just not buying 
I've grown so sick and tired of always trying 
It shouldn't be this hard, it shouldn't be this hard 
To give you the benefit of the doubt 
My patience has run out 
And I would have followed you to our death 
But now in pieces our friendship must rest Am I just paranoid? 
Am I so self-absorbed? 
I hear them laugh at me 
My best friend is the enemy So just where the hell did it all go wrong? 
Buried deep within this stupid song 
Are the feelings that no words could say 
When best friends become enemies The words you sell, I'm just not buying 
I've grown so sick and tired of always trying 
It shouldn't be this hard, it shouldn't be this hard 
To give you the benefit of the doubt 
My patience has run out 
And I would have followed you to my grave 
But now I guess we're enemies And I can't tell if you even care 
I ignore the ice cold stare 
That chills what's left inside of me 
My best friend and my enemy Where the hell did it all go wrong? 
Where did we go wrong? 
Where the hell did it all go wrong? 
Where did we go wrong? 
Where the hell did it all go wrong? 
Where did we go wrong? 
Ignoring words we left unsaid 
Made enemies out of friends Where the hell did it all go wrong? 
Buried deep within this stupid song 
Are the feelings that no words could say 
When best friends become enemies Where the hell did it all go wrong? 
Where did we go wrong? 
Ignoring words we left unsaid 
Made enemies out of friends Where the hell did it all go wrong? 
Buried deep within this stupid song 
Are the feelings that no words could say 
When best friends become enemies
