Oh, the power and the blow of that first kiss 
I swear, it almost knocked me to my knees 
I wasn't ready, caught my heart off guard 
For the first time in my life I felt week And I could not stop myself from lovin' you 
It's a feelin' if I fought, I know I'd lose 
I could never let it go, I could never walk away 
If I did, it would tear me in two 
Even if I tried, I could not stop myself from lovin' you It was over, oh, I never had a chance 
I fell and I was never comin' back 
I surrendered, your love was just too strong 
I knew that I had finally met my match And I could not stop myself from lovin' you 
It's a feelin' if I fought, I know I'd lose 
I could never let it go, I could never walk away 
If I did, it would tear me in two 
Even if I tried, I could not stop myself from lovin' you
