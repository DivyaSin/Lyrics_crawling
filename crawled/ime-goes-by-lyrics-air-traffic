As time goes by, you break the spell 
You tell everyone 
But I can't describe this feeling inside 
It's bringing me down We talk all night and into the day 
'Till there's no more to say

You say it's been fun but it's better this way It's you that I need, it's you that I need 
It's you and I'm sure it's always been 
It's you that I need, it's you that I need 
It's you and I'm sure it's always been Time's run out, I'm losing control 
I wish there was more 
But those wheels won't wait 
Like tears on my face, they're rolling away It's you that I need, it's you that I need 
It's you and I'm sure it's always been 
It's you that I need, it's you that I need 
It's you, I'm sure it's always been All the love that we had 
You let it all down 
All the love that we had 
You let it all down It's you that I need, it's you that I need 
It's you, I'm sure it's always been 
It's you that I need, it's you that I need 
It's you but I'm sure it's always been
