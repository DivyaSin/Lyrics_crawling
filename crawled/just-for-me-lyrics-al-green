Your love is just for me, for me 
Its just for me 
Its just for me, for me, for me 
Its just for me I stepped out to say, 
That I love you more each day 
And you turned around, and you knocked me down 
But I love you still baby, baby Why cant you tell that I love you 
By the way, that I smile 
Oh why can't you bring more love to the table 
You drive me wild [Chorus] 
Your love is just for me for me 
I can tell, oh for nobody but me 
Your love for me its for me 
I can tell 
Its just for me Just stepped out to say 
We'd make our love worth living 
And by now I think our love is more 
Its more than giving, hey, hey, Why can't you tell that I love you 
By the way, that I smile 
Why can't you bring more love to the table 
You drive me wild [Chorus] Singing 'bout you everyday this way 
Singing 'bout you what can I say 
Hanging by you is more for me 
Ah Your love is just for me, its for me, its just for me 
Your love is for me, for me, for me, just for me 
Your love is for me, for me, for me, just for me 
Your love is for me, for me, for me, just for me 
Your love is for me, for me, for me, just for me 
Your love is for me, for me, for me, just for me
