And so this is Christmas 
And what have we done? 
Another year over 
And you've just begun 
And so this is Christmas 
I hope you have fun 
Your near and your dear ones 
Your old and your young 
And so Merry Christmas 
And a Happy New Year 
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear 
And so this is Christmas 
The weak and the strong 
The rich and the poor ones 
Have waited so long 
And so Merry Christmas 
And a Happy New Year 
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear So Merry Christmas 
And Happy New Year 
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear War is over if you want it 
War is over if you want it 
War is over if you want it 
War is over if you want it
