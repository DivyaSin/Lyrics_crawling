{Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Oh, it wasn't that bad, was it? 
Y'all goin' to his show 
Yeah} I'm a searching soul 
I'm a lonely man walkin' down to the crossroads Wake up on a Sunday mornin' 
Heard a voice in my head 
He's tellin' me lies, he's tryin' to take me by surprise 
Tryin' to take me down before I'm dead Oh, down that Voodoo Highway 
Oh, down that wicked road 
Oh, down that Voodoo Highway 
Poor old son, gonna find out the hard way, oh, yes he is now Mojo man, ring my doorbell 
Tell me somethin' what you need 
I ain't gonna sign on no dotted line, no sir 
Might as well make me bleed Oh, I'll take my chance on Voodoo Highway 
Oh, goin' down, down, down 
Oh listen, I never joke a fool 
Don't you know, I was born to fly down Voodoo Highway? Ah, don't you mess with me, boy 
I was born to fly 
Down on Voodoo Highway, Highway, Highway 
Aw, don't try to steal my soul
