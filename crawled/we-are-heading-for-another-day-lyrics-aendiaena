wake up 
get up 
it's time to see the sun 
enjoy a wonderful day hello diana, babe, how do u do? 
good evening andie, babe, i got the blue 
don't worry mama, my head-ache's 
not yet gone 
mmh, your eyes tell me 
u partied all night long 
i lost may raybans 
but what is wrong with u 
i'm overweight-is that enough for u 
sure excuse me, but i bet yesterday's dinner 
was fine 
oh, how can u be so nasty at that time life could have more meaning 
would be more fun 
when u open your eyes 
by the first ray of sun 
there should be no reason 
the brightness to shun 
we are heading for another day hello andie, babe, how do u do? 
thank u, really nice, and what about u? 
i lost 12 pounds weight in the last three weeks 
i did more sport and i climbed 7 peaks 
i see, your skin is fresh 
your eyes shine so bright 
your either darling, thought i saw cindy 
crawford at first sight 
how charming u can be at this morning time 
oh yeah, i've changed, stopped drinkin' 
whiskey and wine life could have more meaning... we are heading for another day
