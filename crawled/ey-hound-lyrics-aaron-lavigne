Sitting in your driveway 
Staring down the street 
Wondering if you're ever gonna come and talk to me 
Dreaming in your peaceful nest 
Smiling. Loving peacefulness 
Man, you got it going on from halfway up the street But, you just sit there and wait for me to come and talk to you 
You just sit there and wait for me to come and talk to you I wish that it were easier 
I wish that I could say 
'holla holla holla!' come on girl. Get up. Stretch those legs. But, you never even realize 
Hiding in those midnight eyes 
Everybody, everywhere just trying to break through
