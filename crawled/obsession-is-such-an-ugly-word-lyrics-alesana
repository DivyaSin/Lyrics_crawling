I toss and turn and lie awake 
It torments me, I must know why 
It just seems too easy 
What is beyond that door? 
As I take a step back I wonder could I go on and turn the key? Look away! Turn away! 
I should remember nothing is what it seems 
For once in my life I will resist temptation has 
Come alive again! 
When all is said and done I may not be able to move on 
If I don't know what lies beyond 
Desire is now the one in control 
Am I strong enough to not ever know what I'd find? 
Should I press on? I can almost hear anguished cries as they suffer 
Welcome to the bodies! 
I should run 
I should run but I just can't see to move Look away! Turn away! 
I should remember nothing is what it seems 
For once in my life I will resist temptation has 
Come alive again! 
When all is said and done I may not be able to move on 
If I don't know what lies beyond 
Desire is now the one in control 
Am I strong enough to not ever know just what I'd find? 
What sinful trance awaits me as the key turns?
