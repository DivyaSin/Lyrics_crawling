Well, it's over and nobody wins Well, it really doesn't matter who's right or wrong 
We've been hurting each other for much too long 
And it's too late to try to say, what might have been 
It's over, nobody wins Make believe and forever is just a lie 
And it seems a little sadder, each time we try 
'Cause it's a shame to make the same mistakes again and again 
Oh, it's over and nobody wins We've gone too far, too long, too far apart 
The love it was easy, it's the living that's hard 
For there's no need to say to see the way it is 
Oh, it's over and nobody wins, nobody wins
