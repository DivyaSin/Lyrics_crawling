Can't believe how you set me free 
The way you purify this soul don't you know 
Got you into my arms now I'm never letting go 
This old dog is finally home... finally home... GO! Tell me what you want 
I'll pay the price 
What's money I'll roll the dice 
Lose it all I take the fall 
I'll let it ride 
As long as I have you at my side Friend or foe you come to me 
Wasn't sure how deep a hole I was getting into 
Yet I choose to wake up every mornin with a smile on my face 
Or see life for what it is one big fat race... GO! Tell me what you want 
I'll pay the price 
What's money I'll roll the dice 
Lose it all I take the fall 
I'll let it ride 
As long as I have you at my side I've played the fool Thinking I can catch you off guard 
And score another night with you 
But the tables have been turned 
This boy's about to get burned 
But before I go I gotta know - gotta know Let's not forget 
You kept me waiting 
What can I do to get through to you 
Tired of singin to myself 
I need a lesson 
I need a blessing 
The shoe fits all we need is a little glue 
I hate what you do Tell me what you want 
Tell me what you want 
Tell me what you want 
Tell me what you want
