I'd like to know what you were thinking 
As you dressed and made our bed 
Just the cold hard facts dear 
You at least owe me that 
Did tears so big and heavy 
Fall down from your eyes 
Falling in regret 
Or disappointment 
Knowing that you had to alibi You want to know how I'm feeling 
Think razor blades on muscles tight 
No surprise here I'm not laughing 
Although it's funny you would ask 
The shattered mirror on the wall 
Reflects what's in my heart 
Am I furious 
Are you serious 
What do you see when you look in my eyes 
Betrayed Tears so big and heavy 
Fall now from your eyes 
Falling in regret 
Or disappointment 
Knowing that my love for you has died 
Don't want to know what you are thinking 
I only came here to break your heart 
That's a cold hard fact dear 
I at least owe you that 
Betrayed
