Are answers just a fairy tale 
To keep us chasing our own tail 
Despite the lovers we may win 
In search of truth we're bound to fail 
And with every fruitless sin 
The devil's there to let us in A warm embrace for the cold and frail 
Teach us how to drive the nail 
And questions build our cross 
Since we only speak in Braille 
We all repent at our own cost 
And our meaning is forever lost Virgin Mary stands in cold hail 
Her orphaned babes blind on the rail 
Train wreck vision locked in a box 
Surrounded us blinded by grey veils 
Swim alone in foreign flocks 
Through vast waters the thirst still knocks Hunger in each exhale 
Starvation in every fake gale 
And though no two minds seem the same 
We're all one in the belly of the whale 
Identity the source of shame 
And lies the nature of the game
