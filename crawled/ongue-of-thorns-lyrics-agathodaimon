A dying romance, bleeding for my sensation 
Would Death unmask the azure of the creation? 
Oh, stay far from my crown of certainties A dying romance, the blindman's torch of ideals 
Men of stories, don't try to robe my morning star 
Cause it will never shine in your eden A dying romance, withered by your naivety 
The scent that I perceive comes from words 
Which escaped your mouth of flies 
Selfish, fetid romance 
You lick the shit of this world Men's quintessence sways in streams of hope 
Drowning in silvercups always used at funerals 
Marvellous, when even Death tries to flee from you 
The flames leave their candles, soon they will die, too
