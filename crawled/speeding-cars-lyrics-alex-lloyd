Please don't go, don't walk out 
Feel like you do when the bottom falls out 
Hold me now hold me tight 
I can't see in the dark of night Who knows how we got this far 
No hands in a speeding car 
Who knows how got this far 
No hands in a speeding Lay right down side by side 
'Til it stops this crazy ride 
Friend or foe don't let go 
You were the peace in my mind 
Who knows this time Who knows how it got this far 
No hands in a speeding car 
Who knows how it got this far 
No hands in a speeding Who knows how got this far 
But no hands in a speeding car 
Who knows how got this far 
No hands, no hands Gone so far speeding cars 
Wanna slow down 
Wanna slow down
