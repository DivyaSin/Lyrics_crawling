We've got a problem we can't get around 
It's gotten too big to just tear down 
We built a wall out of thin air 
Now I'm over here and you're over there I'm afraid that there's no two ways to it 
This could be our undoing 
Can't raise the ceiling, can't lower the floor 
The only thing left is to build a door A door ain't nothing but a way to get through a wall 
That's all 
A window won't work and a ladder stretched that tall 
It might fall You get a hammer and I'll get a saw 
And we'll give this wall what-for 
What we need between you and me 
Is a door We might get sweaty, might get dirty 
A couple of splinters would be well worth it 
We'll hang it right here, level and plumb 
We'll shake hands on a job well done Once that door's standing open 
We'll get some communication going 
We'll reach out and the next thing you know 
This wall'll come down like Jericho A door ain't nothing but a way to get through a wall 
That's all 
A window won't work and a ladder stretched that tall 
It might fall So you get a hammer and I'll get a saw 
And we'll give this wall what-for 
What we need between you and me 
Is a door A door ain't nothing but a way to get through a wall 
That's all 
A window won't work and a ladder stretched that tall 
It might fall You get a hammer and I'll get a saw 
And we'll give this wall what-for 
What we need between you and me 
Is a door
