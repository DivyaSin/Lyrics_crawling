The light of the day eases my tension 
The dark of the night turns me on 
Captures my heat 
Won't let me be 
I heard you laugh, I heard you scream 
Let's take a chance on the body machine 
You're backtalking me, gets me angry 
Whisper some words, calm me down 
We don't need no complications 
Just get it on 
Sometimes I'm cool, sometimes I'm mean 
It all depends on the body machine 
Here inside my blood is burning 
The engine in my heart is churning 
Those little bitty molecules are squirming 
They're driving me way out of control 
Your red-hot lips light my fire 
Your deep blue eyes catch my desire 
Don't mess around 
We're gonna make this flight tonight 
Come on woman, get on this thing 
Give yourself to the body machine 
Here inside my blood is burning 
The engine in my heart is churning 
Those little bitty molecules are squirming 
They're driving me way out of control 
Cruisin' around, trying to get lucky 
Searchin' the dark, turn on some light 
Taking what comes our way 
And makin' it right 
There's no use gettin' hooked on a dream 
Let's take a ride on the body machine
