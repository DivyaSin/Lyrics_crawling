* this is a remake of ed o.g.'s "I got to have it" We gonna do it like this, yo this is aceyalone 
Giving a big shout out to ed o.g. and the b.u.l.l.d.o.g.s. 
Yo whole rock this, look Yo brown is my complexion, I got that electric connection 
Now who needs some protection? 
We rocking hip-hop, come in and turn your gun off 
Gave you the mic and off the head you couln't come off 
I only say it cause nobody wants to shoot ya 
I'd rather teach you science and work on the future 
Aceyalone ain't not a phoney not by any means 
And by any means necessary be supreme 
I am the poet to flow with and get lyrical 
I write songs like smokey and the miracles 
I'm from l.a., city of the big bang 
But everywhere around the world they screaming "get thangs!" 
And at the same time I'm screaming out "I want mine!" 
It ain't nothing really new under the sunshine 
But sometime you got to put away the fun time 
Get it cause you only living one time, I got to have it 360 knowledge of self (I got to have it!) 
Records all over the shelf (I got to have it!) 
The wind underneath my wings (I got to have it!) 
Money and fancy things (I got to have it!) 
The food for my family to eat (I got to have it!) 
The raps that can ride these beats (I got to have it!) 
My own piece of this earth (I got to have it!) 
For everything life is worth (I got to have it!) I got to have it in the 2 triple o 
It's either work nine to five or you rip a flow 
Or rob a nigga, but how low can you go? 
I ain't a thief, I just want relief for sho' 
I got to get mine, no different from everybody trying to get theirs 
So I was getting prepared 
Instead of spitting shots through the air, maybe getting the chair 
Yeah I got ta got ta, have it have it 
Like peas and carrots, broccoli and cabbage 
Bread and butter, now did I stutter? 
Don't you utter another word, you mouth is in the gutter 
And I can't take it, don't want nothing from you 
And I can't stay, I got this bitch something to do 
And it's more important than michael jordan 
Or operah winfery or billy cosby 
To the death like a kamikaze, huh, I got to have it 360 knowledge of self (I got to have it!) 
Records all over the shelf (I got to have it!) 
The wind underneath my wings (I got to have it!) 
Money and fancy things (I got to have it!) 
The food for my family to eat (I got to have it!) 
The raps that can ride these beats (I got to have it!) 
My own piece of this earth (I got to have it!) 
For everything life is worth (I got to have it!) See I want everything that I don't have 
So don't laugh when I tell you that I want half 
But I don't want your half, I just want my half 
And on my behalf, put it on a phonograph 
Cd's tapes, packaged with a photograph 
And respect the ancestors when we walk the path 
Talk the math, speaking like a genuine 
Bless the gods, bless the mic, and then you rhyme 
And keep it going until you end up at the finish line 
And when you see the light beaming, then it's time 
We kick a four or ? ? ? this without a space ship 
Don't want to take your life, I know I can't replace it 
So while you're sitting around the house getting wasted 
You know you're not using your full potential now you're facing 
And plus, ain't nothing wrong with riding the bus 
So put on your nikes and kick rocks, I got to have it 360 knowledge of self (I got to have it!) 
Records all over the shelf (I got to have it!) 
The wind underneath my wings (I got to have it!) 
Money and fancy things (I got to have it!) 
The food for my family to eat (I got to have it!) 
The raps that can ride these beats (I got to have it!) 
My own piece of this earth (I got to have it!) 
For everything life is worth (I got to have it!) Uh, all right, do it like that
