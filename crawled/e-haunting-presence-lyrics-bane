Alone in the dark chamber, 
Watching the fire of the burning candles, 
Everything always reminds me of you Underneath the gray skies, 
In the cold winter breeze, 
Your presence is always haunting me In the deepest depths of my mind, 
Your voice somewhere echoes, 
And after all is lost and forgotten, 
We are nowhere to be found or remembered Underneath the gray skies, 
In the cold winter breeze, 
Your presence is always haunting me
