Mind focused on the far away, sticking to the plan 
Faith healer in this cartoon play, thats the witchy man 
Speaks softly in the light of day, moves by dark of night 
Thrill-seeker in the market-place, slipping out of sight This is the way that were feeling, this is the day that we can 
And if you think its hard to be the witchy woman 
Try to be the witchy man Builds your castle in the air, rides into the sun 
Try to call him if you dare, doesnt wear a gun 
Hes the one out on a limb, muscles on his tears 
Hes the tide against the swim, pressure on the peers This is the way that were feeling, this is the day that we can 
And if you think its hard to be the witchy woman 
Try to be the witchy man This is the way that were feeling, this is the day that we can 
And if you think its hard to be the witchy woman 
Try to be the witchy man This is the way that were feeling, this is the day that we can 
And if you think its hard to be the witchy woman 
Try to be the witchy man
