Burn It All Down Burn it all down 
Burn it all down 
Burn it all down to the ground 
I'll just wait Hearts on fire 
Heads on fire 
Burn it all to the ground 
Gods on fire 
I'm on fire 
Burn it all to the ground 
Every institution 
And the constitution 
Nothing can be saved I will not be told 
By those who've sold 
Everything that is beautiful in the world 
My blood runs cold 
From the strangle hold 
Of a society 
Who will sacrifice 
Everything & everyone 
So.. Burn it all down 
Burn it all down 
Burn it all down to the ground 
It's just our fate The worlds on fire 
The worlds on fire 
Burn it all down to the ground 
The worlds on fire 
the worlds on fire 
Burn it all down to the ground 
I"ll just wait
