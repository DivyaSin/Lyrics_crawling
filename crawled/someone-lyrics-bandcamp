Well I'm battered down 
I'm burnt out like a half of a cigarette 
and I'm passed out on the floor 
Thinking am I happy yet? 
I'm filmed in black in white 
But you remember me in colors 
Singing songs about my heartache 
and my jealousy of others. 
And it's hard to explain it 
and hard to contain it 
and hard to explain how it feels 'Til there's someone to cry about 
Someone to fight it out 
Someone to say..you're the reason they breathe 
'til there's someone you're crazed about 
the one you can't live without 
Someone to say. 
You're the reason they breathe. Well, I'm feeling kind of lonely 
'Cause I lost my train of thought 
Tried to run away from thinking 
But it only got me caught 
I'm as open as a rose 
When summers air can spare no rain 
In this drought I'm almost dead 
And in this sun I'm rather plain 
Does it help you to cling to 
the shell you've turned into? 
I wish you the best and the worst 'Til there's someone to cry about 
Someone to fight it out 
Someone to say..you're the reason they breathe 
'til there's someone you're crazed about 
the one you can't live without 
Someone to say. 
You're the reason they breathe. Noo.. Oh, well I fumble back and fall 
Then try to find my words 
But there's a couple or a couplet that you haven't heard 
Guess I'll try a little harder, 
try some workin' it out 
I think I'd fall on my face on my way out 
Tried to kiss you baby, 
tell you everything on my mind 
Tried to spit out my heart, 
when I go lookin' behind 
If there's something more to say 
Then go and say it now 'Til there's someone to cry about 
Someone to fight it out 
Someone to say..you're the reason they breathe 
'til there's someone you're crazed about 
the one you can't live without 
Someone to say. 
You're the reason they breathe.
