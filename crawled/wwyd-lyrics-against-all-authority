Call me sacreligious, I see you as ficticious Living your life in a storybook nightmare Gimmicks meant to infiltrate & hairwash todays youth Another fashion slogan what would you do of a polluted, starved, corrupted world & soiled what was serene if I tore you dreams & you heard the violent screams Greased up & coated evangelistic lies now you can slide along your apathetic life Rape & murder aren't condoned in the bible You've accepted moral values but you've left something behind the path towards the light has made you blind "How to Fuck the World" should be the new title If I decided your fate what would you do if I took you back in front of you because of your beliefs. Hypocrite, so full of shit! of the book that you translate to cover up your hate in history & you saw your family raped & murdered Religion does not make a person good or bad But if it was all up to me it would be you that burned in hell Whose right or wrong? Only fate will tell
