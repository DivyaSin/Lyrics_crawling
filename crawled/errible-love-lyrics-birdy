It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders 
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in 
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders 
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in 
its quiet company, its quiet company And I can't fall asleep without a little help 
It takes a while to settle down 
My shivered bones 
Until the panic sets It takes an ocean not to break 
It takes an ocean not to break 
It takes an ocean not to break 
It takes an ocean not to break Company 
Its quiet company 
Its quiet company But I won't 
follow you into the rabbit hole 
I said I would 
but then I saw 
your shivered bones 
They didn't want me to It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders 
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in 
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders 
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in It takes an ocean not to break 
It takes an ocean not to break 
It takes an ocean not to break 
It takes an ocean not to break
