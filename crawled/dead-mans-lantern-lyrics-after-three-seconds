The winds that hide the sighs of lovers written words deny 
Whisper with spectral voices 
The roots that felt the weight of soles and souls now drowned in fate 
Young dreams and mortal choices 
The clouds that drape the trees in fog that falls thick at my knees 
Descend on autumn slowly 
The mountain that we made from shattered hearts lain here displayed 
Rises to block the sunlight Wind, pray, delay your judgment one more day 
Things we search and find, lives we've left behind, oh Free 
One dream to be alive The wind will sweep away the scattered lights of another day 
The cool dusk now takes a dark turn 
The inky night will flow through open mouths 
The world we know hangs like a dead man's lantern 
The dim flickering light shows ghosts that dream, that beg for flight 
Caged in by withered branches 
A dark canopy weighs on darkened dreams and empty days 
Dead cries for second chances Fade away if you can't stand to take it one more day 
Flee your darkened soul, heart's an empty hole, oh Free 
One dream to be alive 
And feel all I conceal 
Revive When the world won't give way to your high-hearted dreams 
Push it back 'till it breaks at the seams Bleeding through like a rainstorm that cleanses the skies 
Now let loose all your burdens and fly
