Don't go changin', 
To try and please me. 
You never let me down before (nooooo noo nooo). 
And don't imagine, 
You're too familiar - 
I don't see you anymore. I would not leave you, 
In times of trouble. 
We never could have come this far (nooooo noo nooo). 
I took the good times, 
I'll take the bad times - 
I'll take you just they way you are. Don't go tryin', 
Some new fashion. 
Don't change the color of your hair (nooooo noo nooo). 
You always had my, 
Unspoken passion - 
Although I might not seem to care (ehyeah ah yeah ah yeah). I don't want clever - 
...Conversation... 
I never want to work that hard (nooooo noo nooo). 
I just want someone, 
That I can talk to - 
I want you just the way you are... I need to know that you will all... 
...Always be... 
The same old someone that I knew. 
What will it take till you, 
Believe in me - 
The way that I believe in you. I said I love you, 
And that's forever. 
And this I promise from the heart (oh nooooo noo noooh). 
I could not love you, 
Any better - 
I love you - 
Just you the way... 
you are.......
