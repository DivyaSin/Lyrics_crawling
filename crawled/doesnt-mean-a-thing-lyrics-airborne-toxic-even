I never knew my mother 
I can't say it was so bad 
She was still a girl of seventeen the night she met my dad 
He was just six months out of Dhino 
Trying his hardest to stay clean 
And they'd sing and they'd sing and they'd sing 
Like doves sleeping with broken wings 
In a bed fit for a king 
It didn't mean a thing It was shot gun forest wedding 
But they forgot to bring the guns 
They were too busy counting promises 
To the children not yet born 
No one could afford the ride 
They just hitched up the 101 And they'd sing and they'd sing and they'd sing 
Like doves dancing with broken wings 
With a view fit for a king 
It didn't mean a thing It was a loneliness 
They would confess 
Like the world had gone bad I guess 
So they hold hands and look into the eyes of God 
They'd say tell me why'd ya hide from us 
Why'd ya fill the world with wickedness 
Why'd ya spare us from your grace but not the rot Now my dad says fuck the details 
Just keep your head down hard 
Ya got to find yourself alone before you'll find the eyes of God 
You maybe broke and scared and mad as hell 
At the flesh of your own heartstrings 
But you were born to be a peasant not a king 
So just stop acting like your running from something 
Ya gonna leave the way you came without a thing 
With your heart tattooed and your mind tied to a string You just sing and you sing and you sing 
It doesn't mean a thing
