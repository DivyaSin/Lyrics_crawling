so I'll sit down I'm that this might hurt 
be careful not to slit open my wrists with your words 
I just rubbed out my last wish 
I'll wish it all away 
to spell out your name with all the stars of Uruguay 
jump inside my skin to see what's going on within 
I think I'm falling for you Jen my heart is beating in a box waiting at your doorstep 
marked fragile handle with care when you open it 
I'm laying it 
on the line now 
your what I'm all about 
think twice before you tear my heart out 
jump inside my skin to see what's going on within 
I think I'm falling for you Jen I won't ever ask for much of anything 
please desist the loneliness in me 
I hope that is not too much to ask of you 
hope is all that I've got left to do a face like yours is so hard to find 
I pray one day you'll call me yours and I'll call you mine
