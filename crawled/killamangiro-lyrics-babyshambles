Oh, oh, oh 
Why would you pay to see me in a cage? 
And why would you pay to see me in a cage? 
Some men call the stage Listen now I have gone 
You will know 
I was the only one that would have died 
What was wrong in the eyes of the unwell and unwise And I killed a man for his giro today 
Wasn't very gay, I didn't mind 
I was a money man anyway 
Killed a man for his giro today Why, would you pay 
Why, would you pay 
To see me in a cage 
It's all across the stage And know 
When the night has come 
You might say 
I was not the only the one who would've died 
What was wrong in the eyes of the cruel and unwise 
And I killed a man for his giro today On the off chance that you're listening ' 
To the radio 
I thought you might like to know you broke my heart 
Can only sadden up or hedge your bets 
Or take a chance and never get you again 
All my ties, time and time 
I keep on trying hard not to try too hard 
When I forgive, I won't forget 
To killing time, so I'm better now 
I don't need it... 
Anything that makes you, feel hate 
Can do without hate 
Now I believe in love Now I have gone 
Oh yeah, I will pay 
For everything you've done 
What was wrong 
In the eyes of the unwell and unwise 
And I killed a man for his giro today Oh, oh, oh
