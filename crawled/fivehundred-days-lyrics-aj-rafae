started off grand then ended in ruins 
thought you were the one you never knew what we were doin' 
you didnt know when to stop all of your games 
and you left me here, left me without any shame so the truth came out you couldnt promise me the love that i was pouring out for you 
and when you went away 
couldn't get you out of my mind oh i 
was broken down for you 500 days i know it wasn't the best but i won't ever forget no i won't ever forget 
500 days i know it wasn't the best but i won't ever regret no i won't ever forget you i gotta be frank-- i can't imagine me with anyone other than you 
had me feelin like my dreams came true you made me feel good 
like no one else existed 
like summer was here everyday of the year 
now its just my wishful thinkin so the truth came out you promised someone else the love that i was pouring out for you 
when you went away 
couldn't get you out of my mind oh i 
was broken down for you there is a light and it never goes out 
and there is a promise and i don't mean to scream and shout 
but there is a fog and it's blocking that light 
gotta let you go, no use in fighting this fight
