Pop, rock, rhythm and blues 
Anything you've got 
I don't have time to choose 
Big speakers 
I'll sing along 
Last request D.J. 
I need a song He can't break my heart 
If I can't hear a word (hear a word) Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio 
I'll drown you out 
Cos I don't wanna let you go 
Anything to make you forget 
Cos my heart can't let it go yet 
Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio You spent me, frequency 
If I found signal, maybe, you won't leave 
Headphones, cover my ears 
Keep smiling, fight back the tears He can't break my heart 
If I can't hear a word (hear a word) Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio 
I'll drown you out 
Cos I don't wanna let you go 
Anything to make you forget 
Cos my heart can't let it go yet 
Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio Ooh, I'm turning up the radio 
Ooh wa oh oh oh, 
Wa oh oh oh radio 
Ooh wa oh oh oh, 
Wa oh oh oh radio I'll drown you out 
Don't say it now 
Cos I'm turning up the radio Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio 
I'll drown you out 
Cos I don't wanna let you go 
Anything to make you forget 
'Cause my heart can't let it go yet 
Don't say it now 
I'm turning up the radio
