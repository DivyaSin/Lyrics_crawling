all my time i spent 
the widow said as she bent 
giving what meant everything 
and all my company 
are memories whispering 
down by the forest 
down by the forest all the time in the world 
is yours, she said as she went 
with her thoughts on her dreams 
i hardly knew you 
yet i packed all i valued 
and followed like 
dust in the wind can you give me sanctuary 
when the babbling brook 
runs dry? 
can you give me understanding 
when there's nothing left 
to try? what about your brothers 
and all you had for lovers? 
did they blow away like candles 
in the night? 
i saw you begging 
on the day of the wedding 
she don't wander by herself 
where are 
your sons and your daughters? can you give me sanctuary 
when the babbling brook 
runs dry? 
can you give me understanding 
when there's nothing left 
to try? all my time i spent 
the widow said as she bent 
giving what meant everything 
and all my company are 
memories whispering 
down by the forest 
down by the forest 
down by the forest
