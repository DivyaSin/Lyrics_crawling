Baby, baby, baby 
From the day I saw you 
Really, really wanted to catch your eye 
Somethin' special bout' you 
I must really like you 
'Cause not a lot of guys are worth my time Oh baby, baby, baby 
It's getting kind of crazy 
'Cause you are taking over my mind And it feels like ooh 
You don't know my name 
I swear, it feels like ooh 
You don't know my name 
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know) Oh, baby, baby, baby 
I see us on our first date 
Doing everything that makes me smile 
When we had our first kiss 
It happened on a Thursday 
Ooh it set my soul on fire 
Ooh baby, baby, baby 
I can't wait for the first time 
My imagination's running wild It feels like ooh 
You don't know my name 
And I swear it baby, it feels like ooh 
You don't know my name 
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know) I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me 
Got me feelin' all crazy inside 
I'm feelin' like, oh 
Doing nothing I've ever done, for anyone's attention 
Take notice of what's in front of me 'Cause did I mention (oh) 
You bout' to miss a good thing 
And you'll never know how good it feels 
To have, all my affection 
And you'll never get a chance to experience, my lovin' (oh) 
'Cause my lovin' feels like Ooh 
You don't know my name 
And I swear it feels like 
Ooh

I'm going to have to go ahead and just call this boy 
Hello, can I speak to, to Michael

This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox 
You know the one with the braids?

Well I see you on Wednesday's, all the time You come on every Wednesday on your lunch brake I think 
You always order the special, with the hot chocolate 
Look man I mean, I know girls don't usually do this 
But I was wonderin' 
If maybe we could get together outside the restaurant one day 
You know, 'cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes 
Wait a minute, my cell phones breakin' up 
Can you hear me now? 
Yeah, so what day did you say?

You don't know my name 
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
