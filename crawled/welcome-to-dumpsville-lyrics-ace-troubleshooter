Welcome to Dumpsville, population: you 
I don't want to hang out with you anymore 
Please don't come knocking round my door 
I just need my time, my space 
Even though I had to spring it on you 
I don't want to see your face 
That would make me, like, totally blue Welcome to Dumpsville 
I don't want to see you anymore
