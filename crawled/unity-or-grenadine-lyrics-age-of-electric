The unity of me, seems a lot like yourself 
Edges frayed worn down my luck 
Enterprise to die for 
You're to die for 
It makes your brain, my luckiest number 
My most hopeful trait 
Bits and pieces, I could put it together 
But it still won't bring you to me 
Miss Grenadine 
Miss Grenadine 
You're a teacher, best I've had 
Apple was bruised, I gave you 
Now you can gaze, it's some side of me that ain't right 
But I know, that you're to die for 
And I know, I cauterize my left side breaks 
Bits and pieces, I could put it together 
But it still won't bring you to me 
Miss Grenadine 
Miss Grenadine 
I don't deserve you, they're right 
The hope and the greed, I was on my own 
In her volcanic cluster, the world condom broke 
Glad you lost her, can't grab her that low 
Slashers sulk in my outer 
Never fake their way in 
Shrinking in lonely with a crowd in my eye 
Measuring gold sparkle in your lab in the sky
