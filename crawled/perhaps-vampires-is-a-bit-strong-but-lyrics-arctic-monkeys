I've seen your eyes as they fix on me 
What is he doing 
What on earth's the plan, has he got one 
You better give me some pointers since you are the big rocket launcher and I'm just the shotgun Well I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes 
That might be a surprise but it's true 
I'm not like you and I don't want your advice or your praise or to move in the ways you do 
And I never will 'Cause all you people are vampires 
And all your stories are stale 
And though you pretend to stand by us 
I know you're certain we'll fail I've seen your eyes as they fix on me 
Full of confusion 
Your snarl is just so condescending 
Try to explain that we're on to a win 
If the fee we got in 
Near recoups what we're spending He said 
I can't believe that you drove all that way 
Well how much did they pay you, how much did they pay you? 
You'd have been better to stay round our way 
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things 'Cause all you people are vampires 
And all your stories are stale 
And though you pretend to stand by us 
I know you're certain we'll fail 'Cause all you people are vampires 
And all your stories are stale 
And though you pretend to stand by us 
I know you're certain we'll fail All you people are vampires
