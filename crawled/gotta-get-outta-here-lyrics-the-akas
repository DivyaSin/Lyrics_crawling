And you know that we're out of control. And you know that we can't take anymore, so let's go. Yo girl we gotta get outta here. Hey baby, do you remember the days when we used to hold hands? And everything seemed okay, running through the streets at night, alright, oh yeah. Hey baby, do you remember the times when everything seemed fine? Running round town with our fists in the air, smashing out windows 'cause we don't care. And you know that we're out of control. And you know that we can't take anymore, so let's go. Yo girl, we gotta get outta here. Hey baby, come on. Yo girl, we're gonna lose control. Hey baby, come on... let's go. Hey baby, do you remember when they used to say "god damn." Pointing their fingers as we walked by... pointing their fingers but that's alright. Hey baby, do you remember when you used to say "don't stop, don't stop, don't stop!" Times change, but I say things around here are much the same.
