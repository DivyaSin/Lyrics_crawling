Each day the sun come out to shine 
Yes, the stars and the moon 
They just live on, live on all the time The wind it blows 
As we listen and breathe, we breathe 
God's living air You know the flowers grow, yeah 
And they do not toil, oh Lord 
They do not spend 
Spend or work at all You know the birds, they live 
Live and get their care 
Surely there is 
There is a God somewhere
