Walking on water 
Water into wine Fear is the opiate [Incomprehensible] Clotted screams [Incomprehensible] 
Never ceasing repeating Silence, words of righteousness 
Fill the angel's mouth 
The angel's mouth 
Fuck the mouth Immerse the soul in oblivion 
An abyss of hallucinations 
With time standing still 
Standing still Waiting patiently 
Waiting patiently 
Under a Judas goatskin 
Waiting patiently To catch the life you throw away 
With time standing still 
Observing chaos in action 
Confront the real and ideal
