Alex: 
I don't know you 
But I want you 
All the more for that Alex & Sierra: 
Words fall through me 
And always fool me 
And I can't react Carlito: 
And games that never amount 
To more than they're meant 
Will play themselves out Alex & Sierra: 
Take this sinking boat and point it home 
We've still got time. 
Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice 
You'll make it now Carlito: 
You have suffered enough 
And warred with yourself 
It's time that you won Alex & Sierra (Carlito): 
(Take!) Take this sinking boat and point it home Carlito: 
I'll take you there! Alex & Sierra: 
We've still got time Alex & Carlito (Sierra): 
(Raise!) Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice 
You've made it... Alex, Sierra & Carlito: 
Now!
