[Verse 1] Silent meditations 
I been sitting waiting 
I done tried a lot of things 
There ain't no replacing 
Sun shining through the basement Now baby girl, alright I understand this time 
I ain't got no plans this time 
I just want to watch you glow 
I'll be here front row 
So I'm read' to go, yeah So baby let's go, baby let's go 
Baby girl I'm on a roll 
Oh baby you know I know that it's not the perfect time 
But there's only one thing on my mind [Chorus] Baby does it feel 
Like it's real 
Tell me baby does it feel 
Like it's real [Verse 2] Oh my God you look so perfect 
Oh my God you're so worth it 
Oh my God the way you stare at me 
It feels like therapy The way you stare at me 
It feels like fucking therapy 
I been treatin' this so carefully 
But you ain't playin' fair with me In my bedroom 
In my memory 
In each message 
That you send me We both can find what we need 
I don't want to intervene 
Can you feel the energy? [Chorus] [Outro] Tell me baby does it- (x2)
