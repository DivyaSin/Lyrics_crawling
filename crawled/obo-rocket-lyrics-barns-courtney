Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey When my feet touch down on the foreign land 
I buried all my money in a coffee can 
and I've been hobo skipping just to hide from the weather 
Only got two pennies better rub them together Because I keep on my sleeve 
I wear it on my shirt 
I got a living room full of dust and dirt 
and it's a jumped up living in the city of smoke 
you better suck it up before I come apart 
I'm a hobo rocket Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
What a time, Nothing in my pocket, check 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey When my shoe got holes in the cobble streets 
and now it feels like heaven underneath my feet 
I'm like a lone true sad-or on a holy endeavour 
Living 5 pound daily in a charity sweater 
Because i'm beating on my drum 
I'm tapping on my knee 
I stream ride a chair to a back CD 
At least I still got rhythm if I don't get paid 
and i'll never quit cos I 
I'll come apart 
I'm a hobo rocket Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
What a time, Nothing in my pocket, check 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey I got my hobo beat 
I'm living on my feet 
I got the hobo beat 
That's what I tell them 
I got the hobo beat 
I'm walking on my feet 
I got the hobo beat And so I tell them (who who) 
Alright alright alright (who who) 
Alright alright alright (who who) 
Alright alight alright (who who) 
I tell them what I tell them 
and I do it every night (who who)
