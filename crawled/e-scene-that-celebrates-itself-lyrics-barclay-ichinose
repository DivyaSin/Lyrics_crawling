I'm screaming, I'm shouting 
I'm bleeding from my heart 
I'm crying, I'm dying, 
But she doesn't care 
I'm sitting all alone 
Gazing at your pics 
I hate, but I love 
Your face and your smell 
I'm sitting and thinking 
I'm cutting myself again For a girl I cannot have 
For a smile I cannot steal 
Because of the one now I am (Come On) I'm laying on the floor 
I'm a loser 'cause I cannot wake 
I'm a loser 'cause I cannot wake 
Now you are so far from me 
I'm sitting and thinking 
I'm cutting myself again For the one I had 
For a smile that was mine 
For the one who loved me... Your ruthless voice 
Is cutting my throat My blood drips from my mouth I just want to 
embrace you again I can't live without you But I guess you don't care
