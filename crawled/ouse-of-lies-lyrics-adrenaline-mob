I'm burning on fire 
Feeding on my desire 
I wanna know every way 
You make love 
Excite me invite me 
Your moves they hypnotize me 
I wanna fuck you till you scream 
My name out loud - Out loud! Come on baby drive me crazy 
Take me for a ride I'm burning get me moving 
Let's get that body grooving 
The way you shake 
You're blowing my mind 
You scratch me I'm bleeding 
You got my demon screaming 
You can tie me up all night and torture me - Torture me! Come on baby drive me crazy 
Take me for a ride Here I'm waiting 
In your house of lies 
The games you're playing 
You got me hypnotized Here I'm waiting 
In your house of lies 
The games you're playing 
You got me hypnotized Here I'm waiting 
Waiting for the show 
Anticipating waiting to explode
