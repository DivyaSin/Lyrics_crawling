I know I should feel welcome here 
Way up in the atmosphere 
But I am afraid 
And if I land on earth again 
I'll be happy just to cut my face 
While I shave Now the sky is floating by 
But I am not a cloud 
And I've decided 
I was not designed to fly After all, I'm only sand 
To irritate the oyster and 
To wait for a pearl 
And even though I must concede 
Greatness has eluded me 
I'd still miss the world And I would have regrets 
Were I to pirouette inside a metal jet 
And I am not prepared 
To sprout a pair of wings and fly
