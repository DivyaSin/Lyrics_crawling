Over you 
I guess I never will be over you 
I have tried but it's so hard to do 
I'm surrounded by the memories 
No, I never will be over you 
Time goes by and I'm still holding on 
Waiting for the day when you come home 
If you ever change your mind again 
I will greet you like a long lost friend 
In my heart we've never reached the end 
And I never will be over you 
I will love you 'til the end of time 
Even though I know that you're not mine 
Just as long as there's a chance that I 
Guess I never will be over you 
Life's like walking down a lonely street 
I see you in everyone I meet 
How I long to see your smiling face 
Oh, my love for you I can't erase 
No one else could ever take your place 
And I never will be over you 
Over you
