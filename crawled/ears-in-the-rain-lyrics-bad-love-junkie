Tears in the rain are easy to hide 
If you are one who's so inclined 
To never show 
The pain that you feel 
Tears in the rain are easy to conceal Left in cold 
Or forced to the back 
There's only one thing left to do & and that's to laugh 
Laugh at the world 
Laugh at the lies 
But when there's nothing left inside Tears in the rain are easy to hide 
When you're alone and marking time 
No one would blame you 
But if they did 
Tears in the rain are easy to forgive Maybe the sun 
Will break through the clouds 
Maybe the rain will wash the pain and anger out 
Maybe today 
You'll finely find 
A little piece of mind
