Who am I? 
Time will tell 
Careless girl 
You never saw me coming I see you 
Know your name 
Beautiful 
But baby you were sleeping I feel it, I feel it, I feel it 
More than you 
What can I say? 
Give me the grace 
To fly away I need it, I need it, I need it 
More than you 
Yeah I took your belt 
Don't steal my fire 
I'll fly away So you and I 
Are not the same 
I've seen the things 
You wanna fake And I don't know why 
I'm still standing 
I just need to survive Don't take a mirror in exchange for gold 
A thousand young dreams bought and sold 
You know better than that, you know better than that 
You fly away Don't take a mirror in exchange for gold 
A thousand young dreams bought and sold 
You know better than that, you know better than that 
You fly away I feel it, I feel it, I feel it 
More than you 
What can I say? 
You need a place 
To fly away Yeah I took your gown 
Don't steal my fire 
I'll fly away
