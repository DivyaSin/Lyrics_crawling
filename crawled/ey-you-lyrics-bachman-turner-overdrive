Hey you, you say you want to change the world 
It's alright, with me there's no regret 
It's my turn, the circle game has brought me here 
And I won't let down 'till every song is set 
You realize now 
You should have tried now, oooh 
The music's gone now 
You lost it somehow 
Hey you, sha lalala 
Hey you, sha lalala 
Wooo, sha la la 
Wooo, sha la la 
Hey you, you say the race is much too fast 
It's okay, with me I'm keeping pace 
It's my game, the music is inside my head 
For every one on top there's one who can't retrace 
You realize now 
You should have tried now, oooh ooh 
The music's gone now, you'll find out 
You lost it somehow 
Hey you, sha lalala 
Hey you, sha lalala 
Wooo, sha la la la 
Wooo, sha la la la 
You realize now oooh 
You could have died now, oooh 
The music's gone now 
You lost it somehow 
Hey you, hey you, sha lalala 
Hey you, sha lalala 
Wooo, sha la la 
Wooo, sha la la 
Sha lalala, hey you, hey you, hey you 
Sha lalala, ba-ba-ba-baby's stupid (?) 
Sha lalala, no time, no time left, no time 
Sha lalala, don't let me down, don't let me down 
(music and singing fades out)
