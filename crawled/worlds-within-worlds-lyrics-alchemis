Like creatures within the deepest oceans, you are existing unaware of 
Worlds outside your own. 
Disregard what is believed and fantasy shall enter 
Begin to think of concepts that are slightly left of centre 
Begin without beginning and conclude eternally 
A mass infinite cycle I am in and is in me. The not yet born and dead may know 
Where we've been and where we go 
What's to come and why where here 
But when I look it's most unclear. At times I'm lost with things I find 
Is god creator or image if mind? 
A macroscopic universe - a microscopic view 
Variety of astonishment I can't see thought. Imagine places I've not been 
Picture sights I've never seen 
Believe in worlds I cannot see 
Those I'm in and those in me 
Though life's torment I now find 
Life may be a state of mind 
Disregarding the impossible 
We believe in what is tangible We feel the warmth of one in a trillion starts Ethereal continuation - thoughts beyond infinite cycles 
Are we just a chemical equation that reached consciousness 
Though evolution? Earth's nature confines itself. But within cosmology - infinity
