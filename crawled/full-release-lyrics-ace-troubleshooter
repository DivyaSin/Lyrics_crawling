Don't let me get in the way 
I don't know what I'm saying 
I guess I just don't see Your wonderful plan for me 
Don't let me get in the way 
I don't know what I'm saying 
I'll just give it up to you with a sacrifice of praise My eyes don't do a thing for me 
My flesh outside, I feel it's weak 
My ears, never a thing I hear 
Even when I draw so near 
I guess I steal the show at times 
And when I do I know I'm blind 
Deep down what I seek is peace 
So please just give me full release
