Wretched limbs tear at nothing, 
but wrinkled skin and diseased hearts, 
and black eyes cast blank emotions, 
that drop into hell taking you with them. 
you sell your soul, you've marked your way, 
death and corruption. 
You sell your soul, you've marked your way, death and corruption. 
Heartless, faceless, you'll stop at nothing. 
Raping the willing, leave them with nothing. 
Replace those you've consumed, with the young you've infected. 
Replace those you've consumed, with death and destruction. 
Cut off their tongues, they keep coming. 
Infect the young, they keep coming. 
Sell your death, cut off their tongues. 
Sell your death, infect the young.
