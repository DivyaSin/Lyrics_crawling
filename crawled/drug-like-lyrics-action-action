I'm an angel with broken wings, 
Who's poisoning the night 
With love, from me to you 
I'm having an episode, 
Do you want a small bit part? 
I think you might, I hope you do Oh baby go so slowly 
Nowhere, nothing, quiet softly The world falls apart, in just seven days 
It sinks to the bottom, in oceans of rain 
The cure is so clear, the blood is astray 
And everyone dies, except for the rain 
...and I think that I'm starting to scare myself I hate myself, and I want you to die 
So insincere, swallowing ice 
And it all will render useless 
Welcome to enhancement by affiliation 
Time swept by in a hungry nation 
And everybody's dancing to get it off their chests 
And everybody dies, but no one gets to rest
