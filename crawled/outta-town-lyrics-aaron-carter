I'm still young, getting older by the minute 
Reaching out to the millions, believe it 
I work hard, I work fast 
I'm-ma take it to the top and I'm gonna laugh I know what I've got, so stop 
Knocking on my wagon, cause I'm blowing up spots 
Been 'round the world more times than Phileas Fogg 
And wherever I go, I get mad love To the east to the west, to the north to the south 
They know AC and they know I get down 
To the east, to the west, to the north, to the south 
Keep my feet on the ground and they know that Ya don't see me braggin' 
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon 
Giddy up, giddy up and hold up, take a look around 
Then roll out, roll it outta town Cause ya don't see me braggin' 
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon 
Giddy up, giddy up and hold up, take a look around 
Then roll out, roll it outta town I'm not the type of guy who shows off for attention 
About the fancy cars and jewels 
But let me mention girls can't get enough of me 
Record company lovin me 
Jealousy from all other guys? Hmm, Probably But that won't get in my way, it ain't stopping me 
Always reach for the top, that's how it's gotta be 
Don't worry 'bout the people that, hmm, take a pop of me 
So on with the show, hit the road, here we go To the east to the west, to the north to the south 
They know AC and they know I get down 
To the east, to the west, to the north, to the south 
Keep my feet on the ground and they know that Ya don't see me braggin' 
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon 
Giddy up, giddy up and hold up, take a look around 
Then roll out, roll it outta town Cause ya don't see me braggin' 
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon 
Giddy up, giddy up and hold up, take a look around 
Then roll out, roll it outta town Now wait, people wanna know about the way I live 
And do my biz 
This bright young kid works hard just to make these hits 
But never the less they try to attack me Just to make me react but Spectras got my back 
So come on mama, we're strong 
My label's got the ball rollin, they come correct 
From hip hop to pop, go look at, check From the east to the west, to the north, to the south 
They know AC and they know I get down 
From the east to the west, to the north to the south 
Keep my feet on the ground and they know that Ya don't see me braggin' 
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon 
Giddy up, giddy up and hold up, take a look around 
Then roll out, roll it outta town Cause ya don't see me braggin' 
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon 
Giddy up, giddy up and hold up, take a look around 
Then roll out, roll it outta town, then roll out, roll it outta town
