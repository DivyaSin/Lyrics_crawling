Through you, I see I 
Between a broken nose and a fake smile 
Between piety and gunpowder 
Between fighting and fleeing the scene Between murder and diplomacy 
Between aggression and implosion 
Between brutal and realistically well behaved 
Between screaming and pulling in the reins 
Between tiptoeing and ambling What am I to do with all this fire? 
(I'd like to hit you but I'd never hit you) 
Would you stay with me in this red space? 
(I'd like to slap you but I'd never slap you Between violence and silently seething 
Between my fist and my Pollyanna flower 
Between 'Fuck you' to your face and it's alright 
Between war and denial Between violence and silently seething 
Between my fist and my Pollyanna flower 
Between 'Fuck you' to your face and it's alright 
Between war and denial Between flying vases and secretly weeping 
Between loose cannons and ever downplaying 
Between bruises and nobly differing 
Between bursting and boiling What am I to do with all this burning? 
(I'd like to hurt you but I'd never hurt you) 
Do I overwhelm you in this place? 
(I'd like to kill you but I'd never kill you) Between violence and silently seething 
Between my fist and my Pollyanna flower 
Between 'Fuck you' to your face and it's alright 
Between war and denial What am I to do with all this fire 
Can you understand me in this place?
