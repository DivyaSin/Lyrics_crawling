I can do it 
Like the one you'd never want 
I can bend it 
Sinister like his last thought 
He played his hand 
You needed time 
You found your place when you fell behind 
You can make it 
Disappear without a voice See you by the windowsill 
Delicate like elders' wills 
See me in a distant land 
Recondite like falling man But there's a line I won't cross 
Into another's shadow 
There's a line I won't cross 
I don't want to look that way again You lived a week without a name 
I kept discreet cause that's my way 
Inside the world we fell into 
I played a role and so did you I can do it 
If it's what your really want 
I can mend it 
If you give it a shot See me in my maker's hands 
Unknown like an othered land 
See you by the empty shelf 
I don't want nobody else But there's a line I won't cross 
Into another's shadow 
There's a line I won't cross 
I don't want to look that way again You lived a week without a name 
I kept discreet cause that's my way 
Inside the world we fell into 
I played a role and so did you
