[Verse 1] 
I saw her in a haze on no regrets 
Had a sip, took a trip that I won't forget 
One look and I can't push her out of my head 
I get high 
She's a dream that I see when I close my eyes 
Try to leave but I can't and I don't know why 
She's the sun, she's the moon, she's the velvet sky 
Get high [Pre-Chorus] 
When I'm with her she gets me 
When I'm with her she gets, she gets me [Chorus] 
High 
She gets me 
High 
She gets me 
High 
She gets me 
High 
She gets me [Verse 2] 
She [?] like a summer, she's my fourth of July 
Gives me all that I need every single time 
Way up in the clouds like a number nine 
I get high [Pre-Chorus] 
When I'm with her she gets me 
When I'm with her she gets, she gets me [Chorus] 
High 
She gets me 
High 
She gets me 
She gets me [Outro] 
When I'm with her she gets, she gets me 
High 
She gets me
