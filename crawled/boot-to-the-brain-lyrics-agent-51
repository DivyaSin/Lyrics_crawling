A smack in the face 
A knife in my back 
I wanna go under again 
The day so fast and the 
Night so short 
How could this be my only friend? 
Now I know what's right 
And I know what's wrong 
Don't need some hypocrite tellin' me that 
But if I lived my life by my own rules 
I'd have a beer in my hand 
On my back 
They try to warn you 
And try to fuck shit up 
Then they try to tame you 
They they do it again 
Take another boot to the brain 
All your problems will remain 
Ya hit the ground and call it a day 
Intoxicated inspiration!
