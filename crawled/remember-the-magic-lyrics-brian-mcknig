[Choir:] 
(AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH) 
[Brian McKnight:] 
Can you rember back to a summer time, back to water color days, that still run through your mind? Oh, I rember, just a my old and me, run through an open field, the way it used to be? 
The feeling that our hearts could just take wing, we could live out all our dreams, the journey there was never far away. 
But like a dream come true, that's still inside of you, the secret of tomorrow is to live your dreams today. 
Remeber the time, remember the feeling, remember the magic in our lives. 
You opened up my eyes to a new world reveling, so remember the magic just remember the magic in our lives. 
Do you remember the way it used to feel, when love was only 
make-believe and fairy tails were real. 
Oh I remember, you were with me once again, relive our fantasies, it never has to end. The feeling that our hearts could just take wings we could live a world of dreams, together we could sail against the wind. [Choir] 
Sail against the wind 
[Brian McKnight:] 
And now I know where to begin, gotta find it all again. 
From now until [Brian & Choir] 
Forever 
[Brian McKnight:] 
Remember the time, remember the feeling, remember the magic, in our lives. 
Remember the time, Remember the feeling, remember the magic, in your eyes. 
You opened up my eyes, to a new world reveling, so remember that feeling, just remember the magic, one more time, 
[Choir:] 
One more time 
[Brian McKnight:] 
One more time, remember the magic.
