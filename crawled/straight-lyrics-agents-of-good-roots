The moon was drifting over jordan 
As the street lies under control 
And the she slips into the middle 
Head on, the tour takes it's toll 
You bring bring blues from a fountain 
Keep you wishing for a rainy day 
Get a sandman sitting 
Giving looks that will fade away If you could get yourself straight 
I think that I would like to talk to you 
'cause talk, talk, talk 
That's all we do Will you dance for your brother 
While your lover doesn't know your name 
And in an undercover shot 
Still you talk of what you can't explain 
They say nice change lady 
Hey baby can you spare a dime 
But then you put it in your pocket 
And it's off with another line You better believe it 
Better go
