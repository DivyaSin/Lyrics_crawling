this is my weed, Oh no 
this is my weed, It's all I know. 
there is no doubt in my mind, 
there is no doubt in my mind 
this is my weed, 
and as of now I'm smoking. 
look at my eyes. 
visualize laughing applies yeah. 
but that's all you know. 
Chorus 
HA-HA-HA-HA 
these are the days, 
the radio is learning, 
look at my eyes, 
visualize, laughing applies, 
but that's all they know. 
there's no doubt in my mind. 
REPEAT 
Chorus 
how do you know what you like? 
if you don't like you, 
you got to feel from your nerve, 
and what's false is true. 
it cost to be free, 
and one is more than two, 
and now I feel kinda funny. 
and now you're funny too. 
Chorus 
Poison
