hold on forever, or at least today 
don't follow me, i'm blind 
now you're forsaken, thought you'd never be 
don't forget that you're mine i seem torn along the path 
to decide for the better or blow like a draft 
slightly twisted as you listed all my faults 
trapped in the vaults of the hard stone 
of your heart felt sympathy that you lent to me 
slowly revisited with unlimited sanity 
feelings of an overblown scheme hold on forever, or at least today 
don't follow me, i'm blind 
now you're forsaken, thought you'd never be 
don't forget that you're mine with you, i flourished 
love being malnourished 
under the cover of a lovers flame 
slipped down like the winded needy 
forced down like the money greedy 
slowly, fundamentally, 
followed the epitome of your wasted way 
silently, violently, stroked as the bellows blew up 
the heat of the extreme shame hold on forever, or at least today 
don't follow me, i'm blind 
now you're forsaken, thought you'd never be 
don't forget that you're mine don't forget that you're mine hold on forever, or at least today 
don't follow me, i'm blind 
now you're forsaken, thought you'd never be 
don't forget that you're mine
