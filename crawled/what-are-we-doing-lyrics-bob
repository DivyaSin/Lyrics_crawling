ahhh x8 its been a long time coming and the clocks says a quarter to four, 
i'm feelin like its now or never and your body's tellin me its a go, so what are we doing, 
what are we doing here, 
what are we doing, 
what are we doing here, 
what are we doing, what are we doing here, 
what are we doing, 
what are we doing here, 
what are we doing, on a late night week and showcase event, 
kinda liked you at first but then i noticed you're friend, 
so i got my folk to approach both of them, 
and they both came over and poured up some hen, 
and we aint say much, but we spoke, 
cos you dont have to speak when you know, 
thier eyes said to me, systems go, 
its about that time, we should go, 
so, allow me to flow, 
as i propose a toast to the good life, 
on a good night we go, 
grab a bottle and go, 
to the, hold on, yes a beautiful night, 
colourful kodak photo, 
but as soon as you entered the room i guess you froze, its been a long time coming and the clocks says a quarter to four, 
i'm feelin like its now or never and your body's tellin me its a go, so what are we doing, 
what are we doing here, 
what are we doing, 
what are we doing here, 
what are we doing, it the end of the week, but the first of the month, 
when the moon gets full, but the night is still young, 
with a crowd like this you dont know where you'll end up, 
so i juat play cool like the cubes in my cup, 
huh, 
but you cxame through tryna body me up, 
and i dont know what you thinkin but you're eyes said enough, 
and everything we felt was obvious lust, 
which i thoughts kinda cool, 
i aint gonna bluff, 
but, look at the clock, 
its about time that i duck, 
outta the door, 
dont mean to be in a rush but lady you can hit me up, 
so you hit me up, 
shoes in the door, 
smoke in the air, 
temperatures up, 
but, i guess when the lights went out it froze you up, its been a long time coming and the clocks says a quarter to four, 
i'm feelin like its now or never and your body's tellin me its a go, so what are we doing, 
what are we doing here, 
what are we doing, 
what are we doing here, 
what are we doing, ahh x 16
