You say you're living an empty life 
Your days filled with nothing but misery and strife 
Nobody to call your own as you're slowly wasting away 
In this rat-infested hole that you call home 
Tapping, tapping, tapping the vein 
Rusty razor blade slices deep Blood spurting 
From the gashes in your wrists 
Rats are crawling out 
From the cracks in the walls 
Rats are crawling down 
Crawling down your arms 
Lapping up your blood 
While it's still warm
