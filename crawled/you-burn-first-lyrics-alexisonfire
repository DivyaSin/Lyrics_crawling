I said, "Come here, if there is a fire 
Cause I want you 
To burn first" She screamed at me, "I want to be desired" 
I said, "Easy girl, 
I know it hurts" So, I'll give thanks, 
But I am a liar 
Cause I got a feeling 
I just might get worse Now there's nothing wrong with you 
I'm just tired 
And I need you for a brand new curse You burn first 
You burn first 
You burn first "Come here, if there is a fire 
Cause I want you 
To burn first" She screamed at me, "I want to be desired" 
I said, "Easy girl, 
I know it hurts" So, I'll give thanks, 
But I am a liar 
Cause I got a feeling 
I just might get worse Now there's nothing wrong with you 
I've just grown tired 
And I need you for a brand new curse
