I miss your face, I miss your voice 
I need you back to me 
Everything in you 
Is driving me insane 
I miss your face, I miss your voice 
I need you back to me 
Everything in you 
Is driving me insane I lost you I want you back 
I need you just like that 
Everything was okay 
Until you went away 
I see your face everywhere 
I wish I can stop my brain 
Reminding me of you 
Because I am so insane (I miss you) 
I miss your face, I miss your voice 
(So bad) 
I need you back to me 
(I'll go back) 
Everything in you 
(To the past) 
Is driving me insane 
(I miss you) 
I miss your face, I miss your voice 
(So bad) 
I need you back to me 
(I'll go back) 
Everything in you 
(To the past) 
Is driving me insane Oh I wish I can go back 
To the time where I had 
You belong to me 
I need a time machine 
Oh I wish I can go back 
To the time where I had 
You belong to me 
I need a time machine I had a dream last night 
Everything looks dark 
What I see is only you 
It's the worse nightmare 
I always remember your face 
I see you around everywhere 
I want to see the real you 
I need a time machine (I miss you) 
I miss your face, I miss your voice 
(So bad) 
I need you back to me 
(I'll go back) 
Everything in you 
(To the past) 
Is driving me insane 
(I miss you) 
I miss your face, I miss your voice 
(So bad) 
I need you back to me 
(I'll go back) 
Everything in you 
(To the past) 
Is driving me insane Oh I wish I can go back 
To the time where I had 
You belong to me 
I need a time machine 
Oh I wish I can go back 
To the time where I had 
You belong to me 
I need a time machine I wish I can go back 
To the time where I had 
You belong to me 
I need a time machine 
Oh I wish I can go back 
To the time where I had 
You belong to me

Oh I wish I can go back 
To the time where I had 
You belong to me 
I need a time machine 
Oh I wish I can go back
