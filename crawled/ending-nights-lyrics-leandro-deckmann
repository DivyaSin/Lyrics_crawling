It starts with one One thing 
I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down 'till the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away It's so unreal You didn't look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, to didn't even know 
I wasted it all just to Watch you go I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried 
It all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually 
Be a memory of a time when I've tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme 
To remind myself how I've tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I'm surprised, it Got so far Things aren't the way they were before 
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
Not that you wouldn't knew me, back then 
But it all comes back to me In the end You kept everything inside 
And even though I tried 
It all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually 
Be a memory 
Of a time when I've tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
For all this 
There's only one thing you should've known I've tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter
