Goodbye Rosalind 
It's time to let you go 
I've gotta save myself 
I just can't take it no more I met you on a summer day 
Chocolate brown eyes that blew me away 
We fell in love that night 
I knew our love would be alright Goodbye Rosalind 
It's time to let you go 
I've gotta save myself 
I just can't take it no more Said you'd love me for all time 
Then we kissed, your lips were like wine 
Then that man came along one day 
Fell in love and you slipped away Goodbye Rosalind 
It's time to let you go 
I've gotta save myself 
I just can't take it no more Now you come back to see me again 
Say you wanna be more than friends 
You want my love one more time 
Say you'll love me for all time Goodbye Rosalind 
It's time to let you go 
I've gotta save myself 
I just can't take it no more Goodbye Rosalind 
It's time to let you go 
I've gotta save myself 
I just can't take it no more
