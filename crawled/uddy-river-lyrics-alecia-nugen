Roll on muddy river, roll to the sea 
Take all these memories from me 
Take all of the rain that's falling down 
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground It's about a love that's got me blue 
A love forsaken for somebody new 
He roles through town just like you do 
He's just like the river that's only passing through So roll on muddy river, roll to the sea 
Take all these memories from me 
Take all of the rain that's falling down 
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground I've grown so tired of all those lies 
I'm on my way now to find some bluer skies 
Gonna find me a ticket far from this town 
Far from the river that only brings me down I've got a broken heart, it's about to mend 
Like it always has, time and time again 
Gonna send these troubles on down the line 
I'm gonna let them spill and flow away like wine Roll on muddy river, roll to the sea 
Take all these memories from me 
Take all of the rain that's falling down 
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground 
Take all of the rain that's falling down 
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
