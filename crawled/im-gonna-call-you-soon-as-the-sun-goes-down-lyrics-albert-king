Baby, you know I wanna love you again 
Baby, baby, I've just got to love you again 
We're gonna make things right 
And we'll be together til the end Hey baby, I'm gonna call you as soon as the sun goes down 
Hey baby, I'm gonna call you as soon as the sun goes down 
I want you to make love, I want us to make love 
When no one is around Want you to look for me 
You know I won't be hard to find 
Hey, I want you to go ahead and look for me 
You know I won't be hard to find 
We've been missing for so long 
Little girl, I'm about to lose my mind The rain start' falling 
And the cloud turn' dark as night 
The rain start' falling 
You know the cloud turn' dark as night 
But if I can find my little girl 
Everything is gonna be alright ...(?) 
And they will be talking all the time Hey baby, I wanna make love to you tonight 
Hey baby, baby, baby, you know I wanna make love to you tonight 
We're going some faraway place 
And I declare(?) everything is gonna be alright
