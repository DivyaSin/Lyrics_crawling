Oh, I'm tired of your show 
I want a real man when I look into the mirror? 
I don't understand, can't see it clearer 
I'm sexy, I'm hot, I deserve more 
Look at these body curves, why you unsure? 
Oh, nothing's good enough for you 
Even after 1, 2, 3 tequila shots 
You still leave me high and dry 
Thanks a lot 
Everywhere I go guys say I'm so hot 
So why-y-y do you... 
Still fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot? 
Still fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot? 
So why do you, why do you, why do you 
Still fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot? 
Oh, I'm tired of your show 
It's time to wake up now, see what you're missing 
Open up your eyes and pretend that you'll listen 
I'm sexy, I'm hot, I deserve more 
I'm a single boy and I think I deserve more 
Oh, nothing's good enough for you 
Even after 1, 2, 3 tequila shots 
You still leave me high and dry 
Thanks a lot 
Everywhere I go guys say I'm so hot 
So why-y-y do you... 
Still fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot? 
Still fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot? 
So why do you, why do you, why do you 
Still fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot? 
Oh oh-oh-oh, oh oh-oh-oh 
Oh oh-oh-oh, oh oh-oh-oh 
Don't kiss me like a, hold me like a, please me like a, love me like a robot-bot-bot-bot 
Don't treat me like a, pat me like a, crush me like a, do me like a robot-bot-bot-bot 
I'm giving you 1, 2, 3 of my shots 
Swear you're still high 
And the rhythm is right 
Everywhere I go guys say I'm so hot 
So why-y-y do you, you, you, you, you... 
Still fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot? 
Still fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot? 
So why do you, why do you, why do you 
Still fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot? 
Oh oh-oh-oh, oh oh-oh-oh 
Oh oh-oh-oh, oh oh-oh-oh 
Oh oh-oh-oh, oh oh-oh-oh 
Oh oh-oh-oh, oh oh-oh-oh 
Fuck me like a robot-bot-bot-bot
