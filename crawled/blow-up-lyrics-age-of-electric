Falling up the stairs I met 
A soft target, design bullets 
How could we sleep, through the impact 
Our world blew up You were born in '75 
With silver tone, and grand design 
And stung with gravity of life 
And we were bored You were saying something wise, hidden in 
Some black sarcastic lullaby 
Can we do something with this, pilot light 
If I were molding a monster I'd use your eyes Nobody has known me 
Nobody has loved me 
Nobody has owned me 
Blow me away Change the course, the shape, the size 
I am the girl to be the bride 
To hatch, to hope, to spend a life 
A lifetime 
A lifetime 
A lifetime Mess my clothes and spark a match 
We blew it up 
Burst my bubble back, get back, get back 
The fueling cities chews the best, and spit it out 
Biting quick, and moving fast A need to wrap around some life 
A remedy for boredom like 
A referee between them and us 
A bruise she low, the pain will show 
Idle minds get by Our world blew up, blew up, blew up 
Our world blew up, blew up, blew up 
Our world blew up, blew up, blew up 
Idle minds Nobody has known me 
Nobody has loved me 
Nobody has owned me 
Blow me away A need to wrap around some life 
A remedy but full of life 
Sell the world, the days to come 
A referee sweep, between them and us Falling up the stairs I met 
A soft target, design bullets 
How could we sleep, through the impact
