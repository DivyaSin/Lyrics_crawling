Been hanging around 
This old house 
Its a mess 
It aint sound, or even safe 
Been driving around 
The neighborhood 
Seen lots of others 
Looking a lot like mine I need you to come in 
And clean me 
Ive had my doubts about it 
Free me 
And clean out 
This old house of mine You can sleep in 
The living room 
But keep away room 
The closet in the back 
Cause Ive got skeletons 
I dont want you to see 
And Ive got secrets 
I dont want you to know Been wondering why you 
Would want to stay here 
Would want to come in 
Amongst all of my grime 
Been thinking about how 
You dont even care 
About the shame I wear 
You love me all the same
