River Of Tears 
Ben. E. King It seems that I just cant win 
Ive been hurt time and time again Every time I give my heart somebody tears it all apart 
Through the years, lord knows I must have shed a river of tears 
I tried to be fair in every way 
Id even ignored, yes, I have, things that people say 
Oh, still Im lonely and all alone 
Ive got no one I can call my own 
Through the years I know I must have shed a river of tears A river of tears, oh, how I yearned, yeah 
Tears that flow Somebody tell me what Im doing wrong 
Isnt there anyone I can depend on 
Through the years I know I must have shed a river of tears 
A river of tears, oh, how Ive yearned, yes, I have 
Tears that flow oh, how Ive yearned 
Talking bout talkin bout a river 
Talkin bout a river rbkbsbdfbr
