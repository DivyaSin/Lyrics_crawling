This space is tight, I'm running out of air 
And for the moment, you all can fit 
This frenzied state has almost finished me 
And I won't bide my time to see it blow Driving now against the flow of lights 
And I can see the fault in every home 
They can try to hold the creatures in at night 
And my response will be angry, fist and teeth I'll fight you all 
I'll fight you all We'll tear down this place, she told it to him softly 
Don't use your heart, it only makes you slow 
I'll tear down this place, I've known it since she told me 
Make sure to take everything they have Woah woah woah woah I'll fight you all I'll fight you 
I'll fight you all 
I'll fight you all 
I'll fight you all We'll tear down this place, she told it to him softly 
Don't use your heart, it only makes you slow 
I'll tear down this place, I've known it since she told me 
Make sure to take everything they have 
Make sure to take everything they have
