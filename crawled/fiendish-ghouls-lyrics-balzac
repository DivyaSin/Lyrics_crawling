Glimpses of a dark forest 
The memory becomes real 
Freedom and skill in my arms 
For all time 
Dreams of a dark forest 
Your memory becomes real 
Relish treachery, the brutality of love 
Go! Fiendish ghouls 
When the night 
You are waiting fiendish ghouls night 
You are waiting fiendish ghouls 
When the night 
You are waiting fiendish ghouls night
