She says not to buy her flowers 
Or big expensive gifts 
She says she don't want jewelry 
And she doesn't need another dress 
If I want to show her how much I adore her 
The best way that I've found 
Is to make sure when I'm finished 
I put that toilet seat down We've been to counciling 
To try and see the ways we could improve 
This thing between us 
And different ways to show each other "I love you" 
Forget about those getaway vacations 
To romantic coastal towns 
If you want to say "I love you" 
Then put that toilet seat down 'Cause in the middle of the night 
It's cold and it's dark 
And when I hear my name in vain 
I know I haven't done my part 
She just wants me to support her 
And the best way that I've found 
So with a gentle hand and a loving touch 
I put that toilet seat down I know it's kind of funny 
You can teach a little puppy 
But it's very hard to train a grown man 
When I'm all about my business 
And the path of least resistance 
She's the one that suffers in the end
