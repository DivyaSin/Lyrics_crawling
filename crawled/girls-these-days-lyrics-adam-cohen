Girls these days, they wanna come first 
To know who they are, to know what they're worth. 
They wanna have nights where everything works, 
Keep it like nobody gets hurt. 
They wanna smile when they press rewind, 
They don't want life to pass them by, 
They wanna feel, they wanna touch, 
Girls these days, they want so much. 
They'll fool you into thinkin' that you're gonna drive, 
Then you'll be looking over from the passenger's side, 
Girls these days. 
Girls these days. Girls these days, they wanna control, 
When they say stop, wait, go. 
They put your number in and leave you wonderin' if it's yes or no. 
What they got is so good you'll be runnin' red lights. 
It could be jackpot if you play your hand right. 
Girls these days. 
Girls these days. These days they'll tell you what their name is 
These days they'll walk right up to strangers 
Girls these days. 
Beautiful... 
Girls these days are beautiful... 
And guys like me are barely keepin' up 
Guys like me are still fallin' in love 
With these girls, these girls, these girls, these girls, these days 
Girls these days. 
Girls these days. Show you their intimate pages 
Take you private place
