( Live MCM Caf ) Don't drag it down 
Just because you're down 
Just because you're blue 
Doesn't mean I'm too 
I know found 
You need more than me 
Don't talk to me 
Without being free It's freedom 
Withoutlove 
And magic 
Without love 
And magic without love 
Yeah Hear me say 
Better thing will surely come my way 
Hear me say 
Better thing will surely come my way Say the magic's gone 
Well I'm not a magician 
Say the spark's gone 
Well get an electrician 
Say you're right about needing to be free 
All that's bullshit, baby just won't rid of me You want freedom withoutlove 
And magic 
Without love 
And magic without love 
yeah Hear me say 
Better things will surely come my way 
Hear me say 
Better things will surely come my way My way 
Hey 
Surely come my way...
