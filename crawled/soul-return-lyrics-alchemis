We do not die, we only change 
All must die before their rebirth as 
Fruit must rot to release its seed 
Soul transmigration from divinity to 
The mutable world of birth and 
Disease, old age and death the breeze 
Created by a soul's departure arising 
From this dead and lifeless shell we 
Emanate from the deceased we do 
Not die only change, only change, 
Youknow we do not die only change 
You know we only change death is the 
Dying of the light now the 
Imperishable soul begins its journey to 
The divine implicit and vague become 
Explicit and clear infinitely long 
Passage from another world to our 
Own the winds of a departing soul 
The time of now is slipping away we 
Do not die only change, only change
