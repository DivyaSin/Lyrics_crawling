Listen to the ground, there is movement all around 
There is somethin' goin' down, and I can feel it 
On the waves of the air, there is dancin' out there 
If it's somethin' we can share, we can steal it And that sweet city woman, she moves through the light, 
Controlling my mind and my soul When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right, 
And then I get The night fever, night fever, we know how to do it 
Gimme the night fever, night fever, we know how to show it Here I am, prayin' for this moment to last, 
Livin' on the music so fine, born on the wind, 
Makin' it mine 
And then I get The night fever, night fever, we know how to do it (ahh) 
Gimme the night fever, night fever, we know how to show it In the heat of our love, don't need no help for us to make it 
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin' 
I got fire in my mind, I get higher in my walkin', 
And I'm glowin' in the dark, I give you warnin' And that sweet city woman, she moves through the light, 
Controlling my mind and my soul 
When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right, 
And then I get The night fever, night fever, we know how to do it 
Feels like forever, baby, don't you know it 
Gimme the night fever, night fever, we know how to show it Here I am, prayin' for this moment to last, 
Livin' on the music so fine, born on the wind, 
Makin' it mine Night fever, night fever, we know how to do it 
(Feels like forever, baby don't you know it) 
Gimme the night fever, night fever, we know how to show it 
(Feeling forever don't you know it) 
Gimme the night fever, night fever, we know how to do it 
(Feels like forever, baby don't you know it) 
Gimme the night fever, night fever, we know how to show it (ooh) 
Gimme the night fever, night fever, we know how to do it 
(Feels like forever, baby don't you know it) 
Gimme the night fever, night fever
