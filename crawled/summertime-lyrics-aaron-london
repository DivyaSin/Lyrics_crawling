Summer's finally here 
Time to kick back and relax 
Winter blues is old news 
Nostalgia is in the air 
Misbehaving clouds of grey 
Don't you dare come out today "I wanna see your face turn " 
Father said with such delight 
We're wild and we're reckless 
We'll never forget this 
Time we spend carelessly wondering the streets 
We're wild and we're reckless 
We'll never forget this 
Time we spend to satisfy our youth Just youth 
Just some juvenile youth 
Just some juvenile youth 
Just some juvenile youth 
Just youth 
Just some juvenile youth 
Just some juvenile youth 
Just some juvinlie youth we'll stay juvinile forever 
we'll stay juvinile forever 
we'll stay juvinile forever
