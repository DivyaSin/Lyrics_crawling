Paranoid! Going through it, Oh Lord! 
Somebody pray for me please 
Somebody, amen, somebody Somebody pray for me, somebody pray for me 
Ain't got no fucking mind, somebody help me please 
Them niggas still snitching, no common loyalty 
Boy I'm so stressed out, too many lawyer fees 
Somebody pray for me, somebody pray for me 
Them pussy niggas mad, they filled with jealousy 
I got that problem solver, now where my enemies 
Somebody pray for me, somebody pray for me I think I'm going crazy 
I think I lost my mind 
Feel like the feds watching 
I think they tapped my line 
I'm going through paranoia 
Just paid another lawyer 
Got to keep the devil off me 
I need some holy water 
Lord somebody pray for me 
Somebody pray for me 
I got so much money bitch I can't go to sleep 
I lost my granny Georgia 
Oh may she rest in peace 
I took a bunch of diamonds put 'em in my Jesus piece 
I'm sick and tired of crying 
All my niggas in the city dying 
Either that or prison cells 
They doing so much time

Ain't got no fucking mind, somebody help me please 
Them niggas still snitching, no common loyalty

Somebody pray for me, somebody pray for me 
Them pussy niggas mad, they filled with jealousy 
I got that problem solver, now where my enemies 
Somebody pray for me, somebody pray for me I'm calling out to God 
I hope he get the message

Run up and you'll regret it

That money bring you haters 
But still know its a blessing 
Somebody pray for me somebody pray for me 
Just 'cuz I'm in the 'rari
