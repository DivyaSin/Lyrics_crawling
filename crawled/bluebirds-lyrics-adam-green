Bluebirds are so natural 
I want to buy them for my friends. 
Bluebirds are so dismal 
And I want to trade mine in. 
And I don't go out for brunch 
And I don't go out for cunts 
And I don't go out for months 
Without my Barnes and Noble credit card. Cleaning out my wisdom teeth 
I found a diamond in my gum. 
Cleaning out the kitchen 
I found a spoon that play the drums. 
And despite the things they say 
I gave it up that day 
I'd never go that way 
Unless your daddy nailed me to the cross. Suicide, suicide, 
Leaning out to everyone that hides. 
Breaking the chains on the things down low. 
Where it stops I don't know how that goes. Bluebirds are so natural 
I want to buy them for my friends. 
Bluebirds are so dismal 
And I want to trade mine in. 
And despite the things they say 
I gave them up that day 
I'd never go that way 
Unless your daddy nailed me to the cross, 
Your daddy nailed me to the cross.
