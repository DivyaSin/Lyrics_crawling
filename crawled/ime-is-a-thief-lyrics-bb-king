I woke up this morning and looked at my life 
Filled with so much sorrow and grief 
And in my troubled mind 
I could see through all my strife 
That time is only a thief 
Yes time is a thief 
That will steal your tomorrows 
And leave you only yesterday 
Yes time is a thief 
That will rob you of your years 
Your youth the only ransom you can pay 
So treasure each little moment 
Don't let a single minute slip away 
Because time is a thief 
That will rob you of your years 
And never return one yesterday 
Oh time is a thief 
That will rob you of your years 
And never return one yesterday
