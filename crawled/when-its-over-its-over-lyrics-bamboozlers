When it's Over it's Over 
Words and music by: Steven Rhodes 
So many times it happens, we do not speak our minds 
And what we do not say, catches up to us in time 
When it comes to an end, the only person we blame is ourselves 
Then we find ourself lonely, in our own little piece of hell 
Chorus: 
And you told me, whenit's over it's over 
When it's over it's over always? 
You tell me that you love me, but actions speak louder than words 
You say you'll never go away, but things like that go unheard 
Everyone must go sometime, for reasona of their own or for due time 
And even though we don't think so, neither of us has committed a crime
