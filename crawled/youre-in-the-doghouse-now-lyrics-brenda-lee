You wore out your welcome mat 
You used to be the cat's meow 
You're in the doghouse now 
You're such a handsome hound 
You'll wind up in the pound 
All you can say is bow-wow-wow 
You're in the doghouse now 
It was grand, 
Yes, it was swell, 
But you bit the hand 
That fed you so well 
I hate a dog who begs 
With his tail between his legs 
Find a new place to bum your chow 
Who's in the doghouse now? 
On the town, 
Out on the trail, 
Don't come 'round 
Go chase your own tail 
I heard from Socrates, 
"Sleep with dog, 
Wake up with fleas." 
I never liked you anyhow 
You're in the doghouse now 
You're in the doghouse now 
You're in the doghouse now 
Down, boy.
