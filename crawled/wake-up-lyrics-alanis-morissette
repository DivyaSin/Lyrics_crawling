You like snow but only if it's warm 
You like rain but only if it's dry 
There's no sentimental value to the rose that fell on your floor 
There's no fundamental excuse for the granted I'm taken for 'Cause it's easy not to 
So much easier not to 
And what goes around never comes around to you You like pain but only if it doesn't hurt too much 
And you sit, and you wait, to receive 
There's an obvious attraction 
To the path of least resistance in your life 
Well there's an obvious aversion no amount of my insistence 
Could make you try tonight 'Cause it's easy not to 
So much easier not to 
And what goes around never comes around to you 
To you, to you, to you, to you, to you There's no love, no money, no thrill anymore There's an apprehensive naked little trembling boy 
With his head in his hands 
And there's an underestimated and impatient little girl 
Raising her hand But it's easy not to 
So much easier not to 
And what goes around never comes around to you 
To you, to you Get up, get up, get up off of it 
Get up, get up, get up off of it 
Get out, get outta here, enough already 
Get up, get up, get up off of it 
Wake up
