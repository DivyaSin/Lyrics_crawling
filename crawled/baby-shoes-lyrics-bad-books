Baby shoes, never used 
Thought of you until it happened to us too 
Jennifer, I have heard 
You made it through, you finally moved 
That's good for you I'm a dog, I'm a bird 
I'm a rat, and you're detached from all the words 
I'm a dick, you're around 
I am bound and terrified of making sounds Satan's eyes, the surprise 
Search inside and oh my god she's back alive 
She is mean, she is harmed She once belonged to us now belongs to the dark 
She once belonged to us now belongs to the dark She is gone, false alarm 
Here we are and now I am growing out my arms 
I can make, big mistakes 
Evil comes, yeah it comes to me in ways I'm a saint, sticky paint 
Three sixes we can call her by her name 
I'm a saint, sticky paint 
Three sixes and we call her by her paint I'm so lonely, feed me feed me 
I'm so angry, pet me, pet me 
I'm so lonely, kill me, kill me 
She's so lonely, kill her through me Here I come, down the hall 
I've got a pretty fucking end to all in all 
Hate the bars, I love the bars 
At least I'm safe and you can't hurt me anymore 'Cause she is mean, mean and harmed 
She once belonged to us but now to the dark 
She once belonged to us now belongs to the dark You and me, plucking feathers, and 
You and me destroy the best of things 
Sometimes I, can save the afterlife 
And I am scared the apocalypse is three She is mean, she can kill 
She would do it just to have a simple thrill 
She's a saint, sticky paint 
Three sixes and they call me by her name Three sixes and we call her by her name
