Staring down a bottle 
Feeling kinda mean 
Itchin' for some trouble 
Tryin' to keep it clean 
Wound up so tight 
Poundin' like a drum 
Put up a good fight 
I've been never known to run 
One shot too many 
Two for the road 
I'm ready for action 
I'm ready too far gone 
Weavin' down the highway 
Cross the double yellow line 
Never saw 'em comin' 
Never saw a sign 
Smell of burnin' rubber 
Screamin' to the right 
On the straight of center 
But I got lucky all night 
One shot too many 
Two for the road 
I'm way in the outskirts and 
I'm ready too far gone 
One shot too many 
Two for the road 
I'm way in the outskirts and 
I'm ready too far gone
