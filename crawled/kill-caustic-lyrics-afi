So, I'm feeling much worse now 
You're better, you're better 
Your designer drugs 
Won't work, won't work for me Connect to a three-volt 
I hope your battery dies 
How could you run 
On such, such voltage? All the same, I remain 
The one you blame and I'm 
Demonized, purified, justified 
As you let yourself show So now you'll love these screams 
What's left of me 
Don't speak 
Love these screams 
Like I do 
My name As the infinite stops cold 
Just nine and the six are gone 
Guess I was the one to ride, ride 
Ride that dirty ride That is turning so fast now 
I think I cannot, cannot hold on 
But at this pace 
Who'd want, who'd want to All the same I remain 
The one you blame and I'm 
Demonized, purified, justified 
As you let yourself show So now you'll love these screams 
What's left of me 
Don't speak 
Love these screams 
Like I do 
My name Don't ever speak my name Don't ever speak my name again 
Don't ever speak it 
Don't ever speak my name again 
Don't speak, don't speak Don't ever my 
Don't speak my name So now you'll love these screams 
What's left of me 
Don't speak 
Love these screams 
Like I do 
My name
