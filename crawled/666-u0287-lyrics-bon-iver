Sixes hang in the door 
What kind of shit to ignore, I've cut the cloth 
(Ooh, hard line circle) 
How to know who to write 
How to know who can cull up all the questions 
(We know that I'm right, cause to clean out a night) 
I fell in love I heard about it, I heard about it, I heard about it, no 
And so it's not in your clasp 
What's the function or the task, well, I'd stun and I'd stammer 
Help me reach the hammer (For then what will I ask) 
That's a pair of them docks 
Mooring out two separate lochs ain't that some kind of quandary 
Take me into your palms what is left when I'm hungry I learned about it, I learned about it, I've learned about it, no I'm still standing in 
I'm still standing in your need of prayer, the need of prayer No, I don't know the path 
Of what kind of pith I've amassed, long lines of questions 
Lessons learned (Lessons, lessons) 
But what do you lose to concede? 
Yes, it's hard to believe when 'em sold from your sleeve 
Just come off of your kneel 
Please, please, please 
I can admit to conceal 
No, that's not how that's supposed to feel, oh, no 
(It's not for broader appeal) 
Fuck the fashion of it, dear I've laughed about it, I've laughed about it, I've laughed about it, no
