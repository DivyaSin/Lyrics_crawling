Tonight I can't sleep 
Because of all the thoughts I keep 
Running around inside my brain 
Sweet memories come back 
Yeah thoughts of you attack my head 
Making me go so insane In my dreams you are there 
In my dreams we are a pair 
Why did it have to turn out this way? 
In my thoughts you are there 
And in my every thought you care 
The look of love in your eyes 
I'll stay Remembering you 
And all the little things you do 
So I look away and I fake a smile 
Waiting for a sign 
Wishing I could drop a line 
I'm missing you, it's been a while A brand new page, a whole clean slate 
It's too bad it's without you 
And the smile that I wore is gone 
You shut the door 
A friend, but I'll always want more 
I'll always want more
