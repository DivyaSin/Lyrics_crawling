Fortune cookie what do you say? 
The dream survives on streets of L.A. 
But dreams get dirty, when youre down on your knees 
Its not mud its the sleaze Its California baby 
Welcome to the show 
Down here in the Valley of San Fernando 
And if the sun dont thrill ya 
The next scene surely will 
Straight from a Tarantino film No outrage or scandal that shots were heard 
Some folks think she got what she deserved 
One less junkie on the street A family picture taken back in the day 
I knew her then by her god given name 
She had a secret but she never did say
