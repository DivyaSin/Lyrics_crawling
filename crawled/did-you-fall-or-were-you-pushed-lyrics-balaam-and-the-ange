Heat's on, heart is burning 
Somebody took a desperate chance 
Downtown streets of passion 
Last rites for a dead romance 
Leave the wasteland, time to choose 
Crack force is closing in on you 
Take a hard line for the last time Did you hurt somebody 
Did you kill the pain 
Did you hurt somebody 
Gonna lie alone again Long walk, guard the backway 
Cool hand as you mark your man 
Love in blood, muscle n' money 
Shoulder to shoulder, close command 
Final stand, daddy don't die 
Bullhorn bleeding battle cries 
Take a hard line for the last time Did you hurt somebody 
Did you kill the pain 
Did you hurt somebody 
Gonna lie alone again
