Some where to find a friend like you. Some how when your around the sky is 
Always blue. The way we talk, the things you say the way you make it all okay. 
And how you know all of my jokes but you laugh anyways. If I could wish 
For one thing I take the smile that you bring wherever you go in this 
World I'll come a long... Together we dream the same dream forever I'm 
Here for you, your here for me. Ohhh, two voices one song. And any where you 
Are you know I'll be around and when you call my name, I'll listen for the sound, If I could wish for one thing, I'll take the smile that you bring. Wherever you 
Go in this world I'll come a long... Together we dream the same dream forever I'm here for you, your here from me. Ohhh, two voices one song. Ohhh two 
Voices one song.
