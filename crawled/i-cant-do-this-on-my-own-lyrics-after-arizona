Sometimes I wish I could go back to the start 
To a time where clouds were white and skies were a not so gloomy blue 
I'd wake up knowing where I am and where I'm gonna be 
Won't somebody come and show me Who I am today 
'Cause right now I'm so afraid 
And I'm stuck inside these prison walls that just won't go away 
Who I am today 
Is different from last week 
And I'm slowly realizing that this life is hard to keep 
On my own Sometimes I wish that I could take back what I've done 
Maybe someday I'll grow up and I'll learn to hold my tongue 
I'm looking for a guarantee there's something more than I can see 
Won't somebody come and show me Who I am today 
'Cause right now I'm so afraid 
And I'm stuck inside these prison walls that just won't go away 
Who I am today 
Is different from last week 
And I'm slowly realizing that this life is hard to keep 
On my own Can anybody hear me 
Feels like I'm screaming 
Oh won't you hear me now 
And if you can hear me 
Why won't you tell me 
Why is the sun not shining down Show me who I am today 
'Cause right now I'm so afraid 
And I'm stuck inside these prison walls that just won't go away 
Who I am today 
Is different from last week 
And I'm slowly realizing that this life is hard to keep (Show me, show me, show me) Who I am today 
'Cause right now I'm so afraid 
And I'm stuck inside these prison walls that just won't go away 
Who I am today 
Is different from last week 
And I'm slowly realizing that this life is hard to keep 
On my own
