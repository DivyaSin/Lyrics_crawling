My make up friend 
I pretend to care about her 
Well she sucks me in again 
I can't bend or break 
I can't make mistakes My made up friend's got it all worked out 
This ain't customary 
She'll build a wall until you destroy it all again I'm not following you around 
I'm not the one who hit the ground 
Sing a song about everything you do 
I'm a lot, a lot better I make up friends 
I pretend to give a shit 
Ah well, she's perfectly thin 
And wins again with the hottest thing going My tongue is short and I'm here to stay 
I can't say the same thing for her 
And yeah, I know I can't make a change 
But I'll try anyway I'm not following you around 
I'm not the one who hit the ground 
Sing a song about everything you do 
I'm a lot, a lot better, hey! You have nothing better to do with your life now 
Your life now. Hey! 
You have nothing better to say for yourself, yourself, yourself Just stay close to your enemies 
(It's gonna bite you) I'm not following you around 
I'm not the one who hit the ground 
Sing a song about everything you do 
I'm a lot, a lot better You have nothing better to do with your life now 
Your life now. Hey! 
You have nothing better to say for yourself, yourself, yourself
