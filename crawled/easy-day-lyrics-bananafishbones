Put my black plastic security suit on my gasmask 
Leave the cellar and go to work 
Afraid to be poisoned or trampelled 
By this huge machinery And I think to myself 
What fuck above 
Do I have to thank 
That I'm here to live In this shit I don't 
Want to complain about 
The acid rain 'cause it's 
Nice compared to this Poison Air 
And I wish I could just 
Once see the moon 
One gorgeous show So I take it off 
Yeah that's feeling good 
Though I'm deeply sick 
Right away It's like dancing in the sun 
Having trouble having fun 
Having anything you wish to come 
Then it finally smiles your way And you have an easy day 
It's time to have an easy day 
What the hell 
This must be an antique supermarket What am I doing here 
God, these people drinking milk 
But the clothes they wear 
Look rather cool to me And I wear the same 
What am I doing here? 
Excuse me, Sir, can you help me out? 
I want to bake a cake but I don't know how No, I don't but I'm sure I will 
So what do we need 
For your bakery? 
It's like dancing in the sun Having trouble having fun 
Having anything you wish to come 
Then it finally smiles your way 
And you have an easy day It's time to have an easy day
