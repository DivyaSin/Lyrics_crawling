I won't take all these lies 
Won't you ever realise 
The truth I'm after is very clear 
Will you leave me after all these years 
I won't be afraid no more 
I want you to get out of that door 
I'll pick myself up off the floor 
I've been gone for so long 
Never know what goes on 
Searching for just what to do 
So much better without you 
I won't be afraid no more 
I want you to get out of that door 
I'll pick myself up off the floor 
I won't be afraid no more 
I want you to get out of that door 
I won't be afraid no more 
Keep on watching I'm in heaven
