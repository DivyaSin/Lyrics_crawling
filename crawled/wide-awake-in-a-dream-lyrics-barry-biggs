Oh, we're gonna make this a big one I'm checking out my native city, 
I can feel the blood in my veins 
And my nerves are weak and my heart is just about to collapse, 
I'm kind of desperate, something must happen 
I'll leave for a chance right now, 
And I'll leave a for rock 'n' roll ride 
So come on, don't stop, I want you, it's too fast now 
I want you, I'm feelin' just fine, 
I want you, to kill this pressure 
It's getting much too high, You asked me how long I've played electric guitar 
And you asked for my autograph, 
And you asked if I mix up my whiskey with water 
I tell you be sure, 
I'm kind of desperate, something must happen 
I'll leave for a chance right now, 
And I'll leave a for rock 'n' roll ride 
So come on, don't stop
