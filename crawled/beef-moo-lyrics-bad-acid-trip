The powers that be - Claim theres no reason to fear 
Keep on making babies - Fuck the ones here 
Too many people for such a small place. 
Over-population by the human race 
Used the resources on the planets face. 
But wait till we get into outer space 
The masses just mull around and exist day to day 
Subverted conceptions keep the cattle at bay 
Researchers have long stated their case 
Were becoming a blemish on this planets face 
Like flowers wilting in a fragile vase 
Were a dying species in this pretty place 
The masses just mull around and exist day to day

Researchers have long stated their case 
Were becoming a blemish on this planets face 
Like flowers wilting in a fragile vase

Fat rats breed us toward our own annihilation 
Hiding ideas thatd be our salvation 
Too many people in such a small place. 
Over-population by this human race 
They beat you down, say 'Learn your place 
As part of a statistic called the human race 
Fat rats breed us toward our own annihilation 
Hiding ideas thatd be our salvation 
Too many people in such a small place. 
Over-population by this human race 
They beat you down, say 'Learn your place. 
As part of a statistic call the human race 
Beat you down learn your place. 
Part of a statistic called human waste 
Have you ever considered the possibility 
The reason the powers that continue to be 
Try and facilitate over-population 
Back- stock human slaves as extinction marches on 
Have you ever considered the possibility 
The reason the powers that continue to be 
Try and force over-population. 
Youre what we like to call 
Beef-moo (4x) 
Youre the beef-moo
