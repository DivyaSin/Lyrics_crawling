Shelter, oh I've been branded 
I've been washed up and left for dead 
I've been cast out from this world I'm in exile 
I'm stranded on the streets 
Ain't got no place left to run No one wants me anymore, anymore, anymore 
Now they hunt me down c'mon and take me to the shelter SHELTER give me what I want tonight shelter 
SHELTER take me undercover tonight 
SHELTER I've been tortured 
I've been raging in the breach 
In this wicked world Persecution 
I've been carrying my cross 
I've been down there on my knees No one wants me anymore, anymore, anymore 
Now they hunt me down Come on and take me to the shelter SHELTER give me what I want tonight shelter 
SHELTER running undercover tonight shelter 
SHELTER Come on and take me to the shelter SHELTER give me what I want tonight 
(Give me your love) Shelter 
SHELTER Sleeping on the streets tonight 
(Give me your love) Shelter 
SHELTER give me what I want tonight 
(Give me your love) Shelter 
SHELTER give me what I want tonight
