"This next song's about Ireland 
It's called Across The Broder" Across the Irish border 
And hidden in a car 
There's guns and ammunition 
That were smuggled to Armagh Well that's not right - and they should stop the fight 
And they should sort it out 
And they let them march and let them shout Kill it shoot it down 
(And if you) Bum it to the ground 
Kill it light the fuse 
What's the point and what's the use Now Mr. Ian Paisleys marching 
From Ireland to 'L.A.' 
He's checking out your sympathy 
And guns for U.D.A. Well that's not right - and they should stop the fight 
And they should sort it out 
And they let them march and let them shout Kill it shoot it down 
(I'm gonna) Bum it to the ground 
Kill it light the fuse 
What's the point & what's the use "Guitar" Now all the letter bombs are posted 
And the booby traps are laid 
And the British soldiers marching 
They're marching to their graves Well that's not right - and they should stop the fight 
And they should sort it out - 
And they let them march 
And let them shout. Kill it shoot it down 
(Gonna) Bum it to the ground 
Kill it light the fuse 
What's the point & what's the use Kill it shoot it down 
Bum it to the ground 
Kill it light the fuse 
There ain't no point because there ain't no use
