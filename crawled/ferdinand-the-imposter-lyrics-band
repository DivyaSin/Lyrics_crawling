Ferdinand standing in the tower thinkin' how to get the power 
Empress knows that it would cost her 
For Ferdinand The Imposter 
Came to me to make a deal, 
Dressed like General Butterfield. 
Couldn't wait to thank him for the stuffed birds and rubber door 
Donated to him from the poor 
But its just his game 
And he carries no shame 
Still, he done nobody wrong 
He knew he didn't belong 
But he went along 
Looking to see if there's somebody else he'd like to be 
Benny the Barber, Luke and me, 
Passed out tickets cautiously, 
To see the burning of the soup, 
Down at Lucy's chicken coop. 
Then of course Ferdinand, 
Started out doing Charlie Chan. 
That last atlas honkey's fall, 
He says he's gonna do them all. 
A voice just said he's not for real, 
But its just his game, 
And he carries no shame. 
Still he done nobody wrong, 
He knew he didn't belong, 
But he went along. 
Lookin' to see if there's somebody, 
Else he'd like to be. 
Oh its hard, oh, don't you know 
To be somebody that you don't even know 
But he's friendly, yes he's kind 
I can't help wonderin' why they'd want to change his mind 
Got a message in the mail, 
Ferdinand was thrown in jail. 
I left the snow with Abigail, 
Went on down to fix his bail. 
They had him locked in a gunny sack, 
His hands were tied behind his back. 
He claimed he was a Doukhobor (*) 
But they never heard of that in Baltimore. 
The police said he'd better go home, 
And he went back alone, 
Back to the snow. 
Still he done nobody wrong, 
He knew he didn't belong, 
But he went along. 
Lookin' to see if there's somebody, 
Else he'd like to be, 
Mainly free.
