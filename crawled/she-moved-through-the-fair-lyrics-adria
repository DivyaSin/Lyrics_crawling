My young love said to me 
My mother won't mind 
And my father won't slight you 
For your lack of kind 
And she laid her hand on me 
And this she did say 
"Oh, it will not be long now 
'Til our wedding day" 
And she went away from me 
And she moved through the fair 
And fondly I watched her 
Move here and move there 
And then she went onward 
Just one star awake 
Like a swan in the evening 
Moves over the lake 
Last night she came to me 
My dead love came in 
So softly she came 
Her feet made no din 
And she laid her hand on me 
And this she did say 
"Oh, it will not be long now 
'Til our wedding day"
