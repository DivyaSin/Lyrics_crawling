There are things I could've told you 
There's a time and a place 
Well, my words would allow me 
To say what I won't change Don't let me know as it's happening, oh 
Don't let me know what you said, oh, oh There were birds all around me 
There were bats pressed to my face 
And in time, you will forget me 
And I'll try and do the same Don't let me know as it's happening, oh 
Don't let me know what you said, oh, oh, oh, oh It's been years since I saw you 
But each day, I see your face 
And in time, you will remind me 
That I wish we were the same Don't let me know as it's happening, oh 
Don't let me know what you said, oh, oh, oh, oh
