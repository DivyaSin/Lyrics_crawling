CHRISTINE: Love's a curious thing 
It often comes disguised 
Look at love the wrong way 
It goes un-recognized So look with your heart 
And not with your eyes 
A heart understands 
A heart never lies Believe what it feels 
And trust what it shows 
Look with your heart 
The heart always knows Love is not always beautiful 
Not at the start So open your arms 
And close your eyes tight 
Look with your heart 
And when it finds love 
Your heart will be right Learn from someone who knows 
Make sure you don't forget 
Love you misunderstand 
Is love that you'll regret GUSTAVE: Mother Look with your heart 
And not with your eyes 
The heart can't be fooled 
Christine: The heart is too wise GUSTAVE: Forget what you think 
CHRISTINE: Ignore what you hear 
BOTH: Look with your heart 
It always sees clear GUSTAVE: Love is not always beautiful 
Not at the start CHRISTINE: But open your arms 
And close your eyes tight 
Look with your heart 
And when it finds love 
Your heart will be right
