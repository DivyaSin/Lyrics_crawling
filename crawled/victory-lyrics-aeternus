once again - we have prevailed for our belief under the sun - we have fought hurling our swords into our foes as it spurts - and covers the grass drinking their blood with the colour red once again - our tribe dominates and the dark deep valleys the green steppes - the grey mountains there can be only one tribe the strongest survive we will defend our domicile hail there's a feast tonight forever where we will celebrate our victory - as we have done so many times before they have always led us hail - to our gods - they are with us we know to our - victory
