The moments of happiness We had the experience but missed the meaning 
And approach to the meaning restores the experience 
In a different form beyond any meaning 
We can assign to happiness The past experience revived in the meaning 
Is not the experience of one life only 
But of many generations 
Not forgetting something that is probably quite ineffable Moonlight turn your face to the moonlight 
Let your memory lead you open up, enter in 
If you find there the meaning of what happiness is 
Then a new life will begin
