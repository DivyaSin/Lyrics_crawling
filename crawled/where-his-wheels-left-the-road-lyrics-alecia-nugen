Where his wheels left the road, broken glass and twisted steel 
Were the only traces left of that worn out Oldsmobile 
Oh, the mist hung on that mountain like a winter overcoat 
And the Deputies found him where his wheels left the road He had left the Diamond Horeshoe, drank that whiskey river dry 
That's the tale the Sheriff told to his sister and his wife 
They could claim their Dear Beloved at the White Oak Funeral Home 
And the Deputy could show them where the wheels left the road Now they're bring food and flowers to the kitchen of his home 
They placed a little cross where his wheels left the road But the truth will soon be buried, there's a secret no one knows 
He was not out on that highway when his wheels left the road 
It was back in that old bar room in the smoke and neon lights 
He was dancing with a woman just before he crossed the line In a room next to the Horseshoe, wedding ring down in his coat 
He took her in his arms and his wheels left the road Where his wheels left the road, broken glass and twisted steel 
Were the only traces left of his worn out Oldsmobile 
Oh, the mist hangs on that mountain like a winter overcoat 
And the Deputies found him where his wheels left the road
