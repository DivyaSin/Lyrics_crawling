V1. 
Sweet as our slumber 
Sharp like an ax 
Can you remember 
How good; what we had You can't tell me you don't mean to 
And I can't act like this is right 
The game we play has gotten oh so see through 
But at the end of the day, what's one more night? Ch. 
So I watch my back 
Whenever you are not at my front 
Brace for attack 
Cuz I never really know what you want 
But when the lights go down 
It's a torture that I cannot resist 
I should turn around 
But I suppose I could stay if you insist. V2. 
Comes faster than falling 
And it leaves like a ghost 
So lovely; so haunting 
My poisonous host You can't tell me you don't love it 
And I'd be lying if I said I mind 
I could pretend that I am above it 
But at the end of the day, what's one more time? BR. 
I can play your fool 
It's such a small price to pay 
Let me break your rules 
I promise you won't complain
