"Tender feelings heal with flowers 
When your woes and sorrows leave you 
Overwhelmed 
For the state of endless sadness or 
Uncompleted mourning 
Take star of Bethlehem, 
There's willow if bitter, when helpless 
Wild rose, 
Some sunshine wattle revives all lost hopes" 
But for a simple case of longing 
What are we to do when homeless in our 
Hearts and souls Some of us take daring chances following our 
Lovers 
The passion we can trust 
Others just cannot sit still 
They're driven by the power of mighty 
Wanderlust 
Wherever we go, god, we're trying so hard 
To make every place feel like home left behind 
But despite of all endeavours--nothing 
Changed, 
As ever--we're homeless in our hearts But I'm yearning no more 
'Cause I found my home in you 
And now it's where I belong 
I gave up the world to be with you Come to me, I'll soothe your yearning Is this what you've always dreamed of 
The aim of our desire is hard to recognize 
It often stares you in the face and yet, against 
All reason, 
Takes the longest time to find 
You circle the globe, go native, go far 
But it's not a country or a town, not a house 
What's the use of distant travel if only to 
Discover you're homeless in your heart But I'm yearning no more 
'Cause I found my home in you 
And now it's where I belong 
I gave up the world to be with you So come to me, let me soothe your yearning.
