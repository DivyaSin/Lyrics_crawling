I believe in 
I deceive in 
Bottom weaving 
I can breathe in 
Make a wish in 
Flower fishing 
Moving vibration 
Mild relation 
I'm jamaican on your radio station 
Got a curse in 
Could be worse in 
You first 
In a hearse in 
Good as dead in 
Nothing left in 
Nothing left in 
Some be heading 
I need a head rest in 
And a feed from a warm breast And man making hits 
From my childbearing hips 
Underground like 
Who's it sound like 
You all sound the same 
But you don't know my name I believe in people lying 
I believe in people dying 
I believe in people trying 
I believe in people crying Ah I believe in people balking 
I believe in people talking Ah I believe in people breathing 
I believe in people being We all sound the same 
You don't know my name 
Rearrange and 
Things don't change 
Things remain 
Feel the strain 
Stress 
Catch my breath 
(There'll be a new tale of) 
Get some rest 
(He and I) 
From the mess 
(In fact any time) 
I couldn't care less 
(Every day) 
Sugar cane 
(Write fictional stories) 
Is like smack to my vein 
Shook fame 
(If you want to) 
But I don't complain 
(On the street) I believe in different reasons 
I believe in breath through seasons 
I believe when snow flakes fall 
I believe in buildings tall Ah I believe in people bombing 
I believe in people warring 
I believe diseases coming 
I believe that's why I'm running Ah Keep living Ah Keep living (Alanis Morissette in the background) 
You gotta ask 
(There'll be a new tale of) 
Before he attacks 
(He and I) 
You got the flats 
(In fact any time) 
Dub my sacks 
(Every day) 
You've got the city 
(Writing fictional stories) 
Move out of the country 
I'm scrunching 
(If you want to) 
Friends that are punchy 
(On the street) I believe in people falling 
I believe in people warring 
I believe diseases coming 
I believe that's why I'm running Ah Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in people balking 
I believe in people talking Ah I believe in people breathing 
I believe in people being Ah Keep living
