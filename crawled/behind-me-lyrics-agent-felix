and if I stare too long at the sky tonight 
will it open up to breath life 
back into my lungs they're collapsing into me 
the time is right is never true 
you can't hold out on time it holds out on you 
even when you know your moment is now so turn your backs 
away 
away from what your too afraid to try 
don't hold me back 
when I decide its my turn to fly 
its all for not 
but all could be for everything 
I'll make sure that the door will close behind me 
the distant rise 
is suddenly not looking all that seem to far 
I'm all stretched out 
out from always reaching for the stars 
just one wish 
and I will be there too 
reaching down for someone just like you what could have should have happened 
its so unfair for you 
for me it I know its different 
I won't give up this soon 
at least not this time sitting staring at the rain 
now the play is dead 
pull out the chains 
and measure out 
just how far that you've come
