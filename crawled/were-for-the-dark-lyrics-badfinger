Tell me the day and I'll set you free, what you wanna be 
Show me the way and I'll let you see what you do to me 
Well, it's not enough to live 
If you're gonna take, then you have to give 
We're for the dark, mm-baby, you and I Show me the clouds and I'll give you sky if you want me to 
Show me the crowds and I'll make you sigh if you take me through 
Well, it's not enough to be 
If you're gonna look, then you have to see 
We're for the dark, mm-baby, you and I 
A-baby, you and I-hi 
A-baby, you and I-hi-hi 
A-baby, you and I-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha Show me the way and I'll set you free, what you oughta be 
Tell me the day and I'll let you see what you do to me 
Well, it's not enough to live 
If you're gonna take, then you have to give 
We're for the dark, mm-baby, you and I Show me the clouds and I'll give you sky if you want me to 
Show me the crowds and I'll make you cry if you take me through 
Well, it's not enough to be 
If you gotta look, then you have to see 
We're for the dark, mm-baby, you and I-hi 
Baby, you and I-hi
