Your lips are saying goodbye you tell me not to cry 
But you can't stop my heart from breaking 
I'll play the rules of the game I'll learn to hide the pain 
But you can't stop my heart from breaking 
You can tell your new love I'll smile and let you go 
But what it cost me you both will never know 
I'll say I'm happy for you but if you think it's true 
What a sad mistake you're making no you can't stop my heart from breaking 
I'll say I'm happy for you
