Say you've seen too many things 
That turned out to be too good to be true 
Against your better judgment opened up your heart 
Till you found the joke was on you Looking out on the rest of our lives 
If we're gonna be together or apart 
About the only way that I know how to come 
Is right straight from my heart I want you now, I'll show you how 
I can be the man you need me to be 
I've been around, but now I've found 
That you're the only one for me You say you'll never fall again 
You won't subject yourself to such pain 
But if you give me half a chance I'll win 
I'll never leave you standing out in the rain But if you think that I can look you in the face 
And lie right through my teeth 
Then turn around and walk away 
But cross my heart girl I care for you 
When I look into your eyes and I say I want you now, I'll show you how 
I can be the man you need me to be 
I've been around, but now I've found 
That you're the only one for me I need you so, I can't let go 
Gonna be all that I can be 
I want you still, I always will 
'Cause you're the only one for me I want you now, I'll show you how 
I can be the man you need me to be 
I've been around, but now I've found 
That you're the only one for me I need you so, I can't let go 
I'm gonna be all that I can be 
I want you still, I always will 
'Cause you're the only one for me
