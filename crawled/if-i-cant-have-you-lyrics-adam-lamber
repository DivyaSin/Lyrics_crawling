Don't know why I'm surviving every lonely day 
When there's got to be no chance for me 
My life would end and it doesn't matter how I cry 
My tears of love are a waste of time If I turn away am I strong enough to see it through? 
Go crazy is what I do If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you 
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby Can't let go and it doesn't matter how I try 
I gave it all so easily to you my love 
To dreams that never will come true 
My tears of love are a waste of time If I turn away am I strong enough to see it through? 
Go crazy is what I'll do If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, if I can't have you If I can't have you I don't want nobody 
If I can't have you, if I can't have you 
Am I strong enough to see it through? 
If I can't have you
