I'd like to walk with you to heaven 
I know it's not so very far 
And when we finally get to heaven, I'll know that 
Maybe time, can make things turn out better 
Maybe love, can fix it after all 
Rain that falls, will lead to sunny weather 
So don't forget when we're apart I'd like to fly with you to heaven 
Flyin' way up high 
When we finally get to heaven, you know that 
Maybe time, can make things turn out better 
Maybe love, can fix it after all 
Rain that falls, will lead to sunny weather 
So don't forget when we're apart Ooh heaven 
You're not so very far 
And when we finally get to heaven 
I know that 
La la, la la, la la 
La la, la la, la la, oh, oh baby 
La la, la la, la la 
Don't forget when we're apart Repeat until end: 
I'd like to thank you for the love you've given me 
I'd like to thank you for the happiness you bring 
I'd like to thank you for the joy you've given me
