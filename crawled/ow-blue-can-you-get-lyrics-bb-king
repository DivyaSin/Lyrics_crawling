I've been downhearted baby 
Ever since the day we met 
I said I've been downhearted baby 
Ever since the day we met 
Our love is nothing but the blues, woman 
Baby, how blue can you get? You're evil when I'm with you 
And you are jealous when we're apart 
Yes, I said you're evil 
You're so evil when I'm with you, baby 
And you are jealous when we're apart 
How blue can you get, baby? 
The answer's is right here in my heart I gave you a brand-new Ford 
You said I want a Cadillac 
I bought you a ten dollar dinner 
You said thanks for the snack 
I let you live in my penthouse 
You said it was just a shack 
I gave you seven children 
And now you want to give them back 
Yes, I've been downhearted baby 
Ever since the day we met 
I said our love is nothing but the blues 
Baby, how blue can you get?
