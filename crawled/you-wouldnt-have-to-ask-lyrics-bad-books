Crooked days come bundled up in bunches 
They break your brain like a branch 
And push you out here asking after for something 
you should know I don't have If I had it you wouldn't have to ask 
If I had it you wouldn't have to ask Later on when you bargain with your mirror 
and you ask is it really that bad If it wasn't you wouldn't have to ask 
If it wasn't you wouldn't have to ask How could you know if you didn't? 
What's left to say when your tongue's turned to ash? 
Well I tell you you're finally forgiven 
So you wouldn't have to ask Shoot what's left, slip inside your sinner smile 
Another man in a mask If you faced it you wouldn't need a mask 
If you meant it you wouldn't need a mask 
If I could fix you you wouldn't have to ask 
If I could help you you wouldn't have to ask
