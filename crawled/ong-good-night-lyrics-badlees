A letter of acceptance, from an old forgotten friend 
A little piece of history, you thought you'd never see again 
Like the broken Plymouth and the boat with the hole 
It was a sticky situation and you knew you had to roll 
Well, you knew you had to roll A finger under your conscience, pullin' at your skin 
You broke your standing record, when you let her in 
Like the girl from the past and your secret tryst 
You wouldn't wanna let it go, with the flick of the wrist 
Well, the flick of the wrist But it's broken, final 
Leather, vinyl, die dee die Long good night 
Well, you made it through a long good night 
You were looking for a long good night 
All you wanted was a long good night Terrible trauma, and a consummate kiss 
With a leap frog lover, in a timely twist 
Passionate punch line and a prayerful past 
With a lust for lifetimes, you wonder if you would last 
Wonder if you would last Broken, final 
Leather, vinyl, die dee die Long good night 
Well, you made it through a long good night 
All you wanted was a long good night 
You were looking for a long good night All you wanted was a long good night 
Well, you made it through a long good night 
All you wanted was a long good night 
You were looking for a long good night Die die die Broken, final 
Leather, vinyl, die dee die Long good night 
Well, you made it through a long good night 
You were looking for a long good night 
All you wanted was a long good night You were waiting for a long good night 
Well, you made it through a long good night 
You were looking for a long good night 
All you wanted was a long good night
