You and I 
Together we reach for the sky 
It's not about winning 
It's all about playing the game 
From the east 
From the west 
Each of us trying our best 
Chasing a dream 
Burning too follow the flame Bang the drum a little louder 
So the whole world can hear 
The whole world can hear 
Sing the song a little longer 
So the whole world can hear 
The whole world can hear From near 
From far 
It's clear wherever you are 
This is your moment 
your time to run like the wind 
Dream big (dream big) 
aim high (aim high) 
Even believe you can fly 
Give it your all 
Let the games begin Bang the drum a little loud 
So the whole world can hear 
The whole world can hear 
Jump up a little higher 
So the whole world can see 
The whole world can see 
Sing the song a little louder 
So the whole world can hear 
The whole world can hear 
Bang the drum a little louder 
For the whole to hear 
The whole world to hear Bang your drum a little louder 
So the whole world can hear 
The whole world can hear 
Sing the song a little longer 
So the whole world can hear 
The whole world can hear 
Bang your drum a little louder 
So the whole world can hear 
The whole world can hear 
Sing your song a little longer 
So the whole world can hear 
The whole world can hear (Bang the Drum!)
