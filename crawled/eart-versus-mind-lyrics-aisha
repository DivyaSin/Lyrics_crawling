Verse 1: I was in love 
I could feel it 
And my heart tried to reveal it 
But my mind said no 
I told you so 
When you asked me out 
I had my doubts 
Uncertainty 
You were right for me 
Were we meant to be 
Were you right for me Chorus: The heart versus mind 
It happens all the time 
The battle of two wills 
Call it what you will 
My heart said go 
But mind said no Verse 2: With looks so lush 
You made me blush 
With eyes so dreamy 
You should have seen me 
My heart said go 
But my mind said no Repeat chorus Verse 3: I can say with certainty 
That you're not right for me 
But still I love you so 
But I have to say no 
And wait 
Hold on to my faith 
That God will give me a love 
Sent from above Repeat chorus
