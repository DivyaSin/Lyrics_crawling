When you're weary 
When you're down and out 
Lay your hands on me When you're weary 
When you're down and out 
Lay your hands on me I count my blessings 
I think of all I have 
She never thought about it 
Then threw It all away Left It all to chance 
She tore down fences 
Now It seems so wasted 
Wish she could turn back time Now she's down on her knees to pray 
Begging please, make it good 
Make It good somehow 
She will do what It takes to change 
Someone please, make it good 
Make It good somehow 
Someone please When you're weary 
When you're down and out 
Lay your hands on me She had a vision 
Time to make a stand 
For all she used to be 
To turn her life around To take back yesterday is 
Never easy 
When you're on your own 
It seems impossible, so Now she's down on her knees to pray 
Begging please, make it good 
Make It good somehow 
She will do what It takes to change 
Someone please, make it good 
Make It good somehow 
Someone please Welcome to your revolution 
What you dream Is what you see 
There's no rules, no regulations 
Let the music set you free Now she's down on her knees to pray 
Begging please, make It good 
Make It good somehow 
She will do what It takes to change 
Someone please, make It good 
Make It good somehow 
Someone please When you're weary 
When you're down and out 
Lay your hands on me When you're weary 
When you're down and out 
Lay your hands on me
