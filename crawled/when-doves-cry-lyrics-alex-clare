Dig if U will the picture 
Of U and I engaged in a kiss 
The sweat of your body covers me 
Can U my darling 
Can U picture this? Dream if U can a courtyard 
An ocean of violets in bloom 
Animals strike curious poses 
They feel the heat 
The heat between me and U How can U just leave me standing 
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold) 
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding 
Maybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold 
Maybe U're just like my mother 
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied) 
Why do we scream at each other? 
This is what it sounds like when doves cry Touch if U will my stomach 
Feel how it trembles inside 
U've got the butterflies all tied up 
Don't make me chase U 
Even doves have pride How could U just leave me standing 
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold) 
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding 
Maybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold 
Maybe U're just like my mother 
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied) 
Why do we scream at each other? 
This is what it sounds like when doves cry How can U just leave me standing 
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold) 
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father) 
Maybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold (U know, U know he's 2 bold) 
Maybe U're just like my mother (Maybe U're just like my mother) 
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied) 
Why do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream? Why?) 
This is what it sounds like when doves cry 
When doves cry (When doves cry) (When doves cry) {x2} 
Don't cry (Don't cry) Oh yeah {x6} 
When doves cry {x3} 
Babe! {x6} When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry) 
When? When? 
Don't cry 
Darling, don't cry 
Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry
