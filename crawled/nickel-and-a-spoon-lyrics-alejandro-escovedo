When I turn twenty-one I'm gonna make a change 
Turn my back on what I was 
And make you proud of what I'm not If it's my life why tear it down 
And make me feel this way 
I do my best with what I've got 
Why do you tear it down? Mama's not talkin' now 
Dad, he's fallen off the track 
Sister's on a rampage 
And brother, he's planning his silent attack My family's up and moved away 
They couldn't stand the heat 
Why build a house just to burn it down 
Another love-torn mystery
