She's got a way about her 
I don't know what it is, but I know that I can't live without her 
She's got a way of pleasin' 
I don't know why it is, but there doesn't have to be a reason anyway She's got a smile that heals me 
I don't know why it is, but I have to laugh when she reveals me 
And she's got a way of talkin' 
Don't know why it is, but it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere She comes to me when I'm feelin' down, inspires me without a sound 
She touches me and I get turned around She's got a way of showin' 
How I make her feel and I find the strength to keep on goin' 
And she's got a light around her 
And everywhere she goes, million dreams of love surround her everywhere She comes to me when I'm feelin' down, inspires me without a sound 
She touches me, I get turned around She's got a smile that heals me 
I don't know why it is, but I have to laugh when she reveals me 
And she's got a way about her 
I don't know what it is, but I know that I can't live without her anyway
