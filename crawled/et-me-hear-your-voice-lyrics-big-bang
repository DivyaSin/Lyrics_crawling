Suddenly the rain has stopped, it's like a sign of pity 
The scent of you still lingers, I miss you waking up with me 
And I wonder right now wherever you are 
The sky has cleared to wipe all your pain away Dawn's approaching turning the midnight into early morning 
Wonder if you still have trouble waking up this early 
Even till now these are the little details 
I want to let you know, want you to hear me say Although life's the same, and everyday 
I smile and live on as if I haven't changed 
But inside all the feelings I've drowned 
Without you fill me with pain, baby So let me hear your voice 
Don't tell me that you don't have a choice 
I know you still miss being here in my arms 
It's easy to tell by your tone, your poise Girl, let me hear your voice 
Don't tell me that there's no way we can be 
We shared the most beautiful memories 
But if you must move on, just promise me, you'll live on happily When we first met, it was two weeks into early autumn 
Now it's been a year, are you still thinking "Should I call him?" 
You lit up the streets lights, they glowed in the dark nights 
You laughed without a care in the world You'd cuddle up to me and lean your head on my shoulder 
I would be your haven when your world felt like a boulder 
I remember the tears, I remember the warmth 
You cried without a care in the world And although life's still the same for everyone 
They smile and live on, try to laugh and have fun 
But inside they're trying to keep alive their broken hearts 
So they're holding on So let me hear your voice 
Don't tell me that you don't have a choice 
I know you still miss being here in my arms 
It's easy to tell by your tone, your poise Girl, let me hear your voice 
Don't tell me that there's no way we can be 
We shared the most beautiful memories 
But if you must move on, just promise me, you'll live on happily Yeah, since you went away it hasn't been the same 
In my heart all I've got is pain 
Could it be that I play the game to loose you, I can't maintain 
Sunlight moonlight you lit my life 
Realize in the night while love shines bright 
Can't let you go we were meant for forever baby let me know Days passed without you, can't forget you 
Let me be the cloud hanging above me 
Raining on me, missing your touch 
Nights get longer and it's hard to clutch 
We're apart, breaks my heart 
It's all for the best girl, you're my world 
In time my love unfurls till then wait for you girl So let me hear your voice 
Don't tell me that you don't have a choice 
I know you still miss being here in my arms 
It's easy to tell by your tone, your poise Girl, let me hear your voice 
Don't tell me that there's no way we can be 
We shared the most beautiful memories 
But if you must move on, just promise me, you'll live on happily
