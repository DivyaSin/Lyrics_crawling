So you wanna borrow heavy, you train in vain 
You're like a last song lost yeah 
So you wanna be like your mates, So you disintegrate 
DESTROYREBUILDDESTROYREBUILDDESTROY 
You get the first sip of the last full glass of 
Nothing I'd say 
And boy tribal death Isn't glamourous 
Dead end mosaic, I'd say 
So you wanna borrow heavy, you train in vain 
You're like a last song lost yeah 
So you wanna be like your mates 
So you disintegrate 
DESTROYREBUILDDESTROYREBUILDDESTROY 
You get the first sip of the last full glass of 
Nothing I'd say 
And bad dreams, With Shakespeare craft 
Hero worship, Never lasts
