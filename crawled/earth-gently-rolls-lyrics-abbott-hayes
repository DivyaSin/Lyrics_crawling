The body of water that swallowed me whole 
The wave that came rolling and swept me from shore 
The feeling of floating forevermore 
I pick my brain apart until it's sore 
I keep myself in tune with love and war 
I try to choose between truth and lore To try and strike a chord that rings 
And it rakes my mind and stirs up all these things 
And the dust flies into the air like it has wings 
I awake to find that I'm feeling as clean as spring The lengthening shadow that's tied to my soles 
The grey on the ground that grows and grows 
The feeling of peace while the earth gently rolls 
Most thoughts in my brain i've never told 
I can't help my frozen heart from being cold 
The weather is getting warm but I'm feeling old To try and see the truth that you claim you found 
Well I want a piece and I'll dig deep into the ground 
And I'll stay inspired as I get further and further down 
and I won't grow tired if this planet keeps spinning 'round
