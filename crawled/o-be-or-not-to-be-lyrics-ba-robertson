Now I'm a little shy 
I like to stay homeo 
Shakespear's my guy 
Julie and Romeo 
Now I have found a girl so dear 
She cares not if Will he war queer 
Who cares not if Hammy made it with his Ma? 
To be or not to be my lover 
To me there could not be another 
To be or not to be's my plea 
It's as you like it you know 
To me there could not be another 
In hardback or in paper cover 
To be or not to be's my plea 
Some like the sun 
They'd be a Barbadian 
We think it's fun 
Here in Stratford-on-Avion 
Kids go to a disco show 
We stay and praise Malvolio 
Who cares if Will 
He dressed his guys as chicks? 
To be or not to be my lover 
... 
We are a couplet heaven knows 
Undo my doublet baby 
And I'll undo your hose 
To be or not to be my lover 
It's as you like it you know.
