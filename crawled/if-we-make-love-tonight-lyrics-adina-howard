Cat Daddy Ro: 
Let's make it happen 
Let's make it happen, baby 
Let's make it happen 
Let's make it happen, baby [Chorus] 
If we make love tonight 
Will it change us for the rest of our lives 
(let's make it happen) 
(let's make it happen, baby) 
If we make love tonight 
For the very first time 
(let's make it happen) 
(let's make it happen, baby) Here we are alone again 
But we never kicked it like this before 
(We never kicked it like this before) 
Ooh, the touchin', the kissin' and the huggin', baby 
(it's all good) 
I must confess I want to explore 
We've been homies for so long 
(yeah) 
I just can't calculate the time 
But if we make love tonight 
Will it change the way we are 
(nah, everything is all good. It's cool) 
The question remains my mind 
I want to know [Chorus] I call you on the phone each day 
(yeah, and I call yo' shit up too) 
I must admit you're my best friend 
(Yeah, it's 'cause we got it like that) 
But I can't ignore my attraction to you 
(it's all mutual, you know what's up) 
Are you the man for me 
Tell me what's in store 
(A good time, you know) 
You know my darkest secrets 
(right, right) 
And I know a few things about you too 
(uh huh yeah) 
We're puttin' our friendship on the line 
(Nah nah nah, it ain't anything like that) 
But I want to get next to you 
(c'mon) 
All I want to know [Chorus] You know, we've been homies awhile 
Kicken' it and everything and 
I think it's time for us to take this relationship to another level 
So, uh, what I want to know is 
(sang) 
Do you want to make love to me 
Baby 
All night long 
'Cause I want to make love to you 
Tell me if it's wrong 
Do you want to make love to me 
Baby 
All night long 
'Cause I want to make love to you 
All night long 
Do you want to make love to me 
Baby 
All night long 
'Cause I want to make love to you 
Tell me if it's wrong [Chorus]
