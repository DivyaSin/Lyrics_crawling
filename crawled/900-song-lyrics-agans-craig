You dial one nine hundred lookin' for a fix 
You dial one nine hundred and get off on your kicks 
When you're all alone, and you're stranded at home 
And you're sitting by the phone, after you've been wrecked by a cyclone 
Dial one nine hundred.. when you're gettin' down to the bone.. 
You dial one nine hundred it shouldn't be for real 
You dial one nine hundred it could be your last meal 
They can bring you a million bucks, they can bring a change to your bad 
luck 
But if you find that you're really stuck, and you see them comin', you'd 
better duck 
You dial one nine hundred.. your life must really suck.. 
You dial one nine hundred to hear a prayer from the lord 
You dial one nine hundred you sometimes must get bored 
But they say it's true, that you just dial, they'll do it for you 
They can make all of your dreams come true, it'll hit you out of the 
blue 
You dial one nine hundred.. they'll make a liar out of you.. 
You dial one nine hundred, you're lookin' for a cure 
You dial one nine hundred, it's quarter after four 
But it's the only help that you can see, it's comin' at you from your tv 
You're lookin' down out of nights lonely tree, and you know, you would 
agree 
You dial one nine hundred.. your life sometimes must get lonely..
