My darling queen, 
I lay myself at your feet and I shall stay the hands of fate Wind cries out, 
Heavens boil above voicing discontent to my sins 
I have found the way to trick the ferrymen I have deceived the ancient Gods Cold flesh lends to me its secrets 
Each day brings me closer to you 
For a price too high 
My tragic victory 
I shudder at what I have done Darling queen I lay at your feet 
Chills take me as she wakes, 
Throat gasps tainted breath I've reclaimed you my stolen bride 
Can your soul forgive my crimes of passion? I would not close the casket; 
I'm so consumed by your pain faint screams echo through the night... Cold flesh lends to me its secrets 
Each day brings me closer to you 
For a price too high 
My tragic victory 
I shudder at what I have done The pains of death can no longer haunt you as the dawning sky 
Brings forth one forsaken thought death can not win for 
I dwell in the palace of decay and I shall stay the hands of fate Night descends, sinews twitch 
My pale queen finally stands to taste silent lips now cursed with her love Cold flesh lends to me its secrets 
Each day brings me closer to you 
For a price too high 
My tragic victory 
I shudder at what I have done
