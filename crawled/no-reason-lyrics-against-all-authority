It was never easy growing up with you 
Your words & actions left me confused 
The way you think about things makes the mad 
You tried to teach me your version of bad 
I never saw the reasons for your hate 
I don't think you had one any way 
Now I'm older, opinionated and I'm strong 
So shut your mouth and listen to this song 
Your way of thinking is fucking wrong 
And I know I can't change you with this song 
But maybe I can make you stop to think 
We're all connected, you're just the weakest link 
Conditioned to hate without a reason 
I don't understand what you believe in 
No color, no race, no religion, no creed 
No reason to hate, why can't you see?
