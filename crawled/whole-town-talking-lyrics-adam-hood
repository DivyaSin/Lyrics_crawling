Lately I've been down in the deep end, 
Doing way too much drinkin, 
Everyone thinks I've lost my mind. I guess they don't know how tough, 
losin the woman you love, 
can make it on every day of your life. (Chorus) 
It's a little bit hard to take when, 
the heart you left here breakin, 
has got the whole town talking bout me I went out last Monday evening, 
I heard she flew in to Macon, 
I guess she didn't even try to call. That's when I really broke down, 
they finally had to run me out, 
I was getting sad tearing out the walls. Chorus And maybe she'll come back someday, 
before they put me away, 
and that might be the saving grace I need. chorus
