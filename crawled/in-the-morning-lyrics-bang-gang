When you come 
In the morning time 
what's on our mind 
what's on our mind ? On your mind 
In the morning Well you think I have things on you and won't see 
I just can't let you get away with anything 
Why do you cry and scream and shout at me 
We try to leave everything 'till the morning time We go through 
Me and you 
Things we ought to understand 
About each other When you come 
In the morning time 
What's on our mind? On your mind 
In the morning Trying not to lose our heads 
In the craze of yesterday 
No matter if it's you or me 
We're gonna have to face this day
