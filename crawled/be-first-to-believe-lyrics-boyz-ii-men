The very first time that I saw your brown eyes 
Your lips said 'Hello'(Hello) 
And I said 'Hi' 
I knew right then you were the one 
But I was caught up (caught up) in physical attraction 
But to my satisfaction 
Baby you were more than just a phase *Chorus* 
And if I ever (ever fall) 
In love (again) again 
I will be sure that the lady is a friend 
And if I ever (ever fall) 
In love (so true) so true 
I will be sure that the lady's just like you Oooohhhh, Yeaahh yeah 
Ihe very next time she'll be my friend If I say that I could be your one and only 
(Promise, promise, promise) Promise that you'll never leave me 
lonely 
I just wanna be the one you need 
Oh baby 
I just wanna be the one to serve you 
Sometimes I feel as if I don't deserve you 
I cherish every moment that we share *Chorus* 
And if I ever (ever fall) 
In love (again) again 
I will be sure that the lady is a friend 
And if I ever (ever fall) 
In love (so true) so true 
I will be sure that the lady's just like you [My friend] 
(Very next time she will be my friend, someone I can believe in) 
I need someone who who will be my friend 
[My friend] 
(Very next time she will be my friend, someone I can believe in) 
To be with me through thick and thin 
[My friend] 
(Very next time she will be my friend, someone I can believe in) 
Please share my love with me my friend 
[My friend] 
(Very next time she will be my friend) 
I need someone like you *Chorus* 
And if I ever (ever fall) 
In love (again) again 
I will be sure that the lady is a friend 
And if I ever (ever fall) 
In love (so true) so true 
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
