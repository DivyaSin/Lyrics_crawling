Ba ba do dab a dab a do, oh oh... One false move away from you 
I couldnt leave now if I wanted to 
Im too far gone to turn from you 
What are we gonna do? I was not the type to fall from grace 
But I lost my footing when I saw your face 
And Id break every rule I make 
Will this be my last mistake? Its only love, that Im seeking 
Its only love, that Im seeking I played out this scene a hundred times 
But now I look at your mouth and I forget my lines 
You draw me in just like a cigarette 
One morning dawn with a head full of regret My life is made up with the things I said I wouldnt do 
Now here I am standing in front of you 
It seems theres only trouble and desire 
Im standing on a wire, Im sitting in a fire Its only love that Im seeking 
Its only love that Im seeking 
Its only love, its only love I cant yell any louder 
I cant breathe any deeper 
I cant hold on a little longer 
I cant sing any stronger 
I cant turn it on 
I cant turn it off 
I cant keep this type from rising 
I cant contain this yearning 
I cant stop this fire One false move away from you 
I couldnt leave now if I wanted to 
Im too far gone to turn from you 
What are we gonna do? Its only love, that Im seeking 
Its only love that Im seeking 
Its only love, its only love 
Its only love that Im seeking 
(ba ba da ba do ba da...) 
Its only love that Im seeking 
Its only love that Im seeking 
Its only love, its only love 
Its only love, its only love
