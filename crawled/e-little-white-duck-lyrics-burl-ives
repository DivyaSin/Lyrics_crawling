There's a little white duck, sitting in the water 
A little white duck, doing what he oughter 
He took a bite of a lily pad 
Flapped his wings and he said, "I'm glad 
I'm a little white duck sitting in the water 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack" There's a little green frog swimming in the water 
A little green frog, doing what he oughter 
He jumped right off of the lily pad 
That the little duck bit and he said, "I'm glad 
I'm a little green frog swimming in the water 
Glump glug, glump glug, glump glug glug" There's a little black bug floating on the water 
A little black bug doing what he oughter 
He tickled the frog on the lily pad 
That the little duck bit and he said, "I'm glad 
I'm a little black bug floating on the water 
Chirp bzz, chirp bzz, chirp bzz bzz" There's a little red snake playing in the water 
A little red snake doing what he oughter 
He frightened the duck and the frog so bad 
He ate the little bug and he said, "I'm glad 
I'm a little red snake laying in the water 
Wriggle hiss, wriggle hiss, wriggle hiss hiss"
