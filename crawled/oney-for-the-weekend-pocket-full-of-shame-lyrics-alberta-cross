I get mine trading hearts for a living 
I make jeans for the last supper change now 
You'll get your shot to sell what your givin 
I'm going to fall in the pit that you made now 
You get down when the war comes to livin 
I get down when my heart starts forgivin Yeah there's no money for the weekend 
I gotta pocket full of shame 
There's no money for the weekend 
And there's no heaven for the saints I get my job to give up forgiven 
The kid gives fighting takes some of his sin 
It gets some Johnny out of the giving now 
We both know that we're here for the sparrow 
Money for the high 
Pay me on the floor 
Hard to stay with it 
Don't you know you want more There's no money for the weekend 
I've gotta pocket full of shame 
There's no money for the weekend 
And there's no heaven for the saints 
No there's no honey for the weekend 
I've got my levy for my change 
There's no money for the weekend 
I've got a pocket full of shame Yeah 
I'm waiting for my sanity 
You've gotta leave before the time flies 
There's no limit to the vanity 
I watch it all with some cold eyes There's no money for the weekend 
I've got a pocket full of shame 
There's no money for the weekend 
And there's no heaven for the saints 
No there's no honey for the weekend 
I've got my levy for my change 
And there's no money for the weekend 
I've got a pocket full of shame
