On-on, on the floor, baby Hey boy, what you're up for now? 
I know why you're here and how 
Let's get down, down to the ground 
Fight with the beat but baby cut that sound Hey boy, what are you looking for? 
So long with your drooling jaw 
Give it to me, can't you see? 
We're kissing in the name of destiny We're gonna dance until you're ready to fly (On the floor, baby) 
My good vibration's gonna get you so high (Ah-ah) I can see what you're thinking babe 
I can see what's behind those eyes 
The way you touch, the way you look 
You are the devil baby, I'm the curse Come and get it, come and get it, come and get it 
I know that you want it 
Come and get it, come and get it, come and get it 
You know that I got it 'Cause I know what you're looking for 
You will never have to search no more

What's the color of your unknown fear? 
The world is yours, it's up to you 
It's getting real late baby, come on here I can see you wanna grab that chance 
Getting closer every time we dance 
We never close down, the sun comes up 
Before we get started baby, you can't stop We're gonna dance until you're ready to fly (On the floor, baby)
