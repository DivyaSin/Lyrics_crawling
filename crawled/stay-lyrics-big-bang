Can you feel me now 
Take a deep breath and let me explain 
All the pain that's been wreckin my brain 
Gettin so close to goin' insane 
And see you standing there 
And the feelin' never gonna be the same 
seems like we missed the whole damn train 
Blame is all we have for us And I can let in get in the way 
Even if the love is the costly price to pay 
Lookin' back life love was the game or cliche 
Gotta move away sacrifice my heart and let you breath again baby girl Ososugita nani-mo kamo 
Kanojo ga tokidoki damatta no mo 
Samishii SIGN 
Now that I'm alone Soba ni ite kureru koto 
Atarimae ni omoisugite hontou
