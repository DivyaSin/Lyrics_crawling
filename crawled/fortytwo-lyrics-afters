I came into this world to find a reason to live 
I came with nothing to give 
Nothing I could offer, nothing I could ever do Before You set the stars up in the sky 
You came and took me aside 
You told me I was part of the plan 
You told me I was Yours Will You tell me what this life is all about? 
Will You show me how to make my time here count? 
Will You lead the way onto the other side 
'Cause I want to feel alive, 'cause I want to feel alive? If I could only see right to the end 
I'd know just where to begin 
I could put together all the little pieces 
You carry the world, You hold it in your hands It's all a part of your plan 
Show me how to love 
Wont You help me find my way to You? Will You tell me what this life is all about? 
Will You show me how to make my time here count? 
Will You lead the way onto the other side 
'Cause I want to feel alive, 'cause I want to feel alive? There's a place for us 
The perfect place for us 
There's a place for us 
The perfect place Will You tell me what this life is all about? 
Will You show me how to make my time here count? 
Will You lead the way onto the other side 
'Cause I want to feel alive, 'cause I want to feel alive? 
Yeah, yeah
