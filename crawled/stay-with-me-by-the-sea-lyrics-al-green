[Chorus] 
La, la, la, 
La, la, la 
La, la, la 
Stay with me 
La, la, la 
La, la, la 
La, la, la 
Stay with me Stay with me, my dear 
Walk with me, oh be near 
It's not as late as it seems, no no 
So why'd you take your love away from me [Chorus] In the morning light, orange shades of white 
Your the only one to try, 
So what's the meaning of saying goodbye [Chorus] Hold my hand, my dear 
Treat me like your my ever loving woman 
Am I the only one you see 
So why'd you take your love away from me [Chorus:Repeat x2]
