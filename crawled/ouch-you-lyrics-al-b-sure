Say lady remember that night in the garden 
(Let me love your body down) 
I didn't touch you then 
But I want to touch you now Touch you, oh baby let me touch you 
Tonight touch you, touch you right now 
Tonight touch you yeah 
Tonight touch you touch you right now Can my love for you stand the test of time 
We'll see if it's just pleasures of the mind 
(Pleasures of the mind) Is it physical, I'm so young 
So naive girl, these are new waters 
And I hope they're not too deep for me If I taste your love I hope you'll understand 
(Hope you'll understand) 
That my consciousness of life is more than just a man In my secret place of love we can make so much love 
And no one is the wiser but our hearts believe 
That when I touch You're more than just a flower and you'll grow into a tree 
It's more than making love it's sweet harmony 
And the way that I touch you, run my tongue down your spine 
Ooh you'll never want another lover, you'll always be mine And you'll treasure when I touch you, won't you 
Break it down (oh) 
Can you feel it? 'Cause I can yeah 
Let us climb together so slow, so slow Won't you hold me, let me squeeze you 
Don't you tease me (touch you) let me touch you baby 
All night long (baby let me touch you) 
Tonight touch you, touch you right now! Won't you (tonight) hold me, let me squeeze you 
Don't you tease me (touch you) let me touch you baby 
All night long (baby let me touch you) 
Tonight touch you, touch you right now
