Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music 
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams 
Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes 
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stones 
Until my pun to dime and name etched in stone 
My daughter's growing up, my son on his way 
They closing in on me, I feel like every day 
Music saves me, soothing like the navy 
But a lifetime of scars only sixteen bars 
So I took the vibe with me using my life 
Yep, I propose the main music my wife 
If ever need to call a nigga music's my night 
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dice 
If I degraded and I haven't even cried to 
I watch purpose prophesize about going through 
Music ain't the knowledge itself 
And I'm the knowledge itself, then I acknowledge your wealth Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music 
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music Music a part of me, I'm a bully 
Beating up the track with brutal lines 
The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me 
I'm using the inspiration that they provide to me 
I'm redefining the space, you can call me the new geometry 
A picture of you, papa, when I google monogamy 
Now all the people who go irresponsibly 
Thinking your album is trash is not the root of economy 
So you're expecting the conscious and introspect of use 
Each of lyrical vestibule, let me tell you what's best for you 
My music gives you a message true or respect is due 
But music is emotion, that's lost for me intellectual 
A tree in form of a far is never heard 
Amongst the sparrows and the robbers and even the ghetto birds 
You download it for free but what I create the same 
Of course you're nothing but a pair in making, trust me Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music 
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over 
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music I was born on the afterbeat, I'm like ron for Johnson 
When you reach the crossroads me and the devil have to meet 
It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it 
Lauryn went, looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin' 
Willing to the same songs but we hear them different 
Serenade the death like we got a fear of living 
Having the sounds on stage cause the spirit rising 
Stop the devilish ways where clever displays the lyricism 
The songs are a natural resource of actual street stories 
Attract the police forces 
Slay to the rhythm the masses that rip off us And he could run before he walked
