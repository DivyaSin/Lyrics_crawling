Beautiful One 
Your hair shines in the sun 
I wish I'd never left The wind intwines our hair 
Our words get swept through the air 
I wish I never left Your face shines in my eyes 
Our last look before our goodbye 
I wish I never left Beuatiful One 
You shine like the sun 
I wish I never left 
Before I have said 
You are the one 
You are the one
