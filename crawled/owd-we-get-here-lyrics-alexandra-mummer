Verse 1: 
Tell me how we got here 
This room is filled with silence 
Not a single word is coming out 
We forgot what we were fighting about Chorus: 
My voice over yours makes a louder noise 
We yell and we scream 
I can not believe that we got here 
How'd we get here 
That's what I feared 
My voice over yours makes a louder noise Verse 2: 
We go through this mysery 
It's more pointless than worth it to me 
We keep pushing eachother away 
I don't think we'll be okay Hook: 
I can't let this go on 
Every move we make just feels wrong 
I know it can be better than this Chorus: 
My voice over yours makes a louder noise 
We yell and we scream 
I can not believe that we got here 
How'd we get here 
That's what I feared 
My voice over yours makes a louder noise Hook 2: 
I'm gone and I'm not coming home 
Don't call, I won't pick up the phone 
I can't take this anymore Chorus 2x: 
My voice over yours makes a louder noise 
We yell and we scream 
I can not believe that we got here 
How'd we get here 
That's what I feared My voice over yours makes a louder noise 
We yell and we scream 
I can not believe that we got here 
How'd we get here 
That's what I feared Ending: 
Ohh,ohh, yeah 
How'd we get here
