[Verse 1] Through all of my days 
And in my given time 
Through all of my days 
And in my given time I'd dream and dance 
With any fair girl 
That'd give me the chance 
Through all of my days 
I'd sing my song 
To the wild and beyond [Chorus] [Verse 2] Through all of my days 
And in my given time 
Through all of my days 
And in my given time I'd pray for peace 
Knowing that it starts with me 
Through all of my days 
I'd sing my song 
To the wild and beyond [Chorus]
