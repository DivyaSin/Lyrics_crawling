"Charge admission and rope me off" 
She said, "I do believe I see income here" 
Eight hundred and seventy pounds 
From a thyroid condition, and one room bound, but Beyond these walls 
She screwing off with friends at work, and 
Beyond these walls 
She tells the guy she dates 
He's a pompous jerk again She longs for normalcy 
So she's worked some kinks into her reverie 
Friends'll bug you and lovers fail 
All that's human fills 
An intricate daydream sail, but Beyond these walls 
The mundane hints of rhapsody, and 
Beyond these walls 
Are faces and acquaintances 
And reasons for a routine A rich imagination 
And self-depreciation 
She plays for laughs and 
Eases the trials of isolation Where she reclines alone 
Her breathing labored, she begins to roam 
Another wonderful active climb 
In a beautifully crafted paradigm Beyond these walls 
A laugh with friends and awkward dates, and 
Beyond these walls 
She's overworked and running late, and 
Beyond these walls 
A wealth of situations 
Makes for time away in daydream 
Time away in daydream
