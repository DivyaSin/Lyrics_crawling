Death don't walk in the front door 
He sneak in the back like a thief in the night 
Death don't fight like a brave man 
He put a knife in your back as you stand in the dark 
Lord how I wish 
That you could hear this song 
Death don't care if you like him 
Death won't buy you a drink 
Death don't hear me knocking 
He don't care for a fool like me 
Lord how I wish 
That you could hear this song You gave me your warmth, didn't you? 
As if I knew what I should do 
My face in your hair, then suddenly 
My feet on the cold ground 
Squeezing the puzzle together Death don't walk in the front door 
He sneak in the back like a thief in the night 
Death don't fight like a brave man 
He put a knife in your back as you stand in the dark 
Lord how I wish 
You could criticize this song You gave me your warmth, didn't you? 
As if I knew what I should do 
My face in your hair, then suddenly 
My feet on the cold ground 
Squeezing the puzzle together
