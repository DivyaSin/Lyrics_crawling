They're talking in the neighborhood 
About a sexy hips. OW! 
She looks a bit like Hollywood 
Wait till you hear her lips. 
He's from the other side of town 
But in the hungry streets 
They say he's just a run around 
And he's an "easy-to-beat" 
She gives an eye, he feels attraction 
A little smile, there's no reaction 
Hot girls, bad boys (bad boys) 
Sticking on each other, like glue 
Hot girls, bad boys (bad boys) 
Hugging on each other, they do 
And when it's night, the lights are low 
They are looking for a place to go 
Hot girls, bad boys (bad boys) 
Sticking on each other 
Nobody taught them etiquette 
So what, they're feeling strong 
And what they think they don't regret 
They're always having fun 
She gives an eye, he feels attraction 
A little smile, there's no reaction 
Hot girls, bad boys (bad boys)
