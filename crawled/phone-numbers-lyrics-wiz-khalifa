I cop me one, cop me one for my old girl 
You think she my newest bitch, she my old girl 
Khalifa, a younger nigga who handle his 
Hoes get in my car, ask what the channel is 
Boss shit, look that up my nigga, I handle biz 
On fire, like a candle is 
Niggas be dressing off the mannequin 
Hmm, and I get fresh like where them camera's is? 
Better yet sandwiches, bad bitch Spanish friends 
Could of been the President, rather be the man instead [Chorus] 
Now when I get paid, my checks be looking like phone numbers 
Now when I get paid, my checks be looking like phone numbers 
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million) 
I'm talking millions, nigga I'm talking millions 
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million) 
I'm talking millions, nigga I'm talking millions Time is money so I went and bought a Rolex (Bought a Rolex) 
Time is money so I went and bought a Rolex (Bought a Rolex) 
I'm talking millions, nigga I'm talking millions 
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million) 
I'm talking millions, nigga I'm talking millions 
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million, what?) I'm in the hood off this something that's corner surfing 
Float, no water, my trunk is waving, I'm polar surfing 
Blowing faces, I'm shitting on them diamond infested 
Time is money, peep the wrist bitch, my time is invested 
I'm still the king and I'm thugged out 
Any block, any club, I flood it out 
I ain't the one for competition, I'ma blow it out 
I'm going hard, I don't ever plan on going out 
I'm getting money, probably something you don't know about 
I stunt hard, you would swear that I was showing out 
Don't tell me get them, I got them and I'ma throw them out 
And back door on these hoes that I was warning out 
While I'm in this machine, convert the top 
Tell them that the sky is the limit 
With a four of freaks, she got her face in my lap 
So deep you would think she was hiding in it [Chorus] Shrimp, steak, liquor, and pasta 
Real shit boy, these niggas imposters 
They deserve a Oscar, Kevin Costner 
Oh my God sir, what? 
I got this and that and everything I want like I got a hostage, yeah 
Counting seven digits, no wonder why the money calling 
Got your bitch panties Niagara falling 
Dollars come like I fuck in the bank 
I told them I could, they tell me I can't 
They want me to trip when I'm ducking the paint 
I'm popping champagne, and puffing on dank 
Shining hard, boy, these niggas got to see me 
My dick hard, your bitch is easy [Chorus]
