Na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, yeah 
You are the music in me You know the words 'Once upon a time' 
Make you listen, there's a reason 
When you dream there's a chance you'll find 
A little laughter or happy ever after You're harmony to the melody 
That's echoing inside my head 
A single voice above the noise 
And like a common thread you're pulling me When I hear my favorite song 
I know that we belong 
Oh, you are the music in me Yeah, it's living in all of us 
And it's brought us here because 
Because you are the music in me Na, na, na, na, ohh 
Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na 
You are the music in me It's like I knew you before we met 
Can't explain it, there's no name for it 
I say words I've never said 
And it was easy because you see the real me As I am you understand 
And that's more than I've ever known 
To hear your voice above the noise 
And no, I'm not alone, oh, you're singing to me When I hear my favorite song 
I know that we belong, yeah, oh 
You are the music in me It's living in all of us 
And it's brought us here because 
You are the music in me Together we're gonna sing, yeah 
We got the power to sing what we feel 
Connected and real 
Can't keep it all inside, ohh Na, na, na, na
