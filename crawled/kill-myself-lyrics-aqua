Heart on fire, burning love 
These so wild and crazy times 
Love won't tear us apart 
Why I risk it all tonight 
If I could only control how I feel 
Pick myself through the thoughts I conceal 
Please don't misunderstand when I say 
I will kill myself if I had to to to 
'Cause I wanna waste my life on you 
I'm feeling more like dead when you're not close to me 
All the lonely nights we've been apart 
I've been dying from the broken heart 
I'm feeling more like dead when you're not close to me 
Stone cold days, darkest night 
Empty thoughts, fill me up 
I will try to stay alive 
One more day without you here 
If I could only survive without you 
There's nothing in this world that I couldn't do 
Please don't misunderstand me when I say 
I will kill myself if I had to to to 
'Cause I wanna waste my life on you 
I'm feeling more like dead when you're not close to me 
All the lonely nights we've been apart 
I've been dying from the broken heart 
I'm feeling more like dead when you're not close to me 
I would kill myself 
For you I would kill myself 
I would kill myself 
For you I would kill myself 
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh 
I would kill myself for you 
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh 
I would kill myself for you 
I will kill myself if I had to to to 
'Cause I wanna waste my life on you 
I'm feeling more like dead when you're not close to me 
All the lonely nights we've been apart 
I've been dying from the broken heart 
I'm feeling more like dead when you're not close to me 
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh 
I would kill myself for you
