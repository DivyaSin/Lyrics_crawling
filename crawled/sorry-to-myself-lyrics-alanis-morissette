For hearing all my doubts so selectively 
For continuing my numbing relentlessly 
For helping you and myself, not even considering 
For beating myself up and over functioning To whom do I owe the biggest apology? 
No ones been crueler than I've been to me For letting you decide if I indeed was desirable 
For myself love being so embarrassingly conditional 
For denying myself to somehow make us compatible 
For trying to fit a rectangle into a hall To whom do I owe the biggest apology? 
No ones been crueler than I've been to me I'm sorry to myself 
My apologies begin here before everybody else 
I'm sorry to myself 
For treating me worse than I would anybody else For blaming myself for your unhappiness 
And for my impatience when I was perfect where I was 
Ignoring all the signs that I was not ready 
And expecting myself to be where you wanted me to be To whom do I owe the first apology? 
No ones been crueler than I've been to me And Im sorry to myself 
My apologies begin here before everybody else 
Im sorry to myself 
For treating me worse than I would anybody else Well, I wonder which crime is the biggest 
Forgetting you or forgetting myself 
Had I heeded the wisdom of the latter 
I would've naturally loved the former For ignoring you, my highest voices 
For smiling when my strife was all too obvious 
For being so disassociated from my body 
And not letting go when it would've been the kindest thing To whom do I owe the biggest apology? 
No ones been crueler than I've been to me And Im sorry to myself 
My apologies begin here before everybody else 
Im sorry to myself 
For treating me worse than I would anybody else Im sorry to myself 
My apologies begin here before everybody else 
Im sorry to myself 
For treating me worse than I would anybody else
