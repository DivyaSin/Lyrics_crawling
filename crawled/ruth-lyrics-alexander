Truth 
The truth is that I never shook my shadow 
Every day it's trying to trick me into doing battle 
Calling out "faker" only get me rattled 
Want to pull me back behind the fence with the cattle 
Building your lenses 
Digging your trenches 
Put me on the front line 
Leave me with a dumb mind 
With no defenses 
But your defenses 
If you can't stand to feel the pain then you are senseless Since this 
I've grown up some 
Different kind of fighter 
And when the darkness come let it inside you 
Your darkness is shining 
My darkness is shining 
Have faith in myself 
Truth I've seen a million numbered doors on the horizon 
Now which is the future you choose before you gone dying? 
I'll tell you 'bout a secret I've been undermining 
Every little lie in this world come from dividing 
Say you're my lover, say you're my homie, 
Tilt my chin back slit my throat take a bath in my blood get to know me 
All out of my secrets 
All my enemies are turning into my teachers. 
Because, lights blinding, no way dividing what's yours or mine when everything's shining 
You darkness is shining my darkness is shining 
Have faith in ourselves 
Truth Yes I'm only loving, only trying to only love 
That's what I'm trying to do is only loving 
Yes I'm only lonely loving feeling only loving 
Till I'm feeling only loving 
Ya say it ain't loving ain't loving my loving 
But I'm only loving only loving only loving 
Only loving the truth.
