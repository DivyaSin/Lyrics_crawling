Hey baby I'm sorry 
I never meant to hurt you 
Please don't go 
Slowly my eyes began to see 
That I need you near right with me at all times, yeah 
My feelings are so deep for you 
That I won't let go, oooh no, of you I can't let this love (Slip away) 
And I can't turn it around (you will see) 
And only then Please don't go away from me 
(I'll be there for you) 
When you call my name (call my name) 
I'll reach out my hand to you 
(And I'll welcome you) 
To my heart (my future my heart) 
Please don't go away from me 
We can work it out 
Whatever it may be girl 
Please don't go(no,no,no,no,no,please don't go) You know, It's not often that we see each other, 
That's why I cherish every moment that we spent each other. When you're away, Temptation may come 
Above of when I get caught up (by you), 
Above of when I get caught up (by you), 
Above of when I get caught up (by you), 
I let go 
Thinking about you each day 
I feel (I love you and I'll never let go) Your love makes my head spin 
round and round in a daze, yeah oh baby I can't let this love (Slip away) 
And I can't turn it around (you will see) 
And only then Please don't go away from me 
(I'll be there for you) 
When you call my name (call my name) 
I'll reach out my hand to you 
(And I'll welcome you) 
To my heart (my future my heart) 
Please don't go away from me 
We can work it out 
Whatever it may be girl 
Please don't go(no,no,no,no,no,please don't go) Please don't go away
