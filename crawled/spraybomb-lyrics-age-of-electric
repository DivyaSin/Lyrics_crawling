Opium of the people 
TV now the modern chapel 
Gave it up for a walkabout 
Skyline compared to pyramids 
Lame backdrop for a junkyard 
Compacting cars with a grand machine 
Spraybomb, ya junkie 
Spraybomb, it's lovely 
Spraybomb, your creed after creed after creed 
Spraybomb, it's lovely 
Spraybomb, graffiti 
Spraybomb, eclipse over lips 
Yes, lovegun 
Licence age is bitter wisdom 
Lifespan you swing near dead 
Exploited in maturities apron 
My cologne doesn't kill my breath 
Fashion mask don't kill my emptiness 
Raise my voice to teenage media 
Sellout, sellout, sellout, sellout, sellout 
Spraybomb, ya junkie 
Spraybomb, it's lovely 
Spraybomb, your creed after creed after creed 
Spraybomb, it's lovely 
Spraybomb, graffiti 
Spraybomb, eclipse over lips 
I wish I'd never heard them speak 
Love or lie 
Kings live in the wrecking yard 
Happily raping cars for parts 
Raise a shrine to another mans grave 
Stars burn brighter in the graveyard 
Stars burn brighter in the graveyard 
Spraybomb, ya junky 
Spraybomb, it's lovely 
Spraybomb, your creed after creed after creed 
Spraybomb, ya junky 
Spraybomb, it's lovely 
Spraybomb, your creed after creed after creed 
Spraybomb, graffiti 
Spraybomb, it's lovely 
Spraybomb, eclipse over lips 
I wish I'd never heard them speak 
Love or lie
