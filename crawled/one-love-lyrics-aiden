When I wake, I see you 
Lying there on the bathroom floor 
With foam lips, a black kiss 
Your dead hero and now myth 
The way you look so nice 
We'll save the un-dead princess 
I'm anxiously awaiting your arrival now [Chorus] 
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid 
Beyond you and me 
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid 
Beyond you and me 
One love, in your eyes now, look afraid A demon, your ghost eyes 
Watching me run through our lives 
A soft look, in silence 
Misery come and find us 
Well don't try to stop me 
I'm headed straight to hell down 
I want you, I need you now [Chorus] Your last night, you were here 
Your words were so meaning full 
With great prize we suffer 
I thought your roots were so fake [Chorus] Beyond you and me 
One love, in your eyes 
Beyond you and me 
One love, in your eyes 
Beyond you and me 
One love
