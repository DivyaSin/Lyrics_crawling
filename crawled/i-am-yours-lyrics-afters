I am Yours 
I am Yours 
I am Yours 
I am Yours I can walk across the world 
And never find the answer 
I could search the sky above 
And never get any closer 
You made it all 
And I will have to fall 
At the feet of the One 
Who fell for me You gave your life for mine 
To have me by your side 
I won't look back anymore 
Now that I, I am yours 
You'll never say goodbye 
You are the reason why 
I won't look back anymore 
Now that I, I am yours I am Yours 
I am Yours 
I am Yours 
I am Yours All the rest can disappear 
Without any traces 
I have nothing left to fear 
As long as Your face is 
All I can see 
You are all I need 
Every breath, every step 
You're here with me You gave your life for mine 
To have me by your side 
I won't look back anymore 
Now that I, I am yours 
You'll never say goodbye 
You are the reason why 
I won't look back anymore 
Now that I, I am yours I am Yours 
I am Yours 
I am Yours 
I am Yours I belong to you 
You and you alone 
I belong to you 
You and you alone 
I belong to you 
You and you alone I am Yours 
I am Yours 
I am Yours 
You're here with me You gave your life for mine 
To have me by your side 
I won't look back anymore 
Now that I, I am yours 
You'll never say goodbye 
You are the reason why 
I won't look back anymore 
Now that I, I am yours I am Yours 
I am Yours 
I am Yours 
I am Yours I can walk across the world 
I can search the sky above 
You made it all 
And I am Yours
