In This World I Walk Alone 
With No Place To Call My Home 
But There?s One Who Holds My Hand 
On The Rugged Road Through Barren Lands The Way Is Dark, The Road Is Steep 
But He?s Become My Eyes To See 
Strength To Climb, My Grief To Bear 
The Savior Lives Inside Me There In Your Love I Find Release 
A Haven From My Unbelief 
Take My Life And Let Me Be 
A Living Prayer, My God To Thee Through These Trials Of Life I Find 
Another Voice Inside My Mind 
It Comforts Me And Bids Me Live 
Inside The Love The Father Gives In Your Love I Find Release 
A Haven From My Unbelief 
Take My Life And Let Me Be 
A Living Prayer, My God To Thee Take My Life And Let Me Be 
A Living Prayer, My God To Thee
