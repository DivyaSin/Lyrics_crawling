I'm living in the flat lands 
where i see it all 
the weather's still the same 
since i've grown tall Everywhere i've been 
all over the world 
the weather's still the same 
like at home I'm living in the land of freedom 
where liberty roams 
ain't no change in the seasons 
ain't no drying lawns Global warming's a nasty rumor 
i ain't got no sense 
for that kind of humor Them communists 
try to steal my freedom 
by predicting changing seasons And everywhere i've been 
i've seen shakles on men 
must be by a lack of armoury 
that's why my weather's fine
