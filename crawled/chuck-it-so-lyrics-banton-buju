You Mr. Big Man 
Yes you same one 
Always studying something new 
Ever disturbing people, you and your crew 
Always up to something bad How you a go on like bully so 
On the border like you not going 
I want to know what got into you 
Why you walking and chuck it so Word go round say the man them from up so say 
Then a go corn you 
Don't bother form no fool 
And go back down there 
Can't say I never warned you 
You must jam one away 
And ever lay lay 
That way them can't harm you 
You must move well alert 
And expect any foul play 
Those men know where you work 
Where you sleep 
Where you play 
Dis the wrong set a man you got to run away 
Force ripe bad boy 
Who was wicked yesterday How you a go on like bully so 
On the border like you not going 
I want to know what got into you 
Why you walking and chuck it so You was in Grade 5 
I was in Grade 9 
Humble'er than you little boy you couldn't find 
Now you murdering people what's got into your mind 
Kill so much people 
Every day the number climb 
Now your friends are after you 
Your life is on the line 
Start playing the role name John hard to find 
This is Buju be 
You better start rewind How you a go on like bully so 
On the border like you not going 
I want to know what got into you 
Why you walking and chuck it so Don't have any responsibility 
Not responsible 
Not a baby mother to go home to 
Laing, Ford and Amin every body want you 
Five bad man hunting you 
Now it double 
Public nuisance 
It's either kill the law 
Or they murder you 
Take it easy hear it from Buju 
Straight from my heart 
It's coming to you 
Then I'm asking How you a go on like bully so 
On the border like you not going 
I want to know what got into you 
Why you walking and chuck it so
