I would die before I divorce you 
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love 
'Cause you kiss a lucky horseshoe 
Stuck it in my boxing glove 
'Cause anyone who will see us 
Through our victory and done defeat 
Knows that I'll take you to the cleaners 
If you come between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh 
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh My husband is the finest handsome hustler 
And he still make this housewife blush 
So I'm holding my hand in his 
I'm sitting on the royal flush 
Women drink him in, swimming in his green eyes 
Then go home and catch the chips you got 
And take a bad beat to ooh to boat oh! 
The jack of hearts is my jackpot Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh 
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Catch me on, have to ? 
And I know as my heart beats 
There's a winning secret to both 
And it's sworn between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh 
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh 
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
