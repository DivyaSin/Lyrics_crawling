The abundance of pores in this shell 
Manifest as I draw experience 
Only time will tell, if I've manufactured a spiritual cell 
Filling each space with what I see Experience molds my destiny 
Life is the rezoning for the cause 
My existence bids to nature's laws 
My body a shell of human cells that contain me Myself a kaleidoscope of thoughts that won't set me free 
With each breath that I take I slowly fill the space which will be me 
This feeling, it causes me to, while away the years and suck experience 
Till my shell is filled and I die Woven flesh tomb, encases my soul 
Changes in seven year cycles 
Still wandering, does my shell have a cause? 
The end, a measure of my worth
