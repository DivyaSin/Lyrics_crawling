Loving you is not a choice 
It's who I am 
Loving you is not a choice 
Not much reason to rejoice 
But it gives me purpose 
Gives me voice 
To say to the world 
This is why I live 
You are what I live 
This is why I live Loving you is why I do the things I do 
Loving you is not in my control 
But loving you I have a goal 
For what's left of my life 
I will live 
And I will die 
For you It gives me purpose 
Gives me voice 
To say to the world 
This is why I live 
Yes, this is why I live 
Loving you is why I do the things I do 
Loving you is not in my control 
But loving you 
I have a goal 
For what's left of my life 
I will live 
And I will die 
For you I will live 
And I will die 
For you
