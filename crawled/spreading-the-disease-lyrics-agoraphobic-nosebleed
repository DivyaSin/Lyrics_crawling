Roll down the window, 
I need a breath of fresh shit. 
Assume the worst, 
And be amazed to disgust. 
There is really no preparing yourself, 
No day is without incident anymore. 
Action is bad acting. 
Everything's a fuckin' hassle. 
Tomorrow you'll care less. 
How can this nonsense be a tragedy? 
What's to feel? 
Fuck you 
For even making me have to think today
