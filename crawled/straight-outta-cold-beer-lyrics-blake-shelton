Just a bunch of poor boys, daddy's girls 
children of the corn field 
tryin turn a shift job into a dollar bill 
We wear the muddy boots 
Stay true to how we're raised 
A'int nothin bout us fake You know we're straight out of that dirty south dirty roads 
nobody got no money 
got them signed up pickup trucks 
whistlin at them honies 
from the country (yes sir) 
you know we're straight out of that long week workin 
now everybody wanna party 
all night long bonfire on the back 40 
in the middle of nowhere 
ain't nobody leaving here 
till we're straight out of cold beer 
straight out of cold beer just a bunch of john deer junkies getting funky to some old hank 
nothin been stuck in the mud that we came 
we'll cut the rusty chain in the sun or in the rain 
yeah thats the kinda thing You know we're straight out of that dirty south dirty roads 
nobody got no money 
got them signed up pickup trucks 
whistlin at them honies 
from the country (yes sir) 
you know we're straight out of that long week workin 
now everybody wanna party 
all night long bonfire on the back 40 
in the middle of nowhere 
ain't nobody leaving here 
till we're straight out of cold beer
