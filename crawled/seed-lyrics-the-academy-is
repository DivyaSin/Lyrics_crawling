Subjects are thrown around the room 
Looking for the ones that got away 
A feeling of soft anticipation 
Another confrontation I won't make 
But how do we do it 
We turned into something else entirely 
We fake it 
But I wanted it so desperately to be real Run, run, holding on to some pieces that you left behind 
Hold now, as I walk away, you're the one that finds me out 
Run from the only thing left that I hold close I'll be letting you in 
You've got the feeling you've been followed under your skin 
It will be weighing on your shoulder, believe it. 
If I could express it in a different dialect or in a delicate way 
I'd capture the phrases inside the cage beneath my chest 
And keep it locked for days 
I wanted you so desperately to believe me Run, run, why are you running from another conversation? 
Someone that I've been planning on, you're the one that finds me out. 
There's nowhere, now I found you, that I won't go. I'm always letting you in. 
You've got the feeling you've been followed under your skin. 
It will be weighing on your shoulder. 
You've got that seed in you. 
You've got that seed in you. Run, run, what are you running from? 
Let all your small steps expose your secrets. 
You don't have to speak for me to believe it. 
But what do you mean? Shaken and faint, you've got the feeling 
you've been followed under your skin. 
It will be weighing on your shoulder. 
You've got that seed in you. 
You've got that seed in 
I'm letting you in. 
You've got the feeling you've been followed. 
Are you listening to anything I've said? 
You've got that seed in you. Shaken and faint, it was the hardest thing to swallow. 
Pretending you don't miss me. 
You've got that seed in you. 
You've got that seed in While letting you in, I'll be thinking about tomorrow. 
And every time we cross those lines. 
You've got that seed in you. 
You've got that seed in Oh no, as I walk away, everyone had found me out.
