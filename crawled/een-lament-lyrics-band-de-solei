I was holding an invitation 
To meet some danger 
Around the corner from an evil love affair 
Something told me feet get tread 
To be moving 'cause 
I felt like I weren't going anywhere I took a walk past the church house 
Of my family 
The one that left me feeling solo and for dead 
I was sickly with all those ghosts 
Floating in my bottle 
So I poured them in the pavement and I said If Jesus is coming, he better come on 
If Jesus is coming, he better come on 
'cause I'm tired of running 
I'll get what's coming 
Down at the altar of my youth I snuck in through the oak doors 
Of the chapel 
And I lay my weary body on the pew 
Red crushed velvet 'neath my halo 
I was ready to see his face 
And I tell him exactly 
What he could do
