I guess we didn't see 
It wasn't meant to be 
But we tried to love each other 
There was no reason to 
It's just what we went through 
Now time has torn us apart 
Though I told you I love you 
And you told me the same 
A little distance between us 
How I've noticed a lot has changed 
Now baby I 
I ain't missing your love(missing your love) 
I I ain't missing your love(missing your love) 
It's just another day 
We go our separate ways 
Without thinking about each other 
Now everything seems new 
When I see it without you 
I've been told you feel the same as i do 
Though I told you I loved you(ooh) 
And you told me the same 
A little distance between us 
How I've noticed a lot has changed 
Now baby I 
I ain't missing your love(missing your love)(yeah yeah) 
I I ain't missing your love(missing your love) 
I I ain't missing your love(missing your love) 
I I ain't missing your love(missing your love) 
Is it a crime that I've finally realised 
Your were missing all aong(missing all along) 
Still I don't have you 
And I'm torn in two 
Now it's time to say goodbye 
Now baby I 
I ain't missing your love(missing your love) 
Oh baby I 
I I ain't missing your love(missing your love) 
I I ain't misssing your love(missing your love) 
I I ain't missing your 
Oh I ain't missing your love 
I I ain't missing your love(missing your love) 
I I ain't missing your 
Oh I ain't missing your love
