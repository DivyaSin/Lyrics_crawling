You from New York you are so relevant 
You reduce me to cosmic tears 
Luminous more so then most anyone 
Unapologetically alive knot in my stomach 
And lump in my throat 
I love you when you dance when you freestyle in trance 
So pure such an expression 
Supposed former infatuation junkie 
I sink three pointers and you wax poetically 
I love you when you dance when you freestyle in trance 
So pure such an expression 
Let's grease the wheel over tea 
Let's discuss things in confidence 
Let'd be outspoken let'd be ridiculous 
Let'd solve the world's problems 
I love you when you dance when you freestyle in trance 
So pure such an expression
