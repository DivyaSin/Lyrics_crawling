He wakes up and reaches for 
The whiskey by his side 
His heart is filled with shame 
But he can't turn the tide,oh no Still he spreads the word of God 
It's all he's got to keep from goin' insane 
No one hears him pray But should listen well 
To the story that he tells 
As he's standing in the rain Listen to the Preacher 
Listen to what he say, alright 
Listen to the Preacher 
You've gotta stay a while 
You got the time to pray 
They know that he's a drunkard 
But he's seen the light of day He's just another man 
With dues still left to pay 
It's a bottle every day 
It's a bottle every day 
Yes, it's a bottle every day Been around a long, long time 
And started drinking young 
He says it doesn't matter now 
His life is almost done He has spent his life in vain 
Always trying to ease the pain 
In the heart of his fellow man Oh and now it's come this 
Is it me,in a mess? 
But no one understands Listen to the Preacher 
Listen to what he say, alright 
Listen to the Preacher 
Why don't you stay a while 
You got time to pray 
They know that he's a drunkard 
But he's seen the light of day He's just another man 
With dues still left to pay 
It's a bottle every day 
It's a bottle every day 
Yes, it's a bottle every day
