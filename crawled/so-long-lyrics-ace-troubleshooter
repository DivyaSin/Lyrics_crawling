So long, farewell 
Goodbye you crazy Southerner, goodbye 
Don't cry, turn away Don't change, I'll write 
And all the other stuff, we kinda mean 
Don't cry, turn away I'll remember you, so long 
With your super thumping radio 
I'll remember you, so long 
Hey, oh It's been too long 
Since games and running totals filled our minds 
Boxed up, put away Hach and Brian have gone now 
You went your way, I went mine 
It's all okay I'll remember you, so long 
With your super thumping radio 
I'll remember you, so long 
Hey, oh Don't sit in that gum 
As you're lounging in the sun 
I'll remember you, so long 
Hey, oh So long, farewell 
Au revoir, goodbye 
I hate to see you go 
Don't cry, turn away Goodbye, my friend, I'll miss you so 
Across the states you had to go 
Goodbye, my friend, I'll miss you so 
For all the way across the states you had to go Goodbye 
(Goodbye) 
Goodbye 
(Goodbye)
