Started feeling up the fortune 
Stash away in the hit and play 
Thinking how their birth in on day 
Everything's gonna be undone 
Everything's gonna be undone 
Everything's gonna be undone 
Uh How you get to be a I'm so tired 
Never seem somebody search em as 
Trying well and try you my 
You'll be falling might gonna raise 
Everything's gonna be undone 
Everything's gonna be undone 
Everything's gonna be undone 
Uh You know that it will 
You know that it will 
So many things I could've written down In the passing of the restless night 
Some of those are worth keeping 
There are things that you should never run 
Everything's gonna be undone 
Everything's gonna be undone 
Everything's gonna be undone You know that it will 
You know that it will 
And you know that it will 
You know that it will You think you found another loved one 
Now you know that you will never part 
And you know that everything will be undone 
You couldn't take another broken heart 
Everything's gonna be undone 
Everything's gonna be undone
