[Intro] 
-Yo, what's your name, young blood? What they call you? 
-Well I got, I got, James, Jimmy, Jimmy Dean 
-Yeah I've been feeling that really JD swag lately [Verse 1] 
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece 
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace 
Uh, Schwarzenegger I, straight slaughter niggas 
I'm offin niggas, screaming off with niggas heads 
They all surrender, better call for niggas 
Come at all you niggas heads, talk em off a ledge 
I'm arguing with 'em, I'm done talking with 'em 
I order coffins for 'em, call the coroner for 'em 
Get a comforter for 'em, I did all you niggas beds 
I want all you niggas dead 
You want all you nigga money, royalness and bread 
Royalties instead of rollies for your boys, but loyalty is dead [Outro] 
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece 
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace 
Rep my block, quick to draw on all you niggas if there's beef 
Blow your spot, better pray to Lord this shit don't hit the streets 
Jimmy Dean
