And some people have cats but There was a tailor, had a mouse

Hi diddle um come feed a The tailor had a tall silk hat

Hi diddle um come feed a Hi diddle um, come tintrum tantrum 
Through the town of Ramsey

Hi diddle um come feed a The tailor, he chased him over the lea 
Hi diddle um come feed a 
The last of that mouse he never did see 
Hi diddle um come feed a Hi diddle um, come tintrum tantrum 
Through the town of Ramsey
