Oh it's a matter of knowing when to stop 
your mind from overflowing 
you can't always keep on going 
you're better off hanging loose a little 
gotta find yourself a minute to chill Relax a little and lean it back, lean it back, lean it back 
You've got to get your freedom back, freedom back, freedom back Take off a load and spoil yourself 
Treat your mind to a long vacation, a long vacation You got to lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left 
Release it, you gotta release it 
Lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left 
Release it, you gotta release it. Oh it's a matter of knowing what you want 
have faith in everything that you cannot control 
Just let it go and leave your thoughts alone 
gotta find yourself a second to chill Relax a little and lean it back, lean it back, lean it back 
You've got to get your freedom back, freedom back, freedom back Take off a load be nice to yourself 
Treat your mind to a long vacation, a long vacation You got to lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left 
Release it, you gotta release it 
lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left 
Release it, you gotta release it. (breathe in) 
you slowly breathe in some air 
(breathe out) 
Then you slowly breathe it out 
(breathe in) 
Got to let your heart rate down 
(breathe out) 
Got to let the stress out 
2x Relax a little bit lean it back, lean it back, lean it back 
You've got to get your freedom back, freedom back, freedom back You got to lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left 
Release it, you gotta release it 
Lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left, lean to the left 
Release it, you gotta release it. 
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out Release it 
baby take it off, let it all out 
You gotta release it 
There ain't nothing you should worry about 
release it 
Leave it all behind, let it out your mind 
You gotta release it 
Yeah release it 
Release it
