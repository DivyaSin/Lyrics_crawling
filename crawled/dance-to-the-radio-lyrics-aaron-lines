Your daddy wouldn't like it 
If he knew what I was thinking right now 
But the way you look this evening, girl 
It's hard to keep my feet on the ground It's raining outside 
Let's start a fire 
Baby, I say we just stay in tonight 
And it's a Turn up the music loud 
And turn the lights real low 
There's no one else around 
Let's lay it down and dance to the radio Well, it's almost like the DJ's playing 
Every song especially for us 
And it takes me back to that summer night 
When you and me learned everything about love I just wanna hold 
Your body close 
Girl, I don't wanna ever let go 
And it's a Turn up the music loud 
And turn the lights real low 
There's no one else around 
Let's lay it down and dance to the radio, oh yeah Wanna feel your heart beat, all night long 
When you whisper in my ear 
Girl, it's sweeter than my favorite song There's no one else around, baby 
Turn up the music loud 
And turn the lights real low 
There's no one else around 
Let's lay down and dance to the radio 
Let's dance to the radio
