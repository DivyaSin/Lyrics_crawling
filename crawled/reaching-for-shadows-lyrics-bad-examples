I keep on looking where you were sleeping 
I see the imprint of your body on the sheet 
I keep on hiding, thinking you've found me 
I give you nothing and you give me borrowed time 
(chorus) 
Feels like I'm reaching for shadows, shadows 
Looks like I'm holding on to water again 
Every time I think I've figured out what we're after 
I'm reaching for shadows We say we're honest, but what do we know 
We tell ourselves so many lies we think are true 
And it's no secret we're more than just friends 
But we're so much less than we ever really knew Chorus We put a label on it, just so we won't talk about it 
Two masters of deception -- seeing all, but not each other 
And I believe it's time we stop pretending 
We're a pair of shadows... shadows... I keep on feeling where you're not touching 
I'm tired of dancing with a shadow on the wall 
And if we're terrified of being lonely 
Why do we struggle so hard to remain alone? Chorus
