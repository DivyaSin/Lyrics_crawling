No one dared to show for that shower, when nobody turned out to be clean, was not even touched by the water, just another Nazi scheme. 
Yeah, The Big Takeover yeah-ah-, My, big Takeover yeahh,yeahhh. 
Walking around in total damnation, prepare yourself for the final quest. This world is doomed with a desegregration, still another Nazi threat! 
Yeah, The Big Takeover yeah-ah-, My, the big Takeover yeahh-yeah-yeahhh. 
You've gotta be right, you better take it. 
If you don't act right, you'll never... make it! 
So understand me when I say, there's no love for this U.S.A. This world is doomed with it's own segregation, Just another nazi test. 
Yeah, The Big Takeover yeah-ah-, My Big Takeover yeahh,yeah-yeah.
