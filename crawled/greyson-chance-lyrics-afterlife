We talk to the deep of the night 
Moving by cigarette light 
Waiting for something to spark 
But you've left me in the dark 
Mistakes that you made in the past 
Cutting through you like they're glass 
There are no words that can paint 
The longing in your face 
I just wanna hold you, keep you in my world But you wanted to go higher, take the chance and explode 
Thought I was more than the afterlife, thought I was more than a 
You're at the edge of your desire, left the story untold 
Thought I was more than the afterlife, thought I was more than the 
Thought I was more than the, more than the, more than the Love's never clear in the haze 
But you feel good in the sway 
Calling me up for a ride 
I pick you up, we fight 
I say the future is yours if you choose 
And mine won't exist without you 
Nothing I say hits your heart, 
You keep me in the dark I just wanna hold you, keep you in my world But you wanted to go higher, take the chance and explode 
Thought I was more than the afterlife, thought I was more than a 
You're at the edge of your desire, left the story untold 
Thought I was more than the afterlife, thought I was more than the 
Thought I was more than the, more than the, more than the (x2) 
Don't tell me in my sleep, 
Don't tell me in my dreams 
Don't tell me what you see 
Show me with a touch 
Show me with some love 
Show me you'll stay with me But you wanted to go higher, take the chance and explode 
Thought I was more than the afterlife, thought I was more than a 
You're at the edge of your desire, left the story untold 
Thought I was more than the afterlife, thought I was more than the 
Thought I was more than the, more than the, more than the
