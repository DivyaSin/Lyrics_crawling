Bleeding on your highway baby 
Harvest is a' coming in the season of Dying 
I trace the skull in your face and remember 
I kissed a girl with 13 fingers Mutate 
Insectile 
Mutate I cum malignant, cold death-gasm 
Ia! Ia! Zi, azakka diablos! 
I pulse and twitch; I release and spasm 
I heard Satan on the AM radio 
I trace the skull in your face, and remember 
I kissed a girl with 13 fingers, kissed a girl with 13 fingers Mutate 
Insectile 
Mutate 
Insectile GO GO GO 
Blood makes the grass grow 
I heard the ghost of Hitler on the radio 
GO GO GO 
Blood makes the grass grow 
I blew a load of Jesus into Mary's hole I trace the skull in your face and remember 
I kissed a dark-haired girl with 13 fingers 
I see the Trident Majesty, deep down to break *free* Fuck it, Fuck it 
He raped you 
Fuck it, Fuck it 
I understand the bleeding but don't know why 
It's so easy to watch you cry 
It's so fuckin' easy to watch you cry 
I understand the bleeding but don't know why 
I understand the bleeding but don't know why 
It's so easy to watch you die 
It's so fuckin' easy to watch you die 
It's so easy to watch you die
