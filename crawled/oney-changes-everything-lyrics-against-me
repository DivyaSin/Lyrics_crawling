She said I'm sorry babe I'm leaving you tonight 
I found someone new she's waiting in the car outside 
Ah how could you do it we swore ourselves everlasting love 
She said well you know when we did there was one thing we weren't 
Thinking of and that's money Money changes everything 
We said money, money changes everything 
You think you know what we're doing 
We don't know a thing, it's all in the past now 
Money changes everything Well they shake your hand just smile and they'll buy you a drink 
Said we'll be your friends we'll stick with you till the end 
Well but everybody's only looking out for themselves 
And you'll say, who can you trust, well you can trust 
Nobody else's money Money changes everything 
We said money, money changes everything 
You think we know what we're doing 
We don't pull the strings, it's all in the past now 
Money changes everything I said money changes everything 
I said money changes everything 
I said money changes everything 
I said money changes everything 
We think we know what we're doing 
We don't know a thing, it's all in the past now 
Money changes everything 
I said money changes everything 
Yeah money changes everything [Repeat: x7] 
Changes everything
