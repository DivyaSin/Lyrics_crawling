You don't get dressed up for me no more 
Don't do your make up for me no more 
Don't clean a place up for me no more 
We sleep and wake up make love no more 
No late night movies with me no more 
Play fight and jaccuzis with me no more 
Don't shake your booty for me no more 
Look what you done to me can't speak no more Chorus Yeah Girl.. 
I just wanna be a better man 
I far from an angel or reverend 
streets tryna make a brother sell again 
But i just wanna hold hands with you again [Why?? Why??? 
Would you think I don't love you no more.. no more.. x2] No dirty dancin' tween us no more 
And no romancing tween us no more 
There's no affection tween us no more 
There's no direction where do i go 
They wanna see us let go 
But i'm sure you know 
That i'll never walk out that door 
And i'm sure you know 
That i would be there to fight for you 
And will look out for you even though you were let'n go 
You will always be my only no i'll never leave you lonely.. 
You're friend.. You're my homie 
Comin' Home'y Chorus I just wanna be a better man 
I far from an angel or reverend 
streets tryna make a brother sell again 
But i just wanna hold hands with you again [Why?? Why???would 
you think I don't love you no more.. no more.. x2] Wanna let you know that i'm like your shadow 
And no matter where you go my heart will follow 
Even though you seen alot, heard alot 
One things for show's we all we got hope to ease the pain by telling you just one thang 
That i'll always love you Chorus I just wanna be a better man 
streets tryna make a brother sell again 
But i just wanna hold hands with you again [Why?? Why??? 
Would you think I don't love you no more.. no more.. x2] Ohhh.... Yeahhh Love you no more
