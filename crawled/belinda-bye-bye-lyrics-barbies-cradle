Bake a cake to my taste you dance away Belinda 
Disappear in the light smile like that Belinda 
But i will not follow you 
tonight I will go home 
You are tremors in my heart you are my Belinda 
You will be my sinful secret 
I can't tell my kids about you 
Though I could never lie 
And I hope someday you'd ask You know I'd like to stay here and chat for a while 
But its bad for my future plans of being a loyal wife So bye bye 
Belinda bye bye 
Belinda bye bye 
bye bye 
Belinda bye bye 
Belinda bye bye If you think this song is about you You're so vain Belinda 
But if you catch my stupid eye youd know you're right 
But I will not look again 
this time I will hide my heart 
The spirits in my room they whisper 
You know the sky is now in bloom But I'll sacrifice Belinda 
I have to let you go 
cause I think it might be lust You know I'd like to stay and do magic with you 
But that would be unkind to my little boy blue So bye bye 
Belinda bye bye 
Belinda bye bye 
bye bye 
Belinda bye bye 
Belinda bye bye bye bye 
bye bye bye 
bye bye bye 
bye bye You know I'd like to stay and do magic with you 
But that would be unkind to my little boy blue So bye bye 
Belinda bye bye 
Belinda bye bye 
bye bye 
Belinda bye bye 
Belinda bye bye

Belinda bye bye 
Belinda bye bye

Belinda bye bye 
Belinda bye bye Little boy blue lost his shoe 
One day paddling in the water 
He cried and he cried 
He cried and he realized 
That its more fun to run without shoes
