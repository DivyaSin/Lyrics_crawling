Eleven white roses on a black granite slab 
The beautiful face followed by the stab 
I sit by the foot of many hearts' lament 
All wondering still 
Where the sun and moon went 
Spider sweet spider 
Jumped onto my hand 
Spider sweet spider 
Did I understand? 
Spider sweet spider 
Endless reflections in a room made of glass 
The winners the losers all end 
In the past 
Love keeping track of every tiny attempt 
At facing the monsters that 
Ego has sent 
Spider sweet spider 
Jumped onto my hand 
Spider sweet spider 
Did I understand? 
We're spinning these webs 
To trap all our dreams 
Entangle the notion 
This is as it seems 
It's just a prison that tumbles right down 
With the force of a kiss 
And a smile for a frown 
Spider sweet spider
