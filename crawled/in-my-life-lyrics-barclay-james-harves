In my life I have seen so many things 
Some were true and some were not what they seemed 
In my life I've seen love and I've seen loss 
There've been times when I did not count the cost 
I have been to a place where chaos rules 
In the caves of the talking stoned the fools 
Seen the stars plant their seeds and watch them grow 
Just to keep mister reap but never sow In my life I've seen greed and I've seen hate 
Seen the first to accuse the last to praise 
Tried so hard to find just one saving grace But I was young did not know 
Grace is for God 
Greed is to know 
Mister middle of the road 
Reaps what you sow
