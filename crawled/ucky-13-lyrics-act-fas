Everything that i 
Was taught to be right 
Was it all a stupid lie 
All the things you taught 
All the battles we faught 
And all the unforgetable thoughts 
My brain is twisted now 
The room it spins around 
Everything I believed has broken down 
How could you lie to me 
The things you said I believed 
But still I will not turn my back and run away *chorus* 
But i 
Can't find it in myself 
To turn my back on you 
No matter what you (do) 
But i 
Still don't understand 
All the things you taught 
All the battles we faught 
Tell me 
Was it all a hoax 
Was it just a scam 
I don't (understand) 
Still i 
Can't find it in myself 
To turn my back on you 
No matter what you do Your empty lies 
Won't save you this time 
'cause I know there's nothing on the inside 
I'd agree to stay 
If you agree to change 
But your answer will always be no way 
You were once my friend 
You said friends till the end 
I will still try for as long as I can 
Our friendship's come undone 
The burden ways a ton 
You stabbed me in the back, true friends stab in the front Lucky 13
