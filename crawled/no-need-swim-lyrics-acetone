I'm a molecule of water 
Flying over niagara falls 
While my world is flowing down 
To the sea I'm the ebb and flow of the ocean 
She's the magnetic pull of the moon 
And all the stars are falling down 
Around me I'm a molecule of water 
Flying over niagara falls 
And all the walls are falling down 
In my mind 
In my mind 
In my mind
