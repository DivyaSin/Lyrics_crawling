Go tell it on the mountain 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ was born Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ was born Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ was born While shepherd kept their watching 
Oer the silent flocks by night 
He poured throughout the heavens 
They shined that holy light Im telling you to 
Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ was born Well, when I was a seeker 
I sought both night and day 
I sought the Lord to help me 
And he showed me the way Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ was born Well ,he brought with him forgiveness 
And he showed us the way 
Saving all of Gods creations 
Washed our sins away 
Upon the lonely manger 
Where the baby was born 
And hey! 
Aint nobody got to worry no more Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ was born Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ was born 
Our Savior, he was 
Never been the same since the Savior was born
