Riding in the street - these streets are mine! 
Fooled by corruption for the last time. 
Riding in the street - these streets are mine! 
Never again led by the blind Skating Babylon 
Skating Babylon 
Skating Babylon 
Skating Babylon When I feel - there's no way out, 
I grab my board and I head out - 
And Skate Babylon! 
And Skate Babylon! 
And Skate Babylon! 
And Skate Babylon! Riding in the street - these streets are mine! 
Fooled by corruption for the last time. 
Riding in the street - these streets are mine! 
Never again led by the blind
