It's February and I just want April 
To take my hand and pick me up again 
Yeah, I'm numb but it's really not that bad 
Live life 'til you get it wrong 
Take a breath and turn your head 
Oh my god, I've gotta get out of this trend It's 8 o'clock in the middle of a last chance 
Can't we just pretend we don't know 
Anything or anyone or anywhere anyway? 
It's kinda scary in the dark in the dim light 
Can't I just pretend I don't mind 
Everything or everyone or everywhere anyway? I've got a lot of life and you've got nothing, nothing 
I've got a lot of life and you Don't swallow the sun, the moon isn't bright enough 
We're all like flashlights, useless till you turn us on 
Sex and cigarettes are real, the apocalypse is fate 
Replace the T with a K 
Religion's a reminder that our past is filled with liars I spell my name with capital letters 
But I don't talk much 'cause I'm a beginner at this life thing 
Yeah, I'm young but that don't mean much here 
If everyone knows that they're gonna grow old 
Then why do we act like why we don't like the past? 
If we had the chance we'd do it all over again I've got a lot of life and you've got nothing, nothing 
I've got a lot of life and you Don't swallow the sun, the moon isn't bright enough 
We're all like flashlights, useless till you turn us on 
Sex and cigarettes are real, the apocalypse is fate 
Replace the T with a K 
Religion's a reminder that our past is filled with liars I've spent 21 years replacing my old fears for new ones 
I've asked why, how and where 
More times than I care to remember 
I've got 7 days 'til a new week comes 
And 24 hours to convince myself I'm real 
'Cause today I'm not so sure I even exist Sitting by the sinners on a bad day 
Everybody's kiss is contagious 
I'm tired of watching wars on my TV screen 
There's not an easy way to say this 
Nobody likes a winter sitting on the wind while the trees get thinner Can't you just pretend you're a good kid? 
Can't I just pretend I really give a shit 
Even though I don't really know how I want to live? 
I promise I'll be a better person this time next year 
This time next year
