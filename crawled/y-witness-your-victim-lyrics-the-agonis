Confess to your sins 
Immorality's my witness 
The search for redemption 
A never-ending trial - your victim The battlefield has transformed 
Blades unto bullets 
Killing is easy but Ruling is key 
Strike millions of targets at once 
Bullets unto light The means for authority imposed upon mankind 
False sense of security interacting as your guide 
A woven fabrication as a radiant design 
Enclosing all written access, there's no place left to hide We bare ourselves 
To the eye of the sun 
Take all you need 
In the name of Killing is easy but ruling is key Confess to your sins 
Immorality's my witness 
The search for redemption 
A never-ending trial - your victim A saint-like figure you demand 
Take a look at your reflection 
The world's not your own to command 
Imperfection staring right back at you Anytime 
Anywhere 
With five eyes watching 
We bear witness 
Anytime 
Anywhere 
With five ears listening 
We will attend 
The eye of providence Thus, I present my final words 
A moment is all I ask for 
My greatest fear, eternally 
Is that nothing will ever change Confess to your sins 
Immorality's my witness 
The search for redemption 
A never-ending trial - your victim
