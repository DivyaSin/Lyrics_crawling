i'm on the trapeze of everyday. seven o'clock came early with no sunrise. and to my surprise, i think i realized it was all of my own device. the flight was oh so long, and i'm still hangin' on, to the arm of someone i don't even know. the feeble grind will slay the mind. how did i get this far off the ground? and to my surprise, i think i realized this is not the life that i need. and i'm caught inside the circle and you're caught inside the circle and it's movin' on, it's ' on, it's life inside the circle. it's that time of year again. remember when we used to try to get out of this town? displaced burden girl, you know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night.
