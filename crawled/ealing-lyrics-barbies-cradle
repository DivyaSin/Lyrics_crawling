These aren't pains 
the burdens I cradle 
they have names 
and now I am able to face them 
change them 
or bless them And I thank you most 
for what you did 
and didn't from the inside rose 
someone I had forgotten She's a good girl 
she's no stranger 
she's wiser 
'cause she has come to know healing is from the inside 
when I look close enough i see 
healing is from the inside 
peace is in the place within me the rainy day 
invites melancholy 
but in this place 
nothing ever hurts it's not lonely here 
all good things appear 
i still hold you dear it's not the last time 
persephone comes to visit me 
but it's not a bad time 
when she leaves i'm a good girl 
i just wander 
i'm no stranger 
'cause i have come to know
