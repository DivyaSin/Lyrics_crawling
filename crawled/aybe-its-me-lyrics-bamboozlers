words and music: Justin Moore 
On the radio this morning 
I heard our old song 
I think back to the good times 
And I wonder what went wrong 
Was it miscommunication? 
Or 'cause you had no trust in me? 
Or was it lack of inspiration, 
Or maybe, maybe it's just me 
Water all around me 
But nothing I can drink 
There's light that surrounds me 
But still I cannot see 
I don't know what I'm feeling 
It's not right, it can't be 
I try to find something to blame 
But maybe, maybe it's just me 
Bridge: (Steven) 
My stomach's all tied up in knots 
I don't know how or what I got 
But I know I'm confused 
Where can I go I must slow down 
My mind is turning upside down/ I can feel it 
Chorus: (2x) 
Maybe, maybe it's just me 
I can't get to my heart 
To guide me where to go 
Maybe, maybe it's just me 
I still can't find a way 
To let my mind know (2nd time- Which way I want to go)
