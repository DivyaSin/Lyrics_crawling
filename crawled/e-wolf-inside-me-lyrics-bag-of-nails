You know I cry when others laugh 
sittin' all alone 
I don't want nobody 
hangin' 'round my door They tried to teach me how to live 
and teach me how to die 
They gave me hate to breath 
and love to make me blind I'm feeling blue among the sheep 
pretend my biggest smile 
but after work the night 
wakes the wolf inside I got the wolf inside me 
I'm gonna show you now 
My teeth are sharp my hide is thick 
you know I'll spill some blood around Well my heart is beatin' fast 
and my soul's on fire 
Try to run 
Try to hide Try to run Try to hide
