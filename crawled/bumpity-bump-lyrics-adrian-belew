What's a blue man gonna do 
When he collects the whole set of the blues 
He can't move, 
He can't shake his slump 
A blue man says bumpity bump Hey, bumpity bump 
My heart hurts like a drum What's a man, 
What's a blue man gonna do 
When he knows the truth of the blues 
He can't find the world a satisfyin' place 
He can't even face his own face Why do I hurt like a drum? 
My heart says bumpity bump A blue man 
What's he got to do, 
Go to sleep to evade the blues? 
They might follow him right into his dreams 
They might corner him and make him scream Why do I feel like a bomb? 
My heart says bumpity bump Hey, what's a blue man say 
When he's got to wake up 
To another blue day 
Oh, and nothing is right 
And he's got no disguise 
Who knows, maybe he woke up 
In a different guy Why do I feel like a bomb? 
My heart hurts like a drum, why? 
My heart says bumpity bump
