I do what I do 
And I do 
Make the sound so loud 
so loud 
Machiavelli 
The Balkan Beat Box paints like Dali 
Kali, bali, la-la-la-la-la-li 
La la li 
Bring the dance and leave the guns 
Push your brains to positrance 
Drums of the resistance 
We're making Bush belly dancing with Afghanistans. 
Bring the dance and put the shoes of 
We see the devil is shopping 
The TV is dropping down Dung 
Everywhere blood 
Come anywhere 
We gotta wake up 
Seems to me like nobody cares. 
Beat, beat beats, beat box, beat beat beat 
In the press with the truth in your face 
You say no, I say yes. 
2x 
La la li 
Bring the dance and leave the guns 
Push your brains to positrance 
Drums of the resistance 
We're making Bush belly dancing with Afghanistans.
