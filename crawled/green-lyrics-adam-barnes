'Cause my arms would die without your hands to live 
And your arms will lie parallel to his 
And I won't be fooled as long as I don't hear 
That you have been whispering 
Sweet nothings in his ear And one of these days he'll screw up 
And oh, you'll question the love 
And I will be waiting there for you 
To wander back 
'Cause you deserve more than that 
'Cause you deserve more than that You'll pardon his thinking 
All the fights he dragged you through 
And I learned of his shortcomings 
When I got to lie with you The ways that we differ 
And ways you can begin 
To bring back the green in your eyes 
The sadness from your skin And one of these days you'll grow up 
And oh, you'll question a love 
That never fulfilled you from the start 
It won't take long to mend a broken heart 
Deserves more than that 
'Cause it deserves more than that You'll wait for a break 
Then the morning comes 
And it feels like a burning 
Burning touch of the sun 
It feels like broken glass 
The shot of a gun And one of these days he'll screw up 
And oh, you'll question the love 
And I will be waiting there for you 
To wander back And one of these days you'll grow up 
And oh, you'll question a love 
It never fulfilled you from the start 
It won't take long to mend a broken heart 'Cause you deserve more than that 
You deserve more than that 
You deserve more than that
