Girl I just want to hold you 
Build my world right around you 
Cause girl you give me tightest hold 
Ive ever felt in my life Girl I just wanna squeeze you 
Build my world right around you 
Oh girl you give me the tightest hold

See I take you anytime anywhere 
When youre scared or full of fear 
As a man Ill be there I want a girl who can grow with me 
I want a girl who can take care of me 
Could you be it, let me see it

Cause girl you give me tightest hold 
Ive ever felt in my life Girl I just wanna squeeze you 
Build my world right around you 
Oh girl you give me the tightest hold

Never felt this good before 
Cause youre like a drug without Im in withdraw 
You always leave me wanting more Shes a fire in my soul

More and more and still I earn 
Just let this feeling multiply more Cause I wanna just hold you 
Build my world right around you 
Cause girl you give me tightest hold 
Ive ever felt in my life Girl I just wanna squeeze you 
Build my world right around you 
Oh girl you give me the tightest hold
