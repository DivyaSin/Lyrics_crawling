YEA! Wanna tell you a story 
About a friend of mine in the pen 
When the gavel fell and the lock down cell 
This ? has its revenge 
I aint taking about killing no 
He aint the killing kind 
Just big ass racks and ?? 
Beer ? Whiskey and wine 
AIR RAID 
The city ? and the rock n roll 
AIR RAID 
The next day they decided 
That getting out ? 
With a big ciguar he too his guitar 
? his way to the stage 
? 
They try dragging him down 
Nobody knew what he was going to do 
And silence rang all around
