The Sunsets your not here 
The night creeps your not here 
The Sunsets your not here 
The night creeps your not here Did I miss anything 
Did you say something 
Did I lose a hidden smile 
Miss you all the while To simple I never tried 
never knew 
never knew 
that you cried I was just sleeping 
letting it all sneak away 
I was just sleeping 
the day you went away regrets come with living 
missing while breathing 
day dreaming then lost you 
falling over too what is true we were so close 
now we are so far 
I miss you everyday 
like the night misses stars I was just sleeping 
letting it all sneak away 
I was just sleeping 
the day you went away The sunset sets 
and your not here 
the night creeps 
and your not here
