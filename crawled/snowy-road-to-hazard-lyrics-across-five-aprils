The road is getting longer 
And I'm sure these miles are unforgettable 
I've learned a lot about who you are and who you're not 
It's sickening Late nights and rocks on the rooftops 
We've come so far from that 
Did you ever think this game would catch you 
You're no different than the rest of them We're not your ride we're not your boys 
So save your stories our ears are closed It's not your face I hate but what's going on behind it
