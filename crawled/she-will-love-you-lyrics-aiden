You say you're in love 
The curse has wrote 
This sonnet to the end 
You say you're in love 
This hostile can't pretend Everything trashed 
And picture ask for something 
So perfectly aligned 
Will you come to me? 
Will you come to me? Kiss me, quick I'm losing 
Why can't we live forever? You say you're in love 
But beauty slides 
This silhouette, she screams 
Will you come to me? 
Will you come to me? Kiss me, quick I'm losing 
Why can't we live forever? 
Kiss me, quick I'm losing 
But I'm missing this kiss [Chorus] 
She will love you 
For all her life (all her life) 
She will love you 
Throughout the skies 
She will love you 
For all her life (all her life) 
And sing our lies forever 
Sing our lies together Can you take me back so far away 
Can you take me back so far away 
There's something left 
There's something left to say 
There's something left 
You've got something left to say [Chorus x2]
