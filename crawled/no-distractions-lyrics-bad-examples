All I really want to do 
Is tear these walls out of me and you 
We're trapped inside these movie roles 
Let's start living with a little more soul 
Throw your coat upon the grass 
Flip back your head and shake your ass 
I'll do anything you like 
Let's start living with a little more life 
It's a great big bouncy world and it's yours and mine 
I wanna revel in our physical attraction 
With no distractions Run my fingers down your back 
I'm gonna kiss your belly and bite your neck 
Out here lying in the sun 
It's one for the money, and two for the fun 
There's something chemical - what have we done? 
It's time we got us some soul satisfaction 
With no distractions It's no accident that I feel fine 
It's a great big bouncy world and it's yours and mine 
Close your eyes and we will make our connection 
With no distractions
