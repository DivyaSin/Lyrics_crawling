I'm gonna raise the Titanic 
Sail across the Atlantic 
And this time it ain't gonna sink 
I'm gonna sit here in this chair 
With this beer and declare 
It's the last one I'll ever drink 
Buy a pair of dinosaur skin boots 
Take a walk across the moon 
Yeah that's what I'm gonna do I can do that with no sweat 
You can bet it's a sure bet 
I'm telling the Gods honest truth 
But I can't undo what I did 
Or un-say what I said 
Or un-break what I broke in you 
'Cause there's just a few things impossible to do I'm gonna do some soul searching 
Put my mind to working 
On fixing the hurting I've done 
Drop down into first gear 
Jump clean into next year 
By then you'll be back or still gone 
Ride in on a rainbow 
Land out side your window 
That's what I'm gonna do
