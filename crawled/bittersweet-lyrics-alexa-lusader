Love has the bitter sweetest taste 
All these memories captured in your face 
How cliche of me to think our love 
could end perfectly You keep me from feeling alive 
Took the breath out of me 
I'm thankful for all the lies 
Taught me how to leave She will make you realize 
That you need me 
But you will never have me back 
Isn't that bittersweet? 
x2 Love and heartbreak control everywhere I go 
And how I see 
When my heart catches wind of your image 
Hello anxiety You stole my sense of what's right 
From wrong 
But you don't phase me now 
Cause I am too strong She will make you realize 
That you need me 
But you will never have me back 
Isn't that bittersweet? 
x2 I told you I wouldn't wait around 
Forever 
But this one, this one makes me so much 
Better 
He's beautiful in everyday 
More than I could say 
Now I've found what I've been searching for 
My sight of love Isn't that bittersweet? She will make you realize 
That you need me 
But you will never have me back 
Isn't that bittersweet? 
x2 You will never have me back 
have me back 
have me back 
isn't that bittersweet? 
you will never have me back 
have me back 
have me back 
isn't that bittersweet?
