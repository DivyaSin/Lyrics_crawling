And you 
Can bring me to my knees 
Again All the times 
That I could beg you please 
In vain All the times 
That I felt insecure 
For you And I leave 
My burdens at the door But I'm on the outside 
I'm looking in 
I can see through you 
See your true colors 
'Cause inside you're ugly 
You're ugly like me 
I can see through you 
See to the real you All the times 
That I felt like this won't end 
Was for you And I taste 
What I could never have 
It's from you All those times 
That I tried 
My intentions 
Full of pride 
And I waste 
More time than anyone But I'm on the outside 
I'm looking in 
I can see through you 
See your true colors 
'Cause inside you're ugly 
You're ugly like me 
I can see through you 
See to the real you All the times 
That I've cried 
All that's wasted 
It's all inside But I feel 
All this pain 
Stuffed it down 
It's back again And I lie 
Here in bed 
All alone 
I can't mend And I feel 
Tomorrow will be okay But I'm on the outside 
I'm looking in 
I can see through you 
See your true colors 
'Cause inside you're ugly 
You're ugly like me 
I can see through you 
See to the real you
