I know it's late, and the evenings gently giving ground 
Shadows remain of the words that were never spoken 
All the years that we once held in our hands 
Just leave us to wonder 
Still the winds are changing all the time 
But I know it's too late 
The seasons all gone by, oh, whoa 
Oh, oh, oh, oh Seasons can wait 'till a thousand years have come and gone 
Stories we wrote 
All the days that were never counted 
Time alone 
All the dreams we thought would never die 
But then there's tomorrow 
For these dreams will save our lonely times 
But I know it's too late 
The seasons all gone by, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh Hear the crashing sound as time slips away 
Feel the thunder ride the road 
Wearing this chain on my hands that I'm sure to bare 
Oh, love rain on you forever more, oh Oh, listen I know it's late, and the evening's gently giving ground 
Shadows remain of the words that were never spoken 
Though I dream 
Sometimes dreams are all I know Leave us to wonder 
Though the winds are changing all the time 
But I know it's too late 
The seasons all gone by, oh, whoa But I know it's too late 
The seasons all gone by, oh, oh, oh But I know it's too late 
The seasons all gone by 
Oh, feels so good, oh 
And you feel so good, oh, oh And things must change 
Oh, for the center is now, oh 
You can feel a change 
There's something in ya all 
You just don't know 
Listen 
Oh, oh 
But I know it's too late 
The seasons all gone bye
