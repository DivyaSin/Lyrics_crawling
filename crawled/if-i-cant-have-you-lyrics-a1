Another picture on the wall 
Another life I used to lead 
Another me that was untrue 
With every memory of you 
Broken in my sleep Another moment lost in time 
You talked of love and I agreed 
So many chances passed us by 
And now we've lost the strength to try 
Your love was never mine to keep 
Oh, no We can't hold on 
We're losing track 
So where's the road to take us back 
And how did we forget what we believed If I can't have you 
And If the love has gone 
And If you just can't find it in yourself to carry on 
If you have to leave 
Then take my life forever 
'Cause I will never be with anybody else 
If I can't have you With every night I lie awake 
With every day we grow apart 
Is there a promise we can't break 
We never learned from our mistakes 
From the very start We can't hold on 
We're losing track 
So where's the road to take us back 
And how did we forget what we believed If I can't have you 
And If the love has gone 
And If you just can't find it in yourself to carry on 
And If you have to leave 
Then take my life forever 
'Cause I will never be with anybody else 
If I can't have you Don't look back on yesterday 
'Cause that time has been and gone Think of what tomorrow holds 
Without you it feels so wrong 
I can't carry on If I can't have you 
And If the love has gone (and If the love has gone) 
If you just can't find It In yourself to carry on (can't find it in yourself) 
And If you have to leave 
Then take my life forever 
'Cause I will never be with anybody else 
If I can't have you 
Oh no And if I can't have you
