You've now entered the quest to, the black triangle 
Now you know the reason for the Black Mafia theory, hahaha 
Yes it has many meanings, but no matter how you define it 
It still comes out black 
See it's just a hair trim 
So you can call it what you want [2Pac] 
Now I clown around, when I hang around, with the Underground 
But when I'm with the Mafia we droppin' YA 
And if you're a hoe then I'll be knockin' ya, baby why not 
You shouldn't jock me cause I'm popular 
The group with the glock, I love to pop the gun 
Coppers get shot, they shouldn't try to stop the Mafia 
2Pac'll pack a person, pump the trunk 
I'm bumpin' G-Funk, but you can call it what you want 
How many times I gotta tell ya, don't ignore me 
Either be my hoe or hit the do', you're nothin' for me (see ya!) 
That's why I love to go on tour G 
Scores of whores behind the door, a nigga's naughty 
Now, I'm sippin' on a forty 
So you can call it what you want just pass the blunt and kick it Money [Money B] 
Well, I am the danger, the danger, similar to a killer 
I rhyme for rounds of conflicts chomp and stomp em while y'all chillin' 
In Tokyo, check it as I choke a slow poke rapper 
Capped his ass faster, than a half of pound of crepes'll go on Mother's Day 
First and fifteenth, another way of sayin' it 
I got new clips so trip but it's OK to get your crew 
Cause ooh I'll send your team to the showers 
They true and do and rippin' and got the Wonder Twin powers 
I devour much venom, lunch breaks I shit em, I just stink 
Whaddya think, this is a threat? Just forget about it 
Come back, you're done black, see Cutty was the stopper 
But you'll call me the indo when I chop ya with the shopper 
Sting ya with the stinger, flex the trigger finger 
I blow you to bits and I be gettin' a kick out of grabbin' the mic and flingin' 
Lyrics with the maximum security 
I smoke a splif but I'm not Jamaican, so won't you let a 
Yankee Doodle Doo what he hasta, raise my hand and cast a 
Hellafied spell you can't tell you better ask a 
Weatherman he'll sigh and reply, "You shoulda stayed in the house" 
Cause Mon is gonna rain on their parades [Cold 187um] 
Nowww, clear the smoke, and grab a fool by his throat 
And don't let him go til he holla holla billygoat 
Now Money Money Money B, once said to me 
"187 why you wanna be a G?" Well... 
I like to clock big G's, and hang out all night 
And never worry bout a bitch, cause she can't tell me shit 
Plus, money money is a pimp thang (what?) 
Cause see if you was in my shoes, you'd be doin the same 
So don't ever ever fuck with, I'm a G-er playa 
Cause when I'm bustin' on a punk, I could never be a customer 
Now peep this, cause when I'm goin deep 
The only customers gettin' served in the house, is the pussy I freak 
They wanna pop that ying-yang 
I tell em, "Sit down, shut up bitch, and let me kick game" (y'know) 
Cause hoes always be sayin' they got it goin on but if they wanna 
Get with a nigga like me they gotta pay a fee, I am not 
The No Mack Nigga, from the planet called Silk 
I'm from the planet Black Mafia Life, that freaks pimps 
Yo, come take a sip of the psycho-mega- 
Pimpsome-hoesta-must-be-a-playa 
Now hold up, wait a second 
Nah, I fucked you bitches on the last record, yo 
It's like I'm high on a raggamuffin splif 
Me the dope sound what a man, the myth (come) 
Mon they wanna see me fade shit, like I did last year 
So I POST on em, then I COAST on em 
No I never never never had a murder rap 
And if you snitch you say I did it you're bound to get your neck snapped 
So there it is, and how it's gonna be 
So I pass the joint, to my man KM.G
