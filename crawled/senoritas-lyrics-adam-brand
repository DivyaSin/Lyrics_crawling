I don't dance the Cucaracha 
I don't play the Moochachas 
I've never been to Mexico 
I've never had the chance to go 
Never met Speedy Gonzales 
I don't eat enchiladas 
I don't drink margaritas 
But I love the senioritis I've seen 'em on the TV shows 
Hair of brown and the way it flows when they let it down 
Cherry lips that you just wanna kiss 
It drives we wild when they look like this I love the way they dance all night 
Sway their hip's wrap me round their finger tips 
Tight red dress real knocks me out 
You know boy's what I'm talking about
