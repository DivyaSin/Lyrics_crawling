Something that you love 
Something that you hate 
Everything you're proud of, baby 
And every mistake 
All the things you want 
And everything you give to me 
Everything you're frightened of 
To every single year I just wanna try my best to do it right 
I'll meet you in the morning 
I'll meet you every day 
And I'll meet you in the night 
Everything is beautiful 
Everything is good 
I'll give you everything in the world 
If you were my girl 
If you were my girl Something that you see 
Something that you want to be 
Everything you're scared of, baby 
I want to dismiss 
Something that you love 
And everything you hate, yeah 
Everything you're proud of, baby 
And every mistake I just wanna try my best to do it right 
I'll meet you in the morning 
I'll meet you every day 
And I'll meet you in the night 
Everything is beautiful 
Everything is good 
I'll give you everything in the world 
If you were my girl 
If you were my girl 
If you were my girl 
If you were my girl
