For millions of girls and for millions of boys 
When Christmas Day is here 
The most wonderful day of the year! A jack in the box waits for children to shout, 
"Wake up, don't you know that it's time to come out!" 
When Christmas Day is here 
The most wonderful day of the year! Toys galore 
Scattered on the floor 
There's no room for more 
And it's all because of Santa Claus! A scooter for Jimmy, a dolly for Sue 
The kind that will even say "How do you do." 
When Christmas Day is here 
The most wonderful day of the year.
