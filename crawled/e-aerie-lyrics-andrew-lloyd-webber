Coney isle ... glistering and glimmering 
Rising bright 
Drenched in light 
See it smile 
Beckoning and shimmering 
All a-gleam 
Like a Dream 
Every fantasy set free 
Summer rising by the sea Madame Giry: Coney isle miracle on miracle 
See the sound burning round 
Mile by mile 
Loud and lewd and lyrical 
Dream on dream never seen 
all americ all was there 
here next to billionare Madame Giry: in a vacate 
a sensate and vondua 
hall of fame 
desperate in devastated noise 
night and day 
holding in by hundreds and thousands 
swept away for everything 
desire ...made for me
