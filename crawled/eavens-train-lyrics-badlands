Here's a little story `bout a very old muffin 
She's a sugar when she's on her back 
Tellin' old tales of how it used to be 
And she said she's covered all the tracks Laughin' all night 
Drinkin' all night 
Little Mary holds a naked heart Showin' no cards 
Hidin' no scars 
Just you ask just what's inside of her Such a sad, sad Mary 
Sing a song for Mary 
Love will find her way back home Two o'clock dawns 
When Mary starts out broke 
She's a-rockin' right around the clock 
From the New York apple 
To the Hollywood city 
Mary always finds a twisted plot Laughin' all night 
Drinkin' all night 
She's a tattooed jungle star Living her games 
Bridges in flames 
And she never thought she'd go too far Such a sad, sad Mary 
Sing a song for Mary 
Love will find her way back home (Solo) Two o'clock dawns and Mary's gotta run 
They say she's ridin' on a Heaven's train All aboard 
Mary, now they say she's blown the whistle 
And she's never comin' back again Laughin' all night 
Drinkin' all night 
She's a tattooed jungle star Living her games 
Bridges in flames 
And she never thought she'd go too far Just remember Mary 
Sing a song for Mary 
Love will find her way back home Just remember Mary 
Sing a song for Mary 
Love will find her way back home Sing a song for Mary 
Woo woo, hey
