I HAVE SEEN THE RESULT OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM 
I HAVE SEEM WHAT IT DOES 
I ASKED SOME KIDS ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST 
AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WAS 
DIDN'T THAT HAPPEN IN SOME TIME LIFE BOOKS 
I DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIE I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK 
GENOCIDE IS THE PRODUCT OF EVERY BLOODY WAR 
AND REMEMBRANCE IS A WAY TO BEGIN 
BUT DON'T BE SO IGNORANT AS TO BELIEVE 
IT CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN 
REMEMBER
