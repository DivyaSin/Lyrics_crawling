It was late in the night when I came by an open window 
She was satin and lace in the glow of a soft-lit fire 
She had secrets to share 'cause she's been everywhere the wind blows 
And so deep in her eyes lay the mirror of my desire Moonlight lady 
Come along with me 
Leave the dark city lights 
It's alright 'cause tonight's on me Moonlight lady 
Come along with me 
Leave the dark city lights 
It's alright 'cause tonight's on me And so softly we walked through the streets of the sleeping city 
Waking up dreams that lay quiet a million years 
And I silently weep at the power of her golden beauty 
'Cause I knew that we'd have to forget we were ever here Moonlight lady 
Come along with me 
Leave the dark city lights 
It's alright 'cause tonight's on me There were beggars and kings in a magical sky 
There were wings in the air, and I learned how to fly 
There was me, there was you, and then suddenly you were gone Moonlight lady 
Come along with me 
Leave the dark city lights 
It's alright 'cause tonight's on me Moo-moo-moo-moonlight lady 
Come along with me 
Leave the dark city lights 
It's alright 'cause tonight's on me Moo-moo-moo-moo-moonlight lady, yeah 
Come along with me 
Le-le-leave the dark city lights 
It's alright 'cause tonight's on me
