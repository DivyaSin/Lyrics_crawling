When I am losing 
When I am broken 
When I am sinking like a stone 
And it feels like I am alone 
I will worship You When I am so scared 
Life is unfair 
When I am tired to lose my way 
When I am feeling so ashamed 
I will worship You 
You are the anchor to my soul 
Draw me to you and soon it go 
Only love can make me whole 
Jesus I worship you 
Jesus I worship you When I am dancing 
When I am hopeful 
When I am feeling mercy's hand 
And I'm living life again 
I will worship you When chains are broken 
When heal it's coming 
When you will forgive me my heart 
This is my brand new start 
I will worship you, yeah You are the anchor to my soul 
Draw me to you and soon it go 
Only love can make me whole 
Jesus I worship you 
Jesus I worship you Halleluia 
Halleluia 
Halleluia 
I got to run 
You are the anchor to my soul 
Draw me to you and soon it go 
Only love can make me whole 
Jesus I worship you 
Jesus I worship you 
Jesus I worship you
