You've seen the world 
And all the glory 
Is what you want 
The what you need 
And when you go 
Uh, you're gonna find out 
All that you were 
Was left to me Wanderluster 
Wander yeah 
Wanderluster 
Wander yeah What you forget 
I still remember 
But far away 
Not long ago 
When you return uh 
I will be waiting 
In spite of all 
That's gone before Wanderluster 
Wander yeah

Wander yeah Wanderluster 
Wander yeah 
Wanderluster 
Wander yeah Wander luster
