I went to your house 
Walked up the stairs 
I opened your door 
Without ringing the bell I walked down the hall 
Into your room 
Where I could smell you And I shouldn't be here 
Without permission 
Shouldn't be here Would you forgive me, love 
If I danced in your shower? 
Would you forgive me, love 
If I laid in your bed? 
Would you forgive me, love 
If I stay all afternoon? I took off my clothes 
Put on your robe 
Went through your drawers 
And I found your cologne Went down to the den 
Found your Cs 
And I played your Joni And I shouldn't stay long 
You might be home soon 
I shouldn't stay long Would you forgive me, love 
If I danced in your shower? 
Would you forgive me, love 
If I laid in your bed? 
Would you forgive me, love 
If I stay all afternoon? I burned your incense 
I ran a bath 
I noticed a letter 
That sat on your desk It said, "Hello, love 
I love you so, love 
Meet me at midnight" And no, it wasn't my writing 
I better go soon 
It wasn't my writing So forgive me, love 
If I cry in your shower 
So forgive me, love 
For the salt in your bed 
So forgive me, love 
If I cry all afternoon
