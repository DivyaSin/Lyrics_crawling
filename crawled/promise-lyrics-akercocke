Draw near, partake of this altar 
For you are fairer in beauty 
Than other daughters of man 
Recognize and embrace 
This glorious proclamation 
Of eternal damnation Place your faith in sex and death 
Rather than the wisdom of the divine 
Have no pity for those 
Who mired in prophet delusion 
Content to be servile for a lifetime 
It is better to be king for a day Your passing will scant trace in history 
Wiped from memory like a forgotten dream 
Like sand slipping through fingers
