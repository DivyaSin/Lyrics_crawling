A dull and dreary day 
What else can you say? 
"Eustice, you're always such a bore" 
Why, thank you, Isadore" They say a door is nothing on its own 
It must lead somewhere 
I'd like to go somewhere We could go for a look-about in the attics and the closed rooms 
Find diaries and letters of long-dead distant lovers 
It'd be just like when we were children sneaking all around We wouldn't make a sound 
They'd beat us black and blue if we were found 
But they can't touch us now "Izzy, don't mean to be a bore but really Isadore 
You know these gray days make me blue 
I don't know what to do 
No, there's nothing I want to do" The dull and dreary day becomes a dark and stormy night 
Eustice, we could go outside and bottle fireflies 
Fairy lamps burn bright in the face of stormy night 
And the old black umbrella could keep us from all harm We could go to the lichyard and see what there's to see 
Maybe a cabal meets underneath the banyan trees 
It'd be just like when we were children sneaking all around We wouldn't make a sound 
We thought they'd reach out from their graves 
And drag us down but they don't scare us now "Izzy, don't mean to be a drag 
But I'll do no such thing, I'm staying in this chair. 
I'd probably break my neck falling in an open grave 
Or catch some horrid, fatal ache" "Oh Eustice, come with me, come outside 
It'll be all right"
