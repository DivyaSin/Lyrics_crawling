Runnin' down my batt - er- ies 
Layin' me out to rest 
Knowin' when that is 
Five hours 
I wake up and de-stress 
And I'm diggin' myself into a hole 
And these days I just work 
I will when I have so much sun CHORUS: 
And lately I've forgotten who I am 
Late - ely my energy's just drained away 
And now..my mind..is workin' overtime 
It's been a loooong day 
Such a long day, ...ay, ay mmm 
and while all my contempt 
For every...(all my friends say) 
I should take in college now 
My education is dragging, dragging 
innit 
My guitar to London town 
And the thing that wakes me 
when I could sleep instead 
Is the thought that to deny? 
That I could fall back into bed Chorus: 
And lately, I 've forgotten who I am 
Late - ely, my energy's just drained away 
And now...my mind....is workin' overtime 
It's been a looooooooooooooong day 
It's been a long day Recently my head 
It ain't recharged as such 
And sleep can only cure, yeah 
A restless mind so much Chorus: 
Lately I've forgotten who I am 
Sleep too late 
My energy's just drained away 
And now my mind is workin' overtime 
It's been a long day 
It's been a long long long day 
It's been a long long long day 
It's been a long day 
So long, so long, so loooooooooong
