If I stepped it off 
Walked outside your trance 
Crawled inside your mind 
And got my hands into your pants Wouldn't that beat all 
And wouldn't that be great 
Then all the things you do to me 
We could exaggerate Now everybody knows 
Or everybody wants to know 
The how's, the when's and whys 
Of how I said goodbye Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby, ooh baby Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby, ooh baby Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Ooh If I stepped it off 
Walked outside your trance 
Crawled inside your mind 
And got my hands into your pants Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby, ooh baby Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby, ooh baby Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh baby, ooh baby
