It's not easy 
No, it's not easy 
It's not easy breaking your heart 
It's not easy 
No, it's not easy 
It's not easy breaking your heart We were two dumb kids 
Full of grand ideas 
We knew this would end from the start 
From the fire we burned 
You and I we learned 
It's not easy breaking your heart It's not easy 
No, it's not easy 
It's not easy breaking your heart 
It's not easy 
No, it's not easy 
It's not easy breaking your heart Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh We were two dumb kids 
Full of hopes and fears 
Growing further and further apart 
So you shook your head 
Looked at me and said 
"It's not easy breaking your heart" It's not easy (it's not easy) 
No, it's not easy (it's not easy) 
It's not easy breaking your heart 
It's not easy (not easy) 
No, it's not easy 
It's not easy breaking your heart Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh We started small and conquered it all 
Came from nothing, but knew we would ball 
Some looked at us and said we would fall 
We tryna to do it big like no one done it before 
I remembered that hole in the wall 
Twelve of us in the bus, we was all going hard 
Waiting for hard work to pay off 
They'll come and take your spot if you take a day off It's not easy (no) 
No, it's not easy (no, it's not easy) 
It's not easy breaking your heart 
(I don't really wanna break your heart) 
It's not easy 
No, it's not easy 
It's not easy breaking your heart 
(I don't really wanna break your heart) Yeah, it's Young Khalifa man 
Gotta do what I gotta do 
To get where I'm going 
Haha, ain't nothin' gon' stop that 
We just gon' keep going and going 
(I don't really wanna break your heart) 
(I don't really wanna break your heart) 
(Please don't ever show anyone that, please)
