So light is her footfall 
She walks like a bird 
She's an angel 
Such a familiar stranger 
I wish i could help her 
she's in danger 
She's all alone alone alone alone alone alone 
all alone alone alone alone 
So light is her footfall 
She moves like a ghost 
And i lost her 
In the mist of dawn 
She's already gone 
And i miss her 
She's all alone alone alone alone alone alone 
all alone alone alone alone 
And i miss her 
And i miss her 
She's all alone alone alone alone alone alone 
all alone alone alone alone 
So light was her footfall 
So light was her footfall 
So light was her footfall 
So light was her footfall
