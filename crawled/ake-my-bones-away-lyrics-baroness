You lead the way, I'll follow 
You lead the way, I'll follow What was the plan here? 
I can't seem to stop 
Pissing and screaming from bottom to top. 
Picking up viscera, tendons and broken remains Did you feel another way 
Was it, my turn, or your's to say? 
Did you find another way? Take my bones away 
I'll find 'em everyday! 
Take my bones away 
I'll find 'em everyday! I took your advice and the requisite pills 
Forbidden pie from a white windowsill 
Swallowing caveats, Baphomet's breath and migraines 
Did I tell you don't come home? 
Why was your life not beginning to fall? 
Did I tell you don't come home? Take my bones away 
I'll find 'em everyday Take my bones away 
Take my bones away 
Take my bones away 
Take my bones away 
Take my bones away 
Take my bones away
