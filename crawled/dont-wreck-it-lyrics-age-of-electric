I could swear, I'm no smarter than a squirrel 
Feel safe asleep inside the violent squeals 
It's the way, the milky system turns 
In the fourth dimension, hiding three more meals 
Your creator cowers in the corner in my head 
This won't wreck me, this can't affect me 
Please don't wreck it, I feel fine 
Fine, fine yeah, fine, fine 
You said it was creepy, how we loved so instant 
You never grew up with trust, we just grew into dysfunction 
Sister grabbed my neck and said 
I know how to kill, breathe shallow 
What soul's bugging you?, need to fill every blank 
Please won't wreck me, please don't affect 
Please won't wreck me, I feel fine 
Fine, fine yeah, fine, fine 
Please won't wreck me, please don't wreck it for me 
Please don't wreck me, please don't wreck me 
Please don't, please don't, please don't wreck me 
I don't have much time left
