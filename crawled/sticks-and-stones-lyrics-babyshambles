Now here's a tale 
Tale I will tell 
Blood lust after no sweet love 
And a many, many things I do so well Oh you know that's the end 
That's the end so far away down They said that I was as good as dead 
And there was hope, but not for us together 
My friend, my only friend Oh well you know that that's the end 
And that's the end so far away down Skip... fame on the run 
Don't look back into the motherfucking sun, no 
Oh well you know that that's the end 
And that's the end so far away down Sticks and stones 
May break my bones 
Oh but your words 
They really kill me Sticks and sto-o-o-o-ones 
May break my bo-o-o-o-ones 
Sticks and stones may break my bones 
Oh but your words they really kill me And there you know that's the end 
But there can never be and end
