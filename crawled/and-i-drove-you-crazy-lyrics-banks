(And I drove you crazy) Even though I should of known 
It was a bad idea to love you 
All I wanted was to lift each other up 
All I wanted was to lift each other up 
I couldn't even find a date or navigate a way around you 
All I wanted was to lift each other up 
I never wanted you to hurt too much to touch What are you looking for 
Wanted to be your girl 
And anything you wanted 
Baby I tried to be What are you looking for 
Wanted to be your girl 
Any way you wanted me 
Baby I tried to be What are you looking for 
Wanted to be your girl 
And Any way you wanted me 
Baby I tried to be What are you looking for 
Wanted to be your girl 
And any way you wanted me 
Believe I tried to be (And I drove you crazy) Oh I see that looking back 
I know I blocked out all the red flags 
I should have seen that you would only mess me up 
I should have seen that I would only mess you up 
Oh I know you hurt, I know you hurt, I drove you crazy 
You should have seen that I'd only mess you up 
I should have seen eventually you would give up What are you looking for 
Wanted to be your girl 
And anything you wanted 
Baby I tried to be What are you looking for 
Wanted to be your girl 
And any way you wanted me 
Believe I tried to be (And I drove you crazy) (And I drove you)
