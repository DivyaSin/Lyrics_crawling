[Verse 1] 
I got my money up 
These women all down 
As soon as I touch down in they city 
Man, they all coming out 
They love me in New York 
And down South 
They know I'm from the Westside 
[?] [Chorus] 
Big kush, long money 
Bad girls, real niggas here with me 
Everywhere I go, you know I'm solid 
A1 with these girls, you know I'm solid 
[?] with my bros, you know I'm solid 
I guess you wouldn't know nothing 'bout it 
Oh, I'm solid 
Everywhere I go, your boy solid 
I guess you wouldn't know nothing 'bout it 
Big kush, long money 
Bad chicks, real niggas here with me [Verse 2] 
Snitching on your homies, that ain't solid 
Tricking, she ain't yours, that ain't solid 
She a minor in an Audi 
Wouldn't get that, that's a dollar 
She said, "Don't you got a million dollars?" 
I told her "Stay up out my pocket" 
[?] 
You can miss me with that [?] 
You ain't drop none on this [Chorus] 
Big kush, long money 
Bad girls, real niggas here with me 
Everywhere I go, you know I'm solid 
A1 with these girls, you know I'm solid 
Hunting with my bros, you know I'm solid 
I guess you wouldn't know nothing 'bout it 
Oh, I'm solid 
Everywhere I go, your boy solid 
I guess you wouldn't know nothing 'bout it 
Big kush, long money 
Bad chicks, real niggas here with me [Bridge] 
I got my money up 
These women all down 
And every time I touch down in they city 
Man, they all coming out 
Aye, they on the way 
Yeah, they on the way 
When they pull up, we gon' celebrate 
Celebrate, we gon' celebrate 
Hey, cause today was a good day [Chorus] 
Big kush, long money 
Bad chicks, real niggas here with me 
Everywhere I go, you know I'm solid 
A1 with these girls, you know I'm solid 
Hunting with my bros, you know I'm solid 
I guess you wouldn't know nothing 'bout it 
Oh, I'm solid 
Everywhere I go, you know I'm solid 
I guess you wouldn't know nothing 'bout it [Outro] 
Hello? Hello?
