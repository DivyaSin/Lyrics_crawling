I've seen it all before - time and time again 
As close as I would ever dare to be 
And yet without a doubt - I will disagree 
The sudden truth is no surprise to me I know there is no easy way 
I've said it from the start 
Sometimes you've got to live the life 
And feel the pain 
I hear a beat inside my head 
I feel it in my heart 
But just the thought of it is driving me insane 
It's tearing me apart I hear a distant voice - very far away 
I'm silent now - I don't know what to say 
I've felt a strong desire 
To set myself on fire 
I don't think that would work for me today
