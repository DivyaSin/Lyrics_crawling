Zoom, zoom in under my skin 
Gotta slow down now to begin 
Baby, don't rush, you can look, but don't touch 
You think you know 
When you see me in my videos 
How the story goes 
But that's just the side I expose 
Look through the lens 
You see my body, not who I am 
So don't pretend 
And try to act like you're my boyfriend 
You wanna get somewhere 
Then, boy, don't touch me there 
Just get up close and personal, personal Zoom, zoom in under my skin 
Gotta slow down now to begin 
Baby, don't rush, you can look, but don't touch 
Zoom, zoom 
In to my head 
Gotta know me to be my man 
Boy, prove your love 
You can look, but don't touch You won't behave 
You're getting all up in my face 
Barely know your name, you're tryin' to score 
But it's not a game 
Boy, get a clue, yeah 
You gotta spend the time 
Pay your dues following the rules if you want me to want to be with you 
You wanna get somewhere 
Then, boy, don't touch me there 
Just get up close and personal, personal Zoom, zoom in under my skin 
Gotta slow down now to begin 
Baby, don't rush, you can look, but don't touch 
Zoom, zoom 
In to my head 
Gotta know me to be my man 
Boy, prove your love 
You can look, but don't touch Don't you dare 
Touch me there 
If you want to get somewhere
