Don't use me; don't tease me. 
Don't hurt me; don't mess with my head. 
Don't flaunt me; don't laugh at me. 
Talk about me; or ignore what I said. Chorus: 
But you can treat me good, anytime you like. 
Ahow me some kindness if I'm lucky tonight. 
You can treat me good, anytime at all. 
A little caring's all I'm asking for. Don't trie me, lie to me. 
Patronise me, talk down to my friends. 
Don't neglect me, forget me. 
Be angry at me, say things to offend. Chorus: 
But you can treat me good, anytime you like. 
Show me some kindness if I fluke it right. 
You can treat me good, anytime at all. 
A little caring's all I'm asking for. Everytime I get home, you're suspicious of where I've been, and who I've seen. 
You're so jealous of any little thing that takes up my time. 
It don't have to be that way, baby! Don't hit me, frighten me. 
Threaten me, and order me around. 
Don't guilt me, pressure me. 
Make demands on me, keep putting me down. Chorus x 2
