you quench my needs with an open door. you build me up when there's nothing left, like someone else's secret, you told cause you believe it. and i'll be with you and i'll be with you, though all the world is crashing down, and nothing seems to work out anymore. oh, yeah, it's all about lovin' you. everybody needs someone to hold them close, make it all right. everybody needs someone to touch their lips, kiss them good night everybody needs someone, everybody needs someone, everybody needs someone, to hold them close, and make it all right...you're mouth gives life to my silent lips. i'm hanging on cause of your tight grip, and finally i'm living cause it feels like i'm flying. and i'll be with you, and i'll be with you, though all the world is crashing down, and nothing seems to work out anymore. oh, yeah, it's all about lovin' you.
