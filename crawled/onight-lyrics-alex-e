It's just you and I 
You're finally by my side 
You ain't going nowhere 
And no one will have to know 
You're here with me tonight 
Let's take our time 
'Cause deep in our hearts I know we'll find 
This moment's forever 
And we'll never lose 
The memory of tonight 
Let's close the door and turn out the light 
We'll live a million tales inside tonight 
I'll give you all I've got to give 
Tonight, let's stay inside tonight 
I'll hold you close with all my might 
Tonight, let's stay inside tonight 
When I shut my eyes 
It feels like you can read my mind 
Every touch, every moment 
It's what I need so much 
From you to me tonight 
The things you say now 
Have made me sure that now 
It will always be 
Just you and me 
Right here, right now, tonight 
Let's close the door and turn out the light 
We'll live a million tales inside tonight 
I'll give you all I've got to give 
Tonight, let's stay inside tonight 
I'll hold you close with all my might 
Tonight, let's stay inside tonight 
You lift me higher baby 
Than anything I know 
Let me show my love tonight 
Let's close the door and turn out the light 
We'll live a million tales inside tonight 
I'll give you all I've got to give 
Tonight, let's stay inside tonight 
I'll hold you close with all my might 
Tonight, let's stay inside tonight
