You are, you are a shining star 
I love you just the way you are The roads so fast so you will fall 
You know that youve already got it all It doesnt matter what you do 
It doesnt matter what you say 
I will love you Youre chasing after all the gold, uh oh 
But even now your heart is cold, uh oh 
To gain the world but lose your soul 
Well I dont need to weigh it up to know It doesnt matter what you do 
It doesnt matter what you say 
I will love you 
It doesnt matter if you fall 
It doesnt matter if you run away 
I will love you All these lines upon your face 
So scared to live without a trace 
Tried to outrun the setting sun 
But theres enough for everyone 
You could keep digging up china oh 
But you would never find it no no 
Searching so hard for your happiness 
But its not where you think it is It doesnt matter what you do 
It doesnt matter what you say 
I will love you 
It doesnt matter if you fall 
It doesnt matter if you run away 
I will love you It doesnt matter what you do 
It doesnt matter what you say 
Cos I will love you 
It doesnt matter if you fall 
Or if you run away 
I will love you It doesnt matter 
It doesnt matter 
It doesnt matter 
It doesnt matter 
It doesnt matter 
Ooooooooooooh oh 
It doesnt matter 
It doesnt matter 
It doesnt matter 
It doesnt matter 
It doesnt matter 
Ooooooooooooh oh You are, you are, a shining star 
You are, you are, a shining star 
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are 
You are, a shining star
