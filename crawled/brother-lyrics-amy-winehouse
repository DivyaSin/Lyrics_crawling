Brother 
There's so much that I could never say to your face 
Bye, bye now 
You should know the world and all its ways so find your place How do I find words that do not condescend 
When she bore you before me 
'Cause she doesn't need a child, she needs a friend 
A son not a sob story (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you) 
And your priority, it must be heard 
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you) 
'Cause we'll never be the way we were She can't always be there just to hold you down 
Our mother 
When you are at a age now well life turns around 
My brother Realize that you don't have to answer to no man 
Responsibility comes down to you 
But how can I expect you to understand 
When you live life like its so run through (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you) 
Your priority, it must be heard 
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you) 
'Cause we'll never be the way we were (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you) 
And your priority, it must be heard 
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you) 
'Cause we'll never be the way we were The way we were, we'll never be 
And your priority, it must be heard
