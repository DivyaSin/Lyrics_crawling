Whenever the day since been lonely 
Can't turn this feeling away 
I looked around you was gone 
And I love you I'm up all night again outta my head 
Slippin' and slidin' on a downhill ride 
And I'm going down slow and what do you know? 
I love you All alone, livin' my bed 
I can't seem to get you outta my head 
Don't look back 
There's nothin' I can do without you. Well, I'm lonely for your love 
Lonely for your love 
I'm lonely for your love at night All right. All alone, lyin' my bed 
I can't seem to get you outta my head 
Don't look back 
There's nothin' I can do but I love you, I love ya Well, I'm lonely for your love 
I'm lonely for your love 
I'm lonely for your love 
Well, I'm lonely for your love 
I'm lonely for your love 
I'm lonely for your love at night All right! I'm lonely, you know I"m lonely 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
So lonely for your love I'm lonely for your love
