2BiC that's right, it's your girl Ailee 
Now I want y'all to listen up you ready? 
No matter how much you hold onto me, I won't return 
Your cheating tendencies will never be fixed 
You loving me is a convicted crime, separation is innocence 
I am tortured all night, a sad anguish 
The end of an eternal love, rest in peace, forgotten 
As much as we loved, our knot is tighter 
Now it's the very bottom, so it's sadder 
The end of love isn't beautiful like this, bye 
With cold words, you say you'll leave me when there isn't any other person like me 
Baby, your body temperature was so warm 
But why do you keep acting cold toward me? 
Please my baby I can't let you go 
Day by day, I need you by my side 
Because I am loving you, because I am loving you 
So I'm kneeling before you and begging like this 
Why are you pushing me out, making my heart hurt? 
Please come back to me 
You're the one who said you loved me with your own lips 
Baby, I can't go on without you no matter how much I think about it 
Without you, I can't explain myself 
Please my baby I can't let you go 
Day by day, I need you by my side 
Because I am loving you, because I am loving you 
So I'm kneeling before you and begging like this 
Why are you pushing me out, making my heart hurt? 
Please come back to me 
Now I don't like your touch on my body 
Don't ever look for me again 
You're my first and last love 
Please don't leave my arms 
Hands off, back off, I'm gone tonight 
Because I am loving you, because I am loving you 
My tears flow so I can't see you 
The one love and the one separation 
To me, it was only you
