Don't blow no bubbles 
don't blow no troubles In time before there was no cure 
Now through his will it's healed for sure 
(TRASH PITS, TRASH PITS, TRASH PITS) Away!! 
It's not the weather, we've got P.M.A. We know you can do anything 
and no thought withheld from thee 
So here I beseech thee 
to always request and declare Don't blow no bubbles 
Don't blow no troubles 
There's got to be a better way 
Don't blow no spikes 
Ask Jah and he'll make the change We know you can do anything 
and no thought withheld from thee 
So here I beseech thee 
to always request and declare We know you can do anything 
and no thought withheld from thee 
So here I beseech thee 
to always request and declare Don't blow no bubbles (and we can stop the AIDS) 
Don't blow no spikes 
Don't blow no fudge buns 
Ask Jah and he'll make the change We know you can do anything 
and no thought withheld from thee 
So here I and I said to thee 
to always request and declare
