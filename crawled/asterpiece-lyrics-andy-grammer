Life is a canvas, a painting in my mind 
Colors stay and spill outside the lines 
I refuse to settle, never the black and white 
Rock the neons until the day I die 
I'm on a constant search to make my heart swell 
Bite off too much, chew like hell 
Half my nights spent in a hotel 
Price I pay to escape the conveyor belt One, you get one heartbeat so take it seriously 
This is your masterpiece, don't forget to dream 
And taste the colors in the air you breathe 
It's your masterpiece, go ahead and fill it all 
Don't stop til it is beautiful 
Don't stop til it is beautiful 
Don't stop til it is beautiful Close my eyelids, take a deep breath 
Feel the lightning down in my chest 
I'm just a piece of art and the paint's fresh 
'Cause I'm not near finished yet 
I've got a pregnant mind that wants to give birth 
Breathe life into these big words 
I can hear the universe, in my ears she whispers. One, you get one heartbeat so take it seriously 
This is your masterpiece, don't forget to dream 
And taste the colors in the air you breathe 
It's your masterpiece, go ahead and fill it all 
Don't stop til it is beautiful 
Don't stop til it is beautiful 
Don't stop til it is beautiful And if you settle for a normal life 
Say you're afraid of heights 
But you were meant to light the sky This is your masterpiece, don't forget to dream 
And taste the colors in the air you breathe 
This is your masterpiece, go ahead and fill it all 
Don't stop til it is beautiful 
Don't stop til it is beautiful 
Don't stop til it is beautiful 
Don't stop til it is beautiful 
Don't stop til it is beautiful
