I let it all in and I let it all out 
People don't understand what this is about 
Now I know that everything they said was a lie 
We feel so alive but every day we die 
One by one these days pass by 
But not too many people think to ask why 
Say goodbye, this can't be for nothin 
Nowhere to go but you know they're hidin something 
I play the game that I'm meant to fail 
But the game is rigged on a larger scale 
It took you so long and you got so far 
Now you know you're wrong but not who you are 
You try to find out but you get no where 
Life's not fair you won't find it here 
So, tell me are you ready to jump 
To tell the whole world you don't give a fuck Chorus 
I think I scared em away 
I think I let them down 
You're gonna hate me now you're gonna hate me 
I think I gave em a reason never come around 
You're gonna hate me now you're gonna hate me Built like a machine, brought to the scene 
Told to make friends and succeed that's not reality 
Open them up, and see man, lies man cries man, don't you close your eyes man, the truth man, the Proof man, it's right where you stand man, where you stand man 
All you crazy mother fuckers saying fucker you crazy 
Ever since a baby 
Rocking the label right from the cradle I was told a fable 
I'm looking at you and your wearing a disguise 
You're a product of tradition I can see it in yours 
And the people will ask the questions and need the answers 
Spreading like disease counter please so we can get somewhere 
Who wants to live where, there's no greed where 
The visions not clear where everybody's scared there 
Scared of the mind controlling matter 
These pessimistic ways suck don't be flattered 
Built to last 
You're a punk 
Ya, look at them chains 
Hiding in the shadows but I'm seeing everything 
I'm the outlaw, better run and hide 
I'm a loner fuck Bonny, just Clyde, lets ride I think I scared em away 
I think I let them down 
You're gonna hate me now you're gonna hate me 
I think I gave em a reason never come around 
You're gonna hate me now you're gonna hate me
