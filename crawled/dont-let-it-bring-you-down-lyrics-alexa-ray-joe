Old man lyin' by the side of the road 
Where the lorries rollin' by 
Blue moon sinkin' from the weight of the load 
And the buildings scrape the sky Cold wind rippin' on the valley at dawn 
And the morning paper flies 
Dead man lyin' by the side of the road 
With the daylight in his eyes Don't let it bring you down 
It's only castle's burning 
Find someone who's turning 
And you will come around Blind man runnin' through the light of the night 
With an answer in his hand 
Come on down to the river of sight 
And you can really understand Red lights flashin' through the window in the rain 
Can you hear the sirens moan 
White cane lyin' in a gutter in the lane 
And you're walkin' home alone Don't let it bring you down 
It's only castle's burning 
Find someone who's turning 
And you will come around Don't let it bring you down 
It's only castle's burning 
Find someone who's turning 
And you will come around Old man lyin' by the side of the road 
Where the lorries rollin' by 
Blue moon sinkin' from the weight of the load 
And the buildings scrape the sky Cold wind rippin' on the valley at dawn 
And the morning paper flies 
Dead man lyin' by the side of the road 
With the daylight in his eyes Don't let it bring you down 
It's only castle's burning 
Find someone who's turning 
And you will come around 
You will come around Don't let it bring you down 
It's only castle's burning 
Find someone who's turning 
And you will come around
