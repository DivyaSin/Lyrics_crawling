Hey 
I heard it from the state 
They told me you were never gonna let me get away 
And if you tell me fiction, you will never get me back 
I had to get away, I had to get away, ay, ay 
Hey 
You try to compensate 
You thinking with your one brain, watch you decapitate 
You show me all your letters and I should've confiscated 
Put my eyes away, and I had to get away Talking to ears that have been deaf for as long as I can remember 
A self-medicated handicap so I speak to myself 
And I try so hard to get his stupid deaf ears to hear 
That have become illiterate, I've become dumb 
Hey, hey, hey When I'd come through 
You were dark blue 
And I saved you 
From your darker days 
Born to 
Take care of you 
Oh, I thought so 
Baby, it was just a phase Hey 
I heard it from the state 
They told me you were never gonna let me get away 
And if you tell me fiction, you will never get me back 
I had to get away, I had to get away, I had to get away 
Hey 
You try to compensate 
You thinking with your one brain, watch you decapitate 
You show me all your letters and I should've confiscated 
Put my eyes away, and I had to get away Shut down by a guy I never wanted to kiss 
Not gonna hear this singing of this ringing triumph thing 
And I'm chugging along in a train 
And I'm heading the wrong way, and I'm a trainwreck 
And my heart goes beat, beat, beat to the music of this sad same song 
It's quite depressing, there's no fixing to the problem 
When you're talking to an idiot When I'd come through 
You were dark blue 
And I saved you 
From your darker days 
Born to 
Take care of you 
Oh, I thought so 
Baby, it was just a phase 
Saving 
Only made me 
Just a dreamer 
But I soon found out 
That the traintracks 
Were behind me 
Tried to warn me 
Oh, but my ears went out When I'd come through 
You were dark blue 
And I saved you 
From your darker days 
Born to 
Take care of you 
Oh, I thought so 
Baby, it was just a phase Hey 
I heard it from the state 
They told me you were never gonna let me get away 
And if you tell me fiction, you will never get me back 
I had to get away, I had to get away, I had to get away 
Hey 
You try to compensate 
You thinking with your one brain, watch you decapitate 
You show me all your letters and I should've confiscated 
Put my eyes away, and I had to get away
