I know a girl with a broken smile 
He's been hurting her for quite a while 
But she loves him 
She still loves him 
I've got a friend with a heart of gold 
He loved his wife even when he was told 
She's unfaithful 
He's still faithful I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow 
It doesn't make much sense but i'd like to know Why do good things happen to bad people 
Bad people 
Don't deserve it 
Why do bad things happen to good people 
Good people 
Don't deserve it I've seen a man working all his life 
Lose his job to a new device 
Still he's grateful 
Yeah, he's grateful 
I know somebody who's got all they need 
Who built an empire stepping on the weak 
Still ungrateful 
So ungrateful I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow 
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know Why do good things happen to bad people 
Bad people 
don't deserve it 
Why do bad things happen to good people 
Good people 
Don't deserve it Who decides this? 
It seems so unfair 
Is there somebody somebody out there? 
Who decides this? 
Does anyone care 
Is there somebody 
Sombody out there? Why do good things happen to bad people 
Bad people 
Don't deserve it 
Why do bad things happen to good people 
Good people 
Don't deserve it
