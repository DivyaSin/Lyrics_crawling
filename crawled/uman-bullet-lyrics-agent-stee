White light, mission classified 
Neural probe, map your mind target 
Run the maze, my loyal pet 
Recall your orders and the rest forget (You are close) 
So close to the perfect crime 
A human bullet in a chambered mind 
An appetite for profanity 
Everything you were made to be Fracturing the pristine mind 
Crack the shell and reach inside 
Manipulating all we find to do or die Conflict borne of man machines 
Solidifies our chosen scheme 
It's so much more than what 
It seems behind your eyes White light, falling star 
The you, you knew is now the slave you are 
(Dancing) 
To a dirge that sings within 
A waltz of damage just beneath the skin 
(Rhythmic death) Death tapped out by your puppet toes 
Another current in the undertow 
Below the waves we weave the curse 
To drown the world and choke the earth Assembling the fractured mind 
Puzzle equals suicide 
Create the killer from inside 
Some dreams must die Slaughtering ability 
Bred in you through trickery 
Surrender blindly, slake our greed 
And stain the skies (Dominate) 
Until we hear their cries 
(Dominate) 
While they believe our lies 
(Dominate) 
Salt and twist the knife 
(Dominate) 
Until the wound is ripe Above theocracy, we reign 
Sharing death, bearing pain 
In God's name all the heretics must die Behind democracy, we rule 
And communists we use as tools 
All the world's devoted to our crime 
And still we trust our minds We reign 
[Incomprehensible] Above theocracy, we reign 
Sharing death, bearing pain 
In God's name all the heretics must die Behind democracy, we rule 
And communists we use as tools 
All the world's devoted to our crime Behind theocracy, we reign 
Sharing death, bearing pain 
In God's name all the heretics must die Above democracy, we rule 
And communists we use as tools 
All the world's devoted to our crime 
And still we trust our minds, we trust our minds
