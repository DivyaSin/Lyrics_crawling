Chorus 
It is real, as real as it seem 
Don't you live on illusion 
And don't you ever try to live a dream 
I sing... Buju say how could you rise up every living day 
Telling yourself everything is OK 
When you look at life you'll see it slipping away 
Lord knows who feels it every moment every day Those why cry for the poor get neglected, rejected, put to death 
How much more will we take? 
Did you father work off his shirt, blood, sweat and tears 
Don't tell me that you forgot 
Being oppressed by the oppressors, all different types of stress 
For the sorrows of the poor, they don't even care less 
Refuse to deal with world atrocities, civil unrest 
Instead they're building penitentiaries as big as a bird's nest 
Saying we are to be blamed for whatever what mess Chorus Some say, how are you going? They want to know if we are mine 
Not until we reposess what's rightfully mine 
Sitting down for so long we do belive it is time 
Everyone is entitled to food at mealtime 
'Til then, we'll struggle for rights, no more racial fights 
Degradation to the highest heights 
All obstacles as a people we have to cross 
With health and strength we all can get across 
Happenings of yesterday are just a thing of the past Chorus Don't you cry little one, wipe your tears, sing my song 
Though we're in a strange land with evil ones 
Help the weak if you're strong, iron sharpens iron 
When you're down take a look at where the help is coming from 
What about the masterminds with the foolproof plans 
What about the geniuses who achieve grade one 
Chorus Repeat verse 1 and verse 2
