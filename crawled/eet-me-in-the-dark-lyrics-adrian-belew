When the sun comes up 
In the nuclear sky 
And the life we had 
Has blown up and died 
We will shed no tear, 
We will skip no beat 
And we will walk right down 
The middle of the street So let the power fail 
Let there be no doubt 
I wanna be with you When the sun melts down 
And the night goes black 
We will take down the flag 
And never look back 
We will break no law, 
We will be the law 
And go hand in hand 
Into the face of it all
