Now the story's out 
I see how it's been 
You've been living it up 
While I've been lost in a dream 
Said you were faithful 
I believed your lies 
I have been your fool 
But now it's me who's got wise All the while I gave to you my heart and soul 
You just left me out in the cold I've been blind 
I've been taken for a ride 
You used me and you lied 
But somehow I didn't see 
I've been blind 
While you were my lover 
You said there was no other 
As you cheated on me So long have I waited 
Just to learn the truth 
So humiliated by the things that you do 
Fooled by your deception 
Tricked by your disguise 
Never saw the secrets 
That were there in you eyes All the while I gave to you my heart and soul 
You just left me out in the cold I closed my eyes, I fell asleep and I dreamed... 
I dreamed of perfect love , pure and true 
I dreamed of perfect love for me and you 
But the while I gave to you my heart and soul 
You just left me out in the cold
