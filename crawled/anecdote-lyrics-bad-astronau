A thousand indecisions 
launched from the table for one 
lately they've been killing me 
they were left unsung 
I desire stop motion sickness 
the potion in your breath companionment 
abandonment death a thousand insecurities 
dumped forever dumped endeavors 
I awakened by the laugh comfort 
in your sound whatever 
I enamored by your smile 
you put the words right 
into my mouth 
I love my antidote to death almost 
died twice today 
I wait on you to bail me 
like everyone else 
I confess lay my leery head on your chest 
give you everything I never had
