He says his love for me could never die 
But that'd change if he ever found out about you and i Oh - but his love is cold 
It wouldn't hurt him if he didn't know, cause... When it gets too much 
I need to feel your touch Im gonna run to you 
Im gonna run to you 
Cause when the feelins right Im gonna run all night 
Im gonna run to you 
He's got a heart of gold he'd never let me down 
But you're the one that always turns me on 
You keep me comin round I know his love is true 
But its so damn easy makin love to you I got my mind made up 
I need to feel your touch Im gonna run to you 
Ya - Im gonna run to you 
Cause when the feelins right Im gonna stay all night Im gonna run to you 
Yeah! 
Im gonna run to you 
Oh when the feelins right Im gonna run all night 
Im gonna run to you.
