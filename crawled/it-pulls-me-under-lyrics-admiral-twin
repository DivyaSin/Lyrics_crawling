It's that way with me sometimes 
When I catch a fever, tripping starry-eyed over a face 
In a lonely dim caf?br> I can stare for hours (only minutes relatively) 
I hate that feeling when it comes 
It suckse down 
I love that feeling when I'm there 
It pulls me, pulls me under I'm corn yellow at the core 
I seem steady but I'm riding on another train 
And she can take me far away 
Days and days away (but nowhere in particular) 
I hate that feeling when it comes 
It suckse down 
I love that feeling when I'm there 
It pulls me, pulls me under I know you 
I've been down before 
Down your street 
I barely made it home There last night it was so sad 
I was hazing like a trail behind a jet 
And then I caught a smile that she threw 
I was blissful (but she left with someone right behind me) 
I hate that feeling when it comes 
It suckse down 
I love that feeling when I'm there 
It pulls me, pulls me under
