Heaven knows which way 
I was blinded by your ways 
My foolish heart told me that I could own your mind 
But you would never see the day 
And I could not conceive you to be so unkind 
You never understand together we can fall from grace 
I offered you the promised land you laughed 
And threw it in my face 
I need you to take my hand and lead me from this empty place 
Heaven knows which way 
Heaven knows your heart's desire 
And heaven knows how you have cried when you're alone 
But you can never quench the fire 
A fire that burns within me
