Agust D Lyrics English they call me new thang here's some stuff from a new recruit, so get 'em 
whole world, concert we quite fly Asiana Asia 
you could be my new thang nothing like those lazy bros 
revolt from a celebrity, damn only the strong can mess with me some say I made it too easy 
fuck you I'm a pain in yo' ass too far from the sugar 
to be honest "SSaihanuwar" is embarrassing now I sell half million a year 
this k-pop category ain't enough size for me whoo yea if you wanna go faster then make a reservation for a first class 
my seat is business you economy always behind me and kissing my ass 
next up is the Billboard 
Brazil to New York I'm about to burn this passport A to the G to the U to the STD 
I'm d boy because I'm from D 
I'm a freak lunatic on the beat 
I rap and ya'll get turned on by ma tongue technology A to the G to the U to the STD x 3 
ya'll get turned on by ma tongue technology I haunt down those who copy the copiers get 'em down no matter who the fuck they are 
a bum or a wack and I fack and I carve the history on this ground 
rappers so beat I always get to fat dick 'em 
me so fly bros are sick of me jealousy and whining making all this noise hey ho I don't give a fuck when you fuck around 
you simply dig a hole to bury yourself alive 
hey ho you can't take me 
all ya fried rappers should be thankful for I am an idol cause I'm busy I'm busy 24/7 uh uh don't need no break 
go have some fun among you latecomers 
jealous and childish you scream yet you don't know shit 
paris to new york damn ain't got no empty slot in my calendar A to the G to the U to the STD 
I'm d boy because I'm from D 
I'm a freak lunatic on the beat 
I rap and ya'll get turned on by ma tongue technology A to the G to the U to the STD x 3 
ya'll get turned on by ma tongue technology I'm sorry I mean it I am 
It's me who took your shit sorry boy 
I'm sorry watch the anger
