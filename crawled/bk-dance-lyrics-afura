Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move and nobody get hurt Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move and nobody get hurt I'm not a bad boy or a rude boy blood spiller 
Notice how I touch the microphone like gorillas 
Dressed in all white, sparking up my tire 
It's Brooklyn dance y'all that have me in a trance y'all I slid my way, right up in a jam 
Skated on the dance floor like I was Peter Pan 
Put style's together, I inspired Dapper Dan 
Plus I'm down with the Wu-Tang Clan No bodyguards, I'm just a dred rolling dolo 
Looking for an empress and not a ho, yo 
I made my way to the bar, the DJ shouted me out 
To kick that Shogun slogan I ordered Hennessey mixed with Captain Morgan's 
And made my way right to the booth, to bust a flow son Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move and nobody get hurt And all my big body medium and slim body Chaka queens 
A hip hop nigga rocking in reggae scene 
Arms out, skin out, synchronized as he rock to the beat 
And can you stand the heat And can you wind your waist without moving your feet 
And if you don't like sweating, you should take a seat 
Yeah, yeah, I mixed it out with my homey, Robbie Gandis 
Pulling a cigar from Havana, like a don dada While lil' ma's eyein' me up in the corner 
I talk to bartender and order two corona's 
I slid on over, the way she look made me sober 
'cause I'm a smooth brother, yeah, I kept my composure 
We danced all night to guess what the drama 
It couldn't be a Brooklyn dance without no drama Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move and nobody get hurt Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move and nobody get hurt One shot, two shot, rat-a-tat, tat-a-tat-tat 
I grab the hand and we jetted out the spot 
It was a beef between a Yankee boy and Jamerican 
The whole crowd spread out in a hurry, shit I held a taxi and hopped up in the backseat 
He told the driver, 550 Jay Street 
And by the way, I'm taking you with me 
'cause I, I really really like the way you MC Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, I didn't really know you like me 
Now we both fixing on the party 
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo but you can parle with me 
'cause that's the way I like things to be, aiyo Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt, yeah 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move and nobody get hurt Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt, yeah 
Nobody move and nobody get hurt
