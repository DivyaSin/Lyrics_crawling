It's so strange he doesn't show me more affection than he needs 
Almost formal, too respectful, never takes romantic leads 
There are times when I imagine I'm not always on his mind 
He's not thinking what I'm thinking, always half a step behind 
Always half a step behind I'm in every kind of trouble, can't you tell, just look at me 
Half ecstatic, half dejected, all in all I'm all at sea 
Easy terms I thought I wanted, fill me now with chilling dread 
You can never know the chaos, of a life turned on it's head 
Of a life turned on it's head I am certain that I love him but a love can be misplaced 
Have I compromised my people in my passion and my haste? 
I could be his life companion, anywhere but where we are 
Am I a leader? Am I a traitor? Did I take a step to far? 
Did I take a step to far? Did I take a step to far? I am certain that I love him but a love can be misplaced 
Did I take a step to far? 
So strange he doesn't show me more affection than he needs 
Did I take a step to far? I am certain that I love him but a love can be misplaced 
Did I take a step to far?
