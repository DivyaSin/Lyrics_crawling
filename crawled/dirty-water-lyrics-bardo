I never thought that you could be that way 
Friends from young and now you've changed 
Love and trust has turned to hate 
If I'd have known you'd do me over 
Deceiving me in a big way 
I never thought that you'd betray Why did I bother 
Shouldn't have bothered 
Trying to keep my cool with you 
Tellin' lies I could not see through 
Why did I bother 
Shouldn't have bothered 
Like sisters I would kill for you 
Now I know your words are not true And you can't spend all of your time 
Dirty water on your mind 
Ya can't see through unless it's blue 
The bottom of dirty water 
You're like the devil in disguise 
Double faced and tellin' lies 
Ya can't see through unless it's blue 
The bottom of dirty water As evil thoughts dwell in your soul 
Grinding your mind into a hole 
Filled with spite and tension 
You give me nothin' but deception 
What's more to say that's not much more 
Could it be like just before? Why did I bother 
Shouldn't have bothered 
I was blinded like a fool thinking that those lies were true 
Why did I bother 
Shouldn't have bothered 
Only thing can make me say 
Stay the hell away from me Now you can't spend all of your time 
Dirty water on your mind 
Ya can't see through unless it's blue 
The bottom of dirty water 
You're like the devil in disguise 
Double faced and tellin' lies 
Ya can't see through unless it's blue 
The bottom of dirty water x2 That's the end of your game 
And it's always the same 
Life's come to a stop and you flow to the top 
Through the shadows of dirty water On your mind dirty water 
All the time dirty water 
On your mind dirty water 
All the time dirty water Now you can't spend all of your time 
Dirty water on your mind 
Ya can't see through unless it's blue 
The bottom of dirty water 
You're like the devil in disguise 
Double faced and tellin' lies 
Ya can't see through unless it's blue 
The bottom of dirty water
