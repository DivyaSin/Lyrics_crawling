It's coming down... 
Millions in the black 
Lose sight of the road that's ahead 
Psycho in 308 
Black or white? 
Suffer for a world of silence Is home a world of chaos? 
Everybody's lost their own way 
Is home a world of sadness? 
Everybody's lost their own way Thousands of tears 
Take in your tears
