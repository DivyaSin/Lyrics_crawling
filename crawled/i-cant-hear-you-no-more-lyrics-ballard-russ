First you break it up, but I knew you'd come running 
You'd want to make it up, I can't hear you no more 
Now you know what it's like, and I can watch you begging 
Like I was begging to you, like I did before I can't hear you no more, I can't hear you no more, I won't come running again 
I can't hear you no more, no it ain't like before, I'm learning to live again 
Ain't I the one who called, when you stood so near me 
You didn't hear me then, I can't hear you no more Now you know what it's like, and I can watch you begging 
Like I was begging to you, like I did before 
I can't hear you no more, I can't hear you no more, I won't come running again 
I can't hear you no more, no it ain't like before I'm learning to live, learning to live, learning to live again 
For too long you played a part, now it's lost the mystery 
But no more can I hold on, I'm breaking the chains that tie me, yeah I can't hear you no more, no it ain't like before 
See me walk out the door, I can't hear you no more 
I can't hear you no more, I can't hear you no more 
I won't come running, I won't come running, I won't come running again I can't hear you no more, no it ain't like before 
See me walk out the door, I can't hear you no more 
(repeats out) When you stood so near me, you couldn't even hear me - that's all I should say
