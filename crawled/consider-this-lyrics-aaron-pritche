Things don't always work out like you plan 
But you can't let that hold you back from tryin' again 
I've been fallin' for you, you need not fear 
I've got this propsition I think you should hear 
Consider this, living life together 
Consider this, seeing the world 
Consider this, building a home of our own, a front porch, picket fence and 3 kids 
Girl you and I we can't miss 
Consider this 
Consider this 
Everyday is a new day, take it as it comes 
Theres a world out there waiting so seize it and run 
You've got nothin' to lose, and everything to gain 
Won't you please consider what my heart has to say 
Consider this, living life together 
Consider this, seeing the world 
Consider this, building a home of our own, a front porch, picket fence and 3 kids 
Girl you and I we can't miss 
Consider this 
We can watch every sunset 
Every storm roll in over the shore 
Through the good and the bad girl we'll have our love 
This could be everything you've dreamed of and more 
Consider this, living life together 
Consider this, seeing the world 
Consider this, building a home of our own, a front porch, picket fence and 3 kids 
Girl you and I we can't miss 
Consider this 
Consider this 
Consider this.. seein the world 
Consider this.. buildin a home 
Consider this.. a front porch, picket fence 
Consider this.. 3 kids 
Consider this.. maybe 2 kids 
Consider this.. every sunset 
Consider this.. every storm
