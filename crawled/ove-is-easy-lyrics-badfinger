All that I needed was your smile 
Sayin' all right, I don't mind 
All that I wanted was my chance 
Maybe I could learn to dance Love is easy, love is strange 
Different people, different games 
People, people, love a lot 
Feel the love inside your heart Love is easy, easy 
When you open up your heart 
I said easy, easy 
When you know you'll never part Love is easy, love is strange 
Different people, different games 
People, people, love a lot 
Feel the love inside your heart Love is, love is easy, so easy 
When you open up your heart 
Easy, easy When you know you'll never part 
I said easy, Lord, easy 
When you open up your heart 
I said easy, easy 
When you know you'll never part 
I said easy, easy
