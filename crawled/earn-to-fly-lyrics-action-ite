I've been waiting for something beautiful, 
Fire from a spark, from a spark, in the dark, in the dark. 
I've spent all my life, trying to touch the sky 
Looking where I'm at, where I'm at, don't look back, don't look back 
And when the sun sets into a sun rise, I need a new direction. 
Let's figure this out, just give me some time, 
You know that I'll come back again. Gotta let me go, gotta let me down now, down now, 
Gotta let me go, let me learn to fly, fly, fly 
Gotta let me go, let me learn to fly. Somewhere in the clouds, I can see it now, 
right where I belong, I belong, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong. 
I wish you could be flying next to me, 
both feet off the ground, off the ground, don't look down, don't look down. 
And when the sun sets into a sun rise, I need a new direction. 
Let's figure this out, just give me some time, 
You know that I'll come back again. Gotta let me go, gotta let me down now, down now, 
Gotta let me go, let me learn to fly, fly, fly 
Gotta let me go, let me learn to fly. And you can take it all, take it all back. 
I'd give everything, everything I had. 
All I had. 
Yeah! Gotta let me go, gotta let me down now, down now, 
Gotta let me go, let me learn to fly, fly, fly 
Gotta let me go, let me learn to fly. Gotta let me go, gotta let me down now, down now, 
Gotta let me go, let me learn to fly, fly, fly 
Gotta let me go, let me learn to fly. (hey, ho, hey) Gotta let me go, let me learn to, let me go, let me learn to fly.
