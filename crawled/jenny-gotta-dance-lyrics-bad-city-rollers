Looks like an angel dances like a devil 
Jenny ah 
ah Who's that movin' and a groovin' on the dance floor 
Jenny 
Doin' it doin' it give it to me once more 
Jenny 
Half a woman 
half a child see her more just drives me wild 
Jenny 
Jenny 
Dressed in jeans and too tight T-shirt 
(Jenny) 
You better watch out baby 
you might be hurt 
(Jenny) 
She knows that she turns 'em on 
She don't care she'll just dance on 
And on and on. When she hears Rock'n'Roll tearing her heart and soul 
Jenny 
Jenny 
Jenny gotta dance 
Give her a Rockin' Beat and she'll be on her feet 
Jenny 
Jenny Jenny gotta dance just look at her dance. Looks like an angel dances like a devil 
Jenny ah ah See her movin' in and out with her hips now 
(Jenny) 
Look at the way she can pout with her lips now 
(Jenny) 
Long black hair and flashing eyes she can really hypnotise 
Dance dance dance When she hears Rock'n'Roll tearing her heart and soul . . . 
Dance dance dance
