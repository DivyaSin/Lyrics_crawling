Sailor 1: 
I smell women 
Smell 'em in the air 
Think I'll drop my anchor 
In that harbor over there Sailor 2: 
Lovely ladies 
Smell 'em through the smoke 
Seven days at sea 
Can make you hungry for a poke Sailor 3: 
Even stokers need a little stoke! Whores: 
Lovely ladies 
Waiting for a bite 
Waiting for the customer 
Who only comes at night 
Lovely ladies 
Waiting for the call 
Standing up or lying down 
Or any way at all 
Bargain prices up against the wall Old Woman: 
Come here, my dear 
Let's see this trinket you wear 
This bagatelle... Fantine: 
Madame, I'll sell it to you... Old Woman: 
I'll give you four Fantine: 
That wouldn't pay for the chain Old Woman: 
I'll give you five, you're far to eager to sell, it's up to you. Fantine: 
It's all I have Old Woman: 
That's not my fault Fantine: 
Please make it ten Old Woman: 
No more than five 
My dear, we all must stay alive! Whores: 
Lovely ladies 
Waiting in the dark 
Ready for a thick one 
Or a quick one in the park Whore 1: 
Long time short time 
Any time, my dear 
Cost a little extra if you want to take all year! Whores: 
Quick and cheap is underneath the pier! Crone: 
What pretty hair 
What pretty locks you got there 
What luck you got, it's worth a centime my dear 
I'll take the lot Fantine: 
Don't touch me leave me alone Crone: 
Let's make a price, I'll give you all of ten francs 
Just think of that! Fantine: 
It pays a debt Crone: 
Just think of that Fantine: 
What can I do? It pays a debt. 
Ten francs may save my poor Cosette! Sailors: 
Lovely lady! 
Fastest on the street 
Wasn't there three minutes 
She was back up on her feet 
Lovely lady! 
What yer waiting for? 
Doesn't take a lot of savvy 
Just to be a whore 
Come on, lady 
What's a lady for? Whores: (in counterpoint) 
Lovely ladies 
Lovely little girls 
Lovely ladies 
Lovely little ladies 
Lovely girlies 
Lovely little girls 
We are lovely, lovely girls 
Lovely ladies 
What's a lady for? (Fantine re-emerges, her long hair cut short.) Pimp: 
Give me the dirt, who's that bit over there? Whore 1: 
A bit of skirt, she's the one sold her hair. Whore 2: 
She's got a kid sends her all that she can Pimp: 
I might have known 
There is always some man 
Lovely lady, come along and join us! 
Lovely lady! Whore 1: 
Come on dearie, why all the fuss? 
You're no grander than the rest of us 
Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap 
Join your sisters Whore 2: 
Make money in your sleep! Whore 1: 
That's right dearie, let him have the lot (Fantine goes off with one of the sailors.) Whore 3: 
That's right dearie, show him what you've got! Whores: 
Old men, young men, take 'em as they come 
Harbor rats and alley cats and every type of scum 
Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land 
See them with their trousers off they're never quite as grand 
All it takes is money in your hand! 
Lovely ladies 
Going for a song 
Got a lot of callers 
But they never stay for long Fantine: 
Come on, Captain 
You can wear your shoes 
Don't it make a change 
To have a girl who can't refuse 
Easy money 
Lying on a bed 
Just as well they never see 
The shame that's in your head 
Don't they know they're making love 
To one already dead!
