I could sit at home another Saturday 
And channel surf my life away 
Gonna grab my keys, 
Get behind the wheel 
Got no where to go, 
Just like the way it feels 'cause life is short 
And the road is long 
I'll be punchin' dials 
Lookin' for a drivin' song Ain't gonna stop for nothing 
But a tank of gas 
Take an old black road 
That ain't on the map 
Gotta little hula dancer 
Bobbin' in my back window 
She's gonna stick with me 
Wherever I go 'cause life is short 
And the road is long 
I'll be punchin' dials 
Lookin' for a drivin' song The hours and the songs 
And the miles fly by 
Got all I need to clear my mind Turn My headlights off 
And crank the tunes 
The only light that I need 
Is that big full moon 
And I know that soon 
This night will end 
We'll have to head back home 
But I'll worry about that then 'cause life is short 
And the road is long 
I'll be punchin' dials 
Lookin' for a drivin' song
