You're flying high, 
but I'm falling to pieces. 
Trapped under your spell, 
until it releases. I'm drowning without your love, 
ooh sweet suffication. 
Are you real [x4] 
Are you really my creation? Well there I go, 
dreaming that dream again. 
But it seems so real, the taste, 
the feel of this love I'm in. I know you're out there somewhere, 
dreaming of me. 
I know you're out there, 
dreaming of me. 
I know you're out there somewhere, 
dreaming of me. 
I know you're out there, 
dreaming of me.
