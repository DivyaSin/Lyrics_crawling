Lullaby (Mountain) by The Acorn 
I, I will wash over you 
I know your heart is true 
Little Mountain of mine 
?Cause the sun set down on me 
You turn your head and slowly start to breathe 
Like the common bonds on carbon, buried deep 
I?m the shadow of the long forgotten dream 
But I, I will wash over you 
I know your heart is true 
Little mountain of mine 
But every word I wrote left incomplete 
And the promises I never got to keep 
Though you toes grow colder as you sleep 
The blood runs through your heart with every beat 
?Cause I, I will wash over you 
I know your heart is true 
Little Mountain of mine 
I, I will wash over you 
I know your heart is true 
Little Mountain of mine
