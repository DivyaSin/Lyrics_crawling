Now there was a time when they used to say 
That behind every great man there had to be a great woman 
Now in these times of change, you know that it's no longer true 
So we're comin' out of the kitchen 
'Cause there's somethin' we forgot to say to you We said, "Sisters are doin' it for themselves" 
Standin' on their own two feet 
And ringin' on their own bells 
We said, "Sisters are doin' it for themselves" Now this is a song to celebrate 
The conscious liberation of the female state 
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too, oh yeah 
Woman to woman, we're singin' with you The inferior sex has got a new exterior 
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too 
Everybody, take a look around 
Can you see, can you see? 
Can you see there's a woman right next to you? We said, "Sisters are doin' it for themselves," oh yes we are 
Standin' on their own two feet 
And ringin' on their own bells 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves Now we ain't makin' stories and we ain't layin' plans 
Don't you know that a man still loves a woman 
When a woman still loves a man? 
Just a same though Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
There was a time when they used to say 
That behind every great man there had to be a great woman 
In these times of change you know that it's no longer true 
So we're comin' out of the kitchen 
'Cause there's somethin' we forgot to say to you We say, "Sisters are doin' it for themselves" 
Standin' on their own two feet 
And ringin' on their own bells 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves, yes Sisters are doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves, oh oh yes 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves I said, "Sisters are doin' it for themselves" 
Standin' on their own two feet 
And ringin' on their own bells 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
