Years, it's been so many years 
Resenting the years and my heredity 
Oh, I have hated and loved you 
I have hidden behind you but I finally see You, I've mistaken for destiny 
But the truth is my legacy is not up to my genes 
True, though the imprint is deep in me 
It will always be up to me, up to me Oh, free at last 
Oh, I'm free at last 
(Free at last) 
(Find your way, find your way)
