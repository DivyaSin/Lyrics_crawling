[Chorus - B.o.B] 
We got them going down for the count 
Looking at the ground 
That's why we got haters, that's why we got haters 
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go 
Haters everywhere we go, where we go 
Haters going down for the count 
Looking at the ground 
I think you're a hater, I think you're a hater 
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go 
Haters everywhere we go, where we go 
Haters going down for the count [Verse 1 - B.o.B] 
Yes sir it's the beast from Decatur 
Can't see enemies and the haters 
Real sharp on my thing like a razor 
Blade, come clean like a shape up 
So guess I got a game of tape up 
But everybody going to feel the need to say something 
But can't speak up whenever you face them 
That's what you call microphone gangsters 
Yeah, I got them okie-doke, yeah I'm raw, you know my flow 
Because folk be acting hard, like a Viagra overdose 
Talking that noise on all them songs 
A bunch of little boys but you all look grown 
Those niggas there, and these niggas here 
It really don't matter because they all just clones 
Go to school, read a book, be a lawyer 
Hell yeah man I'm all for the cause 
Ain't trying to get involved with the law sir 
But a nigga will get caught with the Mossberg 
And that just ain't a threat on the song 
Don't get it wrong because this track is my own 
Because niggas that slip they don't last long [Chorus] [Verse 2 - Wes Fif] 
Hey, what the lick read homie? Me I'm doing what I always do 
Grinding, if you wasn't steady hating you'd be balling too 
I know you seen us falling through 
All the rich niggas is on my crew 
Fuck it, they can't touch us, if stuck up is what you call it cool 
Oh! 
You should of seen when I came down in that 
Black on black, custom gator, haters face down on the mat 
Splat! 
Yeah I can make a green nigga mad 
Quick, fast, flash like ten cash on his bitch ass [B.o.B] 
You can tell I'm a G by the walk and the stance 
How I play the game make them talk in the stands 
Watch how you talk when you talk to the man 
If it ain't about bread you can talk to the hand 
I, I, show you how to get rich 
You got a weak arm I'll show you how to pitch 
Made it so play I'll show you how to hit 
And tell the police I don't know about shit 
Aye guy, I'm fly, something like the air 
Ain't that something? 
When it's stunting man there's nothing like air 
Homie hold it right there, homeboy hold it down 
Spent five at the mall and had the haters going down [Chorus]
