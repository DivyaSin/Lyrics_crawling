Tommy used to work on the docks 
Union's been on strike 
He's down on his luck 
It's tough, so tough Gina works at a diner all day 
Working for her man 
She brings home her pay 
For love, for love She says, "We've gotta hold on 
To what we've got 
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not 
We've got each other and that's a lot 
For love, we'll give it a shot" Oh, they're halfway there 
Oh, livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear 
Oh, livin' on a prayer Tommy's got his six string in hock 
Now he's holding in 
When he used to make it talk 
So tough, it's tough Gina dreams of running away 
She cries in the night 
Tommy whispers, "Baby its okay, someday" "We've gotta hold on to what we've got 
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not 
We've got each other and that's a lot 
For love, we'll give it a shot" Oh, they're halfway there 
Oh, livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear 
Oh, livin' on a prayer 
Livin' on a prayer Oh, we've gotta hold on 
Ready or not 
You live for the fight 
When that's all that you've got Oh, they're halfway there 
Oh, livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear 
Oh, livin' on a prayer
