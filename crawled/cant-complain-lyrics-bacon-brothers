Written by Kevin Bacon "Actually, I can, and do, and will continue to." KB He jack of all trades master of none 
Seen down the barrel of a teenagers gun 
Puts on his makeup in the a.m., pretends to cry, for that they pay him 
And his best friend held his head on the night they thought that he was dead 
On the dirty, dirty kitchen floor, but he ain't around much anymore He can't complain, he can't complain 
One look and there's no doubt, there's not a damn thing to complain about 
It's just a little rain, can't complain She run run run run run from the east 
She run run run run run to escape the beast 
Cuts her hair and change her name 
Into her life a child came 
Helped her escape her past, they all said it would not last 
But he took every bit of trust, and he ground it into dust But she can't complain, she can't complain 
She better get those tears off her face, if she wants to stay in this race 
It's just a little rain, she can't complain Here's a letter from my mom and dad 
Oh it's lovely here don't you dare be sad 
Maybe someday you'll see Greece, maybe someday you'll find peace 
It'll be the best damn birthday you ever had 
And I can't complain, I can't complain 
To complain would just be wrong, unless of course you count this song 
It's just a little rain, yeah just a little rain, I can't complain
