Tryna set myself up for the win 
So people got a dream that's so much bigger than the diamond ring 
So gimme love gimme love gimme please give me piece of mind 
I know there's enough to a star than I need a little help with mine 
California, don't let me down 
Seas of golden 
But there's trouble all around 
Sunset Jesus, came to me 
He once was a waiter now he's a singer 
Making money on the street My dreams are made of gold 
My heart's been broken and I'm not alone in the road (but I know) 
My dreams are fading 'til I get old 
Breathe for a minute breathe for a minute 
I'll be okay Staring at a billboard from the bus 
Looking at the faces thinking that could be anyone of us 
So gimme hope gimme hope gimme hope on this lonely ride 
'Cause I know one day I will be the one in disguise 
California, don't let me down 
Seas of golden 
But there's trouble all around 
Sunset Jesus, who came to me 
He once was a waiter now he's a singer 
Making money on the street My dreams are made of gold 
My heart's been broken and I'm not alone in the road (but I know) 
I'm in here fading till I get old
