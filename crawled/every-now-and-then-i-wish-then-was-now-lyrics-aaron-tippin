Once in a while my mind takes a trip 
Down memory lane where two fool kids 
First found love in my old tempest 
Girl, we were something Ribbons in your hair and white cotton dress 
Hearts on fire both scared to death 
We lost our fear and our innocence 
To sweet, sweet loving Now honey, I ain't complaining 
No girl, I'm just saying Every now and then on a night like this 
When south breeze blows, baby I relive 
That laugh, that touch, that kiss 
Oh honey, how sweet it is Every now and then when the moon's just right 
Those old feelings come back to life 
And I wish I could turn back time somehow 
Every now and then, I wish then was now We parked down along dry creek road 
'Burnin' love' blasting on the radio 
Yeah we were green but it never showed 
Baby, we were red hot Hotter than noon in mid-July 
You could have lit a fire with the flame in our eyes 
We left nothing to be desired 
We gave it all that we got So honey, let's take a little spin 
Turn up those old feelings Every now and then on a night like this 
When south breeze blows, baby I relive 
That laugh, that touch, that kiss 
Oh honey, how sweet it is Every now and then when the moon's just right 
Those old feelings come back to life 
And I wish I could turn back time somehow 
Yeah, every now and then, I wish then was now Can't you feel the warm wind kicking up 
That's our cue baby, sure enough Yeah, every now and then when the moon's just right 
Those old feelings come back to life 
And I wish I could turn back time somehow 
Yeah, every now and then, I wish then was now
