Yeah, yeah, what the deal Dog? 
Where you from?, BK, NYC, reppin' wid the DPG 
Yeah, what the dealy, yo, yo, yo, yo, LAFC 
Everything else cool, the Wu-Tang is the best 
Dogg Pound's the best Mic accurate, trade darts TL, slight tint DL, quick flash 
Smooth as a baby's ass, lyrical addicts, murder mics like a savage 
And MO30, bullet proof tuxedos, transactions, C-notes for the kilos 
'Bout our money, killa bees love the honey, puttin' a sting 
On warriors in the ring, get mashed out initiation face slashed out Block dropper, drama action like I won an Oscar 
Eye on me, feds spy on me, it's them cops in the choppers 
That play the roof, ready to snipe, stay bulletproof 
Ease up on the over proof, level head the liable And leave ya for dead, fill fulla lead, incidents, classified accidents 
No evidence, po-po innocent crime pays, I guess 
It's the American ways, far from slaves, yet behind bars and cage 
Fair exchange clicked ya bow wid ya 12-guage It's time for me to do this shit for all my years hurtin' 
See these other niggas bustin' raps that ain't workin' 
I'm jerkin' the game, heavyweight pocket exchange 
Touch my niggas that's broke and hope them niggas do the same 
Pause, squeeze ya balls wid no draws down for the cause And hoes takin' off they draws, y'all, niggas, ain't knowin' the half 
Everywhere I go, feel like I'm runnin' from crash, my intention 
To smash fast plex on elevators 
Sacked a hell a haters crime raider on the fader I'm major now, women hit me on my pager 
While I'm puffin' on the Bombay, the Vietnam way 
Pimpin' in a calm way and rule one 
Never let a bitch know where your baby mom's stay Now if you see me creepin' through SC 
Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high If you see me in the NYC 
Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high Got the session on lock down, make way for the cocked pound 
Best to give it all you got now fool, for this new era, new order 
New terror, new torture, run up and extort ya, abort ya missions 
Escort physicians to the spot you and I met rep for combat Where the bomb at, chop up on that niggas, I been there 
And done that catch a contact by drainin', try trainin' 
Holla when you've perfected ya aimin', ready for a taming 
And catch me at the spot wid this clown gashed up Ya found me in his wife face down mashed up, no stoppin' this 
I'm most poppinest, anything to the left of monotonous 
Mister Khopadopalous, blockin' this hold ya down tech potent 
Any nigga second guessin' keep his face opened Check it out, got games, crackle, clash of the titans 
Up against the crackin', come to fuck you up, stuck you up 
Niggas bust, niggas lookin' like Kurupt, what the fuck you want? 
All at you motherfucking small fry small guy Motherfuckin' small cat, beat wid pipes poles and bats 
Blast wid a small gat, run, and bust till his lungs collapse 
And hit the corner pocket but first strip his pockets 
He shouldn't a got caught in the mixture See I'm the type of nigga to pull out the paintbrush 
And the board and the paper and paint a picture 
You shootin' and got shot, we shoot ya, Drex Luthor 
[unverified] Then pull pens to report to zoopers? I'm a 6-4 rap, 44 mag calicos and mass, double bags caught cash 
Wid cash on cash dub sacks new blocks 
Baby S, El Drex, Kurupt, Trigga and Short Khop When you see me wid the DPG 
Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high And if you see me in the ING 
Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high Yo, yo, verbal seizures, coming from the black Johnny Fever 
You bought your heater turn like Tina when Ike beat her 
We kidnapped ya girl and ain't feed her she's a heavy bleeder 
At this point you realize that you ain't really need her Cats that get it betta stand on they pivot 
Life is rigid from the business and pleasure, when you miss it 
Oh well forget it wipe my pinkie ring when you kissed it 
Couldn't keep ya distance, so things was done deliberate A G-thing, this cost cash is not a free thing 
When we sing that's when they bring the jealousy thing 
But that alerts me, the low and dirty wanna hurt me 
They equal to the numbers on Robert Paris jersey Blood thirsty ten O.Gs in black derbys, we throw things 
I got a arm like Testa Verdy, it's Drex Andretti 
The live lyrical compulsive, betta contact ya physician 
For over dosage, you lost ya focus, realize what you get? A little bit of good shit and a lot of bullshit now you wounded 
So you got exactly what you earned 
You gon' fool wid the Drex it's like a tax return When I'm in the two-five 
Just walk on by, just walk on by 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high If you see me in the NYC 
Just walk on by, nigga, just walk on by 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Before you fuck up my high 
Fuck up my high All I wanna say, "Fuck this niggas, man" 
Yo, first of all, after all this is over, we still all go to sleep 
And we still wake up in the morning, so give thanks to God 
'Cause he loves us for real, for real
