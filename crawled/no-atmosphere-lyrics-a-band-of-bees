There's no 
Atmosphere 
On the moon 
Much like the vibe in the room 
Cold, closed out 
Needs more fuel 
I guess it's too damn cool 
Like Old King Cole 
He grew too old 
Died and didn't get his wish 
To be super rich, forever young 
I guess that's one step back Well that's one step back 
Well that's one step back We know he didn't go 
Without leaving a stitch 
To his wife 
Who was a saucy dish 
You know he owed her money 
And that's sort of funny 
With no room to negotiate 
Before he passed 
Those pearly gates 
And she made his grave from slate 
It's not even straight 
Not even straight That's one, 
Well that's one step back 
Well that's one step back 
That's one, 
Well that's one step back 
Well that's one step back 
That's one, 
Well that's one step back 
Well that's one step back
