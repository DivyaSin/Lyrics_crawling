Once, you won't remember 
If you said Hollywood, hers was the face you'd think of 
Her face on every billboard 
In just a single week, she's get ten thousand letters Men would offer 
Fortunes for a bloom from her corsage 
Or a few strands of her hair Today, she's half-forgotten 
But it's the pictures that got small 
She is the greatest star of all Then, you can't imagine 
How fans would sacrifice themselves to touch her shadow 
There was a maharajah 
Who hanged himself with one of her discarded stockings She's immortal 
Caught inside that flickering light beam 
Is a youth which cannot fade Madame's a living legend; 
I've seen so many idols fall 
She is the greatest star of all
