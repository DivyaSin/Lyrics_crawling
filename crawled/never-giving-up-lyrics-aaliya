Never giving up all this love. 
I'm never giving up, your all I'm thinking of. Sitting here, there's something wrong, 
Thinking bout you baby. 
Thinkin' bout all the changes, we've been through. 
And I know it might sound crazy, but I'm still lovin' you. 
In spite of all the simple things, we've been through [echo] 
The way you make me feel, I cant explain. 
But I love what you do, what you do to me. 
When were making love, your driving me insane, 
See I cant go no higher. Never giving up all this love (hey)

Your always on my mind all the time. 
Never giving up all this love, 
And ill always be there baby. 
Never giving up your all I'm thinking of. Well, well, well 
Feels so strange when I was on the train, 
I cracked a smile, on every thought of you, 
The things that you do, makes me feel so good inside. 
No need to lie, I'm on your side, 
Ooh no need to lie to you. 
I'm givin' my lovin' to you day and night. 
Aaliyah I'm gonna be lovin' you. 
Oh baby girl,

Oh no ill never forgive you for, givin' your love away 
I gotta keep it to myself. Tavarious, 
If you say what you mean, and you mean what you say.
