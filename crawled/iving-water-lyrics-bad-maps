Little drops of living water 
Lost and gone beneath the fodder 
I lost a father 
I lost a father If its for its own sake 
We live and we die 
I venture after nothing resides 
But I lost a father 
I lost a father I allotted visitations with the other side 
Then I visit with the father 
Let him curb my pride 
But I lost a father 
I lost a father
