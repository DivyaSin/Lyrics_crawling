It has been way too long, since back when 
Jasmine, I've been wrong 
I've been wrong about nothing 
You're still the same, I wish you changed It's still your game, by your rules 
And I will never learn nothing 
And nothing ever changes You're asking me to go to an ordinary 
Satisfactory, almost paradise staying 'round you 
Hanging 'round you Jasmine 
With the sound of our straws 
Sipping down, yoo hoo You tantalize, I fantasize 
And in your eyes is the world 
When all else fades into nothing 
I'm the proof, you're beautiful When you're aloof, I get dumb 
And I can't think about nothing else 
And nothing ever changes You're asking me to go to an ordinary 
Satisfactory, almost Paradise staying 'round you 
Hanging 'round you Jasmine 
With the sound of our straws 
Sipping down, yoo hoo Love's a beehive of honey and stings 
And I don't care if I never learn nothing Staying 'round you 
Hanging 'round you Jasmine 
With the sound of our straws 
Sipping down, yoo hoo And I don't want anyone else 
To mesmerize me, Jasmine
