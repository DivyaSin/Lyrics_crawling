I am scared, I'm afraid 
Mercy me with Your grace 
My heart said in brokenness 
I want to see Your face Don't You hide, don't You leave 
Don't You turn away from me 
?Cause if You go I'll be forsaken 
Who will be my soul?s salvation? Lord, hear my cry, hear my heart 
Here I come to where You are 
I'll be there for You, You'll be there for me Lord, though I'm weak, You are strong 
So I'll go back where I belong 
You'll be there for me, I'll be there for You 
You'll be there for me Answer me in my place 
You told me to seek Your face 
My heart spoke with heaviness 
Your face I will seek Don't give up, don't forget 
Remember me and I won't quit 
What good am I if I'm not taken? 
And who am I without salvation? Lord, hear my cry, hear my heart 
Here I come to where You are 
I'll be there for You, You'll be there for me Lord, though I'm weak, You are strong 
So I'll go back where I belong 
You'll be there for me and I'll be there for You 
You'll be there for me Lord, hear my cry, hear my heart 
Here I come to where You are 
You'll be there for me, I'll be there for You 
You'll be there for me
