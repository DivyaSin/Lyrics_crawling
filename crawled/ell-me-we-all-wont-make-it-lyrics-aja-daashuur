Quicksilver Lake, where I got my first break 
I was fast and quick, water was shallow and thick 
My limbs turn gray, didnt need them anyway 
Ive got to make it 
I was born to make it (Chorus) 
Tell me Im the one 
Tell me all the waitings done 
Tell me its okay 
We all wont make it anyway If I push a little harder maybe Ill get farther 
If I stand straight my will wont negotiate 
How bad do I needed it, my name in lights? 
How much do I want it? 
Do I have to reach those heights? (Chorus) x2 
Tell me Im the one 
Tell me all the waitings done 
Tell me its okay 
We all wont make it anyway I just want my chance to write me own history 
I just want an explanation to set my soul at ease Quicksilver Lake, where I got my first break 
Ive got to make it 
I was born to make it (Chorus) x2 
Tell me Im the one 
Tell me all the waitings done 
Tell me its okay 
We all wont make it anyway
