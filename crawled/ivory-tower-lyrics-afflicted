Rising he who was subdued 
committing acts of protest 
their speech of lave is misconstrued 
he will put it to the test Rejecting rule that's obsolete 
their influence won't last 
he won't accept to taste defeat 
their power is part of the past Contradiction, false disguise 
abusing faith of man 
he has how seen through their lies 
ignores that he is banned Now... stop looking to the skies 
no entity of light will help you 
now... who created who? 
Did man create god? No palace in heaven 
no life for eternity 
these medieval beliefs 
can't reign eternally? 
the men in power 
suffocating wills in a society conformed 
in their ivory tower 
arranging master plan for our society deformed Rise now you who were suppressed 
think with your own minds 
don't let yourselves be oppressed 
your own path is what you must find Religion is but a means of manipulating people 
it's time we face it, we are but animals with brains 
stuck on this rotating globe of space 
life is but a random outcome to biological processes 
as is the human race...
