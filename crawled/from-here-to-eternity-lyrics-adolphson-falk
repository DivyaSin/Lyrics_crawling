We're searching for a sign 
A universal message 
A resemblance of life 
From some outer reach of space 
We're sending out our code 
And listening for an echo 
An answer to our call 
From some strange and distant race 
We're seeking out the clues 
Of life's eternal mysteries 
We're forcing the gates 
Of mankind's holy rules 
Our quest will never end 
In some cul de sac of history 
Our thirst will not be quenched 
By the prophecies of fools 
From here to eternity 
Cross the barriers of tie 
We will not be deterred 
We will not be denied 
From here to eternity 
From here to afar 
With our dreams in the heavens 
And our sights in the stars 
Like the mariners of old 
We launch our fragile vessels 
On an uncertain voyage 
Destination unknown 
A galactic caravan 
Through the deserts of illusion 
A celestial crusade 
Past deception's dark mirage 
And even you and I 
The children of this planet 
Whose destiny we share 
On its passage round the sun 
Though we're light-years apart 
Our hearts are bound together 
In an unrelentless search 
For the meaning of it all
