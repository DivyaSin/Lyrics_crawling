Dirty blonde hair 
My new girl she's got dirty blonde hair 
Dirty blonde hair 
My new girl she's got dirty blonde hair 
I don't care what you say 
I will forget you someday, someday, someday Alcohol and cocaine 
Have never been a problem for me 
But a beauty queen with raven hair 
Is like a disease 
Consuming me 
I can't break free from her Dirty blonde hair 
My new girl she's got dirty blonde hair 
Dirty blonde hair 
My new girl she's got dirty blonde hair 
I don't care what you say 
I will forget you someday, someday, someday
