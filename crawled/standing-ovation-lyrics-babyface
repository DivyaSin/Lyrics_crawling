I can't imagine how you be gettin' through your day 
It must be hard when you be carryin' all the weight 
But even with that I see you, you rarely do complain 
You give your heart and soul and still they don't appreciate 
Man to woman I got nothin' but respect for you 
Just knowing you got to deal with all the things we put you through so 
I give a standing O to you 
I raise my glass to you I won't pretend to know 
I can't begin to know 
I'm fascinated on the daily how you do the things you do 
Man to woman I ain't got a clue though, oh no 
Girl I'm so mesmerized, I'm even mystified 
Your perfection shows in everything and anything you do 
Man to woman I ain't got a clue no 
It's amazing how you do all that you do oh 
Suffice to say my hat goes off to you 
A standing ovation 
And I just want to give a standing O to you 
A standing ovation I can't imagine myself walking in your shoes 
It's not even worth the challenge, I know that I would lose 
You just extraordinary way above the ordinary 
There ain't no conversation, been that way since gods creation 
Man to woman I can't help but be in awe of you 
No matter what the deal somehow you always make it through, so 
I give the standing O to you 
I raise my glass to you I won't pretend to know 
I can't begin to know 
I'm fascinated on the daily how you do the things you do 
Man to woman I ain't got a clue though, on no 
Girl I'm so mesmerized, I'm even mystified 
Your perfection shows in everything and anything you do 
Man to woman I ain't got a clue no 
It's amazing how you do all that you do oh 
Suffice to say my hat goes off to you 
A standing ovation 
And I just want to give a standing O to you 
A standing ovation Man to woman I got nothing but respect for you 
Just knowing you got to deal with all the things we put you through, so
