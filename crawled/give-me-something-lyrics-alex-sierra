Tonight you can leave your mark 
No ones watching in the darkness 
Kiss me on the neck make a beautiful scar anywhere you'd like No regrets all bets are off 
We don't need a little talking 
Listen to the madness in my heart Can you read my mind? 
It could be a lonely world 
I want forever times forever So give me something I can't live without 
Leave the sound of your name on my mouth 
Give me something to keep dreaming about 
All night all night oh yeah 
Give me something I can't live without With the hours only 24 
Every seconds a revolving door 
Gonna hold on to your heart for sure 
Til the end of time 
It could be a lonely world 
I want forever times forever So give me something I can't live without 
Leave the sound of your name on my mouth 
Give me something to keep dreaming about 
All night all night oh yeah 
Give me something 
All night all night ohh Give me something 
I can't live without 
Give me something 
I can't live without Give me something I can't live without 
Be the sound of your name on my mouth 
Give me something to keep dreaming about 
All night all night oh yeah 
Give me something 
All night all night oh yeah 
All night all night oh yeah
