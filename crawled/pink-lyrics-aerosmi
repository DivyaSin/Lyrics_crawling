Pink it's my new obsession 
Pink it's not even a question 
Pink on the lips of your lover, 
'Cause pink is the love you discover 
Pink as the bing on your cherry 
Pink 'cause you are so very 
Pink it's the color of passion 
`Cause today it just goes with the fashion Pink it was love at first sight, 
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light, 
And pink gets me high as a kite 
And I think everything is going to be all right 
No matter what we do tonight You could be my flamingo 
'Cause pink is the new kinda lingo 
Pink like a deco umbrella 
It's kink - but you don't ever tell her Pink it was love at first sight 
Pink when I turn out the light 
Pink gets me high as a kite 
And I think everything is going to be all right 
No matter what we do tonight
