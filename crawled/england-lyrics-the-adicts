I hate this war, can't take any more 
It's a real gas, how long does it last? 
I don't wanna die for England 
I don't wanna die at all I, I, I, I, ooo 
I, I, I, I, ooo I got my uniform, now it's battle torn 
I'm wet and I'm cold, what a way to grow old 
I don't wanna die for England 
England will survive I, I, I, I, ooo 
I, I, I, I, ooo 
I, I, I, I, ooo 
I, I, I, I, ooo
