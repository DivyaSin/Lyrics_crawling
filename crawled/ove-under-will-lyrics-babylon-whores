And you go down like submarine / In the cigarette haze filled neon sea / A new cat to skin / For all the dog days / For every nobody face / Has a story to tell / Has a soul to sell / Different maps of hell 
Petty lies are truth just / Optimized / Two bit whores playing penny wise 
And you are dying to get a life / And you would kill to find some peace 
And you love it all / Love under will / Deadened to horror / Bathed in sin / God damned the Devil may care / For each step further down in Hell / For all escatologies and the parables 
And the serpent talks to you at night / As you slowly turn away from the light / Poison oracles / Bastard disciples / Running out of peanuts for the human zoo / Living day by day / Withering away / Dyeing black the grey / Just like me and you 
Petty lies are truth just / Optimized / Two bit whores playing penny wise 
And you would ask if you knew the answers / And you would try if you knew you'd succeed 
And you love it all / Love under will / Deadened to horror / Bathed in sin / God damned the Devil may care / For each step further down in Hell / For all escatologies and the parables 
So nothing is true / And everything's permitted / What's it to you / When your world is breaking loose 
Pretty love pretty hate inside you / Pretty love pretty hate inside your / Heart
