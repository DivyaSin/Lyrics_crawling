(Ooh) 
For the way you changed my plans 
For being the perfect distraction 
For the way you took the idea that I have 
Of everything that I wanted to have 
And made me see there was something missing (Oh yeah) For the ending of my first begin 
(Ooh yeah yeah)(Ooh yeah yeah) 
And for the rare and unexpected friend 
(Ooh yeah yeah)(Ooh yeah yeah) 
For the way you're something that I never choose 
But at the same time something I don't wanna lose 
And never wanna be without ever again (Oh Oh) You're the best thing I never knew I needed 
So when you were here I had no idea 
You're the best thing I never knew I needed 
So now it's so clear I need you here always My accidental happily (Ever After Oh Oh Oh) 
The way you slime and how you comfort me (With your laughter) 
I must admit you were not a part of my book 
But now if you open it up and take a look 
You're the beginning and the end of every chapter (Oh Oh) You're the best thing I never knew I needed (Oh) 
So when you were here I had no idea 
You're the best thing I never knew I needed (That I needed) 
So now it's so clear I need you here always Who'd knew that I'd be here (Who'd knew that I'd be here oh oh) 
So unexpectedly (So unexpectedly oh oh) 
Undeniably happy (Hey) 
Said with you right here, right here next to me (oh) 
Boy you're the.. You're the best thing I never knew I needed (Said I needed oh oh) 
So when you were here I had no idea 
You're the best thing I never knew I needed (Needed oh) 
So now it's so clear I need you here always 
Baby, baby 
Now it's so clear I need you here always
