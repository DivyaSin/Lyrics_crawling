When I was born my brothers asked my momma if they could have 
Instead a little puppy, 
But they saw me cryin' all alone 
And so they carried me home So as I grew up, my brothers they watched out for me, protected me 
My superhero fantasy 
I was the sidekick of the three 
Batman, Robin, and me I will always be Little Brother's Little Brother 
I will always be the third son of my mother 
And all throughout the years, I knew just one thing true 
I don't have a hero, I got two And there at school - my brothers handled bullies who would pick on me 
Came in a flash and share a sandwich 
When I lost my lunch money 
Two Supermen always saving me I will always be Little Brother's Little Brother 
I will always be the third son of my mother 
Our little team, we'd ride our bikes and fly with ease 
Livin' happy in my family Little Brother's Little Brother 
I am not the first or the second, I'm the other 
Here in the shadows of the brave, the proud, the few 
I don't have a hero, I got two Cuz heroes help when life's unkind 
I've got secret weapons who keep things in line 
And like the comics I can claim 
This "secret identity" name: I will always be Little Brother's Little Brother 
I will always be the third son of my mother 
And even to this day they still check up on me 
They still tell me I will always be... Little Brother's Little Brother 
I am not the first or the second, I'm the other 
But what a happy life for this young pup, it's true 
I don't have a hero, I got two I will always be Little Brother's Little Brother 
I will always be the third son of my mother 
Forever I'll remember what they mean to me: 
Brothers, Superheroes, Family Little Brother's Little Brother 
I am not the first or the second, I'm the other 
Forever I will be their special little dude 
I don't have a hero, I got two I got two 
Oh - I got two
