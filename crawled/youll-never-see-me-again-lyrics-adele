In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face 
From the deepest part of my regret 
I hear the words I wish I'd said 
At the dawning of the day 
I can't wait to see the light 
Make up memories in my head 
They help to fill the emptiness you've left 
I can't drown in your tears 
I won't face your fears 
I need to fight my own 
You'll never see me again oh baby in time 
Let the weight take me under 
I know I'll survive 
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day 
I can't bare to see the light 
Make up memories in my head 
They help to fill the emptiness you've left 
I can't drown in your tears 
I won't face your fears 
I need to fight my own 
You'll never see me again oh baby in time 
Let the weight take me under 
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall 
Let the sky come crashing down 
Turn all my right to wrong 
But after you that goes on 
You'll never see me again 
I've been learning to live without you 
It's taken all of my stake 
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time 
Let the weight take me under 
I know I'll survive
