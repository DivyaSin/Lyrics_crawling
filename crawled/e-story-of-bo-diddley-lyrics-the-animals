Now listen here to the story of Bo Diddley 
The rock 'n roll scene in general 
Bo Diddley was born Ellis McDaniels 
In a place called McCoom In Mississippi about nineteen-twenty-sex 
He moved to Chicago about ninetten-thirty-eight 
Where his name was eventually changed to Bo Diddley 
He practised the guitar every day and sometimes into the night 'Til his papa's hair began to turn white 
His pa said "Son, listen here, I know" 
"You can stay but, uh, that guitar's just got to go" 
So he pulled his hat down over his eyes And headed on out for them western skies 
I think Bob Dylan said that 
He hit New York City 
He began to play the Apollo in Harlem Good scene there 
Everybody raved 
One day, one night 
Came a Cadillac, four headlights Came a man with a big long fat cigar 
He said come here son, I'm going to make you a star 
Bo Diddley said uh, what's in it for me? 
The man said uh, shut your mouth son and play the guitar And you just wait and see 
Well, Bo made it, he made it real big 
And so did the rest of the Rock 'n Roll scene along with him 
And a white guy called Johnny Otis took Bo Diddley's rhythm And changed into hand jive 
And it went like this In a little old country town one day 
A little old country man begin to play 
Had two guitars and a beat-up saxophone 
When the drummer said those cats begin to Oh baby, ooh we oh oh 
Ooh la la that rock 'n roll 
You hear me, ooh we oh oh 
Ooh la la that rock 'n roll Then the U.S. music scene, there was big changes made 
Due to circumstances beyond our control 
Such as payola 
The rock 'n roll scene died after two years of solid rock You got discs like, uh 
Take good care of my baby 
Please don't ever make her blue 
And so forth About, uh, one year later 
In a place called Liverpool in England 
Uh, four young guys with mop haircuts 
Begin to sing stuff like, uh It's been a hard day's night 
And I've been workin' like a dog 
And so on A place called Richmond in Surrey 
Way down in the deep south 
Where the guys had long hair down their backs sang 
I want to be your lover baby 
I want to be your man, yeah 
And all that jazz Well we been doin' this number Bo Diddley 
For quite some time now 
Bo Diddley visited this country last year 
And we were playin' the Club A-Go-Go in Newcastle, our home town And the doors opened one night 
And to our surprise in walked the man himself, Bo Diddley 
Along with him was, uh, Jerome Green, his maraca man 
And the Dutchess, his gorgeous sister Now we're doin', uh, we're doin' this number 
Along with them came Rolling Stones and The Mersey Beats 
They're all standin' around diggin' it 
And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin' He turned around to Jerome Green, he said 
Hey Jerome, what do you think of these guys doin' our, our material? 
Jerome said uh, where's the bar, man 
Please show me to the bar 
He turned around to the Dutchess and he said Hey Dutch, what do you think of these young guys doin' our material? 
She said ah, I don't know, I only came across here to see the 
Changin' of the guards and all that jazz 
But Bo Diddley looked up at me and he said, uh With half-closed eyes and a smile 
He said man", took off his glasses 
He said man 
That sure is the biggest load of rubbish ever heard in my life
