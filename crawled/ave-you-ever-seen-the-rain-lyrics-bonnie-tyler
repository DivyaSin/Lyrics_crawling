Someone told me long ago there's a calm before the storm 
I know, and it's been coming for sometime 
When it's over so they say, it'll rain a sunny day 
I know, shining down like water I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
Coming down on a sunny day, yeah, oh yeah Yesterday and days before, sun is cold and rain is hot 
I know, been that way for all my time 
Till forever on it goes, through the circle fast and slow 
I know, and I can't stop I wonder Know yes I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
Coming down on a sunny day, yeah Yeah, I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
Now I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain 
Coming down on a sunny day Have you ever seen the rain 
Have you ever seen the rain 
Have you ever seen the rain
