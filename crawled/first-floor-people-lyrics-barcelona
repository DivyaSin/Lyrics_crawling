First floor people 
I'll take my place among the throngs 
Everyone reading books on how not to fall Some may say, the world looks 
The same through red eyes, no way 
Covered in dirt off the floor, I'm seeing straight Don't be scared if you know 
Help me to explain myself Who am I to fool now if you're gone, you're gone 
If I am found below the ground 
I'm searching, desperate Prepared people, take your places on deck 
I'm a lost boy with no one to tell me I am safe 
Overarching rules have told me not to think about Who am I to fool now if you're gone, you're gone 
If I am found below the ground 
I'm searching, desperate This hole is deeper by the hour 
My hands are bleeding I spin around, you're nowhere 
I'll throw away my ugly plans 
They're too tired to push me anywhere but down So who am I to fool now if you're gone, you're gone 
If I am found below the ground 
I'm searching, desperate So who am I to fool now if you're gone, you're gone 
When I am found below the ground 
I'm searching, I'm desperate
