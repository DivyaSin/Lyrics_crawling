So what did you do? 
It was a little bit less than you should have done 
When the cards were laid on the table 
And how did you love? 
With a little bit less heart that you should have had 
But we all do the best that we're able 
(chorus) 
I haven't got a clue (he hasn't got a clue) 
Which is the right direction 
So I'll leave it up to you (he'll leave it up to you) 
Failing with the best intentions So what did you see? 
It was a little bit less than you should have been 
But you're not alone in being blind 
And what did you say? 
It was a little bit less than you should have said 
But the right words are so hard to come by Chorus I'm falling down (falling down) 
But I'm all right (I'm all right) 
These simple things (simple things) 
Complicate my life... (ooooooh) So how did you live? 
With a little bit less life than you should have had 
But your own rules are so hard to follow 
And what do you know? 
Just a little bit less than you could have known 
But the truth is so hard to swallow Chorus I'm falling down (falling down) 
But I'm all right (I'm all right) 
These simple things (simple things) 
Complicate my life... (ooooooh)
