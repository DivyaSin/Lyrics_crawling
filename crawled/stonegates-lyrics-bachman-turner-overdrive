I was raised, born and bred in a praire town 
When a dark eyed woman really laid the feelings down 
We were one, had our fun in our younger years 
Well I remember damn well she loved me 
And she remembers damn well she cared Stonegates, closing me in 
If I get free won't see me again 
Stonegates, wish I could be 
Back in the country, wish I was free I was down, leaving town on a midnight train 
When a long legged woman come walking down platform A 
She was lean, made a scene as she came my way 
Well we traveled on down through the midwest towns 
In Chicago we parted ways Stonegates, closing me in 
If I get free won't see me again 
Stonegates, wish I could be 
Back in the country, wish I was free Stonegates, closing me in 
If I get free won't see me again 
Stonegates, wish I could be 
Back in the country, wish I was free I was down, leaving town on a midnight train 
When a long legged woman come walking down platform A 
She was lean, made a scene as she came my way 
Well we traveled on down through the midwest towns 
In Chicago we parted ways Stonegates, closing me in 
If I get free won't see me again 
Stonegates, wish I could be 
Back in the country, wish I was free Move around town
