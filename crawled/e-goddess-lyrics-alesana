My breath is slowly catching up to my mind after the crash 
Inhale, exhale 
Now open your eyes, see the wonder 
I'm telling you it's unbelievable Did I lose myself, am I still alive 
Something isn't right 
Am I just asleep or is this really happening to me 
Tell myself I'm fine 
Get up on your feet, get up on your feet 
Answer me now I never wanna leave because you feel like ecstasy 
A seduction becoming a part of me 
Damn you, temptation, you've got a hold on me 
Stand up, walk away, don't fall into the trap Illusion is best when you don't try to fight back 
Give in to the pleasure, skin on skin 
I will take you places you've not been 
Elation is nothing but a myth unless you give in Did I lose myself, am I still alive 
Something isn't right 
Am I just asleep or is this really happening to me 
Tell myself I'm fine 
Get up on your feet, get up on your feet 
Answer me now I never wanna leave because you feel like ecstasy 
A seduction becoming a part of me 
Damn you, temptation, you've got a hold on me 
Stand up, walk away, don't fall into the trap We choose the foolish of the world to astonish the wise 
The weak to embarrass the strong 
Nothing is impossible, we must hope for everything 
You don't have to understand things for them to be 
You just have to believe in the unbelievable My shadow hides in a place where the sun screams 
Come back, my tears 
Please just tell me what you are 
Why can't I feel I can't stay here I will never be anything 
But a fraud too scared to lose it all 
I won't let you go I don't wanna leave because you are ecstasy 
I never wanna leave because you feel like ecstasy 
A seduction becoming a part of me 
Damn you, temptation, you've got a hold on me 
Stand up, walk away, don't fall into the trap I don't wanna leave because you are ecstasy
