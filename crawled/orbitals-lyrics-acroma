I cannot see the end just time before me 
I lost my youth and now there's no returning 
I cannot here the wisdom words below me 
And if I fall is it just the ending? 
It seems that I am lost in orbit 
Somehow I knew it all along We grow become the brightest 
Fight the orbits as they drive us 
We grow become the brightest 
Lost in wisdom We deteriorate it's on more day of dying 
We deteriorate lost in Orbitals 
We deteriorate 
Wait for truth until the end and then it's too late 
One by one we reach the atmosphere and fall to earth I cannot see you cannot hear you 
Lost in orbit I can't stop moving 
I cannot hear the wisdom words below me 
I dream of falling hoping words will reach me We grow become the brightest 
Fight the orbits as they drive us 
We grow become the brightest 
Lost in wisdom We deteriorate its one more day of dying 
We deteriorate lost in Orbitals 
We deteriorate 
We wait for truth until the end and then it's too late 
One by one we reach the atmosphere and fall 
We fall 
A never ending fall 
We fall We deteriorate its one more day of dying 
We deteriorate trade innocence for wisdom 
We deteriorate its one more day of dying 
We deteriorate lost in Orbitals 
We've lost it all
