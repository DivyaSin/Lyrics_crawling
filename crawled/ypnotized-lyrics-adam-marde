You have got me where I don't know what I'm doing 
You hold my heart in your hands 
Now I'm lost in a world of your illusions 
I try to break away but I can't 'Cause when you touch me I go crazy 
When we kiss you complicate me 
And my heart beat stops Then you love me like a zombie 
I don't know what you've done to me 
But I can't get enough I'm hypnotized when I look in your eyes 
Hypnotized ever since I met you 
I've been hypnotized by your lies 
When you say that you love me I am sick and tired of going 'round in circles 
You either want this or you don't 
I should've known from the start that you were trouble 
Now I've entered the danger zone 'Cause when you love me it feels empty 
You might hear but you're not listening 
This is just too much Yet every time you come around me 
I forget what you've done to me 
I'm still caught in your clutch I'm hypnotized when I look in your eyes 
Hypnotized ever since I met you 
I've been hypnotized by your lies 
When you say that you love me Yes I'm hypnotized when I look in your eyes 
Hypnotized ever since I met you 
I've been hypnotized by your lies 
When you say you love me You say the words but you're pretending 
Now there is no happy ending 
And I've had enough 'Cause when you love me it feels empty 
You might hear but you're not listening 
This is just too much Hypnotized by your lies 
Hypnotized, hypnotized Hypnotized by your lies 
Hypnotized, hypnotized Hypnotized by your lies 
Hypnotized, hypnotized
