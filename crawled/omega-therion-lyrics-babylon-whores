For want of an angel 
For all the lead that you thought you turned gold 
There is something you still want to know 
Il Penseroso led you astray 
To the woods and the wild 
The pathless way 
And you followed the trail that Shelley fared 
Gazed on dead kings with your sullen despair 
Even the Dome of the Rock in Blake's city 
Bore no trace of St. Augustine 
And you studied Plotinus 
Thrice great Trismegistos 
Knew the reign of Hister and Niebelung 
Nietzsche, Vril und Gotterdammerung 
Do you want an angel 
Heaven clad as the stars fell 
Do you want an angel 
Poison of god to make it well 
For want of an angel 
For all the blood that you turned into ink 
You found yourself still searching 
A heosphoros for a golden dawn 
A scarlet sunrise for Babalon 
Someone to stop all the watches now 
Someone to bring this shithouse down 
All things must have an end 
All things to all men 
Forget the tuesday baby 
Let it be a doomsday baby 
Come on and suck a megaton 
Omega Therion 
Oh it is time 
Unbind the lines of horizon 
Omega Therion 
Take you away
