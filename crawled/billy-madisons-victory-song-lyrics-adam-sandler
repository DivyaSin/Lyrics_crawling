[Billy] 
Yes, I will go back to school, 
And achieve victory, 
No man will take what my father has built 
Unless that man is me! [Veronica] 
My Billy, sweet Billy boy, 
I knew you would go back, 
No one can stop you if you try, 
Don't I have a nice rack? [Billy] 
Veronica, I thank you, 
For beating the shit out of me. 
I see things so clearly now, 
I choose my destiny! [Veronica] 
Oh, Billy, I knew you had it in ya! [Kids] 
We're here to help you, Billy, 
Get back in school to stay, 
You gotta work real hard, and stick it out, 
'Til graduation day! [Clown] 
Hey, kids, it's me! 
I betcha thought that I was dead! 
But when I fell over I just broke my leg 
And got a hemmoraghe in my head! [chuckle] [Everyone] 
There are obstacles in the way, 
But together we shall overcome, 
'Cause you can't break a spirit, and you can't kill a dream, 
Do you have any more gum, more gum, more gum, more gum? [Billy] 
Do you have any more gum?
