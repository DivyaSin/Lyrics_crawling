I can't take you with me where I'm going 
In me there's a new love that has growin' 
So now I leave behind all that once was mine 
I can't take you with me where I'm going I can't take you with me that's for certain 
Anchored to some heavy red stage curtain 
If I should hear you sing 
Those words would just make me sting 
I cant take you with me, that's for certain I can't take you with me now I know it 
Though the love was in me I did not show it 
I found in Berlin who I swore might be my twin 
Taken from me with out me ever knowin' You can't take me with you where you're goin' 
You've got no intentions of ever slowin' 
My book of baby names 
Only does family flames 
I dreamt we had a boy and named him owen
