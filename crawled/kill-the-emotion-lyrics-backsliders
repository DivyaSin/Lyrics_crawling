Got the lord on his mind, got a load in his bag 
Gotta get across the line, get it sold on time 
Whoa - Little Church on the hill 
Whoa - Little town on the sea 
Whoa - A wooden bench holds the town 
whow - Remember those who have drowned 
Kneel down if you think you are worthy 
Stand tall if your conscience is clear 
The town-folk like ot do a little scolding 
They can tell you're not from around here 
Whoa - One too many drinks is way too much 
whoa - Two too many drinks not enough 
Your cups half empty and your worlds collide 
This one little bell's gonna save your life 
A rusty little cross towers over the ocean 
They'll drink to your health and kill the emotion
