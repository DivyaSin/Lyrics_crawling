Sometimes I think of old friends 
But they all seem the same 
Then I see them and they can't remember my name 
I guess I'm just like them 
I guess I'm just a bore 
I could hate them but I've never done that before 
I've got lots of good friends 
I don't need anymore And sometimes when you lie to me 
Sometimes I'll lie to you 
And there isn't a thing you could possibly do 
All these half-destroyed lives 
Aren't as bad as they seem 
But now I see blood and I hear people scream 
Then I wake up 
And it's just another bad dream (Chorus) 
And I can't help myself by feeling sorry 
Because I gave up every chance I had 
Another movement 
It's just another fad 
Like a cry for help 
In a world gone mad
