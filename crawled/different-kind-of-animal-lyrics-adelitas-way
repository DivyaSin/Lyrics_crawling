Do you feel your future set and stone? 
Do you feel 'of be unknown 
Hands to the match, that won't change your whole life 
Cheers to the times, we go and give 'em all 
If you believe it's something not as well beyond 
We count it all for nothing 
Carry all for try cuz one day you'll wake up and see you 
But that forget all, with nothing left to lose 
One day yull wake up 
And what else could you do 
One day you'll wake up 
Are you where yu've always wanted to be ? 
Do you take advantage of the vanity 
Hands to the match, that won't change your whole life 
Cheers to the times, we go and give 'em all 
If you believe it's something not as well beyond 
We count it all for nothing 
Carry all for try cuz one day you'll wake up and see you 
But that forget all, with nothing left to lose 
But have we hide? Have he grow? 
Let you know 
Let you know all that I chose 
Why can you just let me be 
Take a chanse and set me free 
Tell me all the things you do 
If you believe it's something not as well beyond 
We count it all for nothing 
Carry all for try cuz one day you'll wake up and see you 
But that forget all, with nothing left to lose 
Cuz one day you'll wake 
Nothing left to lose 
Cuz one day you'll wake 
Nothing left to lose 
One day you'll wake up
