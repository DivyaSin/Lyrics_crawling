Dim park and creaking bells. 
Sent a card to wish you well. 
Fall's gone, and winter fell. 
Sent a card to wish you well. You could stay with me, please. 
Come stay with me, please. Next to paw trails in the snow. 
and with the chatter in the cold. 
I'll send a thought to you so 
when you're down, you'll think of home. Or you could stay with me, please. 
Come stay with me, please. Winter skies make me think of you. 
of you. 
In hopes that I will be seeing you. 
Soon. You could stay with me, please. 
Come stay with me, please. 
Come stay with me.
