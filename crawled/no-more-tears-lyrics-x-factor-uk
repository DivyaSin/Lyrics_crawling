It's raining 
It's pouring 
My love life is boring me to tears 
After all these years No sunshine 
No moonlight 
No stardust 
No sign of romance 
We don't stand a chance I always dreamed 
I'd find the perfect lover 
But he turned out to be 
Like every other man I loved, I loved Raining 
Pouring 
There's nothing left for us here 
And we won't waste another tear If you've had enough 
Don't put up 
With his stuff 
Don't you do it Now, if you've had your fill 
Get the check 
Pay the bill 
You can do it Tell him to just get out 
Nothing left to talk about 
Pack his raincoat, show him out 
Just look him in the eye and simply shout Enough is enough is enough 
I can't go on 
I can't go on no more no 
Enough is enough is enough 
I want him out 
I want him out that door now I always dreamed I'd find 
The perfect lover 
But he turned out to be 
Like every other man I loved 
I've had no choice from the start 
I've gotta listen to my heart 
Tearing us apart Enough is enough is enough 
I can't go on 
I can't go on no more no 
Enough is enough is enough 
I want him out 
I want him out that door now Goodbye mister 
Goodbye 
Goodbye mister 
Goodbye sugar No more tears 
No more tears 
No more tears I've had it 
I've had it 
You've had it 
She's had it 
No more tears Is enough, is enough 
Is enough, is enough 
Is enough, is enough 
Is enough, is enough
