From the Isle of Vancouver 
To the Labrador Sea 
One nation, glorious and free 
Where I'm free to be me. From the song of the Prairies 
To the call of the ponds 
Heroes of times come and gone Where the memories go on and on and on 
Oh! Oh! Oh! This is Canada's song (Go Leafs Go) 
Oh! Oh! Oh! Where my heart belongs (Go Leafs Go) Oh! Oh! Oh! This is Canada's team.
