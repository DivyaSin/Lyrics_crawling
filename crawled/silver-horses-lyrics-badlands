Alright 
Running on like the rising sun 
Like a wild horse thundering on 
Fly, fly, fly through the wind and storm 
Now I'm running free Heart and soul 
That's my old bag 
I leave behind a trial of sorrow and pain 
Cry, cry, Lord, he calls my name 
Not even you could take the blame Ride on, silver horses 
Drive, drive past the wind A candle burns for my tortured soul 
In a chapel where she whispers my name 
Pray, pray, pray just to pay my toll 
For sins of yesterday Ride on silver horses 
Drive, drive past the wind 
Ride on silver horses 
Drive on past my sins (Solo) Ride on silver horses 
Drive, drive past the wind 
Ride on silver horses 
Drive on past my sins
