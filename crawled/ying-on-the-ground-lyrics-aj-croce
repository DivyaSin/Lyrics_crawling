Such a strange world that we walk in 
Everyone alone trying to find their way 
Though we try to fly, we never really get away As hard as you might try, you cannot let me down 
'Cause I'm already lying on the ground It?s only human that we question 
All the world around, we are so much the same 
Needing others love and confirmation, the only game As hard as you might try, you cannot let me down 
'Cause I'm already lying on the ground No need for pomp, bring on the circumstance 
I can take the tension, not to mention lack of your romance As hard as you might try, you cannot let me down 
'Cause I'm already lying on the ground So we dig a little deeper, searching for a treasure 
That we?ll never hold 
Though maybe just a little wiser, twice as old As hard as you might try, you cannot let me down 
'Cause I'm already lying on the ground
