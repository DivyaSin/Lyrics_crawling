I can't get past you 
You're everywhere 
In my memory in my every prayer, oh I 
I close my eyes, 
But you're clearer there, 
and I wonder 
Am I under some kinda spell babe? 
Ohhh yeahh I have got this letter, 
that I'm trying to write to you 
I start with hello, 
End up somewhere near I love you, 
So I haven't found a way 
To get it out to you 
I'm scared what you'll say I stopped trying to call 
Stopped trying to get back in your life 
You don't care at all 
I'm not your mother or your wife 
So you know you're free 
To go and be whatever 
you need to be And I'm trying 
to get my life back on the road 
Trying to be myself 
to finally let you go 
So I can get 
beyond this hurt I've come to know Yeah, I want to 
I keep trying to but I I can't get past you 
You're everywhere 
In my memory in my every prayer, oh I 
I close my eyes, 
But you're clearer there, 
and I wonder 
Am I under some kinda spell babe? 
Ohhh yeahh Every single morning 
I wake up just the same way, 
Thinking you might call and say you 
thought of me today 
Yeah, you know I think of you 
But I'm gonna be cool 
Baby like you want me too Oh but its hard to walk away, 
When you believe that love is real 
How did you forget the way 
we made each other feel 
Baby are you sure? 
That you don't need me anymore Oh I want to give you 
all the space you need 
Space to find yourself alone 
with a place for me 
Cause I can't just turn you 
into history Oh, but I want to 
O, I keep trying to but I I can't get past you 
You're everywhere 
In my memory in my every prayer, oh I 
I close my eyes, 
But you're clearer there, 
and I wonder 
I said I wonder 
I wonder why...
