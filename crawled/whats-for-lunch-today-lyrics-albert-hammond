Hammond-Hazelwood You always led me to believe you like me for my own sake 
And I will play along with you. It suits me fine that way 
And I'm such a perfect stepping stone while the friends of friends surround me 
And you never know quite who you'll meet over lunch today You could reach such dizzy heights, if you weren't so self-conscious 
But you, you have to play it cool, and that is quite okay 
'cause I'm such a perfect stepping stone while pretending not to notice 
And you never know quite who you'll meet over lunch today So relax, relax and stick around, and there'll be no bills to pay 
And you never know quite who you'll meet over lunch today You might think that you're original, but we all come up that way 
And the sad part is that you're never sure, if you'll eat today So relax, relax and stick around, and there'll be no bills to pay 
And you never know, no, you never know Who's For Lunch Today?
