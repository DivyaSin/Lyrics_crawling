staring blind; there'sonly darkness 
bothered by too many thoughts 
thoughts of this scattered world 
filled with only bitterness the more I try to ease my mind 
the more sorrow I feel 
the more I try to find the problem 
the less it seems to care walking through a land of memories 
a world that's now irrelevant 
tomorow's comming much to close 
still i've got no peace of mind getting angry at myself 
because of my self-compassion 
as if there are no other problems 
than the life of luxury I live
