Better pack your bags and run 
Or stay until the job is done 
Or maybe you could sit and hope 
That providence will fray the rope And sink like a stone 
Or go it alone And isn't it enough 
For you 
Isn't it enough Baby, you made all the big mistakes 
But duty and love isn't what it takes 
You are the tender of what you know 
Better murder the dream and go If you're you all you've got 
Then I'll tell you what Maybe that's enough 
For you 
Maybe it's enough Maybe it's enough 
For you 
Maybe it's enough
