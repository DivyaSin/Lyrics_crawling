Hey, what's your name? 
Do you live around here? 
Don't I know your face? 
You say I've been a stranger for too long. And I didn't even notice I was gone 
And I want to come back home 
Show me the way to make a start 
Show me the road back to your heart And I've learned the only truth I need to know 
there's a million places I can go, but without you it ain't home. 
Please say 
What I need to hear you say Say I'm thoughtless and foolish 
But say it's not too late 
Now I don't know exactly where we go from here 
Trying is the only way we?ll know And I want to come back home 
Show me the way to make a start 
Show me the road back to your heart 
And I've learned the only truth I need to know There's a million places I can go, but without you it ain't 
It ain't hopeless please believe me. 
Don't give up cause we?re halfway there 
We're at the crossroads in the middle Between hope between despair 
All we need is some direction 
Let me know you're there for me 
Where you are is where I'll be Show me the way to make a start 
Show me the road back to your heart 
And I've learned the only truth I need to know 
There's a million places I can go but without you it ain't home 
It ain't home.
