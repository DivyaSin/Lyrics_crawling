its been a good ride, the words you said to me, 
words that scared me so terribly, 
you see my friend the love was real 
the love was real indeed, I would have walked 1000 miles to see your face again, its been a terrible few years living with a means to an end, if only I could have spoken to you, I tried I tired I tried, you were so tied up with anger it only made me cry. 
I still don't understand you see what really happened to me. 
the only thing I know for sure is for what I have there is no cure, 
The love is real, I keep thinking I will melt. Theres nothing I would not trade to see you once again, I hope and pray that someday you will let me into your heart again, If you find this I want you to know, 
I protected you from the paper 
and what it could have caused, but what it left me with was not worth the cost. 
A giant gaping hole in my heart 
100 miles wide, 
I love you more than you'll ever know 
and Ill never leave your side. 
I never did just for the record.
