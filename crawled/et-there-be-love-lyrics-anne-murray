(Dawn Langstroth) Every life has a plan 
Though sometimes the map is out of our hands 
Every day is a step 
Though we may not know the reason just yet 
When your faith fails 
When your dreams sleep 
Learn to let go, and just let it be CHORUS: 
Let there be love 
Let there be light 
Let there be hope in the dark of the night 
For every heart that's lying in wait 
Let there be love 
Let there be love You are strong 
You are brave 
Though I couldn't even count all the way 
There's a time to be still 
Let the river carry you where it will 
When your faith fails 
When your dreams sleep 
Learn to let go 
Just let it be CHORUS Bridge: 
It's a long, hard road to travel 
Yes, I know what it's like when you lose your way 
When the best laid plans unravel 
That's when you've got to believe CHORUS x3
