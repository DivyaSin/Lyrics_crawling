(Borg, Dregen, Carlsson) I gotta go now, and I don? t need you 
Sometimes it feels like suicide it? s on my mind 
I ain? t got time for a second round 
I gotta go go go `til I find that piece of mind And I hate you and I can break you 
Sometimes you have to realise that I ain? t nice 
I had to break that bitch for a second time 
I gotta go go go `til I find that piece of mind And I ain? t takin? more of your good advice 
I wanna feel like I? m supernatural one more time 
But I doubt that I? m gonna be old 
You know I had to please my soul 
Somehow you feel like me, so why don? t we drop it
