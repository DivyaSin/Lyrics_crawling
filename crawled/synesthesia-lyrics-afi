Heartbreak incarnate. 
I'm nothing if not your memories. 
Heartbreak, please let me be your joy and your pain. Someday I will be, I'll be those common words spoken uniquely. 
Because I may, will forever be, floating as you feel. Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow, 
Letters of past all tear-stained and wrinkled. 
Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow, 
Letters of past all tear-stained and wrinkled. (Just say) Say you will for me (For me) 
Invite me to your memory. 
(Just sing) Sing again for me (For me) 
That long forgotten song. Heartbreak incarnate. 
I'm nothing if not your memories. 
Heartbreak, please let me be your joy and your pain. Someday I will be, I'll be that waking warmth from a fading dream. 
Because I will, I may at best, float as you feel. Please let me haunt as scent on your pillow, 
Letters of past all tear-stained and wrinkled.

That long forgotten song. Let me be all the words, let me be all the words. 
Let me be all the words. Let me be all the words... Let me be all the words echoing comfort. 
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay. 
Let me be all the words echoing comfort. 
Comfort, comfort, comfort. 
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay. 
Unsay, unsay, unsay. Let me be all the words echoing comfort. 
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay. 
Let me be all the words echoing comfort, comfort, comfort. 
Let me be all the words that you'd unsay.
