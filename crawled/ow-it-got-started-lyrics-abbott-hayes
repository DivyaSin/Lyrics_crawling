I want to take photographs of things that are real 
But science does not come to my aid 
It brings forth these questions and theories I feel 
It opposes and challenges my faith 
Like why does the grass grow? 
The leaves turn and fall? 
The moon that draws back all those waves? 
And how'd it get started? We couldn't recall 
That's knowledge too great to be retained She told me that she never liked my opinions 
Call them askew and a waste of her time 
Instead of writing each song with some meaning 
All you do is lie boy, you lie boy you lie 
So what if I've got my convictions 
When the day is done I can say i tried 
Because I can't stop the world from spinning 
But what I can do is take her out of my life I must choose wisely the next note that I play 
It determines the rest of the strain 
The rhythm, the arrangement and melodies made 
It's the only thing keeping me sane 
That's why I absorb myself deep in each song 
In hopes that it whisks me away 
But the parts never last long enough and the chords growing faint 
And eventually the band leaves the stage She told me that she never loved me for my music 
Called it abrasive and tasteless and trite 
Instead of singing each song with some feeling 
All you do it whine boy, you whine, boy you whine 
Watch me as I won't accept her position 
Turned calloused and biased over night (over time) 
I tip my head to the side just grinning 
Singing darling I never loved you for your mind
