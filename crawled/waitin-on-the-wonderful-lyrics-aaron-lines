It's way too easy to live this life 
With your eyes half closed 
And don't I know 
I spend half my time, 
Bored out of my mind 
Sleep walkin'... Well I wake up to this fool's parade 
And I watch the leaves fall down 
I see everything changing 
And somehow I feel caged in 
Just hanging around... I'm waiting on the wonderful 
Something to set me free. 
Out of the ordinary, 
Come and rescue me. Yeah, I could use a little love, love, love 
To set me aside... 
I'm tired of the typical, 
I'm waitin on the wonderful. It's that feeling that's hard to explain 
When the world's so big and your so small 
And you get caught up in the wonder of it all 
That's what I'm missing I saw that look today on that young kids face 
Eating icecream at a laudrymat 
Well if you'd asked him, it was Christmas again. 
I want to get that back. I'm waiting on the wonderful 
On something to belive 
Out of the ordinary, 
The taste of something sweet. Yeah, I could use a little love, love, love 
To set me aside... 
I'm tired of the typical, 
I'm waitin' on the wonderful. Yeah, Yeah, I'm waitin' on the wonderful 
I know it's out there 
I'm waitin' on the wonderful 
On something to believe. 
Out of the ordinary, 
Come and rescue me I could use a little love, love, love 
To send me a sign 
I'm tired of the typical 
I'm waitin' on the wonderful 
Something mystical, 
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
