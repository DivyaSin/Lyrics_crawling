Don't know why 
I'm surviving every lonely day 
When there's got to be 
No chance for me 
My life would end 
And it doesn't matter how I cry 
My tears of love 
Are a waste of time 
If I turn away Am I strong enough to see it through 
Go crazy is what I will do If I can't have you 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh, oh! 
If I can't have you 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, oh oh oh Can't let go 
And it doesn't matter how I try I gave it all so easily 
To you my love To dreams that never will come true 
Am I strong enough to see it through 
Go crazy is what I will do If I can't have you 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh, oh! 
If I can't have you 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, oh oh oh OH! If I can't have you! Ooh! If I can't have you 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh 
(No, don't want nobody) 
If I can't have you 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, oh oh oh 
(I don't want nobody) If I can't have you 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh 
(No nobody) 
If I can't have you 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, oh oh oh 
(No no, no no, no no, no!) If I can't have you 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh 
(No) 
If I can't have you!
