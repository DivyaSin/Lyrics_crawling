Lost in limbo 
Feeling low 
Dealing with the pain 
And a constant rain 
Of tears from a broken heart 
So blue, so blue, So blue 
Let me sing a song for you 
While your world falls apart Close the door 
Dim the lights 
Slip on the head phones 
Close your eyes 
And relax 
You and I alone 
Lost in stereo Your in the hands of the bad love junkie now 
A little blue eyed soul 
In the hands of the bad love junkie now 
Understand that the bad love junkie now has control Welcome to the underground 
Every wound is deep 
Every lover here let down 
Stay as long as you like 
I've know what you need 
To help you through the night On with the show 
Feel the flow 
Songs for a broken heart 
It's true, it's true, it's true 
Let me sing this one for you 
Let the healing start Close the door 
Dim the lights 
Slip on the head phones 
Take a breath 
It's alright 
Steady as we go 
Lost in stereo Your in the hands of the bad love junkie now 
A little blue eyed soul 
In the hands of the bad love junkie now 
In the hands of the bad love junkie now 
Understand that the bad love junkie now has control
