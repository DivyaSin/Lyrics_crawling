Seventeen 
Claiming absolution 
To perceptions of the world 
You believe 
The evidence is clear 
The truths you hold so dear 
You'll always be the same Seventeen 
Trying as they might 
To show you things 
You think you've already seen 
You have no axe to grind 
It's just that you'll be fine 
You'll always be the same 
You're the same Seventeen Seventeen 
Your hopes and dreams 
Are pressed between the pages 
Of your reality 
The feelings are ingrained 
You have no heart to change 
You'll always be the same 
You're the same Seventeen Seventeen 
You'll never see it coming 
When you blink 
And then it's all history 
The way you think will change 
You'll never be the same 
You'll never be the same 
You'll never be the same Seventeen
