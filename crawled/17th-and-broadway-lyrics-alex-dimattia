This is not the story of 
Happily ever was 
This is never came to be But on the last day I was 23 
She had coffee with me 
Finally 
And we shared some February air 
On a bench in Union Square 
New York City And I never will forget 
The way I felt when our eyes met 
At 17th and Broadway 
17th and Broadway The second time we met 
Was on seventy second 
In the rain 
She had lipstick on her teeth 
Lit a fire deep beneath 
my pain, my pain And as we got into that cab 
It brought me right 
Well it brought right back 
The way I felt at 
17th and Broadway 
When she smiled at me 
And took my breath away 
At 17th and Broadway 
17th and Broadway I still remember the first time 
I saw her dancing in the sunshine 
It took me four years to say hi 
But when she smiled 
It changed my life Well we had one more date 
In the garden of the empire state 
Before she just stopped talking to me 
And I would love to tell you how 
This all worked out 
But this is not the story of 
Happily ever 
Cause this is never Well these are my 
Three dates 
In the empire state 
And how I fell 
For her smile These are my three dates 
In the empire state 
And how it changed my life These are my three dates 
In the empire state 
And 17th and Broadway 
17th and Broadway
