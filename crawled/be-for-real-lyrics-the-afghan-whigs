Are you back in my life to stay 
Or is it just for today 
Oh that you need me 
If its a thrill you're lookin for 
Well honey I am flexible 
Oh yeah 
Just.... 
Be for real 
Won't you baby 
Be for real 
Won't you baby 
You see I, I don't want, to be hurt by love again 
You can understand baby, can't you? 
Now you see I am not naive 
But I would like to believe 
Oh what you tell me 
So don't give me the world today 
And then tomorrow take it away 
Don't do that to me darling 
No.... 
Be for real 
Won't you baby 
Be for real 
Won't you baby 
You see I, I don't want, to be hurt by love again 
Be for real 
Won't you baby 
Be for real 
Won't you baby 
You see I, I don't want, to be hurt by love again 
Because I, don't want, to be hurt by love again
