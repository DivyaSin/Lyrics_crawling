Sometimes I really think it's over 
But your blue eyes have never lost a fool 
One kiss and I'm right back believing 
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you You always find all the scattered pieces 
Your words turn lies back into truth 
Your love opens every door it closes 
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you Your touch knows the fine art of healing 
Your heart knows when to make it's move 
Practice makes perfect, don't it, darling 
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you You always find all the scattered pieces 
Your words turn lies back into truth 
Your love opens every door it closes 
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you 
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you
