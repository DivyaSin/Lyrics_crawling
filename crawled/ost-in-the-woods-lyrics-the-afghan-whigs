Surprise surprise 
I'll have you know I've come to see you die 
I'm hard to find 
You'll never tell You know me by now 
You know me by now 
You do Raison why? 
Call it conversation 
Call it occupation 
We'll be here awhile 
Baisons now, 
Before it's too late 
Before you betray yourself 
And I to you Went to the levy 
Dove into the water 
Dove into the water 
Unchaining my light Fate, the believer 
Sanctified redeemer 
Camouflaged deceiver 
So covetous, I 
But you Baby, 
Sitting outside in the cold 
I can see that you're not alone 
That's vanity swallowing u 
Come and see 
How, baby 
Soon she'll be picking her teeth Not dead 
I'll see you all again 
In time we all descend 
Not yet 
And I won't leave til I know what I need to know 
You know me by now 
You know me by now Baby, 
Fear has a mind of its own 
Undress, it'll seep in your bones 
And I see how it waited for you 
And I see how it baited the hook 
Now you're gone and you ain't coming back Baby, 
Sitting outside in the cold 
I can see that you're not alone 
Calamity following you 
Come and see 
That baby, 
Sin is a line in a poem 
Unknown with a need to be known 
A throne in a room with a view 
but you're lost in the woods
