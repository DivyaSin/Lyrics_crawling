Another cheap hole as hotel room. 
Another place another show. 
Another meaning less 
Destination with nowhere to go. Another time to say "I love you" 
Another time to say "good night" 
Another time to hear a dial tone 
'Cause no one wants to fight. 
Why should we fight? 'Cause I can see it in you're eyes 
Is the sparkle gone forever? 
Don't say forever! 
And I can feel it when we touch 
Is the fire out forever? 
Don't say forever! Another time to miss a birthday 
Another time to miss my flight 
I've missed so much, that I don't know what I have 
And what I thought I mind 
What I mind 'cause I can see it in you're eyes 
Is the sparkle gone forever? 
Don't say forever! 
And I can feel it when we touch 
Is the fire out forever? 
Don't say forever! Now I'm lying beside you 
A stranger in you're arms. 
We drift apart together 
And come back like a storm 
Like a storm Another show up Decatur 
Another one in San Antone 
Somewhere else in this equator, 
Takes me far away from home 
I'm coming home 'cause I can see it in you're eyes. 
The sparkle shines forever 
This is forever 
And I can feel it when we touch 
The fire burns forever 
This is forever
