I welcome you to paradise 
It's what you wished for 
A mountain of filth haunted by tortured shrieks of the dead 
I know you'll love it here Time stops and once again i'm stranded nowhere 
And yet again I'm so confused 
Why stop 
It honestly can't get much worse 
And I'm better off here than on my own Step right up, come one and all 
I will be your host tonight 
Welcome to the dreams of hell 
You're in for a wild ride It's strange but I feel right at home 
It's odd but I don't want to go 
Am I a fool, am I crazy to want to stay, do I belong 
Another time, another place, this will do just fine Foolish mortal, what did you think 
That you'd shackle the hands of time 
And defeat the gods themselves 
Sweet vanity you're my favorite sin 
Swallow mountains and choke on them 
Then drown yourself on Lazarus 
Spread your wings and grab the sun 
Sweet vanity you're my favorite sin Pretty lady let's dance 
I bet you thought that you could choose to leave 
Everybody is dead 
You're all alone and i'm the one, the only one, yeah I'll do whatever it takes 
Oh, what's another mistake Back and forth and upside down as we laugh ourselves to sleep 
We're trying to escape 
An evil place so full of wonder taking a hold of me Feeling the pressure, I should be over you 
Slave to the pleasure, I can't get over you 
Tonight we'll try to pretend that we're alright, yea 
Say its forever, don't let me fade away Everything's gone, everything's lost 
What have I done, can it be undone 
Where did you go, will I find you 
This is our home, sweet home 
The canvas went up in flames Pretty lady let's dance 
I bet you thought that you could choose to leave 
Everybody is dead 
You're all alone and i'm the one, the only one, yeah I'll do whatever it takes 
Oh, what's another mistake Back and forth and upside down as we laugh ourselves to sleep 
We're trying to escape 
An evil place so full of wonder taking a hold of me Feeling the pressure, I should be over you 
Slave to the pleasure, I can't get over you 
Tonight we'll try to pretend that we're alright, yea 
Say its forever, don't let me fade away 
I'm everything you want, I'm everything you need 
You're everything to me, don't let me fade away Foolish mortal, what did you think 
That you'd shackle the hands of time 
And defeat the gods themselves 
Sweet vanity you're my favorite sin 
Swallow mountains and choke on them 
Then drown yourself on Lazarus 
Spread your wings and grab the sun 
Sweet vanity you're my favorite sin Parting is such sweet sorrow 
Come back to me soon my dear 
I will be counting the days 
Farewell my love 
This is our home, sweet home 
Drench yourself in the cries of the damned 
Spill their blood 
Bathe in bliss as we torture the sane 
Help me, God
