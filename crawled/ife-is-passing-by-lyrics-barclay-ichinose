Dawn of another day 
Will someone remember what might happen today 
Lost is my hope 
For my eyes to meet yours again now Life passes by even without you 
But everything will someday reach an end While you, where are you then? 
You are living your life, while I am leaving mine My life is passing by even without you 
But now I fear it's to late for us to have regrets Life isn't it strange 
Well I did all that I could to make it worthwhile Life passed by even without you 
Strange how it all looks different from here
