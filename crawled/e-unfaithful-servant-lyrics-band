Unfaithful servant, I hear you leaving soon in the morning 
What did you do to the lady, that she's gonna have to send you away? 
Unfaithful servant, you don't have to say you're sorry, 
If you done it just for the spite, or did ya do it just for the glory? 
Like a stranger you turned your back 
Left your keys and gone to pack 
Bear in mind who's to blame, and all the shame She really cared, the time she spared and the home you shared. 
Unfaithful servant, I can hear the whistle blowing 
Yes, that train is a-coming and soon you'll be going 
Let us not bow our heads for we won't be complaining Life has been good to us all 
Even when that sky is raining 
To take it like a grain of salt 
Is all I can do it's no one's fault 
Makes no difference if we fade away 
It's just as it was, it's much to cold for me to stay Goodbye to that country home 
So long to a lady I have known 
Farewell to my other side 
I'd best just take it in stride 
Unfaithful Servant, you'll learn to find your place
