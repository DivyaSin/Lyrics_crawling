Penelope, I guarantee 
You've never seen a thing like this 
Gravity has taken leave from my bedroom 
You must come 
You must come and see me 
I'm bouncing high above my bed 
And all the spiders outside Penelope, you must believe 
The sun will always shine on me 
And I will wear this golden hat for no one else 
You must come 
You must come and see me 
The sun will blind us 
And we'll fall about together, my dear Penelope, you must agree 
I've spilt like milk inside your head 
And you must be very glad I've called again 
You must come 
You must come and see me 
I'll chant your name until you're stepping off the bus here today 
Until you're climbing up the steps to my room 
I'll be waiting on the edge of the ledge 
I'll shout your name until I see you again
