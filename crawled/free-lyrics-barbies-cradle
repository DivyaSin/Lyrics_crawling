If I leave in silence 
Would you notice me 
Would you hate my absence 
Would you drown in your misery If i leave with a reason 
would you argue to your grave 
would you hold on to a promise 
like a master keeps a slave I throw the question 
to see if you feel the same 
because there is nothing 
i wouldn't sacrifice 
for you I am too tired to cry 
don't you leave me to die 
I have become at peace 
as you set me free On my last confession 
the final breath i take 
will you look me in the eyes 
and say my name the only consolation 
is you remember me that way 
with the butterflies 
and the happy times we made I throw the question to see if you feel the same 
because there is nothing 
to replace you
