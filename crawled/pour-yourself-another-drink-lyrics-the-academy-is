Pour yourself a drink girl, then make one for me. 
We haven't even met yet, and I'm already sure that we won't. 
..and I'm right back where I started. 
The air in here is shaking every single nerve. 
I'm trying hard to let go, but my heart, it won't let me love you. 
..and I'm right back where I started. Right back... 
Moving on up. We're walking on the edge. 
Everyone here has demons in their past 
Now move it on up. You're walking on the edge. 
Everyone here has demons in their past now. The only thing worse for you than you is me. 
The only thing worse for you than you is me. 
The life that I've chosen to live will take your heart and swallow it 
The only thing worse for you than you is to make you wait for me. 
And that's why we will never meet.
