I tried and tried a thousand times I tried to get to You 
But I could never move 
I had to lie, Id fall behind and blame it all on You 
Cause I still hate to lose 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Towers fall and kingdoms crumble 
The mountains bow and the earth will tremble 
At the sound of Your name 
At the sound of Your name The strong man falls to Him who humbles 
The plans he made were bound to stumble 
And only You remain 
Only You remain, oh, oh, oh I cried and cried a thousands tears I cried because of You 
I lost my one excuse 
And I had to die along with everything inside of me removed 
But now I live with You, You 
Oh, oh, oh Towers fall and kingdoms crumble 
The mountains bow and the earth will tremble 
At the sound of Your name 
At the sound of Your name The strong man falls to Him who humbles 
The plans he made were bound to stumble 
And only You remain 
Only You remain So man can reach the sky 
If he builds his own device 
But still hes far away from You Hes underneath Your eyes 
As he plans his own demise 
Whats new to him is old to You 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh His kingdom fell and his heart was troubled, yeah 
I feel the same, I feel the same The strong man falls to Him who humbles 
He demands a man who wont stumble 
And thats why He came 
Yeah, thats why He came Towers fall and kingdoms crumble 
The mountains bow and the earth will tremble 
At the sound of Your name 
At the sound of Your name The strong man falls to Him who humbles 
The plans he made were bound to stumble 
Only You remain 
Only You remain Only You remain 
Only You remain, oh, oh
