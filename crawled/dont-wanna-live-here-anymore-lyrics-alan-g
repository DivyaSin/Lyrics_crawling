So what is there to say now 
Maybe not a lot 
On this road that leads me from my town 
They slammed the door behind me 
Taken all I've got 
Called me every name and kicked me down But the Heavens don't believe 
When they say that they love me 
I can see right through the lies that pass as creed But folks 'round here don't understand 
I'm just bein' who I am 
How can they know just how it feels 
To live a life you must conceal So runnin' away's my only plan 
Cuz secrets can destroy a man 
If I cannot be free to say 
All that my heart proves anyway 
Then I won't stay here one more day What should I hide a secret for 
If I can't open up this door 
I don't wanna live here anymore So what is there to do now 
Maybe not a lot 
Goodbye small town, I'm not what you had hoped 
It's really very easy 
But people always got 
A need to keep the walls that blind them most Maybe one day I'll return 
Watch this door ripped down and burned 
But the truth will be defied until they learn Cuz folks 'round here don't understand 
I wanna be the man I am 
How can they know just how it feels 
To be denied a love that's real 
Livin' a life you can't reveal So runnin' away's my only chance 
Cuz hatred can destroy a man 
If I cannot be free to say 
All that my heart proves anyway 
Then I won't stay here one more day What should I hide a secret for 
If I can't open up this door 
I don't wanna live here anymore
