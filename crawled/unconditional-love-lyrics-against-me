Unraveling, unrolled, a siren in the night 
I love the jaundice of your skin 
Its perverse plasticity 
You make me want to smoke cigarettes 
You make me want to drink whiskey Even if your love was unconditional 
It still wouldn't be enough to save me My sycophant love song 
My authentic desperation 
I'm addicted to the feeling 
The only kind of steady I believe in 
Prison cell exercises 
Solitary sport entertainment 
What makes you think 
You're going to die any different? Even if your love was unconditional 
It still wouldn't be enough to save me
