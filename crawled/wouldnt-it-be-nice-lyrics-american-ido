The name of the the song is Wouldn't it be nice if we were older 
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long 
Wouldn't it be nice to live together 
In the kind of world where we belong You know its gonna make it that much better 
When we can say goodnight and stay together Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up 
In the morning when the day is new 
And after having spent the day together 
Hold each other close the whole night through Happy times together we've been spending 
I wish that every kiss was never ending 
Wouldn't it be nice Maybe if we think and wish and hope 
And pray it might come true 
Run, run, run 
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do 
We could be married 
We could be, we could be married and happy 
And then we'd be happy Wouldn't it be nice Goodnight baby 
Sleep tight baby 
Goodnight baby
