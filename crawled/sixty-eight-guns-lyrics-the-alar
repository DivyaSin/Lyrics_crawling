And now they are trying to take my life away 
Forever young I cannot stay, on every corner I can 
See them there. They don't know my name they 
Don't know my kind. They're after you with their Promises. they're after you to sign your life away. 
For living in the backstreets that's our home from 
Home. the painted walls are all we've ever known 
And "The Guns Forever" that's our battle cry. it is The flag that we fly so high and every day they try 
To drag us down but I cry with anfer I have done 
No crime. For up no the terrace I can hear the 
Crowd roar and down in the subway I can hear Them whisper and through all the ragin glory of 
The years we never once thought of the fears fir 
What we'd do when the battle cry was over. 
Nothing lasts forever is all they seem to tell you
