Fill the blank spots in 
With childish gibberish 
What seems to be the difference 
As we only will digress And I need you more today 
Let's talk about the government 
Then you walk away 
Don't walk away You're so invincible 
So damn consumable 
Oh, just deliver it 
You're so unbeatable You're so delectable 
Even though impossible 
Very much untouchable 
You're so unbeatable Can you figure it out 
Develop your moment 
Rejection is bliss 
Ignorance is almost And I need you more today 
Let's talk about the development 
Then you walk away 
Don't walk away You're so invincible 
So damn consumable 
Oh, just deliver it 
You're so unbeatable You're so delectable 
Even though impossible 
Very much untouchable 
You're so unbeatable Anyway you figure it 
We will all die soon enough 
The trick is to be the first You're so invincible 
So damn consumable 
Oh, just deliver it 
You're so unbeatable You're so delectable 
Even though impossible 
Very much untouchable 
You're so unbeatable And you go and you go 
You're so unbeatable 
And you go and you go 
You're so unbeatable
