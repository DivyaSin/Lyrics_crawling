Heaven has already granted me my wish 
Still I never thought it would be as pleasant as this 
Though you have no wings like the angels up above 
You have a heavenly smile and also the gift of love 
I promise to love you in everything I do 
and know that you love me to And I, I, I thank heaven 
Darling I, I, I thank heaven 
For sending you here to fill my loneliness 
And to fill my lonely heart with love And I am going to get down on my knees everyday 
and thank heaven 
For what he sent to me today 
I promise to love you in everything I do 
And know that you love me to And I, I, I thank heaven 
Oh, I, I, I thank heaven 
Darling I, I, I thank heaven 
For sending you here to fill my loneliness 
And to fill my lonely heart with love Oh, I, I, I thank heaven 
Darling I, I, I thank heaven 
Said I am going to get down on my knees 
I am going to thank him for what he sent to me For sending you here, to fill my loneliness 
To fill my lonely heart with love
