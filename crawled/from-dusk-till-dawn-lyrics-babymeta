Something's got to go 
Something's got to go In the air 
Pray your way 
In the air the air It got better 
Don't start slow, then 
(Something's got to go) 
It got better 
Don't start slow, then 
(Something's got to go) Dream sing 
Climate the weather 
Hot colder 
And warm memories Get off my face 
More day after day 
And reaching to fate 
So instincts so faint 
I'll wake from the dream 
To keep and relive 
'Cause life it is a dream 
And dream's on a break While it's over 
Never ever 
While it's over 
Never ever In the air 
In the air
