No, I don't wanna be 
Part of just another conspiracy 
There's people in high places 
Who say it's all a lie 
And the rest of us have gotta know 
Before we up and die, and say goodbye 
They deny everything 
They talk a lot but still don't say a fuckin' thing 
The lies are bought and sold 
On the newsstands every day 
And when we get the answers, the headlines 
On the papers will say: 
Surprise, surprise, we saw through the lies 
What was that I saw flyin' through the desert sky? 
Surprise, surprise, they're from outer space 
It's not a movie or a story, it's another race 
You think you know everything 
Can't open your mind to the possibility 
That somewhere far away in our unknown galaxy 
There exist another form of life 
Kept in the dark for centuries
