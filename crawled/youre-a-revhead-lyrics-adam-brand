If you've ever dropped the clutch, you're a rev head 
If you've ever smoked 'em up, you're a rev head 
If your tyres are wide and your t-shirt's black 
Your very first date was at the speedway track 
It's time to face the fact you're a rev head If you love Peter Brock you're a rev head 
If you've ever chucked a lap round the block, you're a rev head 
If you've got a spoiler and a set of mags 
Lost a few points and won a few drags 
Well you ain't one of the dags, 
You're a rev head GTS or XR8 
XU1 or Chevrolet 
Music up Hammer down 
The words all over town 
You're a rev head If your man talks nothin' but cars, he's a rev head 
And for Christmas he wants 
Spare parts, he's a rev head 
So you want him to sweep 
You off your toes A bubble bath 
And a long stem rose But he buys you 
A radiator hose, he's a rev head GTS or XR8 XU1 or Chevrolet 
Music's up Hammer down The words all over town 
You can settle down with kids and a wife 
But when a Chevy pulls up by you at the lights 
Your foot goes down and your knuckles go white 
You're an are-E-V H-E-A-D Rev 'em up boys
