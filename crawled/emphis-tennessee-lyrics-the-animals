Long distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee 
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me 
She did not leave her number but I know the place to call 
The phone boy took the message and he wrote it on the wall I said help me information get in touch with my Marie 
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis Tennessee 
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge 
About a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge Oh help me information, more than this I cannot add 
Only that I love Marie and all the fun we had 
But we were pulled apart now 'cause her momma did not agree 
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee I said help me information, more than this I cannot add 
Only that I miss Marie and all the fun we had 
But she was pulled apart from me 'cause her momma did not agree 
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee
