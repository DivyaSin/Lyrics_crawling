We're buried beneath with mountains to climb 
We're drowning away with water and wine 
Were you watching the wolves, our very first kiss 
Wipe the tears from your face, the taste from your lips We'll sit in communion, our hands in our laps 
Writing prayers for a God who will never pray back 
We won't last for forever, make best with your time 
We're the last of our fathers, the first of our kind So no one believes me, it wasn't so easy to say 
I offered the world to a heartbroken girl 
and she left me and stole it away 
This may sound ruthless, so honest and useless 
but no one believes what I say 
Oh I'll follow the birds, 
'cause they're always there to chase I'll sit here remembering what I have got left 
The scars; the words that escape from my chest 
Let the birds fly for winter to the heat of the south 
I will die by the summer, I will die by myself In the freshest of airs, the calmest of storms 
With the blue lights approaching I'll lay in your arms 
I will die like religion, I'm weak with my facts 
But the people will wait, oh the birds will come back So Father believe me, it wasn't so easy to say 
I offered the world to a heartbroken girl 
and she left me and stole it away 
This may sound ruthless, so honest and useless 
but no one believes what I say 
Oh I'll follow the birds, 
'cause they're always there to chase
