Sometimes 
You can be in the wrong place, at the right time 
Sometimes 
You can fall for the right one, at the wrong time Every look, has a notion 
Every kiss, throws me emotion 
Every smile shows a little devotion 
I know that I've thrown it away 
In just three words Sometimes 
I wish we were far away, in another town, in another place 
Sometimes 
I wish, just once, you'd reach for me and show your love Every look, has me believing 
Every kiss, has a meaning 
Every time I think, I must be dreaming 
I know that I've thrown it away 
In just three words Every look, has a notion 
Every kiss, throws me emotion 
Every smile shows a little devotion 
I know that I've thrown it away I know that I've thrown it away 
In just three words
