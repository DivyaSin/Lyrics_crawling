last friday night u talked 
just'bout the weather 
yesterday's theme 
were chemics and news 
for even ten days 
u shun senseful talks 
i call u a man with a heart cold as ice 
start hurting your pride to get to know 
what's inside 
i have allready waited much too long u didn't get me, babe 
u misconsive me 
so please tell me 
what is wrong with u 
u didn't take my meaning 
i only tell u what i've at heart i only want u to be my friend i cannot comprehend why u are angry 
i meant nothing else but (to) "listen to me" 
are u belivin' 
in my secret love to u
