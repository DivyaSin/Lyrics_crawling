love/hate relationship 
aaaaa You make me wanna explode, but somehow we fit 
Why do you tell me I'm gold, then treat me like 
Nothing I do is good enough, yeah you're the perfect one 
I know that I should run, but I don't wanna leave It's a love/hate relationship, I love to hate you, I gotta admit 
It's a love/hate relationship, you're the drug that I just can't kick 
I guess I like it 
aaaaa Wish I could go back before you got me in bed 
Now everyday is a war, but you give the best 
After we're through I can't complain 
It's such a dirty game 
I know that I should run, but I don't wanna leave 
Even though I know that you don't give a f**k about me It's a love/hate relationship, I love to hate you, I gotta admit 
It's a love/hate relationship, you're the drug that I just can't kick 
I guess I like it 
aaaaa If I knew what I know now, I would have never got in 
I thought I had you down, I never saw this coming 
I cannot wait for the day when I can finally get out 
I wanna see your face, you wanna f**k me now It's a love/hate relationship, I love to hate you, I gotta admit 
It's a love/hate relationship, you're the drug that I don't wanna kick 
I guess I like it
