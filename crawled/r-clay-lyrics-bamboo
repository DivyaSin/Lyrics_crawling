Red Sun dawn 
Guns are drawn 
Skull and bones 
Beast of war 
Father help me stop this 
Rush of blood to the head 
Look at you I see red 
Start the game 
I'll end it By this hate that you help the world create 
Ive been sent 
Now repent 
I'm the war that comes to you 
I'm the plague that follows through I've been told 
You've been warned 
To stop the hatred you have spawned 
The qualms you have are stupid 
By this movement manifest 
Lord I'll put you to the test 
Yet you fail 
Now the blind that follow you 
Will burn in hell with you All by my self 
I know that I stand here alone 
All your lies they feed me 
I'm stronger now 
Stronger now than I was before 
There's no way you can 
Hurt me 
Move me 
Stop me Talk too much motherfucker hush 
You had your chance to change things 
Move in the direction of right 
Choose to set the bar 
But then you had to pick a fight 
So what's daddy done for you lately? 
Bought you the throne 
Like stealing candy from a baby 
Line your pockets with mucho dinero 
Paid in full with the blood of the people So now you got the fires rockin 
Blood and hate 
Then you got the people talking 
Legacy 
You will never be forgotten 
Your place in history 
A black mark in time 
A black mark in time All by my self 
I know that I stand here alone 
All your lies they feed me 
I'm stronger now 
Stronger now than I was before 
There's no way you can 
Hurt me 
Move me 
Stop me Peace and flowers 
Will kill the superpower 
The fall of Rome is near 
Can't you hear? 
It's been written, it's been said 
The revelations I have read 
The signs are here 
Those days are over 
Walk away from the line 
For now is the time All by my self 
I know that I stand here alone 
All your lies they feed me 
I'm stronger now 
Stronger now than I was before 
There's no way you can 
Hurt me 
Move me 
Stop me
