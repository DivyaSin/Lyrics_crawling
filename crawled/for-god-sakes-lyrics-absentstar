Sleep in a bed I made 
Wake in another place 
Cold on the warmest day 
I dream its a big mistake Running aground 
Mile after mile 
Shouting all the while For god sakes, hold it down 
The noises overtake the silence I create 
For god sakes, Im calling out 
To anyone who fears falling on deaf ears Far from the way I felt 
Hunt for my former self 
Why did I even try and the strangest thing is 
Remembering how I got this way Running aground 
Mile after mile 
Shouting all the while For god sakes, hold it down 
The noises overtake the silence I create 
For god sakes, Im calling out 
To anyone who fears falling on deaf ears And if you get it someday 
What of yourself remains Oh, and for god sakes, hold it down 
The noises overtake the silence I create 
For god sakes, for god sakes 
For god sakes, hold it down 
For god sakes, hold it down
