Everybody ready? 
Everybody ready? I'll be the first in line 
The race is on no end is here 
But I can't be second best 
The flags are wavin' in the air Feel adrenaline it's burning 
When you taste blood 
It's just a warning On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready? 
On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready? I'll be the first to know 
This track is built for showing gold 
It ain't no time to turn 
The final state is no remorse Feel adrenaline it's burning 
When you taste blood 
It's just a warning On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready? 
On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready? On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready? 
On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready? I'll be the first to go 
On concrete snow and overload 
Ain't got that inner fear 
If hell awaits or heaven's near Feel adrenaline it's burning 
Insanity you keep on learning 
For every match you break, for every step you take 
When you taste blood it's just a warning On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready? 
On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready? On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready? 
On your marks, get set 
Everybody ready?
