Starin' out the window 
from an unmade bed 
I got no reason to live 
No reason to be dead 
Those unnamed blues are with me today 
I got no reason to leave 
No reason to stay Sun in the night, dark in the day 
In a January thaw, frosted in May Searching for salvation 
in a stranger's eyes 
The sooner I sink, 
the sooner I'll rise So honey, don't you try to analyze it 
Just tell me why's it that 
Babies are born happy 
though sometimes they've got to cry 
Babies got that sweet contentment 
So why is it that you and I 
Get no relief? 
Got no belief? 
Steal like a thief through our days 
feeling lost and alone 
when baby we were born happy 
Where'd we lose that 
sweet contentment? Flyin' to an island 
on a silver plane 
But we just 
can't escape 
the growin' pains 
'Cause the ghost 
and the smoke 
of a nightmare past 
will be chasing us 
down twice as fast 
So honey don't it 
hurt to realize it? 
we can't disguise it chorus
