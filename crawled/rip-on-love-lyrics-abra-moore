I let my guard down in the momentary lapse of emotion 
It just slipped out and we both knew my heart could be broken 
I said something I never intended to say, you stopped laughing 
And I said do you feel alone in that way? [Chorus:] 
Do you trip on love? Do you run from magic? 
When you kiss someone, do you make it tragic? 
If you feel too much, do you start to panic? 
When the word comes up, do you trip on love? I just stood there, I'd expected another reaction. 
Out of thin air came the strangest sense of satisfaction. 
Can you tell me how you see me so well? 
If you help me would you let me see that part of yourself? [Chorus] 
Do you trip on love? Do you run from magic? 
When you kiss someone, do you make it tragic? 
If you feel too much, do you start to panic? 
When the word comes up, do you trip on love? Where do we go? 
Do we say this means less than we know it does? 
Please tell me. [Chorus] 
Do you trip on love? Do you run from magic? 
When you kiss someone, do you make it tragic? 
If you feel too much, do you start to panic? 
When the word comes up, do you trip on love? [Repeat: x1] Don't you want to love me no more? 
I just want to love you some more.
