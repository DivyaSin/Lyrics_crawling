I'm gonna rape your fertile land 
And plant my seed in your mother 
Fuckin' listen to me 
Obey my laws worship my God 
'cause your just an obstruction 
And your holding back production 
It's a free land of opportunity 
Where my people can prosper 
So we'll take your land and offer you lies 
And take your lives and your land 
With one sweep of my hand I'll take it all away 
But I've got a solution 
To rid our world of this human pollution 
Lay down and die 
And here's a blanket full of smallpox 
To keep your children warm and put a stop to you 
Lay down and die 
Here's some land not fit for us to live on 
It's called a reservation 
And we've reserved it just for you 
Your obstructing the flow of our progress 
And we destroy what we can't control 
But I've got a solution 
To rid our world of this human pollution 
Lay down and die 
So have a drink on all of us 
And cloud your vision so you're blind to what we do to you 
Lay down and die
