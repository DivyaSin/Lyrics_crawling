You go up to release 
You release, you go down 
And at times I can see your face now 
Up in the air, celestial sound 
When the shadows keep your face now 
Even even the time flows over 
Now waste away ooh 
Even even the time flows (away) 
Even even the time flows over me 
Deep inside the beautiful lies that's all there is Love is a house and you got the keys 
I'm like a city mouse, mama you got the cheese 
James Brown's song please, please, please try me 
Mama don't leave 
So how do we keep the music playing? 
How do we keep our love song from fading out 
Even if the sun burns out 
Mama don't leave cause I can't live without You go up to release 
You release, you go down 
And at times I can see your face now 
Up in the air, celestial sound 
When the shadows keep your face now 
Even even the time flows over 
Now waste away ooh 
Even even the time flows (away) 
Even even the time flows over me 
Deep inside the beautiful lies that's all there is When a man loves a woman 
When a man loves a wo- old man 
He will travel far lands 
And cross the deepest seas 
Send his soldiers to war 
Like Trojans and Greeks 
Many kings lost their lands at a woman's hand 
Marie Antoinette caused the fall of France 
So good was her love that my circumstance 
It left me in the mud for a second chance 
I'm in a love debt because I owe some much 
She was with the Joneses I was trying to keep up 
Trying to keep my feet above water, fell off the cliff 
Can I get a lift? Can I get a tip? 
Oh ain't that a trip 
When love makes you slip into a love debt 
Into regret 
But I would do it all again 
Just to hold her skin
