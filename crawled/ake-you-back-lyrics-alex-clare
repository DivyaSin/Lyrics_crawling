Take me back 
Take me back, we belong Rooster run deep here 
So why don't we just run 
Take me back, take me back You heard what I did way back then 
Hurt you, I know, but, girl, I need a friend 
I'm so tired of these old cliches, 
Sick of looking out my window at these gray-lining days You know we can leave today Take you back 
I got to (take you back) 
I wanna (take you back) 
Leave me alone 
Who's gonna run deep here 
So why don't we just run Still love the city, I owe it so much 
These days I'm lost in the crowd, I feel out of touch 
These streets raised me, taught me what's fair 
But you and I, girl, we gotta future elsewhere We got people on the Southside of L.A. 
Here in Jerusalem the chance will get away 
We could land in in Brooklyn and then again, no 
It's too much like London with its red echo You know we can leave today Take you back 
I got to (take you back) 
I wanna (take you back) 
Leave me alone 
Rooster run deep here 
So why don't we just run Oh, we're going home 
Oh, we're going home 
Oh, we're going home 
Take you back (oh, we're going home) 
Take you back (oh, we're going home) 
Take you back (oh, we're going home) Oh, we're going home 
Oh, we're going home 
Oh, we're going home 
Oh, we're going home 
Oh, we're going home
