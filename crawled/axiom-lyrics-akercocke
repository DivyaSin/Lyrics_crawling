Summer sitting out by the pool 
A ray of sunshine getting in my way 
Close your eyes and wish that it were cool, everyday And I wish it could be back the other way 
But what's dissolved ain't coming back today 
Close your eyes and wish that it were 
Close your eyes and wish that it were Axilla axilla axilla axilla Never understood what my body was for 
That's why, I always leave it layin' out on the floor 
The shape a curiosity, where different faces fit before
