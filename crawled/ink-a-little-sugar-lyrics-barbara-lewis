Don't want a holly golly 
Don't wanna do the twist 
I just wanna sit & talk with you, baby 
All night long about the things we missed together 
So if you'll just think a little sugar 
If you'll just think a little sugar You'll find you're wasting an awful lot of valuable time 
Don't wanna hear no radio 
I don't wanna hear no jams 
I just wanna sit & talk with you, baby 
I'll tell you just how lonely I have been 
So just think a little sugar Think a little sugar 
& you'll find you're wasting an awful lot of valuable time 
If we could have stayed together I know 
The days & nights we spent alone 
Would have been the love over the years 
& there wouldn't have been any tears But I don't wanna talk about a dance 
For the dance has gone 
I just wanna sit & talk with you, baby 
All about the future, but it's been so long 
So just think a little sugar 
Think a little sugar 
& you'll find we've wasted enough of our valuable time 
& you'll find we've wasted enough of our valuable time
