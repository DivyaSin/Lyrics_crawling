Some days 
I get a thrill 
In my brains 
Some days I'm trying to turn to my veins See a face 
Into the mirror 
Reflecting 
On the surface of fear Because you know 
I'm never better 
Than that 
Some days are worse 
Than you can imagine How am I supposed 
To live with that? 
On this train wreck is coming a random Hey 
What are you gonna do 
When those walls 
Are falling down 
Falling down on you? Hey 
What are you gonna do 
When those walls 
Are falling down 
Falling down on you? You got warheads 
Stacked in the kitchen 
You treat distraction 
Like an instant religion The battlesticks snap 
At the rhythm 
You give your best 
With the souls You've been given 
Cause you know 
You're nothing 
Special to them Going someplace 
You've already been 
Trying to make sense 
Of what They call wisdom 
And this riff-raff 
Life ain't with them Hey 
What are you gonna do 
When those walls 
Are falling down 
Falling down on you? Hey 
What are you gonna do 
When those walls 
Are falling down 
Falling down on you? You're wearing all 
Of the years on your face 
Turn a tombstone 
You roll into place 
And your heart Only beats in a murmur 
But your words ring out just 
Like murder
