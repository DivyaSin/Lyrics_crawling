In this house of suffering 
I gotta let some joy in 
I hear that freedom will win Oh, where, oh, where can Jah love be now? 
My dear, it's here in the underground 
Inside the hearts of your own children In this house of suffering 
I spiritualogic grinnin' 
One way grace is my friend 
To conquer doom and sin And all the nations lying 
While all our people crying 
And they stop at nothing 
Nothing, nothing
