(RZA) 
Unable to become immortalized in life 
Ghostface became immortalized in death 
Creating a mayhem so vast 
That the tell of his rampage will be passed down for generations 
Gangstas told theyre children 
To never double cross a man whos will is so strong that he could cross the plains of existence to get his revenge 
And there you have it 
The story of the Ghostface Killah
