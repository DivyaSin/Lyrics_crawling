[First Verse] 
Night drapes the sky 
You close the doors 
Close the blinds 
We have an undercover discussion 
Maybe get down with a little lovin' 
Tonight, in this bed 
Hands holding hands 
Perfect match 
To light a cigarette [Chorus] 
If this is what you want 
Then don't let me get in your way 
Oh, no no no 
Freedom's just a word 
Oh, Lord 
For being enslaved 
By a chain smoking girl [Second Verse] 
Smoke fills the air 
I can't tell if you care 
Mixed signals and hazy positions 
Leave me choking on the indecision 
In my bed all alone 
Sleeping with my phone 
On high 
Helps me get through the night [Chorus] 
If this is what you want 
Then don't let me get in your way 
Oh, no no no 
Freedom's just a word 
Oh, Lord 
For being enslaved 
By a chain smoking girl [Instrumental] [Chorus] 
If this is what you want 
Then don't let me get in your way 
Oh, no no no 
Freedom's just a word 
Oh, Lord 
For being enslaved 
By a chain smoking girl 
Smoking girl 
Smoking girl 
Smoking girl 
Smoking girl
