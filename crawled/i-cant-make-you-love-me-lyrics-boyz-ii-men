Turn down the lights 
Turn down the bed 
Turn down these voices 
Inside my head 
Lay down with me 
Tell me no lies 
Just hold me close 
Don't patronize 
Don't patronize me I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel 
Somethin' it wont 
Here in the dark,in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart 
And feel the power if you wont 
No you wont 
Cause I can't make you love me 
If you don't I'll close my eyes 
Then I wont see 
The love you don't feel 
When your holdin' me 
Morning will come 
And I'll do whats right 
Just give me till then 
To give up this fight 
And I will give up this fight I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel 
Somethin' it wont 
Here in the dark,in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart 
And feel the power if you wont 
No you wont 
Cause I can't make you love me 
If you don't
