Baby come back I wanna be your everything 
I'm gonna stalk you after midnight 
I'll stalk you when the bells are ringing 
And we can make it work alright tonight Mirror mirror on the wall 
Can you tell me 
Who's the greatest love of all? 
Can you help me? I'm waiting for the day 
Every night I'm gonna pray 
Baby come back to me Baby come back, baby come back 
Don't you wanna be with me? 
Baby come back, baby come back 
Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be with me? Don't you wanna be with me? 
Yes I do now, yes I do now 
Don't you wanna be with me? 
Don't you wanna be with me? I know how you have been defending 
I save your prayers every day 
But baby you can't stop pretending 
Tonight I'm gonna come your way Mirror mirror upon the wall 
Can you tell me 
Who's the greatest love of all? 
Can you help me? I'm feeling kinda blue 
'Cause my everything is you 
Baby come back to me Baby come back, baby come back 
Don't you wanna be with me? 
Baby come back, baby come back 
Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be with me? Don't you wanna be with me? 
Yes I do now, yes I do now 
Don't you wanna be with me? 
Don't you wanna be with me? Baby come back 
Baby come back 
Baby come back Baby come back 
Baby come back Baby come back, baby come back 
Don't you wanna be with me? 
Baby come back, baby come back 
Don't you wanna be, don't you? Baby come back, baby come back 
Don't you wanna be with me? 
Baby come back, baby come back 
Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be with me?
