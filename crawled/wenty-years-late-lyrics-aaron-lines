Hey, mom I know that it's late 
Hope I didn't wake you 
Yeah, everything is okay 
Just needed to talk to you Today I had one of those days 
But I didn't call to complain 
Just to say everything 
That I didn't for all of those years You were a taxicab driver, a nurse and a maid 
A waitress, a cook and a shoulder to lay 
My head on to cry on 
When nothing was going my way You knew every answer without cracking a book 
And I took for granted that I had it so good 
And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to say thank you, I love you 
Twenty years late It's funny how time passing by can change your perspective 
A little while out on your own can sure make you think 
I don't know how you did it no I can't find one spare minute 
The days run together but I don't remember you ever letting us down You were the judge and the jury when I did wrong 
Been my biggest fan from my very first song 
The gas in the engine 
That always kept me moving on A seamstress a counselor and the one referee 
That could cold stop a fight between my brother and me 
And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to say, thank you I love you 
Twenty years late I'll let you go now but I hope that you know now how I feel 
Thank you for making me the man I've become 
I love you and I will always be your son 
Mom that's all I called to say Twenty years late 
Twenty years late 
Twenty years late
