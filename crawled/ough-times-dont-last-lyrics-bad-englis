From a desperate place 
How do I reach you 
You know I scare myself 
These crazy nights without you And I feel no pain 
When I see you cry 
We can turn it around now 
You're my reason to try 
We've all seen some trouble 
But we've always come through 
You know things could get better Hey babe believe me 
Tough times don't last 
Lovers do 
Baby don't give up 
On me and you 
Cause trouble's just a storm That's gonna pass 
Tough times don't last 
We can work so hard 
Til we feel the strain We can get so close 
It's the distance 
We can't explain 
Still I reach for you 
In the pouring rain 
Like a change in the weather 
Here comes the sun 
Things could only get better 
Hey babe believe me 
Tough times don't last Lovers do 
Baby don't give up 
On me and you 
Cause trouble's like a storm That's gonna pass 
Tough times don't last 
You say now that your heart is breakin' 
From the wild times that you've lived 
Better measure the risks that you're taking 
Hey babe it can only get better 
Tough times don't last Lovers do 
Baby don't give up 
On me and you 
Cause trouble's like a storm That's gonna pass 
Tough times 
Tough times don't last Lovers do 
Me and you 
Believe me baby 
Oh yeah 
(Whoa whoa whoa) 
Tough times don't last Baby now 
(Whoa whoa whoa) 
Oh yeah 
Na na na na na na na na na 
(Whoa whoa whoa) Oh yeah 
It's me 
It's you 
(Whoa whoa whoa) 
Oh yeah 
Tough times don't last 
(Whoa whoa whoa) 
Oh yeah 
(Whoa whoa whoa)
