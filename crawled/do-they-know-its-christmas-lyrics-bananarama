It's Christmas time 
There's no need to be afraid 
At Christmas time 
We let in light and we banish hate 
And in our world of plenty 
We can spread a smile of joy 
Throw your arms around the world 
At Christmas time But say a prayer, pray for the other ones 
At Christmas time, it's hard but when you're having fun 
There's a world outside your window 
And it's a world of dread and fear 
Where the only water flowing 
Is the bitter sting of tears 
And the Christmas bells that ring there 
Are the clanging chimes of doom 
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time 
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life 
Where nothing ever grows 
No rain, no river flows 
Do they know it's Christmas time at all Here's to you raise a glass for everyone 
Here's to them underneath that burning sun 
Do they know it's Christmas time at all Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmas again
