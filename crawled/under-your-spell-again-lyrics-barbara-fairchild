I swore the last time that you let me down 
That I wouldn't see you if you came around 
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong 
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone 
You've got me under your spell again 
Saying those things again 
Making me believe you're just mine 
You've got dreaming those dreams again 
Thinking those things again 
I've gotta take you back just one more time Everybody tells me that I'm a fool 
That I never should have put my faith in you 
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true 
But no one else can make me feel the way you do 
You've got me under your spell again 
Yes I've gotta take you back just one more time
