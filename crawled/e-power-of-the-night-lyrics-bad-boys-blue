We are in danger 
I feel it deep down in my soul 
Lost in emotions 
Sometimes we seem to lose control Oh, baby, I'm fallin' 
Fallin for you and for your love 
Want it forever 
I can't get enough It's the power of the night 
It's the power of belief 
It's now or it's never 
Let's do it together The power of the night 
It's the power of the dark 
Beware of the night 
Hold on to your heart Baby, come closer 
Heat up my body with your eyes 
And when you touch me 
Oh, I can feel the fever rise Just let it happen 
'Cause burning hearts can't slip away 
Maybe we're crazy 
Babe, that's okay It's the power of the night 
It's the power of belief 
It's now or it's never 
Let's do it together The power of the night 
It's the power of the dark 
Beware of the night 
Hold on to your heart Baby, I'm fallin' 
Fallin' for you and for your love 
Want it forever 
I can't get enough It's the power of the night 
It's the power of belief 
It's now or it's never 
Let's do it together The power of the night 
It's the power of the dark 
Beware of the night 
Hold on to your heart
