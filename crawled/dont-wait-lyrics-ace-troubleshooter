I would like to say that I like the color gray 
But it's blase 
I would choose for you, but I don't know what it'd stand to do 
Make you blue Maybe you should reach inside your bag of tricks 
And see what you can find 
Maybe you should reach inside your bag of tricks 
And call him just one time Don't wait! Right now is the time, so get off your lazy butt 
And drop a line 
Tell him how you feel 
Don't let your feelings dictate what is real
