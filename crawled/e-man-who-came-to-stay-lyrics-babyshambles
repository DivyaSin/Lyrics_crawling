There's a man who came to stay 
The boy he replaced, disappeared without a trace 
Stole all my songs and my style away 
No one would say what they wanted to say 
So he was king for a day If you sail into the sun 
Beware the eyes of green 
And if the whole room tells you, "You are the one" 
I defy you not to believe them, my son There's a man who came to stay, never showing on time 
Out of his mind, diddly doo, doo dine 
Every single gig I play, something's not right inside 
Paranoia and pride, nowhere to hide If you sail into the sun, la, la, la, la, la, la 
Beware the eyes of green 
And if the whole world tells you 'you are the one' 
You must be hearing those voices again my son
