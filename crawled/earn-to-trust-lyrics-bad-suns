Can I hold it down, have I been trying my best? 
Eternal questions always asking, feeling distressed oh 
I've been ticking more than time 
A selfless man 
You're casualty I can't forget 
So, come on and let me know A heart glows in the night, in the day heart turn to dust 
Say it and mean it 
So this heart learns to trust Can I change my ways and can I confront the past 
Eternal questions always asking, failing the test oh 
I'm s ticking bomb inside a selfless man, 
You're a casualty I can't forget 
So, come on and let me know A heart glows in the night, in the day heart turn to dust 
Say it and mean it so this heart learns to trust 
And the truth it makes no sense, my senses don't ring true 
I'm feeling the pressure, distorting you Tell me we're both done, why should I listen 
Tell me we're both done, the words all go missing 
Hold it down, have I been trying my best 
Eternal questions always asking, feeling distressed oh So, come on and let me know 
A heart glows in the night, in the day heart turn to dust 
Say it and mean it 
So, this heart learns to trust 
And the truth it makes no sense, my senses don't ring true 
I'm feeling the pressure, distorting you 
A heart glows in the night, in the day heart turn to dust 
Say it and mean it 
So, this heart learns to trust A heart glows in the night, in the day heart turn to dust 
Say it and mean it 
So, this heart learns to trust
