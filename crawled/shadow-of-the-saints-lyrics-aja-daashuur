Angels at my feet, asked me to take a seat 
Got pulls on my hair, warns me to have a care 
Mary knocks on my door asks, Who are you looking for? 
Joseph wears a grin, tells me confess my sins (Chorus) 
Walking in the shadow of the saints 
Cant live up to the visions that they paint 
An idols life is hard to twist and bend 
But hopefully there will be a happy end Father whispers in my ear, Sacrifice is very dear 
Sister burns bright the torch, devils eye can surely scorch 
Brother beats down his fist, Am I not on Gods list? 
Magdalene bows her head, are all his teachings dead? (Chorus) 
Walking in the shadow of the saints 
Cant live up to the visions that they paint 
An idols life is hard to twist and bend 
But hopefully there will be a happy end Sounds of rushing silk 
Religion sucking up all our good earths milk 
We reinvent out selves to be good as gold 
But who can say for a fact that its ever saved a soul? All I ask my town is to slowly look around 
Must we seek what others have sought 
Am I Judas because I get caught? 
Let me plant my own seeds 
Daughters put away your rosary beads 
Must I be damned in hell 
For not falling where others fell? (Chorus) 
Walking in the shadow of the saints 
Cant live up to the visions that they paint 
An idols life is hard to twist and bend 
But hopefully there will be a happy end
