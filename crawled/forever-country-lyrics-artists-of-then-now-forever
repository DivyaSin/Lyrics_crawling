Almost heaven, West Virginia 
Blue ridge mountain, Shenandoah river 
Life is old there, older than the trees 
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze Country roads, take me home 
To the place I belong 
West Virginia, mountain mama 
Take me home, country roads All my memories, they gather round her (If I should stay) 
A miner's lady, stranger to blue water (I would only be in your way) 
So I'll go, yet I know (dark and dusty, painted on the sky) 
I'll think of you every step of the way (misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye) Country roads, take me home 
To the place I belong 
West Virginia, mountain mama 
Take me home, country roads On the road again 
Like a band of gypsies, we go down the highway 
We're the best of friends 
Insisting that the world keep turning our way 
And our way Country roads (country roads), take me home (take me home) 
To the place I belong 
West Virginia, mountain mama 
Oh, take me home, country roads Oh, I hope life treats you kind 
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of 
I wish you joy and happiness 
But above all this, I wish you love And I will always love you 
I will always love you 
Country roads 
Take me home, country roads (and I will always love you) 
On the road again (I will always love you) 
I just can't wait to get on the road again 
Country roads 
The life I love is makin' music with my friends (I will always love you 
I can't wait to get on the road again 
Take me home, country roads 
I will always love you 
I'll always love you
