Heading down south to the land of the pines. 
I'm thumbing my way in the North Caroline. 
Staring up the road pray to God I see headlights. 
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours, 
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers. 
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh, 
I can see my baby tonight. [Chorus:] 
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel, 
Rock me momma any way you feel. 
Hey momma rock me. 
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain, 
Rock me momma like a south bound train. 
Hey momma rock me Running from the cold up in New England. 
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band. 
My baby plays a guitar I pick a banjo now, 
Oh north country winters keep a getting me, 
And I lost my money playing poker so I had to up and leave. 
But I ain't turning back and living that old life no more. [Chorus] Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke, 
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke. 
But he's a heading west to the Cumberland gap, 
From Johnson City, Tennessee. 
Now I gotta get a move on before the sun, 
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one. 
And If I die in Raleigh at least I will die free. [Chorus]
