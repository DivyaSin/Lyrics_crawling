[Kendrick Lamar] 
Talk about it make 'em talk about it 
Life to me is currensy prosperity i got it 
And your life to me is lifeless like its livin' on life support 
I license everything in my wallet 
Lightest boy with the biggest heart 
Nigga play your part or parallel park your ego next to me and violence 
Next to me is definitely no one, no one, no one 
And i must of won that from anybody who had it 
Or better yet forgot it 
Mac in the back of a lac with a mac in the back of a lac 
With a latch on the back of the trunk 
Hit a punk in the back with a pump in back 
Till he's off balance 
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future 
When your are mentioning talent 
And im back in the back of the block with a cop 
That wanna cop anybody's allowance 
Iraq on the block key watch for the block or whatever 
And cut no cut more guns more guts 
Fuck boy you fucked up twice you fucked consider you drownin' 
Die in the lake on a date with a catfish backflip head first smilin' 
C-Cry in the face of Jesus we just pray we keep on stylin' 
On you bitches TDE YMCMB business bitch 
[Ace Hood] 
Ok nigga ridin in the Mayby 
And im probably with Baby 
Dont talk nigga fuck you pay me 
Intercept your bitch like Baylee 
Ok big money on this side 
100 grand for whip my bitch ride 
Need a new safe money gettin' to high 
Dead presidents all in my Levi's 
Boy i swear this nigga be swaggin 
And I'm livin' lavish 
Might pop me an Aston Martin on 'em 
Anything i drive i own 'em 
Bad bitch and that ass ain't normal 
Gotta put that pound game on her 
Beat it up she deep in a coma 
I'm super paid two shows a day 
My role gold no time to waste 
What it do bird my fuckin' brother 
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely mama 
Hot as the summer cold as the winter 
Stay on them ? 
I heard that they plottin' my timber 
Young nigga got a lot of flows 
Any nigga that don't believe me i make it look easy easy out of control 
[Birdman] 
(Intro) Just like that boy 
Death fore' bitches honor 
You understand me 
Dedicated respect fully loaded 
Box full of choppers 
Hand on the trigger 
Uptown gangster get it how we get it 
Third world soldier suicide rider 
Milli two minded 
Hundred mill on the counter 
Hand persian rug nigga 
Flame on the bugatti 
Crystal Louis Vuitton

Fishin' on fish scales 
Low divin' for them hunneds 
Strapped up makin mill

Higher than we've ever been shinin' on them 24's 
Jr doin time hoe on the grind hoe while you doin time hoe 
[Mack Maine]

The time is money and money still was made baby 
8 months ain't stop nuthin nigga 
It's like jail is third base and my lil' nigga still came home you undertsand yea 
I'm from the hood where bitches hold coke in their baby's diapers 
That's why when the babies grow up damn they be like us 
I came a long ways from rhymin up in crazy cyphers 
Man i so happy my lil brother came home from Rykers 
Shout out to BP, Thugga Flo, and Vel boy 
My flow Lucifer i spit hell boi 
My heart numb ain't no pain i can"t withstand 
And i hold my niggas down like a kickstand 
Get off my nuts Stop Actin like a bitch fam 
Lil nigga finish puberty grow your own dick damn 
I went from watchin time fly on allen red porch 
To cruzin through the streets in miami in a red porch 
Me and stunna fly we should join the air force 
Stand up niggas what the fuck you brought them chairs for 
I went from makin money from people with crack habits 
To thankin god im in a whole 'nother tax record amen
