"One More Dance" I was wrong beyond belief, 
Even the blindest man could see 
That the choices that I've made 
Would be the end of you and me 
So I sit here all alone 
I've been a mess since you've been gone 
Now I hate myself like no one else 
I know that I'm at fault 
Truth is there's really no excuse 
For what I did or didn't do 
So sorry, I hope that you can find it in your heart to save [Chorus:] 
Save one more dance with me 
One last second chance for me 
Cause I don't want nobody cutting in 
I swear I'll never break your heart again 
Please don't let the music end 
Could you just save me one more dance, 
One more dance, dance, one more dance, dance Maybe I was just afraid 
Of how good my life can be 
So I messed things up and hurt you girl 
Before you could hurt me 
I'm not saying I was right 
I'm not so proud of what I did 
Well I'm not gonna lie, or try to justify 
Or try to make it all make sense 
Truth is there's really no excuse 
For all I did or didn't do 
So sorry, I hope that you can find it in your heart to say [Chorus:] 
Save one more dance with me 
One last second chance for me 
Cause I don't want nobody cutting in 
I swear I'll never break your heart again 
Please don't let the music end 
Would you just save me one more dance, 
One more dance, dance, one more dance, dance If there's a space in your heart, please find the room to forgive 
Let's try and make a new start, and begin 
If you take the lead, I'll follow you 
From this moment, I'll dance for you 
Tell me I'm not dancing all alone, no [Chorus:] 
Save one more dance with me 
One last second chance for me 
Cause I don't want nobody cutting in 
I swear I'll never break your heart again 
Please don't let the music end 
Could you just save me one more dance, 
One more dance, dance, one more dance, dance.
