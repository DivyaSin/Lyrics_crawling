Just the pattern of sunlight on a building 
Just a flash in a window I was passing 
Just a frame in a movie I remembered 
Amsterdam 
Just the sound of a wheel in the gravel 
Just the click of a heel on the pavement 
Just a moment like any other moment 
Amsterdam [Chorus] 
I remember your lips 
I remember your eyes 
And the taste of the kiss, and your graceful goodbye 
You lied 
Goodbye Just the scent of perfume on the linen 
Just the print of a palm on the pillow 
Just the hint of the moon through the window 
Amsterdam 
Just a ghost in the steam on the mirror 
Just a shadow of motion in the water 
Just a need to look over my shoulder 
Amsterdam [Chorus] Just two lovers asleep in the silence as I watched from the door 
Just the weight of a heart as it's falling, nothing more [Chorus]
