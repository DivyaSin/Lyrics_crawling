Take those potatoes out of your ear 
Listen to the warnings 
Verify all your fears 
There's a world outside 
That's ready to blow 
And we're all to blame 
When it finally explodes You gotta listen up 
Gotta listen to what 
They're telling you 
Gotta listen up and think 
About what they're saying to you They're the modern day catastrophists 
They've got practical solutions 
(know all the right equations) 
They're the self-appointed 
Righteous pragmatists 
And they know 50 ways 
To save the world 
What makes you think 
You can cure our disease? Maybe its just our biology 
Maybe its time to make room 
For another species 
This is the 21st Century
