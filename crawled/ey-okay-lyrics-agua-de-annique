Your eyes, your shoes, 
It's hard to choose. 
But the best thing about you 
Is the way that I want you move. Side by side, 
All through the night. 
And the thing we dream the most 
Is to see the morning light. [Chorus:] 
Hey OK 
Why don't you stay another day? 
And it feels all right, 
Will you stay another night? 
Hey all right 
Why don't you stay another night? 
And if it feels OK, 
Will you stay another day? Your plays or mine 
Whatever it's fine 
Let's dance, let's sway 
The night away. No fear, no shame, 
We play this game. 
And the best thing about it 
Is I don't even know your name. [Chorus x3]
