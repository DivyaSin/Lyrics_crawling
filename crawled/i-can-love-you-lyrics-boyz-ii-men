Yahooooooooooo They read cinderella 
You hoped it would come true 
That one day your prince charming 
Would come rescue you 
You like romantic movies 
And you never will forget 
The way you felt when romeo kissed juilet 
And all this time that you've been waiting 
You don't have to wait no more... Chorus: 
I can love you like that 
I would make you my world 
Move heaven and earth 
If you were my girl 
I would give you my heart 
Be all that you need show you you're everything that's precious to me 
If you give me a chance 
I can love you like that (I can love you like that x2) I never make a promise I don't intend to keep 
So when I say forever, forever is what I mean 
Well I ain't no casanova but I swear this much is true 
I'll be holding nothing back when it comes to you 
You dream of love that is ever lasting 
Ohhhhhoooo 
Well baby open up your eyes Chorus: 
I can love you like that 
I would make you my world 
Move heaven and all 
If you were my girl 
I would give you my heart 
Be all that you need 
Show you you're everything that's precious to me 
If you give me a chance 
I can love you like that (I can love you like that) If you want tenderness (tendernes, tenderness) 
I got tenderness(tenderness) 
And I see through to the heart of you 
If you want a man who will understand 
You don't have to look very far 
I can love you 
Girl..i can love you I can love you like that 
I would make you my world 
Move heavan and earth 
If you were my girl 
I would give you my heart 
Be all that you need 
Show you you're everything that's precious to me 
I can love you like that 
I would mak you my world 
Move heaven and earth 
If you were my girl 
I would give you my heart 
Show you you're everything (oh you're everything) 
Love you like that 
Make you my world 
Heaven and all 
If you were my girl 
I would give you my heart 
Ohhhoooo
