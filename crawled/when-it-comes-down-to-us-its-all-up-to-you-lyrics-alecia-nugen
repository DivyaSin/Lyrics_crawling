Alecia Nugent: 
Far beyond lonesome at the end of the line 
Just short of crazy I made up my mind 
That I'm gonna love you the best that I can 
You don't have to return it, it's out of my hands Both: 
I can't make you love me, God knows I've tried 
These days I'm used to the taste of my pride 
I've thought it all over and to tell you the truth 
When it comes down to us 
It's all up to you Bradley Walker: 
Maybe you love me, maybe you don't 
Maybe you'll need me, maybe you'll won't 
It don't really matter you're a bridge I won't burn 
I've made my decision, now it's your turn Both: 
I can't make you love me, God knows I've tried 
These days I'm used to the taste of my pride 
I've thought it all over and to tell you the truth 
When it comes down to us 
It's all up to you Bradley Walker: 
I'll love you forever Both: 
That's all I can do 
When it comes down to us 
It's all up to you
