[Anna Kendrick:] 
You Shout It Out, 
But I can't hear a word you say 
I'm talking loud not saying much 
I'm criticized by all your bullets ricochet 
You shoot me down,But i get up [chorus:] 
I'm bulletproof,nothing to lose 
Fire away,fire away 
Ricochet,you take your aim 
Fire away,fire away 
You shoot me down but i won't fall 
I am titanium 
You shoot me down but i wont fall 
I am titanium [Anna Kendrick:] 
Cut me down 
But it's you who'll have further to fall 
Ghost town and haunted love 
Raise your voice,sticks and stones may break my bones 
I'm talking loud not saying much [chorus:] 
I'm bulletproof,nothing to lose 
Fire away,fire away 
Ricochet,you take your aim 
Fire away,fire away 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium 
You shoot me down but i won't fall 
I am titanium 
I am titanium 
I am titanium
