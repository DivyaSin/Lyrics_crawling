Chorus: 
Ahway Ahahahway, 
Baby we winnin, we winnin x2 Vers 1: 
We got uh oh we got it 
Wips so fly like it needs a pilot 
make hands shiver like a face of a sidekick 
Big things and little things, rich in your pocket 
Ignorance would raise me LOS swaps 
Watch me put this city like like Wilson Ted on the block 
In that all black drop lets be glasses of the game 
but winner tops it all (Na boy thats the game) Heels on 6, style on 10 
Me all on me, but I want him 
Steppin til it's ready yup 
My Hustle don't eat 
My Hustle don't sleep 
My Hustle don't wiiin So baby get your dollars up 
Go get on your pimp ship 
Go flip your color up 
Lookin now ?

Sabi got it now 
this thing just to publish us Chorus: 
Ahway Ahahahway, 
Baby we winnin, we winnin x2 [Pusha T] Roll with the winners 
To get money monsters 
V.I.P posers that never stand in liners 
That pay you no minders 
You just remind us of everywhere we don't wanna be 
Thats behind us Dressed in designers 
Laying with the finest 
who love nothing more than becoming my baby mama 
Let the night find us 
The top spin miners 
The stars is the line 
and my jewelry is co-signed shit, we against the game 
holla grand pushing

Ain't nothing changed 
Cash still spinnin 
A message to my haters
