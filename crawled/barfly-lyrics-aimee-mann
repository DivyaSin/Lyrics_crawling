Spent my nights in a sleeping bag smelling kerosene 
thinking fog and sand 
was gonna keep me clean 
feeding all the bluejays at the wrong address 
where they went instead 
I could only guess Tell the barfly 
who runs this town 
you wont get high 
youll just get down 
tell the barfly 
its on his dime 
you wont get high 
so do the time Took a breath full of iodine and I overdosed 
and the tide crept high 
like a watery ghost 
and no one needs your kind 
of a dope sick clown 
you can always find 
sitting one seat down Tell the barfly 
who rolls the dice 
your numbers up 
so roll it twice 
tell the barfly 
its on his dime 
you wont get high 
so do the time Honey, Im not the one whos of use to you now 
I get an hours sleep at night 
and I cant see how 
you deserve all the mess that even guilt wont allow Tell the barfly 
who runs this town 
you wont get high 
youll just get down 
tell the barfly 
its on his dime 
you wont get high 
so do the time
