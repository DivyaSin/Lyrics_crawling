And another night away now 
In a world of my own 
I got a picture of the bedroom, darling 
And you're lying there alone I may work another morning 
Oh, or I may be away from home 
I need to trust that you always know, girl 
I got you on my mind 
I got you on my mind 
I got you on my mind 
I got you on my mind There's a thousand different people 
That I gotta talk to, gotta see, yeah 
Don't you know the only one I always really need 
Is hardly ever near me I may fly another airplane, baby 
Yeah, I may be far away from home 
I need to trust that you always know 
I've got you on my mind 
I've got you on my mind 
I've got you on my mind 
I've got you on my mind You may walk away tomorrow 
But that won't change the way I feel 
Baby that's how much my love is real, real, real I've got you on my mind 
Said I've got you on my mind 
I've got you on my mind 
I've got you on my mind Every thought in my mind 
you, you, you, you, you, you 
Every word I write down 
you, you, you, you, you, you 
Every song that I sing 
You, you, you, you, you, you 
It's all you baby 
You, you, you, you, you, you
