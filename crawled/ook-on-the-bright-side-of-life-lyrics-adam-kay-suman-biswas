When you're staying in St. Peter's, in a room that has no heaters, 
You could think about your life and get upset. 
You're in shit accomodation, and you can't do cannulation 
And you're 37,000 in debt But always look on the bright side of life 
Always look on the bright side of life If you caught the flu in fresher's, spent all your loan in Threshers, 
And your patients always end up in a hearse. 
Though our course may be rotten, there's something you've forgotten, 
At George's it's a million times worse So always look on the bright side of life 
Always look on the bright side of life There are problems with the emails, there are problems with the females 
And you wish you hadn't done a BSc. 
But whatever your regrets, and however bad it gets, 
Well at least you didn't go to GKT Always look on the bright side of life 
Always look on the bright side of life The UMO are dicks, and they send you to zone 6, 
For communication skills and PBL 
The prospectus was all lies, you've forgotten to revise, 
But at least you didn't go to UCL Always look on the bright side of life 
Always look on the bright side of life When you fail examination, and delay your graduation, 
Cos you know about as much medicine as a nurse 
At your resits in september, 
Don't be angry, just remember, 
That every fucking other place is worse Always look on the bright side of life 
Always look on the bright side of life
