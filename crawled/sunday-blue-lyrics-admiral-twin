Saturday sweet 
Or was it Sunday Blue? 
We scattered seeds 
And the day grew 
Throwing caution to the wind 
And danger dances on the land's end Tripping over air 
No one ever really goes there 
Dancing on the breeze 
No one ever really sees me Saturday slow 
And then Sunday flew 
Another night without you 
You walked away 
And the world shut down 
It's hard to dance 
When you're not around Tripping over air 
No one ever really goes there 
Dancing on the breeze 
No one ever really sees me I wonder if I walked with you 
You'd take a few steps too 
Or would you walk away from me? 
We always disagree Saturday sweet or was it Sunday Blue 
We scattered seeds and the day grew 
Throwing caution to the wind 
And danger dances on the land's end Tripping over air 
No one ever really goes there 
Dancing on the breeze 
No one ever really sees me I wonder if I walked with you 
You'd take a few steps too 
Or would you walk away from me 
We always disagree The days go by 
And I dream of a time 
when the poems rhymed 
And the night's are so long 
And the winter lasts all summer long
