searching for something 
walking endlessly 
for what seemed like days 
and if you wait for me 
ill wait for you 
grasping to hold on to what i cant see 
it is coming back 
it seems that ive forgotten the way to continue on 
this broken down road 
push carry on 
i wont pretend 
that this is my life 
hollow words make paranoid people back down 
this is not this is not this is not control i thought that i had control 
i thought i could keep control 
i thought i would want control 
i thought id never lose control theres no reason for this 
just please forgive me hoping for something 
passing time with an endless trail of smoke 
throat burns 
choke on cigarettes 
ashes fall and scatter 
that old familiar blue glow 
red eyes gaze 
this is not this is not this is not control
