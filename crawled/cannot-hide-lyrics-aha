Can you see me baby 
Standing in the light 
I feel your cat's eyes on me 
Phosphor in the night I'll move inside 
Got those eyes 
Something's burning baby 
That's all right 
You and I here tonight Meet me on the other side 
(cause you can do me right) 
Take me where I cannot hide 
(cause you can do me right) 
Meet me on the other side You don't know me girl 
I'm faceless in the crowd 
The things I could show you, babe 
C'mon c'mon to my cloud I, I am alive and tonight 
Something is falling, baby 
You and I or the sky 
I can se it in your eyes Take me to the other side 
(cause you can do me right) 
Take me where I cannot hide 
(cause you can do me right) 
Meet me on the other side Tonight
