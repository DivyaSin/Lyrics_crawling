Too fucking lazy 
To have any courage 
I reap the results 
Take a look around and see 
All I have 
Ignoring all reason and any sense 
I'm the exception 
The rule is a lie 
I clouded my head 
Always taking the easy 
I bought all protection 
I could have been smart 
It's not what I wanted 
You call me shitty things 
Because you're jealous of me 
I don't have to try 
Competition's a waste of time 
It's all a waste of time 
Guilt is a friend I made long ago 
And together we fight any effort 
Prevention or rejection 
I simply give up all my chances 
And you must really hate the fact 
That somehow I can live with that 
Join in and cop out
