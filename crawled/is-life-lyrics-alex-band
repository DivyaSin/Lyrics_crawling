(What we're living this life for) 
(What we're living this life for) I believe in the common man 
Working hard with the dirt on his hands 
He knows that he can't understand it all And I believe in our darkest hour 
We will find that there is a power 
I believe in a faith that makes us one But some days, I can't find my own way 
Not sure where to go 
Now I just need to know (oh oh) 
Tell me what we're living this life for 
(oh oh) 
We can't go on not knowing anymore 
(oh oh) 
Just standing here in front of this open door 
(oh oh) 
So tell me what we're living this life for (What we're living this life for) 
(What we're living this life for) I believe in eternity 
Long after we live and breathe 
I believe that the best is yet to come I know in our darkest hour 
We will find that there is a power 
I believe in a faith that makes us one But some days, we just go our own ways 
All under the gun, what have we become (oh oh) 
Tell me what we're living this life for 
(oh oh) 
We can't go on not knowing anymore 
(oh oh) 
Just standing here in front of this open door 
(oh oh) 
So tell me what we're living this life for What are we living this life for 
(oh oh oh oh) 
Don't you think that it's time we know 
(oh oh oh oh) 
What are we living this life for 
(oh oh oh oh) When I sleep, I can feel the heart beat 
Of each and every one, staring at the sun 
Even though that some days, I can't find my own way 
Just to come and then, I'll never understand (oh oh) 
Tell me what we're living this life for 
(oh oh) 
We can't go on not knowing anymore 
(oh oh) 
Just standing here in front of this open door 
(oh oh) So tell me what we're living this life for What are we living this life for 
(oh oh oh oh) 
Don't you think that it's time we know 
(oh oh oh oh) 
What are we living this life for 
(oh oh oh oh) Don't you think that it's time we know 
Don't you think that it's time we know
