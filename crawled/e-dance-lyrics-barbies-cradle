Would you be interested in dancing with me? 
And maybe tell me all your dreams 
Talk to me like you would in your sleep 
Don't censor anything 
Cause i wanna hear everything 
There's no innocence left to spoil 
You can swear she's not a little boy 
We'll fly tonight so far away 
Where they will never find us 
Use your wings and i will run fast 
Cause that's what i do when i'm not afraid 
We've got it made up in our heads 
We don't have to wait for anyone or anything 
Go anywhere we desire 
So close your eyes become blind 
From the world listen instead to the girl 
She'll tell you why she chose to fly 
And you're left behind 
Just like me alone and free 
We can smile when we've filled the void 
And treated the burn 
But until then i believe 
We're gonna have to learn 
To discard any disguise we're using 
Yes it's hard and it's never amusing
