i can't stand to look at you 
you sit there thinking you're so cool 
tight t-shirt, baggy pants 
you f*ckers are too scared to dance 
the Abducted vs. the emo kids 
and you're gonna die 
you buy into a clique that's cut to fit 
and your bands all sound like sh*t 
you stupid kids aint got no soul 
you can't begin to fathom real 
rock 'n' roll
