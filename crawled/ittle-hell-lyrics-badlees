Once was a man who didn't do too well 
He spent more than a little time 
Down in his little hell 
He had time to decide even if it 
Was worth the ride He started early on before it was cool 
To take the risk on of dealin' 
In the high school 
Never mind that a line wasn't much more 
Than a good time Yeah de yeah 
Carefree and careful as a man could be 
What are the risks of burnin' hot 
If you can't even see 
That the ore's run aground 
Sinking in to the shore Careful and conscious of the burning red 
Of the flashing lights 
And the feeling of dread 
Captured in everything in this 
Dragging little moment Yeah de yeah 
Inevitably in a little hell 
Immeasurably in a little hell 
Character breathes with a little hell Run out of thoughts and possibilities 
It ain't only the man with no eyes 
Who can't see you back up, up a day, 
Coulda wrote, wrote it all... 
You back up, in a daze, shoulda wrote, 
Wrote it all down Yeah de yeah
