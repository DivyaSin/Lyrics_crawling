Take what you've got, take comfort in that 
Everything you know or seen will soon be a non existent dot 
Who'll save the world that claims there is no saving? 
An illusion or delusion of grandeur Half of what I say is bliss, the other half is meaningless 
Comfortable lines, waiting for the clock to heal us 
Lost and found but never touched, another beating heart is lost 
Interesting lies, waiting for the clock to heal us Alone in our rooms, miserable 
A tornado or an owl, come back and isolate the balance 
Nothing is real, your heart on your sleeve 
Just another lie, transcend the pride, of the chemicals Half of what I say is bliss, the other half is meaningless 
Comfortable lines, waiting for the clock to heal us 
Lost and found but never touched, another beating heart is lost 
Interesting lies, waiting for the clock to heal us Take your time, nothingness is something 
And something is nothing 
Take your time, nothingness is something 
And something is nothing and nothing is nothing Half of what I say is bliss, the other half is meaningless 
Comfortable lines, waiting for the clock to heal us 
Lost and found but never touched, another beating heart is lost 
Interesting lies, waiting for the clock to heal us Half of what I say is bliss, the other half is meaningless 
Comfortable lines, waiting for the clock to heal us 
Lost and found but never touched, another beating heart is lost 
Interesting lies, waiting for the clock to heal us
