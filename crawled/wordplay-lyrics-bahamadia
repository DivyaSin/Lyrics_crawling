Peep my credentials involving instruments 
Rhymes massage the cells in your mental 
Relieves you off the babblin' that you used to 
Ever since the departing days of the juice Crew, my style been milk like a bottle of Yoohoo 
Was neva MC Monkey, see Monkey 
Do I move through baby, real natural pose for "Illadel" 
When I gets lyrical ou-ou like Cool Cee used to do I make the kids wanna Rah 
Like Afu shouts to Mecca 'cause the planet's mad 
Digable allow me to pause 
And hit the Mork nanu, nanu, wordplay Non-prehistoric metamorphic boric like acid 
No hat tricks, a classic, so park that ass like Jurassic 
And check the matrix completed like seven To overshadow the triple six 
Complimenting zig-a-zicks with wisdom 
Like the 5 percenters when doing mathematics 
Flips scripts like acrobatics intrinsic in rapping Like insulin to diabetics, text is didactic 
With nutrience like muslix on wax flex facts 
Like hydraulics when vexed to catch flicks 
By Mira max or Kodak I looks beyond the door like 100x for wordplay 
Breaks out analogies like pollen do allergies 
Got the vocab like the Fugees to collect gees top 
Bill like Bellamy shocking hardcore headz Like electricity cuts come complimentary of jockey 
Sean-Ski, yo, vocally be A H A M A D be easy 
Like Moe-Bee raps react radio act like DJ Ran 
And Colby to the Roots like Malik B. Flows pose as noise reduction on MCs 
Like Dolby down by law like felonies 
Catchy like T-be Essential 
To the elements like Ceceley with wordplay
