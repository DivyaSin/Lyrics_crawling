I don't care, I won't preach it 
My God is a reasonable man You preach the facts of sacred prayers 
But you're a terrorist of bigotry 
Fueled by text that was written 
In dead languages and different times I don't care, I won't preach it 
My God is a reasonable man I don't care, I won't preach it 
My God is a reasonable man 
I don't care, I won't preach it 
My God is a reasonable man And your justice and your lifestyle 
My God is a reasonable man 
And your faith doesn't speak for us all 
'Cause my God is a reasonable man It's time to separate faith and politics 
It's time to realize that in ten years' time 
This song will be all that's left of me 
And this song won't need to be sung Your problem is that you think it's no use 
And swimming in another Christian world 
Now you have the balls, so show the power 
So why's the shit back in human rights? Get what? Get back 
My God is a reasonable man 
Get what? Get back 
My God is a reasonable man Our hands again 
They will get sick, all with your politics 
By mixing god this city war 
You take all of your convictions to the morgue Get what? Get back Get what? Get back 
My God is a reasonable man 
Get what? Get back 
My God is a reasonable man
