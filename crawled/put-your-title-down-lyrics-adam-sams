You count the coins and years of work 
That put them in your pocket 
Could you exist on any less 
If suddenly you lost it? Do you depend on your own hands? Put your title down 
Everything you have is a gift 
Put your title down 
Be thankful Is sustenance the effect of work 
Or is that an illusion? 
The earth's carefree simplicity 
Has led to my conclusion I depend on my own hands Put your title down 
Everything you have is a gift 
Put your title down 
Be thankful The nurturing of birds and trees 
Is not of their own will 
The Source providing all they need 
Is nurturing me still Put your title down 
Everything you have is a gift 
Put your title down 
Be thankful
