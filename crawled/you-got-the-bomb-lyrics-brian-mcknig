I can't remember 
The last time I felt this way 
You're keeping a smile on my face 
You know exactly how I tick 
Every time I light the wick 
Seems like you're ready to explode 
I want you to know You got the bomb 
Just can't get enough 
You got the bomb, bomb 
Just keep on blowin' me up 
You got the bomb, bomb 
Just can't get enough 
You got the bomb, bomb, blowin' me up I recall 
The first time I kissed your lips 
(Think I'm gonna shout about it) 
(Baby, there's no doubt about it) 
Whenever you want me, girl, I'm there 
Whatever the time, girl I don't care 
I got no place to go 
Baby, I know You got the bomb 
Just can't get enough 
You got the bomb, bomb 
Just keep on blowin' me up 
You got the bomb, bomb 
Just can't get enough 
You got the bomb, bomb, blowin' me up
