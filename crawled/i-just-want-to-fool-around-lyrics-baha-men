I gotta little question but I'm scared to ask you 
(hey, ho, say yeah but don't say no) 
I can't stand rejection but I got to know to 
(hey, ho , I just know what I know) 
You and me could be so good together we could love beyond forever [Chorus] 
I don't want to 
Steel a kiss, but I can't resist I never felt like this 
I don't want to 
Try to make you hang with me 
I don't want to 
Tell a lie I'm in love with you and I can't deny 
I just want to fool around I'll take you to the movies or I'll take you to the stars 
(hey, ho, say yeah But don't say no) 
Please don't get me wrong I'll never go to far 
(hey, ho, I just know what I know) 
You and me could have a real good time girl 
We don't have to change the world [Chorus] All I want to do is see you, hold you tight and never leave you, 
till that day I'll keep on dreaming, if you say yes I'll start believing 
it's true, it's True I love only you 
It's all good' it's all good' it's all good, it's all good. 
hey, ho, it's all good, it's all good Babe I just want to fool around, 
so girl can you tell me if we can be down 
Just want to know ya, show you what love's about 
kiss your lips if I can or 
Just take you out to the beach on the island 
just hanging out, watching the waves hit the sand 
I know will turn you out 
Having fun with only you is what it's all about, 
don't want to see you cry
