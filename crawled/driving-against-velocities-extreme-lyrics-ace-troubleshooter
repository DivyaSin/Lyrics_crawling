Driving against velocities extreme, makes you wonder why you're going nowhere fast 
Slipping backwards maybe and you wonder 
Yeah you wonder, "How long is this gonna last?" 
Eyes blurry and you're seeing through a mirror dimly, yeah it cloouds your mind 
Feelings of joy and a mindless toy, you choose to slip away for some time Don't you realize that you're drowning? 
The way it is you'll always be frowning Cluttered heaps of trouble and you see 
Yeah you see that the eyes of disarray are upon you 
What pulls your strings really makes you think 
Pseudo-happiness envelops you And I feel torn apart, yeah it rips at my heart But I know He's got an eye on you, plan to pull you through 
All you need to do is meet him there 
Take your worries, shove them up your really want to see you meet Him there Driving against velocities extreme 
Wind in your hair makes you think you're going somewhere 
So clear out all the noise, hear the One True Voice 
I really want to see you meet Him there
