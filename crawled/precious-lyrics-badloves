Precious 
You know I have nothing 
Precious 
No money can buy 
You're like a treasure 
Lost to the sands of time 
Whatever you're hiding 
Few can deny 
You sure got something 
Precious 
About you 
I love your ancient charms 
Precious 
Oh my, my 
I'm saving you for myself 
We fall into each others arms 
And in the half-light 
Reveal your charms 
Precious 
Now we are as one 
Sins of the father 
Are those of the son 
Feel my soul surrender 
Precious 
No doubt about it 
I love your ancient charms 
Precious 
Oh my, my 
I just want a piece of you 
So come and surrender 
Wearing the gifts god gave you 
Who will save you now 
Save me some of your 
Precious 
Come on now 
I love your ancient charms 
Precious 
Oh my, my 
I just want a piece of you 
Precious 
Oh my, my 
I'm keeping you for myself
