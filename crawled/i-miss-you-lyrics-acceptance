time winds down as you stretch upward to heaven 
his blood resounds as it's not over, precursor 
We'll paint them red. those things you said 
We'll paint them red. what you said i miss you 
i miss you 
and i miss you 
i need you 
i need you 
and i need you more 
can see you 
i see you 
can i see you more? i want to defend as i hold you so close to me. 
you speak of peace 
well how can that be 
surround me 
i can't believe the pain received and i can't believe what you said i miss you 
i miss you 
and i miss you 
i need you 
i need you 
and i need you more 
can see you 
i see you 
can i see you more? and i felt it 
you're not fading 
i felt it 
i'm not fading 
i felt it 
you're not fading 
i felt it 
i felt it i miss you 
i miss you 
and i miss you 
i need you 
i need you 
and i need you more 
can see you 
i see you 
can i see you now?
