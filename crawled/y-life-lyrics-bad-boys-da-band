[Sara in background saying welcome] 
[Fred/Miami] 
This Crazy 
I'm Thankful 
Yea 
Welcome Welcome [Ness] 
Life is what you make it 
you gotta put in hard work 
yea cant let nobody hold you down baby [Verse 1 (Ness)] 
hit tha bricks chicks like damn where you been lord 
locked up wit a bad case of hemorriods 
writtin n fightin trifflin rhymes 
about tha life n tha times wit niggaz on tha grind 
white collared criminals climb the corporate ladder 
while niggaz like me gotta sell coke n crack 
riskin my freedom boxed up missin a season 
itz a setup hypothetically speakin 
even my pops was knocked ova tickets for speeding 
drinkin n drivin i aint forget he think i forgot him 
my mom got grey hairs from worrying sick 
and my sister got a house now pushing a stick 
just a lil something to get her from a to b 
ya'll got nowhere to go come and stay wit me 
wit a niece and a nephew dat love me to death 
my little brother nick I guess he'z loving whatz left [Chorus (Sara)] 
Life is what u make it 
though it may sound basic 
going through some bad times 
while were faithful for the goodtimes yea 
though we must build up tha strength to carry on 
welcome to my world 
welcome welcome [Verse 2 (Fred)] 
I remember 1 morning when i was cooking tha O out tha blue i heard a knock @ tha door 
i looked through tha peep whole and itz a feen n he needed some coke 
and at tha time i really needed his dough 
but i know the rules 
you never sell crack where you rest at 
'cause haterz send shellz where ya chest at 
in my case them motherfuckers sent shellz where my vest at 
found ou ti aint dead give dem a spot to rest at 
i found out bout there spot had to go and x that 
my eyes red against cyclops call me tha x man 
i think god just for every blessin though tha roads got tough thankz for every lesson 
i carry loads at times even though it get stressin 
i remember stickin tha clip in stopped and den second guessing 
i couldnt stand tha rain of tha new edition 
tha fast lane had me layin in the cool whip business [Chorus (Sara)] 
Life is what u make it 
though it may sound basic 
going through some bad times 
while were faithful for the goodtimes yea 
though we must build up tha strength to carry on 
welcome to my world 
welcome welcome [Verse 3 (Babs)] 
High heads and high school dropouts 
little girlz wit there stomachs popped out 
i seen it all 
niggaz stretched out by tha corner store 
life nomore 
dont think small im getting focused 
in tha crib writin rhymes while im smokin 
while niggaz on tha block totin i'll see them lata 
my moms make paper but cheat wit her cash 
ask for a pair of kicks she tell me ask my dad 
so i'd rather hit tha ave n knock off roucka 
100 pack in tha pocket of my guess jean skirt 
still tryna get a deal on tha side 
battle bitches outside in front of kennedy fried 
alot of niggaz wanna see me shine 
but i still got tha lanes laggin behind 
hatin on mine itz nothin 
imma get to tha top regardless 
got love for female rappers but think im tha hardest [Chorus (Sara)] 
Life is what u make it 
though it may sound basic 
going through some bad times 
while were faithful for the goodtimes yea 
though we must build up tha strength to carry on 
welcome to my world 
welcome welcome [Repeat Chorus 2x]
