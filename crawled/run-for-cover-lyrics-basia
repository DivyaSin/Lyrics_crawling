How well I know this feeling 
Seems that you will never learn 
It can't go on forever But very soon the tide will turn When it won't go away 
And no one else can cover you 
I'll shelter you from thunder Run for cover,got to run for cover 
When danger is around 
Run for cover,got to run for cover 
I'll never let you down down down If you play with fire 
You're gonna get your fingers burned 
Now the stakes are higher 
Remember what it was we learned When it won't go away 
And no one else can cover you 
I'll shelter you from thunder Run for cover,got to run for cover 
I'll always be around 
Run for cover,got to run for cover 
When the sky is falling down down down Everyday I'm getting stronger 
On a wave of hope that's going round 
There's another world inside my heart 
It's not impossible to turn it inside out When it won't go away 
And no one else can cover you 
I'll shelter you from thunder Run for cover,got to run for cover 
When danger is around 
Run for cover,got to run for cover 
I'll never let you down down down Run for cover,got to run for cover 
I'll always be around 
Run for cover,got to run for cover 
When the sky is falling down down down
