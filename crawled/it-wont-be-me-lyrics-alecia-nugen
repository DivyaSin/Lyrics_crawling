So your bags are all packed and you're leaving 
Without so much as telling me why 
Pardon me if I skip all the grieving 
I'll simply get on with my life 'Cause I know there'll come a day 
It'll come back on you and you'll pay But won't be me you'll answer to 
When the judgment arrives 
And your penance is due 
Forgiveness may come For the things that you've done 
For your dishonesty 
But it won't be me Well, it goes against my christian raising 
To be feeling the way that I am 
I should get on my knees 
And start praying for your absolution But I've tried and I can't 
After what you did to me and to us 
You've betrayed all my love and my trust It won't be me you'll answer to 
When the judgment arrives 
And your penance is due 
Forgiveness may come For the things that you've done 
For your dishonesty 
But it won't be me Now this isn't a threat or a curse 
Just remember you heard it here first It won't be me you'll answer to 
When the judgment arrives 
And your penance is due 
Forgiveness may come For the things that you've done 
For your dishonesty 
But it won't be me No, it won't be me
