There was nothing... nothing left standing, 
all the people and trees... disappeared in the wrath of the sea, 
in the night... she crashed all around us, 
like the quietest dance... i was locked in my hands when I heard, 
voices from the top of the mountain, 
voices from the valley bellow, 
I am ready to join them, 
I am ready to go. Voices from the top of the mountains, 
voices from the valley below, 
I am ready to join them, 
I am ready to go. Now the world... outside is just blooming, 
green as the green that was spilled on the hills and the leaves, 
time will come when the water will open, 
and the angels will cry... just like the time before. They were voices from the top of the mountain, 
they were voices from the valley below, 
I am ready to join them, 
I am ready to go, 
I am ready to join them, 
I am ready to go, 
I am ready to go, 
I am ready to 
Go
