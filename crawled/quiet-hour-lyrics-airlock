There is a place where I can hide 
He comes to meet me there 
There in that hour, I can let go 
Be myself once more There in that place, 
The waters flow 
And the river runs, high [Chorus] 
I hear that still small voice 
What is this call on my heart 
I can be still in your care 
You show me the way Sometimes I'm scared to approach you 
But slowly I get there 
And realize I am home and 
Wish I could stay, and more Whisper your will in to my ear 
And your perfume fills the air [Chorus]
