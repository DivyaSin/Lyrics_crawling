The wind blew a path through the fallen leaves 
And there showed a crack in the old oak tree 
The door stood as if it was standing guard 
Of the dozen chipmunks in the backyard Every house not a home but dare do I roam 
There's a light on the porch here for someone Once upon a time in a border town 
The war was over, the guns laid down 
The women, the men, the children saved 
Now it's hard to remember it any other way When the law acts as though there is nothing to show 
There is compassion and depth in a neighbor Now if Bartles and James didn't need no first names 
We could live by our own laws in favor Every house not a home but dare do I roam 
There's a light on the porch here for someone Now if Bartles and James didn't need no first names 
We could live by our own laws in favor
