[Intro] 
Just another story in the game 
But every try ain't the same 
What if you change, can you change back? 
It's ashamed that I came back But my niggas would'nt let me hold, no way 
They say Bas you gon' make it 
Get us out this fuckin' place 
Anyway we wanna take it Tokyo, Mc call 
Make hoes make friends 
Toast and ball 
Then the Adele friscos 
Houses in every zipcode 
I'm heading out to Cali 
Nigga you should see my rent though 
I'm fucking with the vibe 
The shit a different tempo 
I never need a men code 
We make it ???? 
But I swear this shit is never simple 
I'm tryna keep my lady 
She never had a baby 
I know she got the kid though 
I sip more and ponder how to to that 
Cus I ain't too good to love 
But I know how to do raps 
Writer like MJ playing the 23 
Wiser than my age 
I been braying since 23 
Every day is like 20 beats 
I feast 
Cus everything on my plate 
The fiends, they just relate 
We ain't een there 
Bitch, look what we made 
New York, New York 
My city, that is my state 
My niggas go into court 
For balling in love with the sport 
Supplying demand 
Lets call it love of the snort 
Lets call it love of the snort 
And all of the sort 
It push me harder and farther 
My father pushes 70 
Dont want him dying tomorrow 
For me feel his guidance 
I'll be grinding till he off his feet 
I pray it all come from me 
The shit is all for the fam 
The rest is all for the team 
Fiends 
Never once lied 
Tight clique, never untie 
Hit the ground like a bus drive 
Take the town like a mud slide 
City of the empire 
City of the empire 
City of the empire 
Queens shit, fiends shit 
Queen bitch, rolls blunts 
Seamstress 
G shit 
Allegiance 
To my real bitches and my G's 
Salute the [Outro] 
Its Bas
