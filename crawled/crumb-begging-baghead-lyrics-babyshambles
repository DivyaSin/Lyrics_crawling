Don't take me for no sunbeam 
Don't take me for no sunbeam 
No sunbeam no sunbeam Another faction of 
And no detection of 
Another tax out of your life Don't take me for no sunbeam 
Don't take me for no sunbeam 
No sunbeam no sunbeam Cause I'm a crumb begging baghead baby yeah 
Crumb begging baghead baby yeah 
Bet you say that to all of the girls All of the long lost wars 
Any cause is worth dying for 
What passing bells for those who die like cattle again and again and again and again Now, don't take me for no sunbeam 
Don't take me for no sunbeam 
No sunbeam no sunbeam I'm a crumb begging baghead baby yeah 
A crumb begging baghead baby yeah 
Bet you say that to all of the girls If you ever smile 
In the street, crocodiles 
I doubt you'd ever smile again Now, don't take me for no sunbeam 
Don't take me for no sunbeam, no sunbeam, no sunbeam
