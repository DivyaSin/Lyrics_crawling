Broken Hold me tight and don't look away 
Ask me how I feel and how I make it through the day The distance between us is the closeness you want to keep 
Is there nothing more to give 
Is this the end of it all If I had a chance to take it all back 
Would you leave me anyway 
And if I told you I could change again 
Would you still be here with me 
If I could change again 
Would you leave me anyway 
If I could change again There's a house down by the sea 
Where we used to live 
Now it's turned to dust If I had a chance to take it all back 
Would you leave me anyway 
And if I told you I could change again 
Would you still be here with me 
If I could change again
