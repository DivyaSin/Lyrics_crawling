Written by babyface, madonna (1994) 
Performed by madonna I don't, don't care if it's not right 
To have your arms around me 
I want to feel what it's like 
Take all of you inside me In your eyes 
Forbidden love 
In your smile 
Forbidden love 
In your kiss 
Forbidden love 
If I had one wish love would be like this I know that you're no good for me 
That's why I feel I must confess 
What's wrong is why it feels so right 
I want to feel your sweet caress Hook If I only had one wish 
Love would always feel like this 
Wishin' on the stars above 
Forbidden love 
If I only had one dream 
This would be more than it seems 
Forbidden love Hook Heaven forgive me 
Never forbid me 
Love should always feel like this
