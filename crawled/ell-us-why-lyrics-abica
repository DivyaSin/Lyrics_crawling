Tell me why! 
Do you really not care 
It looks like we got something to share 
Why! 
I know it's really not fair 
You look around and there's nobody there 
You know! 
You know I did the work, put the time, wrote the truth to fill the lines 
You know! 
That I've had so much and I'm never backing down and I'm never losing touch 
Oh no! 
Now I know it's much better 
Let the time take the rain it's the weather 
Or not, did you even try 
I know a lot of people talking like they do but they lie 
Excuses! 
Yo, fuck your reasons keep it shut just stick to breathing 
These days have come and gone that's why I'm done with holding on 
I've done a lot 
I've said too much 
I've lost my grip 
Can't feel your touch 
I'll take it back it was just to heavy 
But for now Chorus 
We're gonna take it all 
Won't beg, won't plead or crawl 
We'll take you out this time 
But first you tell us why 
We're the underground 
Our circuits built the sound 
Before we say goodbye 
It's time to tell me why Don't let me stop I know, I can turn this 
Now! 
Now I'll turn it around, it's been the same old thing but I'm living it now 
how! 
Do you go when I'm bound, it's been three long years but I'm living it now 
So! 
You're just another lost hope, just one more proof to everything I wrote 
go! 
Cuz you think you know, but you don't, low with a bottle of soco 
Now, tell me how to make it all ok today! 
Holding me down with your fucking chains 
Going out of our fucking brains 
Now I'll show you why I feel this way 
Like nothing right here makes sense today 
So, let it in let it get inside 
Let it take over and watch your past die We're gonna take it all 
Won't beg, won't plead or crawl 
We'll take you out this time 
But first you tell us why 
We're the underground 
Our circuits built the sound 
You've got to tell us why Just tell me why I thought it needed to be 
What's good for you 
What's good for them 
What's mine is nothing to me 
So I choose to not believe 
No! 
And not let this get to me! 
No! 
I don't think that you could see 
What this did to me 
So just let me be 
Just go! 
This image is so real 
I just can't shake it 
The truths not yours to steal 
But still you take it We're gonna take it all 
Won't beg, won't plead or crawl 
We'll take you out this time 
But first you tell us why 
We're the underground 
Our circuits built the sound 
You've got to tell us why
