Look out People used to call me backwards, livin' out here with the tractors 
Lettin' this world leave me behind 
Now a days I'm an innovator, I'm a country boy prognosticator 
Man, a man ahead of my times I've got a hundred acre farm 
I've got a John Deere in my barn 
I've got a garden in my yard 
Full of corn, peas and beans I've got a guitar, I play unplugged 
I've got a homegrown girl I love 
And when the summer time hits we skinny dip in the stream 
I was green before green was a thing Sheets on the clothes line dryin', red tail hawks are flyin' 
A couple of deer on the timber line 
Yeah, and I know a lot more about cane pole fishin' 
Then I ever will know about carbon emissions 
But my little corner of the world is doin' just fine I've got a hundred acre farm 
I've got a John Deere in my barn 
I've got a garden in my yard 
Full of corn, peas and beans I've got a guitar, I play unplugged 
I've got a homegrown girl I love 
And when the summer time hits we skinny dip in the stream 
I was green before green was a thing I've got a hundred acre farm 
I've got a John Deere in my barn 
I've got a garden in my yard 
Full of rooted baked potaters and greens I've got a guitar, I play unplugged 
I've got a homegrown girl I love 
And when the summer time hits we skinny dip in the stream 
I was green before green was a thing 
I was green before green was a thing
