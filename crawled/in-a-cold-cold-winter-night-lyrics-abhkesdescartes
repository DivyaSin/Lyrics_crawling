There exists somethinggg: haunting me from behind 
It's not the echooo : ricocheting in the hills 
It's not the fire that erupts 
and ceases down in the rhythm 
Of my Marlboro stick 
In a Cold cold cold winter nights Oh oho oho (4) For all the road; I've crossed down the hills 
When I was drenched 
It wasn't easy nor was the pain 
To be alive in the 
Cold cold cold winter nights Oh oho oho (4) Blowing the puff: that exists in the last 
The foggy road gets a little cleared 
It wasn't easy nor was the pain 
To be alive in a 
Cold cold cold winter nights Oh oho oho (4) There exists something haunting me from behind 
It's not the care that lasted short when I needed it more 
It's not the brightness that lit up in a day 
When I need darkness to feel it safe 
In a Cold cold cold winter nights 
In a Cold cold cold winter nights Oh oho oho (4) In hope, a time.... soon arrives 
The winter and the puff,, gets synchronized And There exists nothing in between 
When every road seems convergent 
With No delimma to sublimate 
In a cold cold cold winter nights Oh oho oho (4)
