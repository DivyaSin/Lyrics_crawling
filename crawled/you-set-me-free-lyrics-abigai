How many times have I called your name 
And wondered if you hear me, see me 
Know the things I'm feeling in my soul 
You turned around and you answered me 
You held out your arms to me 
Helped me when I needed you the most And you set me free 
Finally I see 
You set me free 
In you I can believe 
You set me free I was alone when you came to me 
Saw that I was naked, broken 
Couldn't find the strength to carry on 
You lifted me up and you sheltered me 
You opened up your heart to me 
Loved me when I needed you the most And you set me free 
Finally I see 
You set me free 
In you I can believe 
You set me free 
You're everything to me 
You set me free 
In you I can believe 
You set me free
