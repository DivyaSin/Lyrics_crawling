Fifteen I'm strung out 
Once again and kicked out 
I think well I'm on my own, 
I'm on my own now, Sixteen and I said goodbye 
To those I knew I'll never see 
Well I can't see home 
I can't see home now When I look at the path 
That I chose and I'll say to you 
Live Fast Die Young 
We'll stay out on the run So live fast and die young 
Live Fast Die Young 
We'll stay out on the run 
So live fast and die young Seventeen I'm sleepin on the 
Streets and no hope 
I think well I'm in the cold 
I'm in the cold now, I look to a god I said 
In my own life 
I'll never see well 
I can't see home I can't see home now 
When I look at the path 
That I chose and I'll say to you. 
Live Fast Die Young We'll stay out on the run 
So live fast and die young 
Live Fast Die Young 
We'll stay out on the run So live fast and die young 
We'll cherish every moment last forever 
We'll cherish every moment now 
We'll cherish every moment last forever We'll cherish every moment now 
Go Go Go Go 
Live fast and die young
