She was a woman on a mission 
Here to drown him and forget him 
So I set her up again to wash him down 
She has just about succeed 
With that low-down, no good cheating 
Good for nothing, came strutting through the crowd 
Oh he was laying it on so thick 
He never missed a lick 
Professing his never-ending love 
Oh but I never will forget 
When she stood up and said 
"So I guess you think we are just gonna kiss and make up don't ya?" That's when she said Why don't you kiss, kiss this! 
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips 
And me and you 
(Me and you) 
We're through 
(We're through) 
And there's only one thing left for you to do 
You just come on over hereon last time 
Pucker up and close your eyes 
And kiss this, goodbye Well,the next thing I recall 
She had him back against the wall 
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone 
She was putting him in his place 
I mean right up in his face 
Dragging him down a list of done did wrongs 
It was just about now 
That the crowd gathered around 
They come to watch him pay for his every sin 
She called him everything under the sun 
And when we thought she was done 
She rared back and she let him have it again, MAN She said...she said Why don't you kiss, kiss this! 
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips 
And me and you 
(me and you) 
We're through 
(we're through) 
And there's only one thing left for you to do 
You just come on over here one last time 
Pucker up and close your eyes 
And kiss this, Why don't you kiss, kiss this! 
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips 
And me and you 
(me and you) 
We're through 
(we're through) 
And there's only one thing left for you to do 
You just come on over here one last time 
Pucker up and close your eyes 
And kiss this, goodbye Kiss this, goodbye See ya
