Verse 1: Life can make you cry 
Through the struggles 
You wonder why 
Why things have to be so tough 
In those moments when you've had enough 
Why did I have to go through this 
There's got to be more to life than this 
Many times you ask yourself why 
Especially the days you want to cry 
Like today 
It seems to be center the of your existence 
Questions that hound you with persistence 
But a life without faith 
Is one filled with fear 
Being that way won't get you anywhere Chorus: Don't give into hate 
Keep the faith 
You can't let go 
Cause you never know 
You can't stop living 
Cause there is life in giving 
Through your pain 
Someone will love again 
Keep the faith Verse 2: God is there for you 
And He cares for you 
Open your eyes 
Then you'll realize 
You don't need to be afraid 
Through it all he stayed 
God is the One who brought you through 
And He loves you Repeat chorus Bridge: 
One day things will be better 
It won't be this way forever 
Forever 
Forever Repeat chorus
