Take the needle out, enjoy the drip 
Fill your head with lies, from your fingertips And you can't swallow all your problems 
They float, float up to hunt you 
It's time for you to choose, your conscience or the chemicals, yeah 
Caught in a dream disguise, happiness is real A snake, the knife, the candle, hold what's close to us 
A cave, that box, a tunnel, is our trust a must? 
Our irrational manifestations, please decode the dosage 
Do we dream to solve the puzzle or dream to make them up? And you can't swallow all your problems 
They float, float up to hunt you 
It's time for you to choose, your conscience or the chemicals, yeah 
Caught in a dream disguise, happiness is real, oh no, oh, no Be careful what you wish for 
Be careful what you wish for 
Be careful what you wish for [Incomprehensible] Be careful what you wish for 
Be careful what you wish for 
Be careful what you wish for [Incomprehensible] Be careful what you wish for 
Be careful what you wish for 
Be careful what you wish for
