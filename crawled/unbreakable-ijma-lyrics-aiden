So now your picture's worth a thousand words, 
You meant so much to me it hurts. 
This tattoo on my wrist, this feeling can't be missed. 
You meant so much to make things worse. Get ready for the impact, 
I promise you won't feel a thing tonight. 
Get ready for the angels to come and take away your pain and sight at the moment of passing. 
I know that memories never die. So this is my angel and I know my scars won't heal tonight 'cause they're paid for, paid for. 
I know that memories never die. 
So this is my angel and I know my scars won't heal tonight 'cause they're paid for, paid for. 
Get ready for the ending, I promise you'll feel the Earth tonight. 
And this is for the mending, 
To heal the hearts of the friends you left alive at the moment of passing. 
I know that memories never die. So this is my angel and I know my scars won't heal tonight 'cause they're paid for, paid for. 
I know that memories never die. 
So this is my angel and I know my scars won't heal tonight 'cause they're paid for, paid for. 
This is my tribute to your life. In this moment, this violent careless moment, 
I make believe that you're still here. 
I'll see you out tonight. 
I hold you close and hold you dear, Keep you by my side. 
Forever and a lifetime, 
Just a blink and you're gone. 
I wish you'd stay. And this is for your moment, 
I finally get to say goodbye the right way, 
While everyone's listening. 
I know that memories never die. So this is my angel and I know my scars won't heal tonight 'cause they're paid for, paid for. 
I know that memories never die. 
So this is my angel and I know my scars won't heal tonight 'cause they're paid for, paid for.
