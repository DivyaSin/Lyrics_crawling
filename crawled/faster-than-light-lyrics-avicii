All my life I've been learning 
I've always lived for today 
And I don't know about tomorrow 
But I can choose who I become God wasted too many days 
I got let on the wrong way ooh 
You left on a wednesday 
It might've even been your birthday ooh 
You told me to go fuck yourself 
'Cause I rubbed you the wrong way ooh 
I wasted so many days 
And we, we've been faster than light 
We've been faster than light 
We've been faster than light We've been faster than light (x4) God wasted too many days 
I got let on the wrong way ooh 
You left on a wednesday 
It might've even been your birthday ooh 
You told me to go fuck yourself 
'Cause I rubbed you the wrong way ooh 
I wasted so many days 
And we, we've been faster than light 
We've been faster than light 
We've been faster than light
