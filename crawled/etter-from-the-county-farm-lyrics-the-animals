Letter from the county farm, letter from the county farm 
And the wind it has been blowin' 
Its been blowin' so strong 
They're afraid to raise the flag 'less it gets torn to shreds 
But God forbid the wind should ever stop blowin' 
But if it did 
I'm sure we'd all fall down 
But sometimes it isn't windy 
Like last February 
I remember it snowed 
and a week later it hailed 
And now it looks like raining 
Now it looks like raining 
I'm convinced that what makes the rain and hail so heavy over here 
is that the sherrif has been messing with out minds. 
handin' out questionnaries to the pris'ners who are blind 
to the pris'ners who are blind 
Let me tell you one thing new at the county farm 
They've got muzak in the fields 
which makes this life of mine a little more unreal 
a little more unreal 
But I wish they'd kill the sounds, I wish they'd kill the sounds 
You don't knowwhat it's like to hear Debussy in a California prison field 
And I love 
I love to sing while I'm workin' 
I love to sing while I'm workin' 
And the wind has been blowin' 
And the wind has been blowin' I've given up reading for a time and taken up other pastimes 
Such as watchin' winos gum their food and epileptics havin' bad times 
More frequently I've been lost in this game 
And it looks like they're gonna make a crim'nal out of me 
A criminal out of me 
But those guys who are down on me winnin' 
Lord knows, they take the game so seriously 
But what hurts me more, burts me more than anything 
Is when I get your mail 
When I get your mail, they've cut you 
They've cut out the parts and the words that have feeling 
So I'm left with only part of you 
I say I'm only left with part of you 
And the wind has been blowin' 
And the wind has been blowin' Oh, play your guitar, baby 
Play your guitar, baby, 
Get me off this farm, baby, take me away... And apart from all this crap there is some peace and quiet 
Except for the screws grumbling and mumbling and calling me a long hair 
I wouldn't mind, but they cut my hair quite some time ago 
They cut it off when I first came here 
Which tells me Indo-China is really here behind this wire 
And it soon will be dying engulfed in their own fire, in their own fire 
In fact, they tell me that a boy like me shouldn't think like that 
But this is murder and everybody accepts that. 
Lord knows, they all accept it, and everybody knows thatt ain't where its at 
So take care, pray for rain and maybe I'll see you 
Visiting hours next week 
And when the screw, when the screw says no touching, 
Lord knows, I'll turn the other cheek.
