Well, for a while it was amazing, and I still think you're the one 
As long as we both want the same thing it's not hard to carry on 
Just place your hand in my hand, take a walk in this old (farm?) 
And hang around in the rain 'til it goes down I want to ask you questions that I never asked back then 
And you could teach me lessons 1 to 10 And on the second first impression I can see how things go wrong 
I know this isn't a confession; if it was it would take too long 
I know you will forgive me for the things I have done wrong 
I'm sorry I never liked your favorite song But put yourself in my shoes; I will place myself in yours 
Something tells me the future could be ours Well, if you wanna know how I feel, all you have to do is ask 
And all things never being easy, I'll give you (well must advice?) 
Just take a walk down my street, here is magic in the air 
And if you look you will find this (?) somewhere The feeling comes from nowhere and it takes you by surprise 
Don't say you've lost the magic in your eyes As long as we both want the same thing 
From the ashes we will rise Is it a common misconception or a beautiful idea 
That we all end up back to your place, or you all come over here 
Nobody could have planned it, it's just a pure accident 
Well the people came, the people came and went And I want you to just surround me with your love in your own way 
This kind of thing doesn't happen every day As long as we both want the same thing 
Then it all should be OK
