Uh, seems like since we got a black president 
Black people stop questioning the government 
And that ain't no diss to Barack either 
So Mutherfucker you can miss me with that other shit 
I'm good for life, I don't really need another hit 
You wanna bury me you better get the shovel and 
You better make it deep enough where no one will recover me 
I'm Bobby Fucking Ray, I'm a modern day anomaly 
Last year I did a show on a continent 
In a country with a struggling economy 
Who the hell you think paid for it all? 
It sure ain't rocket science And it sure ain't trigonometry 
Drug money, drug money, drug money 
Blood money, blood money, blood money 
For god sakes there's an all-seeing eye on the back of the dollar, 
We can't even trust money 
You need to understand who you dealing, with 
These are like modern day villains 
These are type of people that would kill a whole village 
Build a fucking building, and say it's just business 
Who you think gave you religion? 
Land of the free, who you think built it? 
And don't ever let them tell you nothing different, 
'Cause we know who did it if I ever come up missing 
I'm missing, I'm missing, I'm missing 
Ten strands of my DNA is missing 
Cuban Linx on my neck as they glisten 
Listen up Mutherfucker pay attention 
It's a New World Order that we live in 
Lies on the lips of every politician 
Man at night I pray to God for forgiveness 
I just wonder if the big homie's still listening 
Still listening, I wonder if the big homie's still listening 
Still listening, I wonder if the big homie's still listening I don't need a hook but for hooks sake 
If I had a hook, I'd make the hook say 
"Be a good slave, be a good slave" 
(Be a good slave, be a good slave) 
Everybody in my hood brave 
Everybody in my hood slang 
Every street got a freak 
And they give her all the wood that she could take 
I'm fresher than a faema coffee 
Get it? I'm fresher than a FEMA coffin 
I'm willing to die for mine 
But you the type of nigga 
You'll call the police department 
If you can't look in someone's eyes and be yourself 
And speak the thoughts that's on your mind 
You ain't got no reason to live 
You on the sideline 
You just a motherfucking slave 
They got your mind tied up and it's missing I'm missing, I'm missing, I'm missing 
Ten strands of my DNA is missing 
Cuban Linx on my neck as they glisten 
Listen up Mutherfucker pay attention 
It's a New World Order that we live in 
Lies on the lips of every politician 
Man at night I pray to God for forgiveness 
I just wonder if the big homie's still listening 
Still listening, I wonder if the big homie's still listening 
Still listening, I wonder if the big homie's still listening Uh, I know I appear to be quite severe 
An unopen mind will consider me weird 
Thats just how the Matrix has been engineered 
Now lend me your ear 
Lend me your ear 
Not to strike fear 
More like Paul Revere 
Not talking down on nobody at all 
I just got some shit I think you should hear 
Uh, Look 
I ain't acting like I got all these facts and shit 
But if you calling me a liar, look up in the sky 
Look up in the sky you can see it happening 
Uh, I'm not a activist 
Just a young, black nigga with a half a sense 
Cause there's ancient knowledge that they hiding from us 
And I think it's time that we take it back again 
Because it's missing
