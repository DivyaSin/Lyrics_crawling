Setting sun, forgot who I was 
Put the garbage where it doesn't belong 
All is numb, two minutes to one 
What's your life like with all that you've done? 
You've done, you've done Listen close wherever you go 
Dull times, let'em seep into your bones 
Keep it kind, always in time 
Honest themes every once in a while 
In a while, in a while 
In a while, in a while Filthy room, guitars out of tune 
Blank thoughts like I promised to you 
Underneath is there something to see? 
Slower clouds only reflecting 
On the water, on the water, 
On the water, on the water 
Feel's like I'm going insane, why bother? The home is where the heart is 
How long we've apart, it's been hard 
Or home is where you are 
Which side I live on, I won't say Home is where the heart is 
How long we've been apart 
It's been hard-er home 
Home is where you are 
And which side I live on 
Long we've been apart 
Home is where the heart 
Home is where you are Blank state and maudlin 
In need of something to say 
Get to solving this thinking problem 
Dissolution at the start of the day, start of the day I administered badly 
Dreaming mysteries up 
The stars spinning around and around me 
While the tasks keep piling up 
Piling up, they're piling up I might talk to the ceiling 
I never need something to do 
I never needed a reason to stare into the light, the light of the moon (moon) 
Staring at the light (moon) Home is where the heart is, home is where you are 
Long we've been apart, which side I live on 
Home is where the heart 
Staring at the light (moon) 
Staring at the light (moon)
