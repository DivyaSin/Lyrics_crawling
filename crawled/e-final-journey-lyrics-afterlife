I walk my way, just like I should 
Have to go, but I would stay if I could 
My boat of life has sailed for many years 
Some fell aboard and we brought them tears But we never know, oh, where to go 
No we never know, where to go But we always know that life won't leave 
When you die a certain truth is revealed 
The plans we've made are like the waves we've sailed 
And the lifeship travels on A thing in the way, will we die today 
Disappear and go away ? 
If we'll drown we'll sink down 
But our soals will ever stay 'Cause we never know, oh where to go 
No, we never know, oh where to go But we always know that life won't leave 
When you die a certain truth is revealed 
The plans we've made are like the waves we've sailed 
And the lifeship travels on 
And the lifeskip travels on
