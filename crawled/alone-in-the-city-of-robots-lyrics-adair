it's the best in midwestern technology. 
this place, this town, is breaking me. 
excuse me but you don't seem human. 
eyes are vacant. could it be that I'm the only one? and if home is where the heart is, then 
you're all homeless. my home is on my sleeve. 
excuse me but you don't seem human. 
eyes are vacant. could it be that I'm the only one? can you still feel anything? 
anything at all? can you still feel?
