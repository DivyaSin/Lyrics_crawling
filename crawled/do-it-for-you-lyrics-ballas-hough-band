[Chorus] 
I will climb the highest mountain, 
A dead of winter in a storm, 
Turning back ain't really an option, 
I told you I would keep you warm 
(And I) I'll do it, I'll do it for you, 
I'll do it, I'll do it for you, 
Believe it, I'll prove it to you, 
You know that I'ma do it, 
And It'll be all for you I heard you call me, I came running, 
Cause wherever you go, 
I'll be standing right by your side, 
Wanna give it to you how you want it 
Baby, just so you know, 
You can count on me at anytime I'll be your blanket when the weather's getting cold, (cold) 
I'll be your shadow so you'll never be alone, (alone) 
I'll be that shoulder you can lean on, (lean on) 
Wanna be the body that you breath on (breath on) [Chorus] I promise I got you, I'm looking out for you, 
All you gotta do is let me know, 
And I'll be right there, 
Cause honestly, I ain't never met nobody like you, 
What's mine is yours in this life that we share I'll be your blanket when the weather's getting cold, (cold) 
I'll be your shadow so you'll never be alone, (alone) 
I'll be that shoulder you can lean on, (lean on) 
Wanna be the body that you breath on (breath on) [Chorus] I'm gonna prove it, baby, 
I'll march a million miles, 
Anywhere, anytime, 
Just to see you smile, 
I'll be your hero, 
Be your animal, 
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of, yea [Chorus]
