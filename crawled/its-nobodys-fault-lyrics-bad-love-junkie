What time is it anyway? 
Where did everybody go? 
I guess I sit here by myself 
And have this drink alone I'm tired of thinking 'bout the future 
I'm sick of living in the past 
Wondering what would happened 
If the good times could last 
This feeling inside me is growing I could blame it on fate 
I could blame it on God 
But it's nobody's fault I'm broken 
Some are born saints 
Some of us are not 
And I"m not 
NO I"M NOT 
I'm broken The fool flapped his lips 
I did my talking with my gun 
And I said hell no I'm not joking 
But I do regress 
I think I need another shot 
It's it's nobody's fault I'm broken I wonder if there's a heaven 
Cause I know there's hell 
It's this worlds best kept secret 
ahh it's just as well 
I'm better off just not knowing I could blame it on fate 
I could blame it on God 
But it's nobody's fault I'm broken 
You're swear you've seen me here before 
Ya I get that a lot 
It must be the brand that I'm smoking 
You mean I'm funny he he 
Or funny ha ha 
It's OK I"m only joking 
But I do regress 
I think I need another shot 
It's nobody fault 
I'm broken
