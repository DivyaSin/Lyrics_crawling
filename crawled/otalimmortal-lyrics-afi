Hope unknown, sometimes just waking is surreal 
I walk right through the nameless ones, I know that hope's unknown 
Sometimes the water feels so real 
As I walk through, it fills my lungs, my god, I'm drowning This day never seems to end, this pain, never 
This day never seems to end, this rage I can not let go 
I hear them calling, I feel them gnawing out holes 
All through out our flawless souls, so alone Sometimes I swear that I can hear 
The taunting of the voiceless ones 
I fear that I alone fear those who finally ceased to feel 
That they're alone inside this place, I am the misplaced I hear them calling, I feel them gnawing out holes 
All through out our flawless souls 
Now every face, it looks familiar, then every face would melt away until 
Now everyone, do you know I know your deception?
