Nobody gonna kick us out 
We are here to stay 
Bang your head against the wall 
We won't go away Get adicted in '79 
Get adicted while you've still got time 
Get adicted in '79 
Get adicted We won't cause a revolution 
We just want to tell 
This is 1979 
We're gonna give it hell [1979 version:] 
Nobody gonna kick us out 
we are here to stay 
bang your head against the wall 
we won't go away get adicted cause it ain't no crime 
get adicted while we still got time 
get adicted get outta line 
get ada ada ada ada adicted we won't cause a revolution 
we just want to tell 
this is... [fart noise] 
we're ganna give'm hell [Chorus] 
[First verse] 
[Chorus 2x]
