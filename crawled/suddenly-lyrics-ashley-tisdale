Suddenly I am in front of the lights 
Everything, I'm feelin' 
Scary and beautiful at the same time 
And every day, I try just to breathe 
I want to show the whole world 
The truth inside of me Suddenly, people know my name 
Suddenly, everything has changed 
Suddenly, I feel so alive 
In the blink of an eye 
My dreams begin to rain Suddenly, time feels like the wind 
It changes everywhere I go 
I'm just trying to fit in 
Now here I stand 
And I'm still just that girl 
I'm following my heart 
In this amazing crazy world Suddenly, people know my name 
Suddenly, everything has changed 
Suddenly, I feel so alive 
In an blink of an eye Suddenly, I am center stage 
Suddenly, I am not afraid 
Suddenly, I believe again 
In a blink of an eye 
It's happening now As my dreams begin to rain 
I wanna say love me for me 
What's inside 
I wanna be positive, not run away, so much for you 
This is life Suddenly, I am center stage 
Suddenly, I am not afraid 
Suddenly, I believe again 
In the blink of an eye My dreams begin to rain
