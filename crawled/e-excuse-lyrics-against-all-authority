Well son are you feeling the pressuer yet? 
You know where you're from and you best not forget 
You can twist and contort it 
But I know you'll regret 
If you compromise all the blood that you've sweat 
And I feel it now when I'm forced to produce 
Cause this gift I've been given I've learned to abuse 
I've asked for this rope 
And I've made a fine noose for myself 
It's no excuse, It's no excuse 
I heard thy're like assholes 
I know I can be one 
So I'll be the best one I can be 
I won't compromise 
I just can't organize 
My thoughts with it hovering over me 
So we'll scream when we've finished triumphantly 
Fuck the deadlines 
And you!
