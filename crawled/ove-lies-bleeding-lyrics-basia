Poor you 
What will you do 
When there's no other like this one 
Though it's so cruel, acutely painful 
Excruciating, greatly ungrateful it's highly suspicious 
What is your secret 
There must be a motive 
A hidden agenda 
No-one's that stupid and altruistic 
To love so deeply 
And so completely 
Oh no, you're crazy 
You cannot help it 
?cause without this torture life has no meaning 
There is no reason to go on waste away or die of disappointment 
Those you love the most inflict the deepest cut 
Waste away or die of disappointment 
One you love the most will surely break your heart again your love lies bleeding 
But your heart's still breathing 
And just one "last time" you're noble and forgiving 
So your love lies bleeding 
But your heart's still breathing 
And it tears you apart poor me 
Now I agree 
There is no other like this one 
Though it's so cruel, acutely painful 
Excruciating, greatly ungrateful 
It's nothing suspicious 
There is no secret 
I don't have any motive 
A hidden agenda 
I must be stupid and altruistic 
To love so deeply and so completely 
Oh yes, I'm crazy 
I cannot help it 
?cause without this torture life has no meaning 
There is no reason to go on oh, poor you and me
