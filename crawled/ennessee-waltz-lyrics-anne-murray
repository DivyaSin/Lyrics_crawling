I was dancin' with my darlin' 
To the Tennessee Waltz 
When an old friend 
I happened to see 
I introduced her 
To my loved one 
And while they were dancin' 
My friend stole my sweetheart from me I remember the night 
And the Tennessee Waltz 
Now I know just how much 
I have lost 
Yes, I lost my little darlin' 
The night they were playin' 
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz I remember the night 
And the Tennessee Waltz 
Now I know just how much 
I have lost 
Yes, I lost my little darlin' 
The night they were playin' 
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
