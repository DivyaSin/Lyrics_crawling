The better love is 
The worse it is when it's over, 
Baby, nobody could love me like you. 
The better love is 
The worse it is when it's over, 
If I'd've known I never would 
Let you love me so good. Sometimes I wish I never met you, 
You're so much better than the rest. 
That's why I can't seem to forget you, 
Where do you go once you know you've had the best? The better love is 
The worse it is when it's over, 
Baby, nobody could love me like you. 
The better love is 
The worse it is when it's over, 
If I'd've known I never would 
Let you love me so good. I loved you more than I loved anyone, 
Couldn't love you better if I tried. 
That's why I can't just be with anyone 
Makes me feel empty inside. The better love is 
The worse it is when it's over, 
Baby, nobody could love me like you. 
The better love is 
The worse it is when it's over, 
If I'd've known I never would 
Let you love me so good. Guess I should be glad that I had you all, 
Got to build a wall between now and then. 
I'll have to survive on memories 
'Cause I know I'll never love again. The better love is 
The worse it is when it's over, 
Baby, nobody could love me like you. 
The better love is 
The worse it is when it's over, 
If I'd've known I never would 
Let you love me so good.
