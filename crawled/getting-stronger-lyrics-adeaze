Listen to me I'm feeling afraid 
Of something in my life that is wrong 
And your trying to tell me that I'm okay 
Don't worry because I am strong I know it gets hard sometimes 
but remember that I'm only human 
And the things that I face are the same things 
that you can help me to overcome I don't want nobody else 
I don't need somebody else to tell me about love 
I am strong on my own 
But if you think you can tell me 
Why the things I'm doing is going wrong 
It's just me getting stronger Well I'm here to tell you that I'm ok 
That with or without you I'm the same 
But don't get me wrong I'm still waiting for the day 
When we can say we went all the way Life is about all the meaningful things 
that we get to share with each other 
So leave the past behind in each other 
we'll find our love is strong again I don't want nobody else 
I don't need somebody else to tell me about love 
I am strong on my own 
But if you think you can tell me 
Why the things I'm doing is going wrong 
It's just me getting stronger I don't want nobody else 
I don't need somebody else to tell me about love 
I am strong on my own 
But if you think you can tell me 
Why the things I'm doing is going wrong 
It's just me getting stronger
