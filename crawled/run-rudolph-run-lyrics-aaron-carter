Yeah baby I'm ready for christmas 
Out of all the reindeers you know your the master mind 
Run run rudolph when you start to fall behind [Chorus] 
Run run Rudolph 
Santa's gotta make it to town 
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the free raign down 
Run run rudolph 
'Cause I'm feelin' like a merry go round Send santa to a boy child what have you been longing for? 
All I want for Christmas is a rockin' eltric guitar 
And then away went Rudolph racing like a shooting star [Chorus] Play that guitar 
Send Santa to a girl child what will please you most to get 
A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink, and wet 
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a paper jet [Chorus: x2]
