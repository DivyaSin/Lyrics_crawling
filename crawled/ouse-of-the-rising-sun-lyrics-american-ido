There is a house in New Orleans 
It? s called the Rising Sun 
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And Lord I know of one If he had heard what Daddy said 
He? d be a King today 
But he knew best, what he should do 
And he was on his way He soon became a travellin? man He? s travelled from town to town 
The path he took was good to him 
Till he drank his liquor down ------ Guitar solo ------ Then he woke up a body died 
Realised what he had done 
Remembered what is daddy said? bout the House of the Rising Sun There is a house in New Orleans 
It? s called the Rising Sun 
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And Lord I know of one 
And Lord I know of one yes I do I really know, I know of oneyes I do I know of one, yea
