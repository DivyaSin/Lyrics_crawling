Pierced heart, awaken in the dark 
Harsh light bleeds from flames 
Hear the drums when the morning comes 
You want your life like you had it? 
Well it's too late for that So scream loud, fill your lungs with air 
Down here, they can't hear 
They don't care and you're worse for wear 
You want your life like you lived it? 
You didn't live it right, no Night falls, learn and know it well 
Your sharp eyes are crafted by a tenure in Hell 
They cast a deadly spell 
Your figure shaped in my image now returns to life So tread soft, fear the watchful eye 
Sink deep, drink and relish the cry 
They all deserve to die 
Grant them a place at my table, and the night begins
