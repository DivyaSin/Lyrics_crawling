I heard the voice 
Didn't see behind the words 
I saw the faces 
Loved ones, unknown to me 
I was asleep 
And I never really woke 
I had a dream 
Made for me, already dreamed All the days faded away 
Carried by the endless eclipse 
Black light of those enchanting eyes 
Made me forget, walk astray Kadottaen toivonsa 
Tuhottuna tahtonsa 
Murtuneena rankona 
Astuu alas hautaansa I tasted the wine 
But I didn't taste the life 
Then when I felt the warmth 
I was frozen inside 
I closed my eyes 
To run away, to stop the pain 
But in my mind 
I was enchanted again All the days faded away 
Carried by the endless eclipse 
Black light of those enchanting eyes 
Made me forget, walk astray Blood of mine 
Not sacred anymore 
Enchanted tie 
The line of life in disgrace Silmin kutsu kadotuksen 
Valtoihinsa saanut mielen 
Mukanansa hnet vieden 
Sielunsa imien 
Krmehisen silmt katssu 
Nujertaa hnet tahtoo 
Alas kutsuu pimeyteen 
Ikuiseen unehen
