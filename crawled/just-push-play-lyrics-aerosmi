She gave you a flower 
The one that God gave her 
You all up in de kool-aid 
But you do not know the flavor 
Get into the zone baby 
And do yourself a favor 
Head down spin around 
Get a little refried 
If that don't get it you can 
Flip it on the b side Just push play 
Out of the way 
Just push play 
They're gonna do it anyway 
Just push play 
Right away

We're comin' at you anyway Sweet leaf dreamer 
You been smoking up the ganja 
Damned if you do yeah

And trade it for a coo hah Just push play
