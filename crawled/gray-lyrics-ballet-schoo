I only ever had you for a moment 
And I never thought you'd leave me but you ran right 
Ran right, ran right through me 
I can't really tell you how I'm doin' 
I finally know 
You never really loved me at all 'Cause everything about me is a struggle 
Why do I have to save every girl? 
Why can't I admit that I need better? 
Because you move me like Whoa-oh-oh-oh 
I like you Run around the city with a new friend 
And I think I said your name like maybe one time 
Wanna get out of here? 
He looks at me so crazy when I say that 
I wish we were old 
Then we would have survived all this Now please don't try to fool me with your reason 
I know you like the back of my hand 
Why can't I admit that I need better? 
Because you move me like Whoa-oh-oh-ohh 
I like you Yeah
