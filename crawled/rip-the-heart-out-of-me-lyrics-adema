I woke up this morning and knew 
That the world would test me, come un-glued 
Is it me or do you feel my pain? 
This world makes my blood boil again You rip the heart out of me 
Rip the heart out of me 
You make it look easy 
You rip the heart out of me 
Rip the heart out of me 
Control and deceive me 
You rip the heart out of me 
Rip the heart out of me I've tried everything to please you 
Gone out of my way like a fool 
What makes me break down like a bitch? 
It's so hard to crawl out of this ditch You rip the heart out of me 
Rip the heart out of me 
You make it look easy 
You rip the heart out of me 
Rip the heart out of me 
Control and deceive me 
You rip the heart out of me 
Rip the heart out of me
