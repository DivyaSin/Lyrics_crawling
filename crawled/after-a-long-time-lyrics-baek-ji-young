[Translation] 
The talks we had as we looked at each other 
The stories that only we knew 
I guess I can't erase them, 
I can't throw them away, 
I can't forget them 
I look around these streets for the first time in a while 
Whenever I pass this street, the good memories 
They keep floating up in my head so I stop my footsteps 
After a long time, I am here right now 
Because I long for that time, 
Though I tried to live without knowing, 
I keep thinking about it 
That's how I am, it keeps coming into my eyes 
The times we spent together, the memories - 
they fall like stars 
How about you? 
The people look only happy 
It seems like I'm the only one left in loneliness 
I try to pretend that I'm not 
but I keep thinking of you 
After a long time, I am here right now 
Because I long for that time, 
Though I tried to live without knowing, 
I keep thinking about it 
That's how I am, it keeps coming into my eyes 
The times we spent together, the memories - 
they fall like stars 
Tears fall 
If I wait here, 
will I be able to see you? 
Then will I be able to tell you 
how I feel right now? 
Because I miss you, because I am missing you 
That's how I am, I only know you 
Living without you makes me filled 
with regret about everything 
Because you're not here, 
because there are so many empty things 
Again today, I long for that spot and 
my footsteps won't move and I call out to you
