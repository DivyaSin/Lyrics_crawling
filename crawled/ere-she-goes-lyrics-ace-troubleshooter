I see that girl walking down the street 
I see that girl coming up to me 
I see that girl, now she's passing me by 
I see that girl, coffee in her hand 
I see that girl by the newspaper stand 
I see that girl, she's my pie in the sky She goes hand in hand with another man 
I know someday she will be mine There she goes, passing me by 
There she goes, with another guy 
There she goes, outta my life 
There she goes I see that girl getting on the bus 
And I know my luck I can't trust 
I see that girl, now she's passing me by 
I see that girl, like to invite her out to dinner 
And even though I would like to win her 
If I tried to talk to her I'd die
