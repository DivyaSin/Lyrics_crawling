Do you ever go home to a place 
Where you dont belong 
Where the feeling of neglect 
Can be oh so strong 
Where everything you try to say 
Or do is always fucking wrong 
When everything around you 
Is a sad sad sad song I did not choose to be here 
I know im your regret 
But ill paint your blackened walls clear 
So youll never forget So dance with me 
On these broken dreams 
If only, if only these walls could scream I did not choose to be here 
And I know im your regret 
But ill paint your blackened walls clear 
So youll never forget Forget the broken promises 
This is now our fate 
Not knowing why theyre given 
Power to create 
When broken is the only word 
In which you can relate 
When everything you love became 
The only thing you hate So cmon cmon and dance with me 
On these broken dreams 
If only, if only these walls could scream I did not choose to be here 
And I know im your regret 
But ill paint your blackened walls clear 
So youll never forget I wanna see you all burn
