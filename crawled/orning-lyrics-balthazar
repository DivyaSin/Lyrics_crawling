go where you want 
when you know you can change your direction 
'cause it always arrives 
but it starts with another intention 
you could drive for a while 
but you'll never understand what has happend 
to the places you left 
when you weren't paying any attention your eyes go wide in this night you were heading to 
and the morning surrounding you with its gloom 
the trails in the back as a nightly track 
your eyes see the better day you can drive for a while 
but you'll never understand what has happend 
to the places you left 
when you weren't paying any attention your eyes go wide in this night you were heading to 
and the morning surrounding you with its gloom 
the trails in the back as a nightly track 
your eyes see the better day go where you want 
when you know you can change your direction 
'cause it always arrives 
when it starts with another intention your eyes go wide in this night you were heading to 
and the morning surrounding you with its gloom 
the trails in the back as a nightly track 
your eyes see the better day
