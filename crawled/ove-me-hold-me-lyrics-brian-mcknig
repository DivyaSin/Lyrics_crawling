Every night I lie awake 
Wishin' I could love you with all my heart can take 
Tell me my love this time, do you want me to stay? You say you're in need of a little love 
And baby, it's me you're thinking of 
And nothing in this world could keep me away Darlin', finally I've waited so long for you to come to me 
Darlin', with each passing day, there's nothing left to say 
But I'm so glad we waited, it was worth the wait so Love me, hold me, don't hesitate 
Let's celebrate our love together 
Love me, hold me, don't hesitate 
Let's celebrate our love together 
Let's make it last forever, for always Can I open the shades? You ask me why 
So we can have the moon and the stars as our only light 
Cherish the moment, let's take our time Passion flies across the room 
The sweet aroma of true love in bloom 
Softly I whisper, "Forever be mine" Oh now I see, you're everything I dreamed of now it's reality 
Oh love's so rare, now it's ours to share 
It's me for only you and only you for me so Love me, hold me, don't hesitate 
Let's celebrate our love together 
Love me, hold me, don't hesitate 
Let's celebrate our love together 
But make it last forever, for always Always I've been waiting to hear you say 
You'd be mine for always 
What would I do, do without you? 
Know that it's true, I'm all about you darlin' Love me, hold me, don't hesitate 
Let's celebrate our love together 
Love me, hold me, don't hesitate
