We said goodbye, you told one so many times 
We've made our peace 
But this is love, I'll never give you up 
I know your love is come haunting me 
Like a river always running 
I keep losing you 
Like a fire always burning 
I'll be here for you If you're ready, heart is open 
I'll be waiting 
Come find me 
If you're searching for forever 
I'll be waiting 
Come find me 
I see you, here in the darkness 
Blinding light right where your heart is 
If you're ready, heart is open 
I'll be waiting 
Come find me 
Come find me 
Come find me 
I see you, here in the darkness 
Blinding light right where your heart is 
If you're ready, heart is open 
I'll be waiting 
Come find me We've lost our way that's what you told me last 
Tears, they come and go 
This is us, I'll never get enough 
It's taking losing you to know If you're ready, heart is open 
I'll be waiting 
Come find me 
If you're searching for forever 
I'll be waiting 
Come find me 
I see you, here in the darkness 
Blinding light right where your heart is 
If you're ready (if you're ready), heart is open (heart is open) 
I'll be waiting 
Come find me 
Come find me 
Come find me 
I want to meet and never leave now 
I want to meet and never leave now 
I see you, here in the darkness 
Blinding light right where your heart is 
If you're ready, heart is open 
I'll be waiting 
Come find me 
Come find me 
If you're ready (if you're ready), heart is open (heart is open) 
I'll be waiting 
Come find me 
If you're ready, heart is open 
I'll be waiting
