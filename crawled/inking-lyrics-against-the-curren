You took my hand 
and you never let go 
Well I was so sure 
but now I just don't know 
You've got me thinking 
You've got me thinking about you Because you 
You played my heart 
Took my love 
Did you plan this from the start? STOP! 
Just take a while 
I won't wait another night 
for you to call 
Cause lately I've been thinking 
That these fights 
They don't mean 
a thing to me 
Who are you to be the 
Judge of what 
I should be And here we go 
Yeah we're at it again 
Wish I could say 
that we were more than friends 
Cause I've been dreaming 
I've been dreaming about you 
(about you) Because you 
You played my heart 
Took my love 
Did you plan this from the start? And if I should do it over again 
I'd do anything to 
be us in the end STOP! 
Just take a while 
I won't wait another night 
for you to call 
Cause lately I've been thinking 
That these fights 
They don't mean 
a thing to me 
Who are you to be the 
Judge of what 
I should be STOP! 
Just take a while 
I won't wait another night 
for you to call 
Cause lately I've been thinking 
That these fights 
They don't mean 
a thing to me 
Who are you to be the 
Judge of what 
I should be When I looked into your eyes 
I saw what we should be 
You may not care anymore 
but you meant every thing to me STOP! 
Just take a while 
I won't wait another night 
for you to call 
Cause lately I've been thinking 
That these fights 
They don't mean 
a thing to ... STOP! 
Just take a while 
I won't wait another night 
for you to call 
Cause lately I've been thinking 
That these fights 
They don't mean 
a thing to me 
Who are you to be the 
Judge of what 
I should be STOP! 
Just take a while 
I won't wait another night
