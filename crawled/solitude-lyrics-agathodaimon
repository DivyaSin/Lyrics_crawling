One wish alone have I 
In some calm land beside the sea to die Upon its strand 
That I forever sleep 
The forest near, a heaven near 
Stretched over the peaceful deep That no one weeps my end 
Nor for me grieves 
But let the autumn lend 
Tongues to the leaves No candles shine 
Nor tomb I need, instead 
Let them for me a bed 
Or twigs entwine When brooklet ripples fall 
With murmuring sound 
And moon is found 
Among the pine trees tall While softly rings 
The wind it's trembling chime 
And over me the lime 
In blossem flings As I will then no more a wanderer be 
Let them with fondness store my memory And Lucifer the while 
Above the pine, good comrade mine Will on me gently smile? 
In mournful mood 
The sea sing sad refrain... 
And I be earth again 
In solitude
