(Listen to the track bitch) Burr burr burr 
I'm in the zone they keep on gettin' offended 
But ain't did nothing wrong 
But tightened up all my business 
And now I'm making millions, 
Everybody's social 
They really too emotional 
I don't have time to hold 'em 
I wanna be a billionaire, me too 
So I can count a B cashing hundreds on you to 
I get dirty money bitches know with Ciroc on my rida' 
On the stage gettin' with Diddy Nicki Ricky Roze and Flo Rida 
I rock Maris with the money ball like Stoudemire Omare 
Hold a blunt with my left hand to show my automall is Paris 
Look at all that I've accomplished, 
I just bought me three Ferrari's 
Spent five million in my company 
If I offended you not sorry, Gucci [Chorus] 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin' on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Got some killa and some gats and money 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin' on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be I'ma street magician 
And I keep on taking pretty girls to Lenox 
New mustang with 80 in it 
Watch her spend all 80 in 80 minutes 
Sacks are full real true religion 
I bought a car so sharp it make you feel suspicious 
See I'm too flamboyant 
They say its malnutritious 
I'm in a rare edition, 
Think I'm a mathematician 
Don't nobody in here put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Gotta die on my life as whats it gonna be 
Whatcha gonna do Gucci ain't gonna leave 
Still poppin' bottles pouring liquor on chicks 
No need to lie I'm such a freak 
No need to hide you so unique 
I'ma try beat your back down 'til you weep 
Said you ran outta money there's more for me 
Here's more for you cause you a whore for me 
Don't be a hoe for free 
Cause we can ball right now 
We can do it 2, 3, 4 times a week 
From zone 6 down to Camelton 
I pull up in that yellow thing 
I put rims on everything 
Hoes think I gotta wedding ring What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin' on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Got some killa and some gats and money 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin' on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be 
What it ain't gonna be Come in to leave throwin' money high 
Don't care where it reach 
Spend 2 G's a week on haircuts 
Like 4, 5, 6 sometimes a week 
These girls petrified they scared to speak 
I'm in the new gt with a Georgia peach 
Gotta condo right out on the Florida beach 
I ain't hard to reach so nice to meet 
Every night we meet you prolly fight with me 
Say its fine with me to spend the night with me 
No rules everything alright with me 
Now shake baby shake just right for me 
Catch ball players in magic city 
Show them boys how good my jumper is 
Ain't no niggas no lies to tell, 
Makin' all pros look like amateurs 
I just showed my ass last night I had a blast 
My jewelery was so bright haters put theirs in the trash 
Pulled up in somethin' fast just to make them haters mad 
Rims with paper tag paper bag full of cash What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin' on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Got some killa and some gats and money 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin' on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be
