Keep your philosophy 
Take it up or leave it 
It doesn't apply to me 
I'm not gonna change a bit 
If it means heartache 
then leave it out for your sake 
I tried and I try tried 
to take care of my insides 
Nobody's perfect so leave me if you object I want those who get to know me 
to become admirers or my enemies When you're a pirouetting, highkicking 
thighslapping cruiser 
When you're a hipgrinding spellbinding 
clean cut seducer 
You have to be careful so people take note 
I take it serious, but I still like a joke I want those who get to know me 
to become admirers or my enemies Take it up or leave it 
I'm not gonna change a bit 
If it means heartache 
then leave it out for your sake 
I tried and I try tried 
but still you say that I lied 
Nobody's perfect so leave me if you object Keep your philosophy 
it doesn't apply to me 
If it means heartache 
then leave it out for your sake, your sake 
I tried and I try tried 
But still you say that I lied 
Nobody's perfect so leave me if you object
