I'm gonna Lasso Santa Claus and I know just why because... I'm going to pull,pull on his beard , pull,pull to see if it's real. 
I'm going to tickle, tickle him on the tummy, because he laughs so funny. He's so jolly & so fine when he comes around Christmas time. 
I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus & the reason is because ...I know a boy & girl he never comes to see. He never brings them toys like he does to me. 
I'm gonna pop, pop Santa Claus with my water pistol gun squirt, squirt and then I'll take his bags of toys and run and bring them all the kids who don't have none.
