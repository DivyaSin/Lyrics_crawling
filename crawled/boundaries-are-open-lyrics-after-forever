After Forever 
Boundaries are open I see clearly all my dreams 
I know chance is always near 
Make my own reality 
Just imagine! Boundaries are open 'Cause you cannot control this 
My reality differs from yours 
The power of imagination is strong 
So we only try to imagine Will the force be so strong it will control one's mind? 
Will this power delude or widen the madness that renders blind? 
So the frontiers of our conceit 
Then will become indistinct to vanish in thin air Boundaries are open 
But don't believe it's real! So does faith have roots in imagination? 
Who is right in the grim and endless fight for revelation? 
I cannot tell what's right or wrong 
For we all dwell in an imaginary borderland Boundaries are open 
But don't believe it's real Boundaries are open 
But don't believe it's real
