The problem with society's been how do we teach 
And if they'll believe. 
We'll fight this battle for years to come 
Till we only accept that we can stand on our own. Grandfather used his hands, he worked them to the bone. 
To provide his family with a happy home, alone. Don't take your aggression out on me. 
My own man is all I'm meant to be. 
This god-damned place is so lazy old and tired 
All your ideas are so, uninspired. 
Takes more than one idea 
More than one person to fight the fight 
How many times have you taught and not conspired? Don't wanna be, they never say 
But don't call us the liars. We've walked these alleys a thousand times 
And scattered around a thousand lies. 
They are trying to hold you till you'll lie, 
It maybe hard, but keep your feet on the ground. 
Why don't I have the finer, things that others have? 
The chance is there if you want it all that bad. 
So bad. Don't take your aggression out on me. 
My own man is all I'm meant to be. 
This god-damned place is so lazy old and tired 
All your ideas are so, uninspired. 
Takes more than one idea 
More than one person to fight the fight 
How many times have you taught and not conspired? Don't try and get me confused. 
Cause I do understand. 
And sometimes people need help. 
That they may need a hand 
When this problems going on. 
A thing you have to get straight 
Is that you don't own my hand. 
And I don't owe you a thing. 
So don't think about how sorry 
You feel when now your treated so bad. This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired 
All your ideas are so, uninspired. 
Takes more than one idea, 
More than one person to fight the fight. 
How many times have you taught and not conspired? And as a race we look back and we've come so far. 
While some may conquer, 
The others had it so hard. 
But instead we just complain 
While there's no one for us to fight. 
I guess we're born and its how we keep our side to pay.
