Paradise Hey mr dj 
Won't you play my favorite record 
Blame it on the music 
Everybody is a star Hey mr dj 
Like the oracle of delphi 
Take us on a voyage 
To the planet alcazar When I hear the rhythm 
How it grabs my soul 
Shakin' through my body 
Like a super bowl 
Take me to the dj 
In the happy skies 
One way ticket 
One way ticket 
One way ticket to paradise Paradise oh ooh 
Paradise oh oh

Paradise Instant attraction 
Like a rocket in my pocket 
Instant reaction 
We go voguing on the tracks 
Instant attraction 
When I plug into the socket 
Cool satisfaction 
When we take it to the max When I hear the rhythm 
How it grabs my soul 
Shakin' through my body 
Like a super bowl 
Take me to the DJ 
In the happy skies 
On a one way ticket to paradise One way ticket
