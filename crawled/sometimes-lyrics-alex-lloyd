The traffic is jamming for miles up ahead 
Releasing emotions deep in my head 
I wish it was easy, easy to breathe 
The words that we needed to get some relief I still hear you crying, then I see you smiling 
Even when I close my eyes Sending a rescue, coming to find you 
Do you think that we could save another day? 
Try not to break down, walking the old ground 
I don't want to throw the life we had away Blocked up and cluttered, tired we stand 
Alone together was just not the plan 
Something undenying in the underlining 
Even if I close my eyes
