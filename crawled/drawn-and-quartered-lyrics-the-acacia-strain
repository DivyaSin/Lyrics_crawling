Darwin read what he wrote and it all became so clear. This is evolution: theory, principle, fact. He can't turn the tables on the real. Add is up and it still equals four. Drawn and quartered in the prime of his life. Documentation is useless. A year later gone and forgotten. Nothing makes sense after a year. With no remorse we walked away. The vultures made due with what was left. This is an endless cycle of destruction and reformation. There is no beginning nor end.
