What have I done? 
I feel my world is falling apart 
What can I do to find a way to your heart? 
What have I done? 
I feel abandoned and so alone 
I'm on my own. What have I done to you? 
Why do you treat me so cruel? 
I'm down and out. And so full of doubt 
'Cause I was given my heart 
You're gonna break it in two 
So what can I do. It isn't right 
You'd better make up your mind Don't leave me now. Don't go 
Don't you run away. One day you'll find 
We're two of a kind 
Don't leave me now. Baby 
Don't go throw my love away 
Want you to stay. What more can I say? Oh baby! 
Don't leave me now 
Don't leave me now What have I done? 
There is no answer inside your eyes 
What can I do? 
Is every smile just a lie? 
What have I done? 
I thought that loving you was right. But now I find 
What have I done to you 
I feel that I'm losing you 
Don't let it die, we've gotta try 
Just once again for a while 
'Cause baby it's up to you. So what can I do? 
And who's gonna care whenever I'm not there?
