Craving possession 
Material obsession 
You function solitarily 
On lower brain transmission You want it, you need it 
You're never gonna get it 
Cause really what you're chasing 
Is a lie to begin with Paralyze 
Manufacture aspiration 
Design the ideal outcome 
Would you like to hear your story? All this time you've played the part 
A part that was chosen just for you 
Bite down on the painless 
Enter the gates of Horn and Ivory With fire at my back 
I will tame the waters 
I will learn to swim 
Fear is not my master. [x2] How do I Breathe? 
You will choke 
How do I walk? 
You will fall 
Instinct to the extinct 
Paralysis by analysis Trapped in delusions 
Ghosts are out to haunt you 
The world you've grown to love 
Is slowly crumbling You need it, you want it 
You're never gonna get it 
Cause really what you're after 
Is a fictional desire With fire at my back 
I will tame the waters 
I will learn to swim 
Fear is not my master [x2] Enter the gates of Horn and Ivory
