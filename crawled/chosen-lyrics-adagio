[Lyrics/Forte - Music/Forte] [Verse 1] 
I'm lost in nowhere, I cannot see 
What's inside of me 
Some changes appear I can feel, 
I'm coming alive [Bridge] 
My eyes are wide, 
Opened to this brand new world, 
I'm not supposed to bleed [Refrain] 
Only my eyes can see your world, like it is, 
Blinded by innocence, see the moon fading out to black 
Leave out your mind 
And if I am the chosen one, I will try 
To help you to understand, the silence can sometimes be your friend 
Whisper your fears [Verse 1] 
Winter's breath leaves a cold wind on my face 
My believing thoughts, 
Decrease in shapes of ghostly sadness 
I've failed out of weakness [Bridge] 
My eyes are wide, 
Opened to this brand new world, 
I'm not supposed to bleed [Refrain] 
Only my eyes can see your world, like it is, 
Blinded by innocence, see the moon fading out to black 
Leave out your mind 
And if I am the chosen one, I will try 
To help you to understand, the silence can sometimes be your friend 
Whisper your fears
