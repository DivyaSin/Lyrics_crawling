We've all got problems - that's a fact 
Don't sit there and act like you're so damn perfect 
We gotta make a living - you and me 
But the green's got you so blinded, that you just can't see 
Clocked in at six in the morning 
And didn't clock out till six at night 
Yeah, a life spent under the impression 
That you ain't never worth a dime unless you work all your life 
But he still got nothing done... 
If I work all day, I should get paid for somethin' 
But I work all day, and still get nothin' 
No purpose, but to fill his prophecy 
I won't be stuttering 
I'm not gonna let 'em eat me 
Gotta go wherever my gut leads me 
Dad says go to work just to be like him 
But a future like his looks way too dim 
Hey dad, don't forget what's important 
Like your kids, your wife, and your dreams
