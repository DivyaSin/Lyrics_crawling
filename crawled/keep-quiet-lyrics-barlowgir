All the things I've sacrificed 
So that I could bring You to this world 
I want them to see You in me 
But Your name just keeps them far from me So, I'll keep quiet 
Let's hope they see I'm different Jesus, Jesus, why's Your name offensive? 
Why are we so scared to tell this world You saved us? 
When all of the hope of the world's in Your name 
Why are we so scared to say, oh, Jesus, yeah, Jesus If I avoid to speak Your name 
Tell me would You do the same to me? 
If relevance becomes my goal 
Tell me will I lose You to its hold But if I keep quiet 
They'll never see I'm different Jesus, Jesus, why's Your name offensive? 
Why are we so scared to tell this world You saved us? 
When all of the hope of the world's in Your name 
Why are we so scared to say, yeah, Jesus, whoa, Jesus, yeah I'm sorry, I've cared about my name more than Yours 
I'm so sorry, how could I hide You anymore? 
But if I keep quiet 
They'll never see I'm different Jesus, Jesus, why is Your name so offensive? 
Why are we so scared to tell this world You saved us? 
When all of the hope of the world's in Your name 
Why are we so scared to say, oh Jesus, whoa Jesus, yeah 
Oh Jesus, whoa Jesus
