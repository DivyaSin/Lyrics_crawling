When you and I first began 
We always gave each other a hand 
Never did I expect to see 
That all our love would fade away I need time to pick up all the bits and pieces 
Of these broken dreams Tell me what I'm going through 
Let's get away for a day or two 
Send some money, send some fame 
Without you it won't be the same I need time to pick up all the bits and pieces 
Of these broken dreams Well, I guess that you might say 
That we've come a long, long way 
But I say it's too soon to tell 
If our scheme will win or fail So get the toolbox out 
It's time to find a way 
To fix these broken dreams I need time to find a way 
A way to fix these broken dreams 
Tell me what I'm going through I just can't shake these broken dreams 
Take these shattered bits and pieces 
Of these scattered broken dreams 
Get the toolbox out
