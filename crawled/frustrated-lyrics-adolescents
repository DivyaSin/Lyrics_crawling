Pigs that never let me be - Most of the justice that I see 
One of those days, sleepless nights - Public scenes, domestic fights 
Routine ruts from day to day - Girls who won't go all the way 
So. Cal freeway jams - S.O.S. and legal scams 
Rides that always sketch on me - Have to have her home by three 
Memories of blowin' it - Thing I want that I can't get 
Car won't start, I'm on my feet - Snakes in the grass, so indiscreet These are some of the many things that make me - So frustrated! Needles always stuck on 'E' - Bums who want a ride for free 
Kids who Jones away the lines - Cop poured out my jug of wine 
Friends that never seem to call - Freaks that call out of the walls 
Boss won't cut me any slack - Bill collectors on my back 
People who were born to stare - Sledgehammer pulled out the air 
Radio has shut us out - Record biz so full of doubt 
Chicks that want in on the list - Guys who live to use their fists
