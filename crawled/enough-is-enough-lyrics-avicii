Feel like I've been waiting so long for tonight 
'Cause I just can't get you out of my mind 
Can you feel my heart's beating so fast 
Now you're here know there's no turning back Oh I think I'm falling 
Can't hold on no more 
Enough is enough, enough is enough, just gotta let go 
And as my grip unwinds 
I feel your hand in mine 
No I never felt, never felt, like this before Come on babe 
Don't give up on us 
Choose me and I'll show you love 
Let me show you love 
Let me show you love 
Let me show you love If you call, I will be there at your side 
If you're lost I'll be there shining my light 
'Cause every touch lifts me up to the stars 
'Cause nothing could ever keep us apart Oh I think I'm falling 
Can't hold on no more 
Enough is enough, enough is enough, just gotta let go 
And as my grip unwinds 
I feel your hand in mine 
No I never felt, never felt, like this before Come on babe 
Don't give up on us 
Choose me and I'll show you love 
Let me show you love 
Let me show you love 
Let me show you love
