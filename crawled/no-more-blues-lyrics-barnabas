Well I've got somethin'--- mean to tell you I've got somethin' 
I wanna lay on you right now 
I mean to tell you that I've got somethin' I mean to tell you 
I've got somethin' 
I wanna lay on you right now 
There's a lotta people saying' they've got the blues 
An' how they're tired of payin' all of them dues 
Hey baby--- got somethin' I wanna lay on you lay on you right now Well you can take it how you want to 
It's up to you to open up that door 
But Jesus Christ gave His life so that you could live 
Ahh don't you know it was you He died on that cross for 
Well, I've given my life to Jesus 
And I want to tell you that I ain' t got those blues no more 
Well you can try an' try an' try 
To find just a little bit of happiness to keep you goin' 
But I just gotta tell you somethin' that you ain't gonna find nothin' 
You ain't gonna find nothin' in this world 
Worth lookin' for 
But you can give your life to Jesus 
He' ll take away all the pain and all the emptiness inside 
And you won't have to have those blues no more
