Verse I 
Box drops down, then I swear 
Pandora's insides everywhere 
Have just gone through a massive break up 
All the evil inside the jar 
is on its way to my scar 
So I like to travel afar Pre Chorus 
But then I remember someone who always is there 
And so I call her, telling her my inner despair Chorus 
Hello Miss Janitor will you clean my room 
Swipe the floor and replace the door 
It's time to clean this tomb 
Please Miss Janitor what's your hourly pay 
I need my tidiness to escalate 
So please make my day Verse II 
Continuously falling on the floor 
I need help here, were art thou 
I will be satisfied with only a smile 
But for each step I take today 
I come closer to not feeling as gray 
I hope you are here to stay Pre Chorus Chorus Verse III 
Hear my words, come close to me 
Take the next train, come straight to me 
Hold my hand, 'til you fall asleep 
Take the jar's contents put it in a box 
Glue a lid on and tie it to a fox 
Scare it away, away from us Pre Chorus VII 
You are the someone, the someone who is always there 
I will always call you, you will help me with my inner despair Chorus Outro
