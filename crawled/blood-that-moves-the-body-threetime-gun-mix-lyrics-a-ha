It's the way we feel 
Tonight 
As if it's all unreal 
All right 
My love, won't you come back to 
Our love, you know I'll react to 
The blood that moves the body 
Now covers the ground 
The blood that moves the body 
The blood that moves the body There's nowhere to go 
Tonight 
Lend some warmth to our cold 
And lonely lives 
Red stains on 'Eyes Of A Blue Dog' 
My pains fade as the interiors fog 
The blood that moves the body 
Now colors the ground 
The blood that moves the body 
The blood that moves the body Not long ago 
It hurts us so 
A tremble through our lives 
The love love and care 
The way we were 
Lost it's way at nights It's the way we feel 
Tonight 
Lend some warmth to our cold 
And lonely lives 
My love, won't you come back to 
Our love, you know I'll react to 
The blood that moved our bodies 
Now covers the ground 
Now covers the ground 
The blood that moves the body 
The blood that moves the body
