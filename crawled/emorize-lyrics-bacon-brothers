I'm sure that we've been lower 
But I can't remember when 
As the chilly winds of discontent 
Are blowin once again 
Through our lives of icy fire 
Sharp as knives 
Are your words that I finally believe 
But I need some of your time before you leave 
Let me memorize you 
Every tiny imperfection in that face 
I'll always love 
Let me memorize you 
Knowin it's the last time 
That I'll lay these eyes on you 
Let me memorize you 
The arguments are empty 
Debated to a draw 
Analyzed forever 
To find some fatal flaw 
That would show 
We could see it through 
Now I know 
That one goes on 
And one will stay behind 
But don't you leave me 
'til I've etched you in my mind 
Let me memorize you 
Every tiny imperfection in that face 
I'll always love 
Let me memorize you 
Knowin it's the last time 
That I'll lay these eyes on you 
Let me memorize you 
For all of my life 
For all of my life
