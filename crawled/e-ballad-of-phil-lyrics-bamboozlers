words and music: Steven Rhodes 
I can't go in there 
I can't go near there 
I can't go anywhere 
It won't let me go 
I see my shadow 
Through the window 
And I know 
It'll snow 
Winters melting out 
Spring is blooming 
And again 
I go 
One thing I know 
Is the thing I see 
It means the world to you 
But nothing to me 
I come at fleeting times 
These cold February nights 
They dictate my life 
Chorus: 
What am I? 
I'm just a pawn to you 
I don't mean anything 
But I predict your future 
Who cares about me, 
Believes in me? 
Thinks that I come around 
More than once a year 
Another year 
Has come and gone 
I'll go to my place 
I'll sing my final song 
Summers dying out 
Fall is falling in 
And again 
I'm gone 
Once again iam 
Foresaken like the rest 
And I know 
My sleep will be long 
Chorus
