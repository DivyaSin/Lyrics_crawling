Culture souvenir shop 
Lying on the chopping block 
World wide space wide 
In a small house wife 
Motor bike horse ride 
In the general market 
Imagination gun is playing on the tv It's falling away 
It's falling away Sunrise darkness in an empty lunchbox 
(The world is so big the world is so small) 
There's a cold man can you give him a blanket 
(Can you give him something, can you give him some) 
War isn't everything but complex economics 
(It's just a day of numb, it's just a day away) 
Underline gender in the new pop culture 
(I'm just a boy living in a girl's world) It's alright, it's alright, but it's so long 
To pretenders in the new scene 
To the falling of your head 
Well it's alright, well it's alright 
But it's so long 
Falling so far
