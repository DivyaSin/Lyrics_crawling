Yeah, can you hear the call in our rambling land susurrations 
That can expand beyond all hope of light and plunge us into unrelenting night? A pall on truth and reason 
It feels like hunting season 
So avoid those lines of sight and we'll set this right [Chorus:] 
Welcome to the new Dark Ages 
Yeah, I hope you're living right 
These are the new Dark Ages 
And the world might end tonight Now come ye children one and all - let's heed Ezekiel's call 
And bide until the word is good and ripe and get plucked clean out of sight The world will be erased 
Our kin will be immaculate ejaculate in space before the King of King's love 
He'll snatch us from above 
Brothers, help me sing it [Chorus] So, how do you sleep? 
There's nothing to keep 
This is deep Because we're animals with golden rules 
Who, who can't be moved by rational views, yeah Welcome to the new Dark Ages 
I hope you're living right 
Welcome to the new Dark Ages 
Say it again, yeah 
These are the new Dark Ages 
I hope you're living right 
Welcome to the new Dark Ages 
And the world might end tonight
