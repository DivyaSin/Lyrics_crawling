You're a little to drunk to drive and I'm a little too into you to let you go, 
I ain't ready to kiss you goodbye just yet and let you disappear down that road, 
Don't know where this is goin', girl all I know is this, 
In the morning, I wanna wake you with a kiss. Let me pay this tab and we'll hail a cab and hold onto the night, 
Wrap your arms around what we're feelin' now and cover it in candlelight, 
Wanna drift off to dream with your name on my lips, 
Ain't goin' nowhere, I promise you this, 
In the morning, I'm gonna wake you with a kiss. I wanna watch you down the hallway, see if heaven waits behind that door, 
Watch your shadow dancin' on the wall while your dress is sleepin' on the floor, 
Hold you still beside me while the world around us spins, 
And in the morning, I wanna wake you with a kiss. Lets dance this dance and take this chance and hold onto the night, 
Wrap your arms around what we're feelin' now and cover it in candlelight, 
Wanna drift off to dream with your name on my lips, 
Ain't goin' nowhere, I promise you this, 
In the morning, I'll wake you with a kiss. Wanna wake up there right by your side, 
And brush the hair out of your eyes, 
At the start of a brand new day with a smile there on your face. Girl lay your heart against my heart and lets hold onto the night, 
Wrap your arms around what we're feelin' now and cover it in candlelight, 
Wanna drift off to dream with your name on my lips, 
Ain't goin' nowhere girl I promise you this, 
In the morning, I'll wake you with a kiss. Yeah, in the morning, I'll wake you with a kiss.
