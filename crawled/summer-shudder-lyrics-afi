Listen when I say, when I say it's real 
Real life goes undefined, why must you be so miserable? 
Everything you take makes me more unreal 
Real lines are undefined, how can this be so miserable? Under the summer rain I burnt away 
Under the summer rain you turned away 
(Burn!) (Under the summer rain) Listen I can't make, make a sound or feel 
Feel fine, I kissed the lies why must they be so distant? Whoa 
Listen as I break, break the four wall seal 
Gorgeous eyes shine suicide, when will we be invisible? Under the summer rain I burnt away 
Under the summer rain we burned away 
(Burn!) 
Under the summer rain I burnt away 
Under the summer rain you turned away 
(Burn!) This is the fall, this is the long way down 
And our lives look smaller now and our lives look so small 
(Willingly crying) 
This is the fall, this is the long way down 
And our lives look smaller now and our lives look so small Under the summer rain I burnt away 
Under the summer rain we burned away 
(Burn!) Under the summer rain I burnt away 
Under the summer rain we burned away 
(Burn!) 
Under the summer rain I burnt away 
(Burn!) 
Under the summer rain you turned away 
(Burn!)
