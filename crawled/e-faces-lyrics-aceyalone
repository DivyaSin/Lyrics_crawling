Right there...cool 
Come here 
Let me holler at you face to face 
See ace been place to place 
I seen a million of em 
They look at me for a split second 
Then they grin, never to be seen again 
But it`s locked in, so I can read every line 
Its written all over your upside down mind 
With an upside down smile 
Whoops upside your head, well hey now 
I never forget a face, especially your`s 
Because the mirror is the only dimension without flaws 
I look out till again 
And then begin to look out for the faces of men 
Cause I done been face to face with a serpent 
Demon is the same think it is when it ain't 
White like snow or black like coal 
Yellow like the moon and red(read) like a book 
To live or die is the plot but the face is the hook 
So meet the face from left field 
3 eyes two ears one nose and a grill, but still remain faceless 
Oh ya Let me holler at you face to face 
See ace been place to place 
I seen plenty of em 
But don`t let the face fool ya 
There`s so many of em, but still remain faceless 
Let me holler at you face to face 
See ace been place to place 
I seen plenty of em 
But don`t let the face fool ya 
There`s so many of em, but still remain faceless So can I take a poloroid? -say cheese- 
Of the face that got you employed -please- 
Same face your momma enjoyed as a boy 
Will be the same face that will get you destroyed 
Now you got to face the facts, face the music 
You cannot about face it and turn back when you abuse it 
So wisdoms use it wise, bat thoses eyes, show them teeth 
Lick them lips even powder them cheeks 
So while your passin`, I'm askin` myself 
I wonder if she knows what I`m looking at 
Well look at that, a face that got me looking back 
I can see the history in your bone structer 
I can see the misery in your frown 
So smile now and cry later 
Or just walk around with the face of a clown and still remain faceless 
I said smile now and cry later 
Or just walk around with the face of a clown and still remain faceless Let me holler at you face to face 
See ace been place to place 
I seen plenty of em 
But don`t let the face fool ya 
There`s so many of em, but still remain faceless 
Let me holler at you face to face 
See ace been place to place 
I seen plenty of em 
But don`t let the face fool ya 
There`s so many of em, but still remain faceless
