The ash of my mind in the back of my throat 
Out on the ocean of curling, fetal smoke 
The anti spirit of time just behind these eyes of mine 
I can remember all that you've forgotten Grave dirt in the eyes 
The darkness there between your thighs 
The incubus that sucks me dry 
Beneath the sky Touched but untouchable 
Bleeding black into the blue bayou 
Seem like it was Friday high noon 
I smoked and you bled thought that I was dead 
I can't remember all that you've forgotten Forsaken, there's grave dirt in my eyes 
The darkness there between your thighs 
The incubus that sucks me dry 
Beneath the sky Smile after smile 
Chasing the last over the lips 
Smile after smile 
Chasing the last over the lips The ash of my, the ash of my 
The ash of my, the ash of my mind, my mind There's grave dirt in the eyes 
The darkness there between your thighs 
The incubus that sucks me dry 
(All night) There's grave dirt in the eyes 
The darkness there between your thighs 
The incubus that sucks me dry 
Beneath the sky 
Touched but untouchable
