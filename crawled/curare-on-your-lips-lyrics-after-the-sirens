Welcome to the last time 
That You can buy my answer 
With less than a question 
I would sell the hands off my wrists 
If they weren't so preoccupied 
With taking the bread from Your fingers And downing this cheap new years wine 
That we call Your blood 
And You can wait for midnight 
But my lips are sealed 
And You can wait for midnight 
But my lips are sealed In this garden I'm waiting anxiously 
For my children to come and murder me 
In this crowded room, staring nervously 
Lovers lick at their lips and wait for the kiss I've been sharpening 
My teeth for this moment 
And I'll stab with my lips 
But You've already won
