Blake Shelton Sings Austin. 
It's on his 2001 Album. She left without leaving a number 
Said she needed to clear her mind 
He figured she'd gone back to Austin 
Cause she talked about it all the time 
It was almost a year before she called him up 
3 rings and an answering machine is what she got If you're calling about the car, I sold it 
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling 
If you got something to sell you're wasting your time 
I'm not buying 
If its anybody else wait for the tone you know what to do and 
P.S. if this is Austin I still love you.... The telephone fell to the counter she heard 
But she couldn't believe what kind of man would 
Hang on that long what kind of love that must be She waited 3 days and then she tried again 
She didn't know what she'd say but she heard 3 rings and then.... If its Friday night I'm at the ball game 
And First thing Saturday if it don't rain 
I'm headed out to the lake and I'll be gone 
All weekend long but I'll call you back when I get home on 
Sunday afternoon and P.S. if this is Austin I still love you Well this time she left her number but not another word 
And then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening 
And this is what he heard If you're calling about my heart its still yours 
I should have listened to it a little more 
And it wouldn't have taken me so long to know where I belong And by the way boy this is no machine you're talking to 
Can't ya tell this is Austin and I still love you.
