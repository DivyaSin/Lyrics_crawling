If I could only read your mind 
To understand what you are thinking 
I'd take a step back into time 
But that it is me, I'm only dreaming Well, can I stand the fear of walking 
Will I disappear and walk away 
But let it be for another day again 'Cause I'm falling down again 
And I do not know the reasons 
That I'm falling down again, again I close my eyes and wonder why 
I can't put this all together 
I want to let you go this time 
But the addiction's growing stronger 
The fighting's getting harder Can I stand the fear of walking 
Will I disappear and walk away 
But let it be for another day again, yeah 'Cause I'm falling down again 
And I do not know the reasons 
That I'm falling down again, again And only time can heal this pain 
But just make it through another day Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa, whoa And I'm falling down again 
And I do not know the reasons 
That I'm falling down again, again And I'm falling down again 
And I do not know the reasons 
That I'm falling down again, again
