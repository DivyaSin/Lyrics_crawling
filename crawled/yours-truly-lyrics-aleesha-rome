And when I wake in the morning and, 
You're not here 
I, I start to search every moment and, 
Taste the tears 
Cause I 'm outta my head over you And you look deep into my eyes and I feel the air that you breathe Yours truly, 
I'm counting the moments 
Truly, 
When I fall asleep 
And I'm with you, and you, you are my dream 
Yours truly And every count of your heart beat now, 
Lingers on 
I, I want to dream every moment, 
And, feel the sun 
Cause I'm outta my head over you I reach out and touch for your hand 
And you feel the air that I breathe Yours truly, 
I'm counting the moments 
Truly, 
When I fall asleep 
And I'm with you, and you, you are my dream 
Yours truly
