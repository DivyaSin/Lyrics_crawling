Turn your eyes upon Jesus 
Look full in His wonderful face 
And the things of Earth will grow strangely dim 
In the light of His glory and grace Oh soul are you weary and troubled? 
No light in the darkness to see 
There's a light for a look at the Savior 
And life more abundant and free His words shall not fail you, He promised 
Believe Him and all will be well 
Then go to a world that is dying 
His perfect salvation to tell Turn your eyes upon Jesus 
Look full in His wonderful face 
And the things of Earth will grow strangely dim 
In the light of His glory and grace Turn your eyes upon Jesus 
Look full in His wonderful face 
And the things of Earth will grow strangely dim 
In the light of His glory and grace Oh soul are you weary and troubled? 
No light in the darkness to see 
There's a light for a look at the Savior 
And life more abundant and free Turn your eyes upon Jesus 
Look full in His wonderful face 
And the things of Earth will grow strangely dim 
In the light of His glory and grace Turn your eyes upon Jesus 
Look full in His wonderful face 
And the things of Earth will grow strangely dim 
In the light of His glory and grace
