Well, do you believe what you're saying 
Or are they angry words? 
Remember "goodbye" is a long time 
Longer than "forever" or "i love you" 
And you looked at me like I'm a stranger 
(chorus) 
But this is me 
Do you remember who you're talking to 
This is me -- but who are you? I sat in your car and I listened 
To all your crazy theories 
But something inside must have broken 
'cause all your words were in another language 
And you looked at me like I'm a stranger Chorus Bit by bit the pieces fell together 
Day by day the problems were getting better 
Then you laughed and said I'll have to forget you If this was a joke I'd be laughing 
It seems so impossible 
But when I wake up in the morning 
I'll wake up alone, still not understanding 
How you looked at me like I'm a stranger Chorus
