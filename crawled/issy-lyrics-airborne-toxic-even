Missy got off the bus one day 
In a crowd of people, downtown LA 
She looked around as if to say, 'I'm home' 
But I'm home I find someone to love 
And some place to drink 
And some time when I can just sit and think 
And I don't mind if I catch the stink of these drones 
Lord, of these drones 
Just as long as I'm never alone She had eyes as big as porcelain plates 
And skin as thin as paper drapes 
And she loved the Lord the way an apostate loves songs 
And she'd sing to him before she went to sleep: 
"I pray to you, my soul to keep 
You're shepherd, then I'll be your sheep 
Until dawn, oh until dawn 
Well I'd follow you, even if it was wrong" I met her one night at the coffee shop 
Her face so bright, my heart just stopped 
Hello my dear, I fear I'm not what I seem 
Not what I seem 
I should've become a better man 
I should be more deserving than 
The beggar, thief and courtesan I've been 
Oh, that I've been 
But I swear, I lie, I curse all of my dreams
