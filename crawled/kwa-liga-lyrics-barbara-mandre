Kaw-liga was a wooden Indian standing by the door. 
He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store. 
Kaw-liga just stood there and never let it show, 
So she could never answer "yes" or "no." CHORUS: 
Poor ol' Kaw-liga, he never got a kiss. 
Poor ol' Kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed. 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-liga, that poor ol' wooden head. He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk. 
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped some day he'd talk. 
Kaw-liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign, 
Because his heart was made of knotty pine. Kaw-liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere. 
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair. 
Kaw-liga just stood there and never let it show, 
So she could never answer "yes" or "no."
