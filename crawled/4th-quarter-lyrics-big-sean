I look up 
Straight up 
I gave 'em time, time 
Time Now it's back to me nigga 
I took my clique turned it to faculty nigga 
Took my operation to factory nigga 
When I'm in the zone they won't tackle me nigga 
I touched down in the city, a fuckin' walkin' target 
Still man all my bitches miss me, yeah they miss me but not misses 
If you ask me what's my interest, all my interest involve interest 
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off but you can't cut my percentage (No no) 
With the bases loaded all we need's a hit, boy I'mma still swing for the fences (Gone) 
I guess you tend to overdo it when you come up underprivileged, look 
I came to my senses, I can never count on people 
I can't even trust the senses in this world full of venom 
All I need's my spider senses, my short temper to cool out 
Yeah sometimes I need woosah, time to get paid by the goo-ghaas 
My office on top of that rooftop, for my mama Myra Anderson 
Tell me who gon' be set for life, Myra and her son, fo' sure 
One time for the fam', they don't eat, I don't eat 
I can't rest on my feet 'til they all on they feet 
They say rest your eyes, I'm just like why? 
Bitch I ain't never seen Ben Franklin sleep 
But I do need that paper like sheet after sheet 
I got so much drive hoe, look both ways in the streets 
When I heard 'bout all these singers and all they naked pictures 
I'm like "Did my email just leak?" Hol' up 
Lemme check, oh nah nah nah 
They fake, we good, we good The stock goin' up, makin' all the right moves 
Boy you would have thought I got tipped off (Tipped off) 
You would have thought these niggas fell off a skateboard 
The way they take these hoes and trick off (Trick off) 
I got a rich girl, I swear to Dod dawg, man she's like a walkin' ATM 
Except she ain't come in with drawls 
I know you've been having G.O.O.D. Music withdrawls 
I can not deal with the fuckery that fake shit you be in 
All that bullshit that you rappin' honestly just makes me cringe 
Money doesn't grow on trees, O.K. Someone explain to me 
Then how the hell does my whole team just keep on rakin' it all in, hah? 
We stressed on, we pressed on 
Met with Hov and Bey they told us we next on 
We dream that, been slept on, we kept on, we left home 
Mama earlobes is V.S. Stone 
Her earrings so big she can't even fuckin' hear nothing nigga 
Don't give a fuck, no I can't spare one nigga 
No I do not have five wheels, I can't spare one nigga 
Talkin' like I'm on the last cigarette 
'Cause I had to take it back to square one nigga
