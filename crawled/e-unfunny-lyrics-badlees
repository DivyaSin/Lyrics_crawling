Just be clever for clever's sake 
Starin' at the ceiling into shadow fakes 
The circle-smokes in the ladies room only 
Got you as far as the roles assumed A glimpse of the perfect crime 
Is just a reverie away 
Whaddaya say we hang there a while 
For expediency's sake? And fantasize 
The great demise of the unfunny 
Cut and dry 
We'll bid goodbye to the unfunny Their personality inspires 
Like a five pound bag of fertilizer 
Like living in a house with fifteen cats 
You're unaware of the stench when a line goes flat A glimpse of the perfect crime 
Is just a reverie away 
Whaddaya say we hang there a while 
For expediency's sake? And fantasize 
The great demise of the unfunny 
Set 'em up 
We'll drink a cup to the unfunny
