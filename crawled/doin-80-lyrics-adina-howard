This is a true story (this is a true story) 
Its kinda crazy (its kinda crazy) 
It goes back a little (It goes back a little) 
See me and my mans (see, me and my mans) 
We was like peanut butta and jelly (we was like, peanut butta n jelly) 
It was crazy like (like) 
One wasn't without the other (one wasn't without the other) 
It was something (it was something) 
And it took a wrong turn 
I ended up on the freeway I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place 
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down 
I'm doin 80 on the freeway and I'm on my way 
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong 
I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place 
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down 
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80 
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80 I got this feeling that I just can't shake 
And I can't focus I can't even concentrate 
Where my baby been all day long 
Last time we spoke said he was on his way home 
I tried to tell myself don't lose it don't jump to no conclusions 
But what could he be doing 
I'm headed for the door, grab my car keys 
Now I'm on the freeway doin 80 I'm hoping that I'm wrong ain't nothings going on 
I got this premonition womans intuition 
If nothings going on won't you pick up the phone 
And I gotta know so I gotta go I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place 
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down 
I'm doin 80 on the freeway and I'm on my way 
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong 
I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place 
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down 
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80 
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80 As I get closer I start to question what I'm doing 
I must be wrong could I be wrong am I just foolish 
He gotta know I ain't the type of girl to fool with 
And god I hope I don't run up and see some bullshit 
I tried to tell myself don't lose it just turn up the music 
But what could he be doing oh 
Damn he got me dippin 
Don't wanna get a ticket 
But I gotta know I'm hoping that I'm wrong ain't nothings going on 
I got this premonition womans intuition 
If nothings going on won't you pick up the phone 
And I gotta know so I gotta go I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place 
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down 
I'm doin 80 on the freeway and I'm on my way 
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong 
I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place 
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down 
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80 
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80 I know he's home 
His lights is on 
Who's car is in the driveway 
He ain't alone 
I walked up on the porch 
Knock knock knock (Who is it) 
He won't open the door 
Knock knock knock 
Baby girl I know its you 
But I can't open up this door 
Cause if I do you'll know the truth and won't love me no more 
Baby say no more open up the door 
He opened the door 
It was my best friend
