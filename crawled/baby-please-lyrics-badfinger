She's a long, tall, skinny-minny 
Never says a word, but she knows 
She never tells me why 
She's clever and she lets it show She's an all around, bawdy-clawdy 
Everyday collector of dreams 
But she never tells me why 
She's clever and she loves to please Stay, baby, stay 
Play, baby, play 
Won't you please? She's the old soul of rock 'n' roll 
She's every kind of woman you see 
She never tells me how 
She's so clever as she has to be She's an all night, treat me right 
Answer to my lonely day 
She never tells me why 
She's clever and she always plays Stay, baby, stay 
Play, baby, play 
Won't you please? Yeah, oh yeah 
Stay Stay, baby, stay 
Play, baby, play 
Won't you please? 
Please
