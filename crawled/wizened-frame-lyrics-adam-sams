One day I'll come riding over them hills 
With the salt in my hair and the sand upon my soles 
With the river's current rushing through my veins 
And the life I found when I grabbed hold of the reins I promise I'll come back around 
I just gotta leave for a little while One day you'll see me walking through these streets 
One day I'll arrive and finally find some sleep 
With a wizened frame and a clean slate of mind 
And the kind of love that only comes with time I promise I'll come back around 
I just gotta leave for a little while
