Did you know? That I'm contiguous watching you type on the phone 
Something as simple as hearing your tone 
It's enough for me to feel like I'm at home (oh yeah) 
Did you know? That each and every time you walk into a room 
My eyes are totally fixed on you 
I know you want to show me all that you can do 
But I think that you're confused I don't ask for much 
But I don't need anything 
Baby all that I ask 
My only request 
All that I really need 
Is too share the same air that you breathe Sometimes I just stay awake and watch you sleep 
And try to guess what you do in your dreams 
That's my favorite thing to do when you're with me (oh yeah) 
Did you know? That your smile lightens up through the night 
I like to think that happens when I'm on your mind 
I know you want to give the world to me tonight 
But you should realize I don't ask for much 
And I don't need anything 
Baby all that I ask 
My only request 
All that I really need 
Is too share the same air that you breathe And I'll be okay, as long as you're here with me yeah 
Baby promise me that, there's no turning back 
I'll be fine honestly, if I can share the same air that you breathe 
So you don't have to prove, that your love is true 
Might give you the world tonight, cause I'll be satisfied 
If I'm by your side, I get a butterfly from looking in your eyes I don't ask for much 
And I don't need anything 
Baby all that I ask 
My only request 
All that I really need 
Is too share the same air that you breathe And I'll be okay, as long as you're here with me yeah 
Just promise me that, there's no turning back 
I'll be fine honestly, if I can share the same air that you breathe Oh yeah 
Oh, oh, oh 
If I can share the same air that you breathe
