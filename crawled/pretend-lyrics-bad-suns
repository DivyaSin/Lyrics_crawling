Sometimes I wish that we could all forget 
Your figure fades into a silhouette 
But I hear you breathing 
I'm done believing We're painting portraits but the canvas is blank 
If this life is a gift then who do we pay? 
You're desperate for the answer 
It eats at you like cancer Tonight won't ever end; can we pretend, pretend, pretend? 
We'll paint the walls instead and I'll pretend, pretend, pretend again Your head is filled with unproven thoughts 
Twisting theories into bigger knots 
And I feel you dreaming 
You're done believing Tried to avoid this but I'm weak to the bone 
My inner compass points me to the unknown 
But I still keep running faster 
Yea, someday I'll find the answer Tonight won't ever end; can we pretend, pretend, pretend? 
We'll paint the walls instead and I'll pretend, pretend, pretend again 
Ooh, pretend, pretend, pretend 
We'll paint the walls instead, and I'll pretend, pretend, pretend again I wanted to know you 
Though I still don't know myself 
I've got so much to show you 
Won't you show me the way? (yea) Tonight won't ever end; can we pretend, pretend, pretend? 
I don't want this to end so I'll pretend, pretend, pretend again 
Ooh, pretend, pretend, pretend 
Tonight won't ever end; can we pretend, pretend, pretend instead? Lights turned low 
Lights turned low 'cause I don't wanna see this go 
So can I just pretend, pretend, pretend instead?
