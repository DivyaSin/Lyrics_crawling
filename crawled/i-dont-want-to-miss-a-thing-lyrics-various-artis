I could stay awake just to hear you breathing 
Watch you smile while you are sleeping 
While you're far away and dreaming I could spend my life in this sweet surrender 
I could stay lost in this moment forever 
Where every moment spent with you 
Is a moment of treasure [Chorus] 
I don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall sleep 
Cause I miss you babe and I don't wanna miss a thing 
Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dreams would never do 
Cause I miss you babe and I don't wanna miss a thing. Lying close to you, 
Feeling you're heart beating 
And I wonder what you're dreamin, 
Wondrin' if it's me you're seeing And then I'd kiss your eyes 
And thank God were together 
I just wanna stay with you 
In this momment forever, forever and ever [Repeat chorus] I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep 
Cause I miss you babe and I don't wanna miss a thing I don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall asleep 
Cause I miss you babe and I don't wanna miss a thing 
Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dreams would never do 
I'd still miss you babe and I don't wanna miss a thing ehhahhhehahh 
I'd still miss you babe and I don't wanna miss a thing The sweetest dreams would never do I'd still miss you babe 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
I don't wanna miss a thing 
I don't wanna miss a thing 
I don't wanna miss a thing!
