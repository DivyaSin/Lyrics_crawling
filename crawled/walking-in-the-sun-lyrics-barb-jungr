Well, things have been goin' wrong long enough to know when everything's just right 
I've been walking in the dark long enough to know when I've finally seen the light 
I've been losing long enough to know when I finally have won 
And even the blind man can tell when he's walking in the sun. Well, I've cried enough tears to recognize this feeling of a smile 
I've been bottom rung long enough to know when I'm doing it in style 
I've been running long enough to know when there's no more need to run 
(O Lord) Even the blind man can tell when he's walking in the sun. The wind is at my back and I'm sailing on a ship long overdue 
I've blown so many chances, I ain't gonna blow this one with you 
And I've seen enough bad times to know when the good times have begun 
O Lord - Even the blind man can tell when he's walking in the sun (Oh yeah) Even the blind man can tell when he's walking in the sun
