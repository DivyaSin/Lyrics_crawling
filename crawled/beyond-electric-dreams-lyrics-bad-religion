No one here can show you where it is but I can point to a sign 
On the roof of the world without apparent design 
The frozen definition of a lunatic ambition to rise 
The air is thin, the future dim, dimension hard to find Up on a mountain 
Encased in solar rays 
Beyond electric dreams 
Of inarticulate passion plays 
Coming down a mountain 
Eons have a human ring 
The conversation of impassive planets 
Intercepted by a human being Ratiocination is a practicable way to derive 
An attitude of altitude and probity by which to abide 
Or maybe a theophany of flaming creosote in disguise 
The air is thin, the future dim, dimension undefined Up on a mountain 
Encased in solar rays 
Beyond electric dreams 
Of inarticulate passion plays 
Coming down a mountain 
Eons have a human ring 
The conversation of impassive planets 
Intercepted by a human being Let's go where the raptor goes 
To the mountain in a cosmic glow 
We'll have a genuine terrestrial show 
On a mountain, on a mountain 
Let's scan the horizon clean 
For any trace of human schemes 
And try to touch upon immortal themes 
On a mountain, on a mountain Up on a mountain 
Encased in solar rays 
Beyond electric dreams 
Of inarticulate passion plays 
Coming down a mountain 
Eons have a human ring 
The conversation of impassive planets 
Intercepted by a human being
