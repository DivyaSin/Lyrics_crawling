I'm lifted by your words. 
They mean so much. 
It's been so long since I've smiled. 
You bring me new life. 
Is this a dream? 
If so I don't want to ever wake. 
Let me sleep forever. 
Embrace this moment, it's too good to last for long. 
Although I wish it could. 
Don't leave me now, it's too hard, to stand without you.
