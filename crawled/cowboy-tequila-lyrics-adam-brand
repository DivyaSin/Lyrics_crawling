Friday night bout ten o'clock 
Packed house, line around the block 
The bands rockin' the dance floors full 
Their crankin' up the speed on the mechanical bull 
Line 'em up right across the bar 
Look out party's really 'bout to start 
The bar tender shouts OK who's next 
The place goes crazy, well what did you expect Cowboy tequila 
Cowboy tequila 
There ain't nothing in this whole wide world 
That drives me wild 
Like a sexy cowgirl 
Shootin cowboy 
Cowboy tequila Here comes Suzie with her girl friends 
She's kinda shy except for the weekends 
A lick of salt from her long tanned neck 
A hit of lemon straight from her lips Shot 1 head spins 
Shot 2 kicks in 
Shot 3 I'm on my knees 
Shot 4 on the floor and I want more more I wake up with a hammer in my head 
I swear I'll never do that again 
Phone rings it Suzie on the line 
I guess it wouldn't hurt me 
Just one more time Cowboy tequila 
Cowboy tequila 
There ain't nothing in this whole wide world quite like a 
Cowboy tequila 
Cowboy tequila 
There ain't nothing in this whole world 
That spins my spurs like a sexy cowgirl shootin' cowboy 
Cowboy tequila 
Cowboy tequila
