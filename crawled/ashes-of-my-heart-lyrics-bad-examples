It's getting to the point 
Where I no longer know 
Exactly what I want or need 
A new disaster threatens 
Every day that I stay here with you 
Trying to start a fire 
Where there used to be a fire burning 
Here in the ashes of my heart 
And all you really need 
Is that I give you everything 
I used to give you 
Back when giving everything was easy 
Yesterday I loved you 
Now I'm trying to start a fire 
Where there used to be a fire burning 
Here in the ashes of my heart I'm sick and tired 
Of being sick and tired 
We both admit we're losing hope 
I love you but I don't suppose 
It really makes a difference if I say It's getting to the point 
Where I now disregard the feelings 
That you share 
I know that you deserve much better 
Than this fumbling cartoon character 
Trying to start a fire 
Where there used to be a fire burning 
Here in the ashes of heart I'm sick and tired 
Of being sick and tired 
We both admit we're losing hope 
I love you but I don't suppose 
It really makes a difference if I say I don't know what to feel now 
There's nothing left that's real now 
Tell me - 
We fell in love together 
Spent so many years together 
Why must we fall out of love alone? It's getting to the point 
Where I no longer know 
Exactly what I want or need 
This hurricane's inside me 
And I'm sorry but I can't go on 
Trying to start a fire 
Where there used to be a fire burning 
Here in the ashes of my heart I'm sick and tired 
Of being sick and tired 
So damn sick of all this
