For all those who wanna analyze me 
For all those who wanna analyze me 
It starts off in the hips 
Move to the lips 
For all those who wanna analyze me My mother committed suicide when I was four or five 
I love Mike O, was killed by a psycho 
But I'm not sad or sorry 'Cause we be tomorrow 
'Cause we be tomorrow 
For all those who wanna analyze me 
For all those who wanna analyze me My mother committed suicide when I was four or five 
I love Mike O, was killed by a psycho 
But I'm not sad or sorry 'Cause we be tomorrow 
Next month, next week 
I guess I'm weak 
I guess I'm weak 
But I'm not sad or sorry 'Cause we be tomorrow 
Suicide when I was four or five 
Mike-O killed by a psycho 
Sad or sorry, I be tomorrow 
For all those who wanna analyze me Starts off in the hips 
Move to my lips 
Starts off in the hips 
Move to my lips Train passes where they prosecute 
So be careful where you tread 
It's a land mine baby 
Don't go losing your head Just remember our love 
So you won't give up 
If you remember our love 
So you won't give up Long gone are the proper sleeves 
To walk by our side 
Long killed are the visionary souls 
Now we're walking blind The lies are meant to hypnotize 
And put you in a spell 
Wake up you sleepy heads Release yourselves from hell 
You won't give up 
You can't give up They made us drink salt water 
Then sell us liberty 
Tell me how can you sell somebody 
What's supposed to be free 
You know the non-contender for the derelict mind You starved us baby 
And you're gonna shine 
You starved us baby 
And you're gonna shine 
You starved us baby Fuck creation, fuck creation 
Fuck creation, there is no relevance with my life 
All I mean is how to fight 
Producing the goods I'm fit to make sense Built with more right 
Especially a thing, self-defense 
A wasted office in my mind 
All the time I've been blind Race an objective difficult at times 
Don't know what to do 
Name your Baby Namboo 
Mine's far and away the rest is up to you Politicians are destroying 
The dreams of the many 
One can inform our country 
So they don't spend a penny Less than our future 
On some posh adventure 
Driving along Concord Lane 
They're looking for adventure Pick out the homes and count the best bids 
Pick out the homes and count the best bids 
There's only so much to go around 
And they took the life It's not what you're savin' 
It's how much you got 
Pick out the homes and count the best bids 
Hunt the homes and pick out the best bids You're on his high and you won't give up 
Your tongue is torn and you won't give up 
Your back is broke and you won't give up 
You're all alone but you're so tough You won't give up, you won't give up 
You starved us baby and you cannot shine 
You starved us, baby
