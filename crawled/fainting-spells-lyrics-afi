Give me this before 
I slip, 
Before I sink, 
Because I think 
I think I may have found 
The short way down 
Just give me something 
Something?s cold and clear 
The love spent here, 
As I had feared, 
Means nothing dear. 
I pray to reason I?ll forget 
I?ll trade what?s left Just give me something 
I?m the devout, 
Praying just to 
Get the blood out, 
Bound by this flesh I own 
I?m the devout, 
Cutting just to 
Get the blood out 
Desecrate 'til we die alone I will defy 
The pulse, disguise 
But please pretend 
We?re still alive 
If it gives you hope 
I sung and drowned, 
I?m taking the short way down Just give me something 
I?m the devout, 
Praying just to 
Get the blood out, 
bound by this flesh I own 
I?m the devout, 
Cutting just to 
Get the blood out. 
Desecrate til we die alone Give me something I can take, 
Can take to make the memories fade, 
Poison kiss, remember this, 
I never was meant for this day Give me something I can take, 
Can take to make the memories fade, 
Poison kiss, remember this, 
I never was meant for this day I?m the devout, 
Praying just to 
Get the blood out, 
Bound by this flesh I own 
I?m the devout, 
Cutting just to 
Get the blood out. 
Desecrate til we die alone Just give me something 
I?m the devout, 
Praying just to 
Get the blood out, 
Bound by this flesh I own 
I?m the devout, 
Cutting just to 
Get the blood out. 
Desecrate til we die alone 
We die alone 
We die alone
