Well I heard there was a secret chord 
That David played, and it pleased the lord 
But you don't really care for music, do ya? 
Well it goes like this 
The fourth, the fifth 
The minor fall and the major lift 
The baffled king composing hallelujah [Chorus] 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Well baby I've been here before 
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor 
I used to live alone before I knew ya 
I've seen your flag on the marble arch 
Love is not a victory march 
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah [Chorus] Well your faith was strong but you needed proof 
You saw her bathing on the roof 
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you 
She tied you to her kitchen chair 
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair 
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah [Chorus] Well there was a time when you let me know 
What's really going on below 
But now you never show that to me do you? 
And remember when I moved in you? 
And the holy dove was moving too 
And every breath we drew was hallelujah [Chorus] Well maybe there's a God above 
But all I've ever learned from love 
Was how to shoot somebody who'd out drew ya 
And it's not a cry that you hear at night 
It's not someone who's seen the light 
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah
