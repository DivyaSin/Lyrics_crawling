A single shot then silence springs 
An alarm that blew my whole world apart 
Infection spread like a hornet sting 
The mark of Cain on a bullet Shot through a poisoned heart 
I could feel the taste of bile come up 
Then drop like fire washed with gasoline 
Too much just ain't enough when bloodied hands come clean Then we step off the land 
Into the fire 
Out of the pan 
Into the fire 
Just grab my hand 
And hold on tight 
I'll pull you to 
The guiding light The candle flickered, the wind it howled 
The waters crashed, the ship set sail at last 
I sometimes sense my brothers scowl 
Was molded into a smile 
By the coroner's wax 
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust 
Rosetta Stone, no laughter 
In the face of mirth 
No phoenix rising from the rust 
From the earth to the earth
