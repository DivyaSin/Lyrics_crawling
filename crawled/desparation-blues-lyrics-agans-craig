The ceilings are low and the floors are high 
I can't think it backwards i can't even try 
Much ado about nothing i fear this will be 
I once planted a rock, it washed into the sea.. 
A name on a page, a smile in my mind 
sometimes my dreams can be real unkind 
Which came first? the chicken or the egg 
What should i do now, should i borrow or beg? 
It's needless to say i'll take what i get 
but there's not much to see and there's nothing to bet 
Forever is long, need i say more? 
but bein' here, darlin' is never a chore.. 
It's not that you give, less than you receive 
of whatever it takes, to make me believe 
You say monkey see, i say monkey do 
whatever it takes to get next to you..
