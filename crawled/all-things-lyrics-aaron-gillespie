The... 
You keep the things I've broken 
The silence of a beautiful soul 
Leaves our fears unspoken 
You are no stranger here 
So you are holding All things all things are in your hands 
All things all things are in your hands ? in and off a smile 
The beauty of the baggers 
The roads you paved with blood and tears 
Cause you are calling us to be 
You are no stranger here 
Thought the show was All things all things are in your hands (repeats) 
Beautiful, wonderful 
All things are in your hands No lives no deeds keep you away 
To keep you away 
To keep you away No doubt no shame 
Keep us away All things all things are in your hands 
All things all things are in your hands
