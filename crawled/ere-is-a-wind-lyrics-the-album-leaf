Running so far ahead 
Just to get back to the end 
There is something in our way 
There is something I can't say There's a wind behind everyone 
It takes us through our lives 
I wish I could have stayed 
But this wind takes me away, away, away One day we began 
To fly again 
And now we start 
To fly and then Running so far ahead 
Just to get back to the end 
There is something in our way 
There is something we can't say There's a wind behind everyone 
It takes us through our lives 
I wish we could have stayed 
But this wind takes us away, away, away Oh, where do we go in these days? 
Oh, where will we land? 
Oh, where do we go in these days? 
Oh, where will we land? Running so far ahead 
Just to get back to the end
