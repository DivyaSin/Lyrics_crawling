Oh baby can't you see 
I'm trying 
Your love is a mountain 
Baby baby I'm trying to climb But at the peak 
My heart beats so weak! 
(weak weak, oh oh, so weak) 
At the top 
It basically just stops 
(stop stop, oh it just stops) Never gonna give up 
Each river I cross 
I get really cross 
That I am waiting so long for you Oh sugar can't you hear 
The sound of the soldier drawing near 
This love is a battle 
This love is a crime 
And the words yeah the words are stopping to rhyme But at the peak 
My heart beats so weak! 
(weak weak, oh oh, so weak) 
At the top 
It basically just stops 
(stop stop, oh it just stops) Never gonna give up 
Each river I cross 
I get really cross 
That I am waiting so long for you
