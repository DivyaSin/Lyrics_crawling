On the rebound, on the rebound 
That's how you fell for me 
That's how you changed my life 
You cut me like a knife On the rebound, on the rebound 
You came, you saw, you took 
It only took one look 
And, lady, I was hooked On the rebound, on the rebound 
On the rebound On the rebound, on the rebound 
You came and took my soul 
You came and left a hole 
Where your love used to be On the rebound, on the rebound 
You like to drown in your tears 
And after all these years 
You give your pain to me (On the rebound) you came to me 
(On the rebound) to set you free 
(On the rebound) too bad for me 
Oh, yeah When you came 
You wanted my money 
And when you left me 
You took my life, honey (On the rebound) you came to me (oh) 
(On the rebound) to set you free (oh) 
(On the rebound) too bad for me (oh) Can't stand this pain 
Won't you come back again (On the rebound) you came to me 
(On the rebound) to set you free 
(On the rebound) too bad for me 
Oh, yeah Through my tears 
Your face still appears (On the rebound) you came to me 
(On the rebound) to set you free...
