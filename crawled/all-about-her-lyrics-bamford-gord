I used to wonder what they meant 
By walking the floor 
Now there's grooves under my boots 
And I don't wonder anymore 
All those simple country songs 
Have so much meaning since I lost her 
They go right through my heart 
Not in one ear and out the other Like when my Daddy spun that vinyl 
Of Hank Snow and Charlie Pride 
It always caught Momma's attention 
And she'd just break right down and cry 
But I'd just listen to the pickin' 
'Cause that's the only part I liked 
I didn't understand the words 
Now they're all about her We went out walkin' after midnight 
Now I do it alone 
It seems like one day she was with me 
And the next day she was gone 
There's a high lonesome sound 
And the melody is whistling 
I remember from my childhood 
When I didn't know what I was missing Like when my Daddy spun that vinyl 
Of Kitty Wells and Loretta Lynn 
It always caught Momma's attention 
And she'd just break right down again 
But I'd just listen to the pickin' 
The only part that pulled me in 
I didn't understand the words 
Now they're all about her Here's to pick-up trucks and good dogs 
And heartaches 
I'm gonna listen to what gets me through 
If that's what it takes So now when I spin my records 
Of George Strait and Tim McGraw 
I close my eyes and let that lyric 
Catch me when I fall 
I still listen to the pickin' 
Yes I do but that's not all 
Now that I understand the words 
And they're all about her They're all about her
