Watch your mouth, or I'll make you wash it out. 
I will teach you to be good, Mary. Cause after all you locked yourself, in a dream and all 
The very, very special things you've seen won't mean a thing. And all your friends wanna sail around the bend 
But I won't let them take your wind, Mary. And even still you got this far, but you're not there and all 
the little things that got you here won't get you anywhere
