Can you hear me 
I'm calling your name oh Lord 
I can't go on this way 
Will I make it another day Oh Lord, was I made just to beg and crawl 
Who will catch me whenever I fall 
Do I even matter at all 
I am waiting here for you to answer my call Can you see me 
I'm down on my knees oh Lord 
I'm lost and I'm so alone 
Does your world have a heart of stone Oh Lord am I destined to be what I've been 
Never a thick and barely a thin 
Where do I fit in 
I am waiting here for you to answer my call You say it won't be long 
So I got to keep holding on 
This world just so cold, so cold, so cold, so cold Oh Lord am I destined to be what I've been 
Never a thick and barely a thin 
Where do I fit in 
I am waiting here for you to answer my call 
I am waiting here for you to answer my call Oh, oh Lord when you gonna answer my call
