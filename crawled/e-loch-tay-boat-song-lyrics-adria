When I've done my work of day 
And I row my boat away 
Doon the waters o' Loch Tay 
As the evening light is fading 
And I look up on Ben Law'rs 
Where the afterglory glows 
And I think on two bright eyes 
And the melting mouth below 
She's my beauteous nighean rue 
She's my joy, my sorrow too 
And although she is untrue 
Well I cannot live without her 
For my heart's a boat in tow 
And I'd give the world to know 
Why she means to let me go 
As I sing horee, horo 
Nighean Ruadh, your lovely hair 
Has more glamour I declare 
Than all the tresses rare 
'Tween Killin and Aberfeldy 
Be they lint white, brown or gold 
Be they blacker than the sloe 
They are worth no more to me 
Than the melting flake o' snow 
Her eyes are like the gleam 
O' the sunlight on the stream 
And the song the fairies sing 
Seems like songs she sings at milking 
But my heart is full of woe 
For last night she bade me go 
And the tears begin to flow 
As I sing horee, horo.
