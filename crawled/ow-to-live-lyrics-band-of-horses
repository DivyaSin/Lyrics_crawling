When I'm giving advice to others 
I take more than I can give 
It's a birds eye view 
What I want you to do or how to live And I really don't have to suffer 
I still do it anyway 
I'm a diamond in the rough 
Or I'm a dirt clod in the clay Guess what I lost my job 
It's just my luck Reveal you've always been the actor 
With those puppy dog eyes 
Well one of y'all is telling the truth 
The other one is lies 
It's someone else's fault so often 
You getting rude, getting tall 
It's a great big world 
Darling your translations is just a little off So what, you made a mistake 
You try to hide the time 
The time is life 
Gets a little bit larger everyday 
It grows 
Gets out of control I've been giving my advice to others 
I try to tell them how to live 
A little lying, a bit of truth 
What I'd like for you to do and how to give And I really didn't need to suffer 
Still did it anyway 
What a great big world 
I better find some way to stay Guess what you're getting old 
Still gotta grow up
