Seeing people all around me with their high class careers 
Does it make em' feel happy, won't it cause any tears 
Want to sit here in my room and do nothing at all 
No I don't want to answer to society's call I want to be a kid forever, no responsibilities 
I want to be a kid forever, aged 10 when I freeze Seeing couples on the streets walking kindly hang in hand 
Happily married, this I can't understand 
Rather be all alone on an island far away 
Never think about tomorrow, I'm just gonna seize the day Don't wanna undestand the world, there's way too much hate 
Don't wanna go to school to learn, they'll decide your fate 
Don't wanna change the earth, 
just le me be I wanna be a kid forever, honest and free
