I know that you feel it 
Deep inside 
But you just won't admit it 
you've got too much pride Don't deny what's in your heart 
You're safe with me 
All your love is locked away 
Won't you set it free I endure the sleepless nights 
Filled with doubt 
And I try to comprehend 
Why you shut me out If you're scared darling 
Just let me know 
You just gotta understand 
How I love you so Mad about you 
I feel a tide of love crash over me 
And I know the feeling 
Is mutual but you just won't let it be Mad about you 
Lost beyond the point of not return 
Dancing in the flame until we burn 
Mad about you Mad about you 
Mad about you 
Mad about you 
I don't want to play the fool anymore And I'm tired of watching you 
walk out that door 
Every time I reach for you 
You turn away This whole game has gone too far 
To last another day 
Mad about you 
I feel a tide of love crash over me And I know the feeling 
Is mutual but you just won't let it be 
Mad about you 
Lost beyond the point of no return Dancing in the flame until we burn 
Mad about you 
I feel a tide of love crash over me 
And I know the feeling Is mutual but you just won't let it be 
Mad about you 
Past the point of no returning 
Mad about you Torn apart at the flame keeps burning 
Mad about you 
Mad about you 
(Don't know I'm) Mad about you 
I'm Mad about you baby 
Mad about you 
Mad about you
