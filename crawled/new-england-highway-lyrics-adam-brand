I've travelled across the country 
On every beaten track 
From the sugar cane to the Nullabor Plain 
And I've been to Burke and back 
But there's nothing I like better 
Just before Australia Day 
Than heading down the New England Highway Got my boots on, got my hat on 
Got my old guitar and a new song 
For a week I'll be where I belong 
With the big stars, Golden Guitars 
Dream will be ours some day 
Cruising the New England Highway They'll be busking down on Peel Street 
Looking for a lucky break 
There's the chook man and the one man band 
And Slim Dusty's in the Cavalcade 
There's nothing I like better 
Just before Australia Day 
Than heading down the New England Highway
