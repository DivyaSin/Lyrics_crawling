Check out my hair, isn't it cute 
I use a really expensive shampoo-oo-oo 
We're throwing rocks, and acting tough 
Even though we're all wearing tons of ma-akeup 
Our manager says we have to act straight, 
Even though we're all gay! We're at the beach acting like we're hunting for chicks 
But secretly what we're looking for is some dick 
Shut the hell up guys and get back in the closet, 
They can't kno-o-ow that you are not hetaro 
Snorting bath salts and jumping in place, 
Look at that hot guy I think we should eat his face 
Get away from me you psychos I have some mace 
Damn it blo-o-ows bet that you taste beautiful 
NO NO NO! Get lost you drugged up homos We're playing sports, so we seem straight 
Our manager says that that's a good wa-a-ay 
You need the gals, for record sales 
So you better keep kicking that ball all damn day! Oh whats the point everyone can see it? 
Its obvious we like penis! We are five gay British boys skipping in the waves 
All we want to do is watch Magic Mike all day 
Lets all get into the water and masturbate 
I'm gonna think bout you 
I'm gonna think about you too 
God dammit guys please stop being gay 
Ninety-nine percent of your fans are straight ladies 
If they find out you're queers our sales will go away 
Ok fi-i-ine we'll save it for another night 
There's a girl, go and act like straight guys 
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah-nah nah 
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES! Hey girl we're supposed to act like you get us off 
But looking at you makes our penises go soft 
OH MY GOSH I THINK I SEE DAVID HASSLEHOFF! 
Hey there boys it's the Hoff, I've been on this beach since baywatch 
And I've been watching you all this time 
I've gotta say that you're all looking mighty fine 
Why don't we head back to my place and have some wine? 
Yeah, lets go, that sounds so so magical 
No no no! Do not go over to his home! 
Woah woah woah these boys are mine they're beautiful!
