Ooo, I'll follow you where you will take me. 
Through frosted trees. 
Blue snow on our boots, metallic moon 
sweeping the streets. 
And I won't sleep. Ooo, seeking the true feelings of Christmas 
as children we knew. 
Songs of cheery carols 
And I am filled with new sense of peace. Flush of your cheeks oh, kiss me please. 
The rustle of foxes. 
This wishing well, snow covered hill. 
My love doesn't come in, in boxes. 
Ooo. Flush of your cheeks oh, kiss me please. 
The rustle of foxes. 
This wishing well, snow covered hill. 
My love doesn't come in, in boxes. 
My love doesn't come in boxes.
