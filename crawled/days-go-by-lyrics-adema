Sometimes I just get so frustrated 
I don't even bother sleeping anymore 
And all this seems overrated in all of us 
Is all the things we said and done 
If we can see them lying on the floor And I ask them why can't they remember 
All of this this will be forgotten 
Surrender there's nothing we can do to stop them 
That's just the way it goes, that's just the way it goes 
Days go by, I just can't keep track of the time Dreams are made for fools and sages 
Nobody ever leaves with what they came here for 
Still they gotta keep turning pages 
In all of us is all the things we wished we done 
If we could see them wash upon the shore And I ask them why can't they remember 
All of this will be forgotten 
Surrender there's nothing we can do to stop them 
That's just the way it goes, that's just the way it goes 
Days go by, I just can't keep track of the time I go back to the way it was 
This feeling it can't be wrong 
It's coming on way too strong 
I go back to the way it was 
This feeling it can't be wrong 
It's coming on way too strong Remember all this will be forgotten 
Surrender there's nothing we can do to stop them 
That's just the way it goes, that's just the way it goes Days go by 
(All of this will be forgotten) 
Days go by 
(There's nothing we can do to stop them) 
Days go by 
(All of this will be forgotten, will be forgotten, will be forgotten)
