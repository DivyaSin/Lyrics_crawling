I don't know ,what I feel now 
I don't know, what I'm doing here tonight 
And this colour ! It's red everywhere 
I guess it's over, I can smell blood everywhere I can feel, it's so cold inside 
I can feel ,it's so hot outside 
I can see my body lying on the floor 
I can see your hands slamming the door 
Who do you think you are 
What have you done 
And do you know, you kill me I can feel you're so warm inside 
I can feel , you're so cold outside 
I could feel your heart beating for me 
I could feel your soul follow me 
Who do you think you are 
What have you done 
And do you know, you kill me 
You murder me Who do you think you are 
What have you done 
And do you know? you kill me 
A thousand times
