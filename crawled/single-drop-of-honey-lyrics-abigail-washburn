If a single drop of honey 
Would bring you to me 
I'd break that sweet rock open 
And hold it out for thee She asked him for a penny 
He gave her a dime 
She asked him to stay forever 
He said "all will come in time" If a single drop of honey 
Would bring you to me 
I'd break that sweet rock open 
And hold it out for thee She prayed for him to come back 
He sent a voice true 
She barely heard the words 
He said "I'm not so far from you" 
If a single drop of honey 
Would bring you to me 
I break that sweet rock open 
And hold it out for thee
