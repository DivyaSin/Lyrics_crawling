After nine years in the army 
They took away his brain 
They tattooed 'Defect' on his brow 
And signed him up again He killed ten thousand Germans 
A hundred Japanese 
A family of Hindus 
And a lot of Portuguese, nine plan failed I could never see the point 
Of showing them you're boss 
When they drag you through the city streets 
And nail you to a cross They took him to the office 
They strapped him to the bed 
They fastened lots of pretty wires 
Securely to his head They wheeled him down the corridor 
Upon a metal trolley 
Now he wears big spectacles 
And he sings like Buddy Holly, nine plan failed I could never see the point 
Of showing them you're boss 
When they drag you through the city streets 
And nail you to a cross The world declared its armistice 
And took away his guns 
And now he satisfies himself 
On piss-weak tea and buns 
On piss-weak tea and buns 
Oh oh, at the disco Rome is very pretty and Rome is very grand 
But the Pope lost his four fingers 
When they gave this boy his hand to kiss 
When they gave this boy his hand to kiss 
It wasn't funny, no He wasn't very good at school 
His highest grade was C 
But he believed the managers 
When they said,"You leave it all to me" They gave him suits from Savile Row 
The quality so fine 
So now he sits in the desert wastes 
Just waiting for a sign, nine plan failed
