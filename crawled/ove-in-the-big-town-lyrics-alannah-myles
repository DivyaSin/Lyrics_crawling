This is the place where nobody comes from 
Perfect strangers in this desert town 
Just out of flame, looking for favors 
Hungry players when the deals go down You get a hollow heart from shallow breathing 
And a see-through smile like the ones on T.V. 
This is the land of thrills and money where you 
Hit the edge and you drift out to sea It seems so real 
(So real) 
Looks so good 
(So good) But you'd give it all up 
And you'd start again 
If you thought you could And it sounds so sweet 
(So sweet) 
Feels so right 
(So right) 
But it leaves you cold 
In the middle of the night Step right up, money down 
If you're looking to buy love in the big town 
Lift you up, tear you down 
Leave you begging for more love in the big town Down in the street with the waiters and mystics 
When you got faith in nothing, you just fantasize 
Look for a flame but you'd fall for a flicker 
In those angel faces and those cowboy eyes Seem so real 
(So real) 
And they look so good 
(So good) 
And with a bit of persuasion 
You really believe you know you could Tastes so sweet 
(So sweet) 
Feels so right 
(So right) 
But it leaves you cold 
In the heart of the night Step right up, money down 
If you're looking to find love in the big town 
Lift you up, tear you down 
They'll leave you begging for more love in the big town Oh, you learn to use all your desperation 
Till it works its way into your soul 
Then you find out that you slowly lose control Step right up, money down 
If you're looking to find love in the big town 
Lift you up, tear you down 
They'll leave you begging for more love in the big town Step right up, money down 
If you're looking to find love in the big town 
Lift you up, tear you down 
They'll leave you begging for more love in the big town You want love in the big town 
We need love 
(Were gonna turn you on) 
(Were gonna tear you down) 
In the big town 
(Yeah, hey) Aha, you want love, ooh yeah, in the big town 
We need love, hey, hey, yeah, in the big town 
Yeah, yeah, you want love in the big town
