Met 'em on the highway 
Way out on the road 
Where they were a-headin' 
Don't think anybody knows 
Didn't care where, 
Only needed to go They're just rollin' along Pulled into a truckstop 
A hundred miles to go 
Feelin' kind of beat up 
After eatin' up the road 
Thought we had it tough 
'Til we heard their tale of woe They'd been rollin' along 
Livin' on the highway 
Rollin' along 
Travellin' way too far 
Rollin' along 
With the mess they're under 
Lightnin' and the thunder- 
Just rollin' along 
Rollin' along Said they'd play for pickin's 
Any place on up the road 
Thought it would come easy 
They'd be rakin' in the dough 
Barely brings a livin' 
Said "I guess it comes slow" 
And they're rollin' along Told me they'd seen trouble 
A short time ago 
At a rock n' roll house 
Where they'd tried to steal the show 
Cowboys let 'em have it 
And they showed 'em where to go 
Now they're- Rollin along 
Livin' on the highway 
Rollin' along 
Travellin' way too far 
Rollin' along 
With the mess they're under 
Lightnin' and the thunder 
Just rollin' along Haven't got an eagle 
Or a place to lay their heads 
Have to run the highway 
Still they're gonna make it 
Still they've got the will 
You know they're gonna make it 
They keep climbin' up the hill Rollin' for the highway 
Stood and watched 'em go 
Wonderin' if they'd manage 
As they blew off down the road 
Thinkin' how we'd made this trip 
So many years ago 
Just rollin' along Livin' on the highway 
Rollin' along 
Travellin' way too far 
Rollin' along 
With this mess they're under 
Lightnin' and the thunder- Just rollin' along 
Rollin' along 
Just rollin' along 
Whoa, rollin' along 
Keep those wheels a-turnin' 
Whoa, rollin' along 
Just rollin' along 
Just rollin' along
