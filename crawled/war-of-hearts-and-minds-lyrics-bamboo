War of hearts and minds 
Who will pay the price? 
Does anybody care? 
It's not make believe 
You've seen it on your TV screen 
I'm glad that you're not here Chorus: 
Take my wife please 
If you think it's funny 
Cut my heart out for a souvenir 
Take my life please 
If you think it's worth it 
I'm glad that you're not here 
I'm glad that you're not here War of hearts and minds 
Seven days later, 
I still can't find 
Truth and peace 
How will i find my way 
They say love, love without fear 
Is said to be the key 
But just look around 
No clear answer to be found 
(Get me out here) (Repeat Chorus) (Repeat Chorus) Coda: 
I'm glad that you're not here
