If you're ugly, I'm ugly too 
In your eyes the sky's a different blue 
If you could see yourself like others do 
You'd wish you were as beautiful as you And I wish I was a camera sometimes 
So, I could take your picture with my mind 
Put it in a frame for you to see 
How beautiful you really are to me Ugly, ugly 
All of us just feel like that somedays 
Ain't no rainbow in the sky 
When you feel u.g.l.y. 
And that's ugly, yeah, yeah, yeah Ugly, ugly 
All of us just feel like that somedays 
Ain't no rainbow in the sky 
When you feel u.g.l.y. 
And that's ugly, ugly 
All of us just feel like that somedays 
Ain't no cure that you can buy 
When you feel u.g.l.y. 
And that's ugly
