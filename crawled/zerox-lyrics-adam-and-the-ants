Lock up your brain 
Because I'm here again 
I'm never bored to steal your chords 
Ooh-ooh Zerox Machine 
Ooh-ooh Zerox Machine Give me a line 
Or a middle eight 
I've got the best so I want the rest 
Ooh-ooh Zerox machine 
Ooh-ooh Zerox machine Lets get together before its too late 
Collect up the ideas, duplicate 
Filling up the forms, send them off tonight 
And you'll be the owner of the copyright 
Of the copyright, of the copyright Time of the essence get your ears to the 
Ground 
However else can the hits be found? I may look happy, healthy and clean 
A dark brown c voice and suit pristine 
But behind the smile there is a Zerox 
Machine I'm a Zerox machine
