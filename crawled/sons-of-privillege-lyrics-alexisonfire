America blaring in my ears all day 
America, I don't see the glory of your ways 
The oldest money flows through a bloodline 
We'll see if your empire stands the test of time 
Don't wanna 
I don't wanna 
Be a slave to the sons of privilege 
Don't wanna 
I don't wanna 
Be a slave to the sons of privilege Sweet lady liberty 
You are lost, though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep 
Sweet lady liberty 
You are lost, though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep America, grin and bare the resentment of the world 
With all your ugliness and self-worth 
Desperate to grease the gears of the hideous machine 
The swine, they writhe and praise the infallible regime 
Don't wanna 
I don't wanna 
Be a slave to the sons of privilege 
Don't wanna 
I don't wanna 
Be a slave to the sons of privilege Sweet lady liberty 
You are lost, though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep 
Sweet lady liberty 
You are lost, though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the Lost though you are free 
In America 
Lost though you are free 
In America 
Lost though you are free 
In America 
Lost though you are free 
In America 
It's time to justify your pride 
In America 
It's time to justify your pride 
In America 
It's time to justify your pride 
In America 
It's time, it's time, it's time Sweet lady liberty 
You are lost, though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep 
Sweet lady liberty 
You are lost, though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep
