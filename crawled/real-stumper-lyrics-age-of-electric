On the simplest question, I'll go blank 
The complexities attack, my appetite 
How can I get out of this, doesn't feel right 
I'm so thick she eats with a fork 
I'll be gone, I'm almost gone 
I'm gone 
I was phase, on a hot plate 
I got you ice cream, you froze your face 
And you dropped it 
I got another, and it melted 
I couldn't be higher, you say 
I couldn't be higher 
I couldn't be higher, you say 
I couldn't be higher 
I can stay calm when you bite off my head 
You don't know where I bury myself 
You never know when I could be behind you 
A simple answer, it's a real stumper 
You'll never see when I get behind you 
The difficult decision is a real stumper 
What did you say 
I couldn't be higher, I couldn't be higher 
I couldn't be higher, I couldn't be higher
