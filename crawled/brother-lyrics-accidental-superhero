st thomas and an old man walkin' 
and he tells him 
go your own way, be your own stay 
don't matter what they all say 
in the middle of a fire 
you feel the need to run 
the only way to make it 
is to stand like a stone 
all alone st thomas and a middle man walkin' 
and he tells him 
take it day by day 
never see the grey 
no one know how the cards'll lay 
it's a crisis of my time and my 
spirit, i have no energy 
creativity only flows, i suppose 
when the desert runs dry brother 
don't you see my hands are holed 
can you reach out for my side 
touch me 
stop doubting just believe 
thomas looks alot like me st thomas and a young man walkin' 
and he tells him 
live the good life 
find a good wife, 
don't think about the dream 
the clock hangs like a thief 
on the wall, like punishment 
for what i want, for what i need, 
and how far away it is from me brother 
don't you see my hands are holed 
can you reach out for my side 
touch me 
stop doubting just believe... st thomas and a dead man walkin' 
and he thinks 
i'll go my own way 
never have to pay... brother 
don't you see my hands are holed 
can you reach out for my side 
touch me 
stop doubting just believe
