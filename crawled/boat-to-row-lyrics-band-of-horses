Dilly I, I never wanted you, 
Sleepin' out on the ground tonight. 
Dilly now, now that I'm comin' home, 
Dilly, you got someone to answer to. Callin' out; 
Ain't no way you're on your own. 
Fallin' out; 
Your companion now. Dilly, I made up my mind long ago. I shoulda known. I shoulda known. Oh, I shoulda known. Dilly I, I never wanted to, 
Have to, oh, lie to you. 
Dilly I, I ain't ashamed a you, 
Coz Dilly, I'm professin' too. Callin' out; 
Ain't no way you're own your own. 
I'm fuckin' out on my own. But Dilly, I made up my mind long ago. I shoulda known. I shoulda known. I, I shoulda known. But bidin' time's a boat to row, ah. 
You and I: I shoulda known. I shoulda known. I, I shoulda known. But Dilly you, you've been called lazy boy, 
Starin' out on the bedroom wall. 
Now anytime you feel like comin' out, 
Ya ain't too proud, ya ain't too proud to say hello, oh
