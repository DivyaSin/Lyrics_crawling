(Verse) 
All of the stars are singing notes I've never heard, 
Let em ring. 
Because in time, well play the chords that I prefer. 
And let em dance, like young birds. 
Give me more time, I will replace these things. 
With diamonds and pearls, that shine and sing. 
Like wedding rings. 
And will I have, the time to say goodbye. (Chorus) 
Cause I am the darkness in the sky, 
Sweeping winds that haunt the night. 
The burning fire from deep inside, 
Will come undone. 
And give me another time to fight, 
Another chance to say good bye. 
I wasnt prepared to let the light, come undone. (Verse) 
Another painful day, my hands are red and torn. 
From crawling across the floor, my knees are cracked and worn. 
I sat outside, till the morning broke the sky. 
Singin painful melodies, in the storm. (Chorus) 
Cause I am the darkness in the sky, 
Sweeping winds that haunt the night. 
The burning fire from deep inside, 
Will come undone. 
And give me another time to fight, 
Another chance to say good bye. 
I wasnt prepared to let the light, come undone. (Chorus) 
Cause I am the darkness in the sky, 
Sweeping winds that haunt the night. 
The burning fire from deep inside, 
Will come undone, come undone. 
And give me another time to fight, 
Another chance to say good bye. 
I wasnt prepared to let the light, come undone, come undone. 
Come undoooone, oh no. 
Come undoooone, oh no. (Verse) 
All of the stars are singing notes Ive never heard. 
The swallow and finch will leave the nest, and emerge 
So let em dance, like young birds.
