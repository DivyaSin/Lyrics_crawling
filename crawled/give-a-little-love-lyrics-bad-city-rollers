It's a teenage dream to be seventeen 
And to find you're all wrapped up in love 
And I found that you made a dream come true 
Now I do believe in what I say You've got to give a little love take a little love 
Be prepared to forsake a little love 
And when the sun comes shining through 
We'll know what to do 
Give a little love take a little love 
Be prepared to forsake a little love 
And when the sun comes shining through 
We'll know 
what to do. When I walk with you there is just we two 
And the world goes by but I just don't care 
And I know one day that I'll find the way 
To be safe and sound within your heart 
So until I do I'm gonna give a little love take a little love
