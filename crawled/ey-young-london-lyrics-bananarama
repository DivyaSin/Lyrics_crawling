[Chorus] 
Hey young London you're looking good 
Dressing up like you know you should 
Hey young London you're the brightest star 
So you ride about got to get that far Well I've read your face 
And seen your place 
And you'll let me in 
If I share your tastes 
You know the night spots 
If you want to stay hip 
Have you flown to Paris 
Hope you have a good trip [Bridge] 
We don't care 
You know that we don't care 
We don't care 
Do you know that we wear flares Hey young London you're looking good 
The lights are less well that's understood 
Hey young London take your time and go 
The girls are young but they act so old You're heading for 
The same pub each night 
Girls in the corner 
Boys looking for a fight 
Even he might rock 
Each others self control 
When you get engaged 
You know you've reached your goal [Bridge] Hey young London you're looking good 
You got the money you can choose your moods 
Hey young London you're a bright young thing 
Your private houses are a public thing She's so afraid 
She sees a dead still light 
And her dress is see-through 
And his pants on tight 
With his girl at his side 
He doesn't need his breaks 
And a smile on his face 
For all the risks he takes [Chorus] Hey young London you're looking good 
The lights are less well that's understood 
Hey young London take your time and go 
The girls are young
