Loneliness, it made you sad 
Watch you cry 
I see you cry 
She cried 
Emptiness brings you back 
To your home, all alone, to you home 
I'd do anything just for you 
Just for you 
Standing here 
Open arms 
Hold you close 
So tight 
Won't let go 
I'd do anything, anything for you 
I'd do anything, anything for you 
I'd do anything just for you
