The only difference between tattooed and non-tattooed people 
is that tattooed people don't mind if you're not tattooed! Since my first time under the gun 
It seems I'm never, ever able to stop 
Next time I think I'll go see Patti Laguna 
One of the coolest lady's around Still, in some places its against the law 
What's wrong with such a beautiful art? 
Damn, I can't wait till the next convention 
Show and be shown crucial tatt collections 
Oh Yeah! [Chorus:] 
When I get that itching? 
Ya, Body starts a twitching? 
Well, I jump on my bike 
And I race to the Pike 
'Cos It's tattoo time! 
It's tattoo time! My homie's got his gun 
He's gonna fill me full of ink 
He's got the custom design 
For life, it's gonna be mine! 
It's tattoo time! 
It's tattoo time! Yeah, when I get that urging? 
Yeah, body starts a surging? 
Well, I jump on my Harley 
And I visit Ed Hardy 
'Cause It's tattoo time! 
It's tattoo time! Rob Roberts got his gun 
He's gonna fill me full of ink 
He's got the tribal design 
For life, its gonna be mine! 
'Cos it's tattoo time! 
It's tattoo time! My old lady's name is tacked on my arm 
But we've long ago since broken up 
Gonna take my problem to good ol' Kari 
I know she'll do an Award-Winning cover-up Checking all the flesh hanging in the parlors 
Marks that make us stand out in crowds 
I really take pride in my skin illustrations 
Unite and be proud, for we're the tattooed generation 
Oh yeah! [Chorus] Well come on everybody, let's get a tattoo! 
(Mahoney's Tattoo solo played on Rikk's arm) [Chorus] 
(It's tattoo time, It's tattoo time)
