Little Lost Angel in the snow 
Shivering cold from head to toe 
Little Lost Angel didn't know 
Which was the way to Jubilo 
Which was the way to Jubilo Little Lost Angel, come, said I 
Here is my house all warm and dry 
Little Lost Angel, don't you cry 
I'm very pleased that you stopped by 
I'm very pleased that you stopped by Little Lost Angel smiled at me 
Nibbled his cake and sipped his tea 
"Sir, you have made me fine and warm 
May the Lord keep you from all harm 
May the Lord keep you from all harm." Little Lost Angel rose to go 
Fluttered his wings and curtsied low 
Here are his footsteps in the snow 
Where I showed him the way to Jubilo 
Showed him the way to Jubilo
