Daisy, you 
Shouldnt do the things you do 
But youre just so incapable of changing. 
You lie so well. 
I could never even tell 
What were facts, in your art for rearranging. 
But I came back for more 
And you laughed in my face and you rubbed it in. 
Cause Im a Labrador 
And I run when the gun drops the dove again When we first met, I was glad to be your pet 
Like a Lab I once had that we called Maisey 
But fetching sticks 
Was the best I had for tricks 
You got bored, you got mad then you got crazy. 
But I came back for more 
And you laughed in my face and you rubbed it in 
Cause Im a Labrador, 
And I run when the gun drops the dove again Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer. 
Daisy, Daisy, do. 
Remember good old Maiseyhow she waited at the stairs for you. Daisy, Dear, I could almost shed a tear 
But lets shine, in the time we have remaining 
Youre a tough old gal, but a dog is just a pal 
And believe me, my dear, Im not complaining
