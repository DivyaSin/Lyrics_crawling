Much has been said 
Said you'd never leave 
Why it have to be 
Harder than it had to be 
Now don't you throw blame 
You were part of this 
Wasn't supposed to end 
With us just walking away 
So many times we tried 
Holding on to the pain 
But in my baby's eyes i see my shame 
Asking why you had to leave 
Wasn't i strong enough 
To make you see 
That the biggest part of this 
It's not about you or me 
But just been wrong 
If we held on So maybe tomorrow we'll find 
A taste for the old days 
Hard lessons we've left behind 
This mirror's an open door 
I can barely stand to see myself 
I don't know what to do anymore 
I'm cryin out for help Ooh lord 
Ooh lord Much has been said 
Well i never learned 
Keeping my fingers crossed 
Praying for my luck to turn 
But i can't complain 
I'm living it easy 
Job's keeping me busy i'm going crazy 
Can't describe the way it felt 
When you left said you goodbyes 
It just seems crazy for me to think 
That I'll find love the second time 
But we all know how it all,wraps up in the end So maybe tomorrow we'll find 
A taste for the old days 
Hard lessons we've left behind 
This mirror's an open door 
I can barely stand to see myself 
I don't know what to do anymore 
I'm crying out for help Ooh lord 
Ooh lord 
Ooh lord 
Ummm... What am i leaving behind 
Sweet how we see the big picture 
When your life's not on the line 
I know the way out but do you see what i see 
A tortured life always second guessing the bookie 
Put money on the table thought that was all i had to do 
Never came home never said a word to you 
No one ever said it was going to be easy easy yeah 
Start over again this time this time let's do it right 
Start over again but this time this time let's keep the fires burning burning yeah 
Start over again start over again but this time this time let's do it right sweet child 
Start over again start over again but this time this time let's keep the fires burning burning yeah 
You say i only hear what i want to no, no, no, no 
You say i talk so all the time 
I talk so all the time
