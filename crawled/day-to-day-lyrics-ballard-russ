Since you been gone, I get the strangest dreams 
What's going on, in every one it seems You come to me, in slow motion, then you pledge your devotion 
Then I awake, I realize, you won't be coming back [Chorus] 
I'm living day to day, now that you've gone away 
I just do what I have to do to get through the day 
I'm living day to day, and that's the way it will stay 
Til you come back, I'll keep living day to day And when it's light, I walk down the stairs 
I read the news, the weather's fine, who cares I stand up, walk to the doorway, I look down on the floor lay 
Just one letter maybe two, but there ain't one from you [Chorus: x2] Til you come back, I'll keep living day to day
