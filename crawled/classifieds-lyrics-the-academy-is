My life reads like the classifieds 
Pages of what's for sale, whats on the auction block? 
Attention bidders, its Lot forty-five 
He's got a decent voice, he's got that crooked smile 
Hold on, you haven't heard the best yet 
He writes good storylines, he's got those honest eyes 
So, take him home for just nine-ninety-five 
he'll sing the songs you like, he'll keep you warm at night (at night) 
Back down, cash out, that's the city for ya 
Break down and back out, and get what's coming to you 
When you said you were falling apart 
I thought you meant that you were falling apart 
Ohh oh... I'm not the type to forget about nights like this 
when every single move that I make is documented and scored for style points 
The once ambitious one, now holds a smoking gun 
And if I die in my sleep, are you still willing to be everything you promised you would be? 
Back down, cash out, that's the city for ya 
Break down and back out, and get what's coming to you 
When you said you were falling apart I thought you meant that you were falling apart 
Ohh oh 
Will you be the first one to tell the neigborhood papers 
and all my family and friends that still care 
Did you buy what I sold and did you feel what I told you 
I hope that you still do, will you? 
Promise yourself, that this isn't all we've got 
Back down, cash out, that's the city for ya 
Break down and back out, get what's coming to you 
When you said you were falling apart 
I thought you meant that you were falling apart 
Back down, cash out, that's the city for ya 
Break down and back out, get what's coming to you 
When you said you were falling apart 
I thought you meant that you were falling apart 
Ohh oh
