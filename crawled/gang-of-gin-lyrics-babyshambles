I get around to singing about 
That gang of gin I'm in 
Then you'll know most certainly 
The kind of game I'm in 
You sound around to swinging about 
The gang of gin I'm rolling in, oh 
Then you'll know 
The kind of state I'm in Who will buy my beautiful roses? 
Who will buy my beautiful songs? 
Who will buy my beautiful roses? 
Who will buy my beautiful songs? Oh in a nutshell 
Yeah in a nutshell, oh 
In a nutshell 
In a nutshell I get around to singing about 
That gang of gin I'm in 
Then you'll know 
The kind of game I'm in 
She was getting pally with a scally in the alley 
Giving head for gear 
She calls a spade a spade 
Got slit from ear to ear Who will buy my beautiful roses? 
Who will buy my beautiful songs? 
Who will buy my beautiful roses? 
Who will buy my beautiful songs? Well I showed no decorum 
Spilled my heart out on the forum 
Looked like a snapshot 
Of the most tragic day I'll tell you my story 
The treachery it bores me 
Carl and McGee both promised me 
It would not happen this way 
Carl is kept sedated 
The frontman elevated 
And McGee doing all he can to ruin my band 
And keep me out the way In this industry of fools 
Musclemen and ghouls 
If you're not a puppet or a muppet 
Then you might as well call it a day-ayay The truth here gets distorted 
The wall scrapings get snorted 
I'm welcome back if I give up crack 
But you gave me my first pipe anyway Can't show no decorum
