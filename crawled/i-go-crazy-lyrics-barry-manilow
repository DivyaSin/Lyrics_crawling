Hello girl it's been a while 
Guess you'll be glad to know 
That I've learn how to laugh and smile 
Getting over you was slow 
They say old lovers can be good friends 
But I never thought I really see you 
I really see you again 
I go crazy 
When I look in your eyes 
I still go crazy 
No my heart just can't hide 
That old feeling in side 
Way deep down inside 
Oh baby 
You know when I look in your eyes 
I go crazy You say he satisfied your mind 
Tells you all of his dreams 
I know how much that means to you 
I realize that I was blind 
Just when I thought I was over you 
I see your face and it just ain't true 
You know it just ain't true 
I go crazy When I look in your eyes 
I still go crazy 
That old flame comes alive 
It starts burning inside 
Way deep down inside 
Oh baby 
You know when I look in your eyes 
I still go crazy Oh it just ain't true 
No it's just ain't true 
I go crazy 
When I look in your eyes 
I still go crazy
