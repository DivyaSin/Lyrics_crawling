I can't believe existence is confined to this life 
And I can't tell the difference between the truth and lies Surreality, surreal, reality 
Is this really me, or just an idea in my mind? Sometimes it seems that being is all within my mind 
In truth I'm seeking comfort, too difficult to find 
Infernal lobe resistance, fact and fiction are the same 
Please let all the answers be unleashed from my brain I can't believe existence is confined to this life 
And I can't tell the difference between the truth and lies I can't believe existence, is confined to this life 
And I can't tell the difference, between the truth and lies Surreality, surreality 
Surreality, surreal, reality 
Is this really me, or just an idea in my mind? Surreality, surreality 
Surreality, surreal, reality 
Is this really me, or just an idea in my mind?
