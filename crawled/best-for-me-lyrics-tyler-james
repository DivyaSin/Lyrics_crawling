Rewind 
Let's journey back to the times 
When that lady she was mine 
How we just sit and stare and sigh And she, she whispered soft to me 
Baby, you're my valentine 
Cupid can run but he can't hide 
At night, I ask myself why I treat her so badly So badly she flyin', went south for the winter 
The note shattered in her 
She's sitting pretty with some other guy Now I find you saw the best in me 
When I was blind 
Now I see, you are the best for me 
The best for me Friday and I think I'm fine 
Singing for my valentine 
Honey child of mine You say I'm waiting for fall 
While I'm just unconditional 
Saying you can have it all So how am I here again? 
Always out with other men 
Now you're just my friend Let me look out for ya then 
'Cause I'm not waiting 
For you to say you will Now I find you saw the best in me 
When I was blind 
Now I see, you are the best for me 
The best for me You saw the best for me 
And I never realized 
But I was blind, I was blind 
I was blind, I was blind You saw the best for me 
But I never realized 
'Cause I was blind Now I find you saw the best in me 
When I was blind 
Now I see, you are the best for me 
The best for me Now I find you saw the best in me 
When I was blind 
Now I see, you are the best for me 
The best for me Now I find you saw the best in me 
When I was blind 
Now I see, you are the best for me 
The best for me
