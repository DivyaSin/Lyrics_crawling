Let's just wait here, 
I got so confused, 
But I left you in the morning when the news was ran the new. I won't go back again, 
My hours are through, 
And though she's on amends, 
There's nothing we can't do. Watch what you say, if I'm guilty 
I will pay 
Watch how it goes, if I'm guilty 
It'll show 
So watch, what you say if I'm guilty 
I'll walk away. I will wait here, 
for an hour or two 
Cause you left me in the bedroom, when there's 
other things to do. Watch what you say, if I'm guilty 
I will pay 
Watch how it goes, if I'm guilty 
It'll show 
So watch, what you say if I'm guilty 
I'll walk away. Controlling is, 
So hard to fight, 
I can't believe, 
I've lost my mind, 
I need you now, 
I need you then, 
On and on, 
Where are my friends?
