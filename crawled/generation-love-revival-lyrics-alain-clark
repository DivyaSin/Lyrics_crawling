Look into the mirror everything about me is blurry 
Thinking to myself 'is this a good reason to worry?' 
And if you got the answer, tell me was my question right 
Should I worry about the facts or let my heart decide? 
If I'm Generation love revival 
I'm a part of it, part of it 
Generation love revival 
Yeah we're starting it, starting it 
Generation love revival 
Yeah it's happening, happening 
Generation love revival Everybody's secrets, all out in the open now 
No inhibitions, no false optimism allowed 
Can't get away with murder, murder, oh, oh 
Walking 'round the planet carrying one burden, oh, oh Generation love revival 
I'm a part of it, part of it 
Generation love revival 
Yeah we're starting it, starting it

Oh it's happening, happening 
Generation love revival Pete Philly: Riddle me this brother and sis 
Listen would you miss 
Any of this system if it was dissed and gone 
Traveling to places thought long gone 
A whole new paradigm, ain't nothing wrong 
With a little more freedom song 
A little less blues, a little more food for thought 
and the spirit when you hear it 
Yes you'll get caught the minute when you hear it 
and the fear just leaves 
Like the Fall makes room for the Winter 
and since we're here to achieve 
going out and removing the splinter 
from the third eye of the beholder 
got you a shoulder to cry on 
new generation relies on his and my songs 
here's to the future 
bygones are bygones Generation love revival 
Generation love revival 
Generation love revival 
Generation love revival 
(2x) Pete Philly: 
we need to take a chance 
to let go of the negative stance 
burry the lance and dance in the rain 
perception of what a woman or a man is 
needs to advance cause the chance is the same 
Things keep happening over and over 
don't you know we got a freaking four leaved clover 
in the pocket the day we was born 
Guess we forgot but you know that 
I've sworn to take it out, live it out like Clark 
Focus on the light not the dark side of things 
About to embark on a rated R type movie 
most of the things we need is indeed inside 
put it on black let it ride 
if you just show who you really are, no need to spar 
and there's no need to hide Generation love revival 
Generation love revival 
Generation love revival 
Generation love revival
