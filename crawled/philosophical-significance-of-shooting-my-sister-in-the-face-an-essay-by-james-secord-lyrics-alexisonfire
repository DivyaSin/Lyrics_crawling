My name is James Secord 
Everything was gone 
With this bullet 
In my sister's face 
Maybe then they 
Won't hear the screams 
Pull the trigger The mirror hurts us, the music notes 
And wonder how they won't be Times are hard enough 
Without days like these 
If you cry hard enough 
Maybe they'll hear your screams 
Life is rested, splattered neck 
Put a bullet in your own sister's Face 
Nothing now 
I won't be, won't be 
'Cause I am back again 
Black cats, red dogs 
Breakfast, rapist 
Rough bread, not dead 
Goodbye, rapist God damn me With a simple bullet 
The shit is simple 
You left a dead bullet 
Everything is, everything is dull, gone, gone 
Is dull
