Lose yourself why don't you, why you always holding on 
Lose your heart why don't you, why you always cold now 
Find your way why don't you, don't be we can call about 
I guess those who can't do, those who can't watch 
Which side are you on? 
Ooh Well you can if you want, you can run if you want 
I won't stop you 
But I can't sit and watch as you drown in the dark 
Ooh You can't find the light 
They'll say we've survived 
With stars in our eyes 
We broke the sky 
We fought for our lives 
Set flame to the night 
With stars in our eyes 
We broke the sky 
We broke the sky 
We broke the sky 
We broke the sky Find yourself why don't you, why you always so damn lost 
Let me in why don't you, why you on a guard 
I promise I won't hurt you, let me see just who you are 
But I'm too far to save you, I will never be across 
Ooh Well you can if you want, you can run if you want 
I won't stop you 
But I can't sit and watch as you drown in the dark 
Ooh You can't find the light 
They'll say we've survived 
With stars in our eyes 
We broke the sky 
We fought for our lives 
Set flame to the night 
We broke the sky 
We broke the sky 
We broke the sky 
We broke the sky We broke the sky 
We broke the sky 
We broke the sky 
We broke the sky We broke oh we broke the sky 
We broke oh we broke the sky
