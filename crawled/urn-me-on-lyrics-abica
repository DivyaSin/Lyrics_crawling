Walls around me they surround me 
Leave me right here right where you found me 
A spark in the dark is what I need to be free 
Start with my heart and then you'll get to see me 
And I need you here just to push me back 
And I want to feel like I'm on the right track 
Cuz I brought you here just to open a sore 
But I can't pretend that I care anymore 
Look and see right where you stand 
Will it give you a clue a way to understand 
Can it open up your eyes and erase all doubt 
Or will you scream and shout to your voice runs out 
Your so hypnotic 
I think I caught it 
And now I got it 
Let me, come let it set me 
And take my world of fire 
Now I'm, another species 
I'll write it if you read me 
Leave me, these release me 
Temporarily they complete me Chorus 
Turn me on 
You know I'll give it to you 
y-y-you know I'm on now 
Turn me on 
I know you you'll give it to me 
i-i-i'll turn you on now 
Take a chance 
Living on let it go, open eyes surprise yo let's role 
Take a try 
Living on let it fly, fine lines and time to take mine 
Turn me on 
I need to know the facts cuz I think I might be trapped 
I'm stuck in the cracks and I never can relax 
You thought it would be easy that it wouldn't be this hard 
I thought it could be real but it didn't get us far 
You can try to blame me if it makes you feel better 
But you'll always hate but I doubt you'll remember 
Put the pill in my mouth so easy just swallow 
You lead me down this path and I follow 
I know the dangers 
No I'm not stranger 
That's why I came here 
Now I, go flip your switches 
Turn them on to fix all your glitches 
Liftin, this life I'm living 
To a place where all is forgiven 
Sittin upon this less known addiction 
Missin nothing, got no prescription Turn me on 
You know I'll give it to you 
y-y-you know I'm on now 
Turn me on 
I know you you'll give it to me 
i-i-i'll turn you on now 
Take a chance 
Living on let it go, open eyes surprise yo let's role 
Take a try 
Living on let it fly, fine lines and time to take mine Turn me on 
I see they're watchin me 
I hear them asking me 
I think they're wondering what's turning me what's twisting me 
It's not what you would think 
It's not what you would need 
It's something more I'm looking for my kind of ecstasy 
I see them listening 
I know they're questioning what's turning me what's twistin me 
It's not what you could see 
It's not what you would be 
It's something more I'm looking for my own tranquility 
Turn me on 
You know I'm on now, you know I'm on, you know I'm on now 
I see them watching me 
I hear them asking me, my kind of ecstasy 
Turn me on 
They're questioning what's turning me what's twisting me 
What you could see 
What you would be 
It's something more I'm looking for my own tranquility 
What's turning me what's twisting me 
It's not what you could see 
Turn me on 
It's something more I'm looking for my kind of ecstasy 
My tranquility 
Them listening, they're questioning what's turning me what's twisting me 
I'll turn you on now 
What you could see 
Turn me on 
I'll turn you on now 
It's something more I'm looking for my own tranquility 
It's something more I'm looking for my own tranquility 
Turn me on
