Wake me from this bad dream 
It's all I think I know 
I gave myself knowingly 
So here I am alone Isn't it sad? Don't you feel bad that you ruined me now? 
Don't you feel bad? 
Don't you feel bad that you took it all now? 
Don't you feel bad? Beaming youth I once wore 
A pile on a the floor 
Innocence I long for 
I lost that long before Isn't it sad? Don't you feel bad that you ruined me now? 
Don't you feel bad? 
Don't you feel bad that you took it all now? 
Don't you feel bad? 
Trying to get back to the girl I was 
Now don't you feel bad? 
Don't you feel bad that you screwed me up now? 
Don't you feel bad? Lost my dignity to selfish lust 
Everything to a man who couldn't love 
And now I can't even stand myself 
Isn't it sad? 
Isn't it sad? 
Isn't it sad? Don't you feel bad that you ruined me now? 
Don't you feel bad? 
Don't you feel bad that you took it all now? 
Don't you feel bad? 
Trying to get back to the girl I was 
Now don't you feel bad? 
Don't you feel bad that you screwed me up now? 
Don't you feel bad? Don't you feel bad that you ruined me now?
