Me and Dixie, we'd waste away 
Sleep through the night and all the next day 
Sleep through the sun, rain and moon 
Here, in this room Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child Me and Dixie, we rolled and dreamed 
Time held us alone in this world it seemed 
Then morning broke and awoke you from me Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child So come back, Dixie, I'll rock you to sleep 
Back to our dreams our twisted sheets 
Cradle your fading stars in my arms Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child 
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
