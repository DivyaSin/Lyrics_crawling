I love you, maybe I don't 
Maybe I'll need you, and maybe, baby, I won't 
I guess I don't take the time to let you know what's on my mind 
Maybe I've been blind Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm sane 
Maybe I need to go away, start over again 
But if I went away, I'd be afraid I should have stayed 
Maybe I'm afraid that maybe I love you And believe me when I tell you 
It's because of all the things you say and do 
That help me make it through 
I need you 
But when I try to say goodbye, I realise I won't know what to do 
If I don't have you Maybe I love you, baby I do 
I guess I loved you the first time I saw you 
And when I don't take the time to let you know what's on my mind 
I know that I'm too damn blind, but baby I love you
