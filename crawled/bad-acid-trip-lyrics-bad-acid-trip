WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING 
TO THE WORLD ON WHICH WE LIVE 
WE'RE SPEEDING TOWARDS OBLIVION 
HAVE WE NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE? 
I WATCH MY FELLOW MAN 
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EYES 
IGNORANCE IS NOW THE STANDARD 
WE FEAR THE TRUTH AND LIVE A LIE 
THE PARADISE IS LOST 
WE'VE TURNED IT ALL TO SHIT 
LOONIES RUN THE ASYLUM 
EVERYBODY'S ON A BAD ACID TRIP
