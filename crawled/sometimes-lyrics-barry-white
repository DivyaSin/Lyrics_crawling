Life is a game, it's a 
And the only way you can participate in it 
Is you have to get involved 
With all your heart and soul Your mind, oh, your mind 
Is such a great thing, use it, use it 
The positive has to overtake the negative And no matter what people may say to you 
Believe me, you have to get involved 
In the game of life 
Things don't always go the way you want 'em to 
But hang in there Don't be afraid, no matter what they say 
You gotta take a chance at life 
And you don't know how far you can go 
And you won't know until you try Set your sights for better things in life 
And work for them hard as you can 
Patience is key, it always sets you free 
It's all about your master plan 
People, sometimes [Chorus] 
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose 
Sometimes some things are so hard to do 
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose 
Sometimes some things are so hard to do Make your move, be careful what you chose 
You gonna reap what you sow 
Make no mistake, you've got what it takes 
And all it's gonna take is you Patience is key, it always sets you free 
And you can make it if you try 
Don't waste time makin' up your mind 
It's your choice, it's your life 
Listen to me, people [Chorus] They say that the mind 
Is a terrible, terrible thing to waste 
And so it's time, and it's time 
That you made up your mind 
About what you wanna do in life Different strokes for different folks 
We're all in this together 
And what you have to realize is that 
You can't always win and you can't always lose 
Just sometimes, sometimes you do Listen to me, people [Chorus] Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose 
And sometimes some things are so hard to do 
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
