When I'm gone 
Like the northern light 
I'll shine down on you I'll keep my magic sparkle 
Brighter and higher 
For you I can see sadness in your eyes 
Remember our love will never die 
To watch your future from afar 
Will surely leave me scarred But I have to face my demons 
I have to realize 
That I can't be with you anymore 
But it's alright Yeah it's alright 
Yeah it's alright 
You just gotta be strong 'Cause when I'm gone 
Like the northern light 
I'll shine down on you I'll keep my magic sparkle 
Brighter and higher 
For you When I'm gone 
Like the northern light 
I'll shine down on you I'll keep my magic sparkle 
Brighter and higher 
For you I know it might seem unfair 
That tomorrow's not ours to share 
But let me guide you when you're lost 
"I'm so much more than shadow and dust But I have to face my demons 
I have to realize 
That I cannot be with you anymore 
But it's alright Yeah it's alright 
Yeah it's alright 
You just gotta be strong Whoah ohh ohh ohhhh 
Whoah ohh ohh ohhhh When I'm gone 
Like the northern light 
I'll shine down on you I will keep my magic sparkle 
Brighter and higher 
For you
