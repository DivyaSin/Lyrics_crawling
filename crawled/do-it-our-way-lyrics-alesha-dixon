Come on! 
Hey! 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Hey heeey 
I used to be so boring 
Staying in bed all morning (yes I did) 
No longer I'm the one who's letting me down 
Now I'm proud and stepping outta my house 
So now I do a little shopping 
Buy a little dress I've been wanting 
Gonna buy it, gonna wear it right now 
Whatever makes me happy I didn't like my photo, I'm loving it now 
I'm looking in my mirror, I'm checking me out 
Finally ready to get up, I'm taking control 
Hey! My ladies let's play Out all night, yeah, let's shout it 
Wear that smile, I like what I see 
Always, always 
We're gonna do it, d-d-do it our way 
Feels so hot, lipstick's brighter 
Whole wide world is rocking with me 
Always, always 
We're gonna do it, d-d-do it our way My life revolved around TV 
Easier to be someone than be me 
Now I know what I want out of life 
In bright colours so my body can't hide 
And now I wear a little make up 
Taking centerstage, yeah I'm made up 
And now I'm doing what I wanted at last 
Whatever makes me happy I didn't like my photo, I'm loving it now 
I'm looking in my mirror, I'm checking me out 
Finally ready to get up, I'm taking control 
Hey! My ladies let's play Out all night, yeah, let's shout it 
Wear that smile, I like what I see 
Always, always 
We're gonna do it, d-d-do it our way 
Feels so hot, lipstick's brighter 
Whole wide world is rocking with me 
Always, always 
We're gonna do it, d-d-do it our way Throw out the rules, live for today 
Life is a game, you just gotta play 
Always, always, always 
Let your hair down, do it our way 
Life is a game, now j-just gotta play 
Always, always, always Out all night, yeah, let's shout it 
Wear that smile, I like what I see 
Always, always 
We're gonna do it, d-d-do it our way 
Feels so hot, lipstick's brighter 
Whole wide world is rocking with me 
Always, always 
We're gonna do it, d-d-do it our way Out all night, yeah, let's shout it 
Wear that smile, I like what I see 
Always, always 
We're gonna do it, d-d-do it our way 
Feels so hot, lipstick's brighter 
Whole wide world is rocking with me 
Always, always 
We're gonna do it, d-d-do it our way
