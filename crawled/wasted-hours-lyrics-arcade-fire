All those wasted hours we used to know 
Spent the summers staring out the window 
The wind it takes you where it wants to go At first they built the road then they built the town 
That's why we're still driving around and around 
And all we see are kids in the buses longing to be free Wasted hours before we knew 
Where to go and what to do 
Wasted hours that you make new 
And turn into a life that we could live Some cities make you lose your head 
In this suburb stretched out thin and dead 
What was that line you said? 
Wishing you were anywhere but here 
You watched the life you're living disappear 
and now I see, we're still kids in the buses longing to be free
