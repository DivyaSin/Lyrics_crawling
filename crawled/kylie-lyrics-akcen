Kylie give me 
Kylie give me Baby, you're the one that melt my heart 
I swear I'm not lying 
Maybe tonight I'm gonna try my luck 
I can see that you want me 
I'm dreaming about you every night 
Every night refrain: 
Kylie give me just a chance 
Let's go out and dance 
We can get into the groove 
I can watch you move 
Later you can sing to me 
Like a shining star 
But I rather do you on the backseat of my car 
(2x) Baby, take a minute check me out 
I sit in the frontrow 
Baby I'm the coolest guy in the crowd 
I'm sure you have seen me 
I'm dreaming about you every night 
every night refrain You drive me crazy 
You slowly drive me crazy 
Think about you baby 
Can't get you out of my mind 
I should be lucky 
I should be so lucky 
I should be lucky to sleep with you tonight Kylie 
Kylie 
refrain Kylie give me
