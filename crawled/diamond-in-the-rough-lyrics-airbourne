I had a dollar in my pocket 
And dirt on my hands 
She was a rich man's daughter 
Who didn't give a damn She had all the boys talkin' 
With her fancy cat walkin' 
But it was me who took her home 
And gave her bed a good rockin', oh yeah 'Cause at the end of the day 
Honey, when it's all said and done 
I can't get enough of that diamond in the rough 
I can't get enough of your diamond in the rough Early next morning 
I woke naked and beat 
And as the sun was rising 
She was lookin' like a treat I stuck my finger in the honey 
Threw my dollar in the well 
And when I made my wish 
You know it was clear as a bell That at the end of the day 
Honey, when it's all said and done 
I can't get enough of that diamond in the rough 
I can't get enough of your diamond in the rough I can't get enough of that diamond in the rough 
I can't get enough of that diamond in the rough 
I can't get enough of that diamond in the rough 
I can't get enough of your diamond in the rough
