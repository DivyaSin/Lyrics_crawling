I cannot help you 
I cannot help myself 
I will not help you 
I will not help myself 
Below all the great big plans 
Below all awakened drive 
Below every failed ignition 
Below countless acts of try 
Below every education 
Below all the empty hope 
Beyond any word of existence 
Under 
Under 
We are what we create and destroy. 
Extinction ...
