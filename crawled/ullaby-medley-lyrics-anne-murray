Hush, little baby, don't say a word 
Papa's gonna buy you a mocking bird 
And if that mocking bird don't sing 
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring 
And If that diamond ring is brass, 
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass 
And if that looking glass gets broke 
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat 
And if that billy goat won't pull, 
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull 
And if that cart and bull turn over, 
Papa's gonna buy you a dog named rover 
And if that dog named rover don't bark, 
Papa's gonna buy a horse and cart 
And that horse and cart fall down, 
You'll still be the sweetest baby in town 
Sleep child and when you do 
Dream a dream to drift you through 
The night that lingers through the day 
Tonight, dreams of you 
I'll sing this lullaby for you 
Sleep child, for dreams always come true. 
Lullaby and goodnight, 
May sleep softly surround you 
while your dreams fill your eyes 
With a melody of love 
May the moonlight embrace you 
The starlight caress you 
May the sunlight still sing you 
This lullaby of love Dadadaa...dadadaaa,,,
