I saw the mark as she passed though the door 
I saw the truth, you're a whore 
Distill the scene and don't lie to me no more So what's killing you, is it the demon inside?

She wrote, 'I'm not insane, I'm sorry, I have to go' 
And these walls are painted red 
She put a bullet in her head ?Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye? 
That's all she said So what's killing you, is it the demon inside? 
My God, you're turning blue, a suffocating lie 
You're all I've got, you're all I've got 
You're all I've got, you're all I've got 
You're all I've got, you're all I've got, got
