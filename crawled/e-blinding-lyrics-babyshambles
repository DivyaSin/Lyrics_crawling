Come and see the blinding 
It's so blinding 
It's the last thing that you'll ever see 
But you might be happy oh, happier 
Than you've ever been So let me show the blindin' 
Last thing that you'll ever see 
But you might be free oh, freer 
Freer than you've ever been What will you do? 
If she runs out of time for you 
When will you go? 
Things to be getting on with 
On with, on with, on with the show! (oh) Last thing you'll ever see Come and see the blinding
