Won't take me home, I'm sweetness to the bone 
I'm silken and discreet, amiable and cheap 
Meat for you to pound, to beat and smack around 
Holes for you to fill with anything you will 
But I won't apologize for the things that I do 
I am victimized but so are you 
There is nothing I've not seen, I'm bruised but I'm clean 
If you're turned off by my tracks just get up on my back 
I'm prouder than you'd guess, I'm honest more or less 
For you I will not pretend, I'll never be your friend 
I won't apologize for the things that I do 
I am victimized but so are you 
Love knows these lips, never kissed before 
And at my fingertips are the secrets of a whore 
Bring me to your lust 
You're cursed and you are weak 
In myself I trust 
In my bed you leak
