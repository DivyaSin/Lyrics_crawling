Everybody shares the same obsession 
a wealthy life in luxury People craving for the latest fashion 
they'd even die for Jewelry Everyday I got the same impression 
there's a lack of honesty Honestly, people follow any wrong direction 
and this is the cause of SLAVERY SLAVERY 
We abolish SLAVERY SLAVERY 
We want no more SLAVERY, no no no no SLAVERY 
We must stop with the SLAVERY right now help me singin' 
NO MORE SLAVERY Everybody gonna learn one lesson 
that our life is not for free Every moment of lust 'n' temptation 
a human dies in poverty If you wanna change the situation 
open up your heart 'n' soul Open up your eyes 
there's so much to do for compensation 
all in the name of SLAVERY SLAVERY 
We abolish SLAVERY SLAVERY 
We want no more SLAVERY, no no no no SLAVERY

We must shake off SLAVERY SLAVERY 
(they won't stop!) but who am I to blame? SLAVERY

but isn't it a shame? SLAVERY 
that no one else complaints SLAVERY, WE DONT WANT SLAVERY It is said to be true that our consumption is the key
