Windy, windy 
Looking for a better home 
Got me, got me 
Runnin' out of light bulbs 
Cloudy, cloudy 
Open to a waste can 
Yellow car, yellow car 
Better be inside there 
Wake up, wake up 
Nothin's gonna harm you 
Glass wall, glass wall 
Standin' on the furniture 
Little boy, little boy 
Layin' on a sleeping bag 
Watching, watching 
Through the cracks of his eyelids 
Stranger, stranger 
Feeling on a broken stone 
Lost him, lost him 
Standin' on the orange chairs 
Alphabet, alphabet 
Can't afford a telephone 
Black hole, black hole 
Nothin's gonna harm you
