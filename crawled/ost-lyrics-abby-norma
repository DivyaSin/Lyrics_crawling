Did you get lost? Didn't you know notice 
The same way you got here my dear is the only way out 
Do you need a friend? Would you like a warm fire? 
Settle right down here my dear 'cause there's no need to cry... oh no 
Don't be so startled my dear cause' your not going to die... 
Not yet 
The dreams aren't so bad here my dear if you just close your eyes 
"Close my eyes?"... "WHY?" Did you stray from the path my friend, did you follow the road 
The road to ruin again, has fate forebode 
Fantasy aint your luxury, This aint your game 
Ecstasy and your company pride lost in the rain Try or Die - you should know - it's the only way outta here 
Fight or Cry - it's quite a show - why don't you face your fear 
Try or Die - this is the way to go - it's the only way outta here 
Fight or Cry - it's nice n' warm below - why don't you face your fear It seems you lost your way again, maybe it's time to give up 
After all what's this journey worth when the going gets rough 
Have a seat we'll negotiate a way out for you 
Just sign right here and I'll give you my word I see that your through
