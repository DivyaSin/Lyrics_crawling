The sky has fallen in on me 
Imagine what goes on 
But something tells me I've done wrong 
Shouldn't stay around so long 
I have tried so many times 
But would I cry for you 
Would I lie for you 
And would I die for you 
And in this dark I feel my heart 
It's beating out for more 
I think it's you I need tonight 
You're deepinside my soul 
I have tried so many times 
But would I cry for you 
Would I lie for you 
And would I die for you 
Pull on me pull on me baby 
I can't get away you pull on me 
I have known this for so very long 
That I could cry for you 
I would lie for you 
And I would die for you
