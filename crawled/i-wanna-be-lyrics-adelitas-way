I wanna be the one that's catching all the luck 
Sitting on a mountain of a million bucks 
It's time I get a taste of the Hollywood life 
Sleeping all day, getting drunk all night 
Can I be the one getting all the free shit? 
Hanging out with Hef; got my house on Cribs 
If I could have a chance to be living this way 
I would show you all that I'm not the same Famous for nothing, you're not above me 
You're gonna come and go, come and go 
Then you're gone 
Famous for nothing, loser got lucky 
You're gonna come and go, come and go 
Then you're gone I wanna be the one with hundreds in my hand 
Slipping right by the bitch door man 
It's time to start seeing things going my way 
Sipping on some Jack and a bottle of Grey 
Can I be the one with the thirty-two cars? 
Sitting backstage with all the rock stars 
Don't wanna be the one that told you so 
Middle finger up screaming "Fuck the world" Famous for nothing, you're not above me 
You're gonna come and go, come and go 
Then you're gone 
Famous for nothing, loser got lucky 
You're gonna come and go, come and go 
Then you're gone Famous for shit 
Why don't you quit? 
You've got it all 
So why can't I? Famous for shit 
Why don't you quit? 
You've got it all 
So why can't I? Famous for nothing, you're not above me 
You're gonna come and go, come and go 
Then you're gone 
Famous for nothing, loser got lucky 
You're gonna come and go, come and go 
Then you're gone
