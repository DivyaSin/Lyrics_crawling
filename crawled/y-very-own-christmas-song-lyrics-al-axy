I cannot wait 
I'm counting down the days 
Until my dreamy Christmas wish comes true 
Through the snow I'll roam 
Soon I'm coming home 
To spend the perfect Christmas time with you I remember when I was young 
I'd impatiently wait at my granny's place 
She'd let me help set up the Christmas crib 
And then look into my eager face 
When done she finally takes me home 
To the most beautiful tree 
Glowing candles, sensational scent 
Did all of this happen magically? Chorus: 
Oh, I cannot wait 
I'm counting down the days 
Until my dreamy Christmas wish comes true 
Let the sleigh bells ring 
Wrapped presents I will bring 
This winterland of sparkling white looks good 
Through the snow I'll roam 
Soon I'm coming home 
To spend the perfect Christmas time with you Now her cheerful soul still warms the room 
The vivid memories keep living on 
Cross my heart, who would've thought 
I'd once share them in my very own Christmas song? 
As we grow older some things change 
What matters is the jolly time 
I pick Christmas balls and turkey size 
Traditions old and new combined Repeat Chorus Do you hear what I hear? 
A heartbeat of childlike excitement 
Do you see what I see? 
A city dressed in sparkling splendor I wish you a merry Christmas 
From the bottom of my heart 
Don't stop bringing joy to my world 
And may we never spend this time apart Repeat Chorus Spend the perfect Christmas time with you
