Last night I 
I saw you standing 
I started 
Started pretending 
I knew you 
You knew me too 
And just like a baby I could not talk 
I tried to come close but could not walk 
Now I think of it every night 
How I just could not get it right 
Ooh, next 
Next time you come my way 
I'll know just what to say [Chorus] 
Can we talk for a minute 
Girl I want to know your name 
Can we talk for a minute 
Girl I want to know your name I started 
To write you a letter 
But I wanted 
To be more clever 
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you 
Hey, baby 
But just like a Roni you were too shy 
But you weren't the only one, so was I 
Girl if 
We should come close again 
I know what I'll say then [Chorus] Oh, girl 
One more chance 
With you again 
I will not let it go 
Ooh, babe 
Give me just one more chance 
For love, love, love, love [Chorus] Can we talk for a minute 
Come on and talk to me baby 
Say I want to know 
Well, come and tell me your name baby 
I said talk to me for a minute 
Come on and talk for a minute 
I want to know, I want to know 
I want to know your name
