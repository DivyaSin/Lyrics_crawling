Could it be that you were hoping 
Something new would change your life? 
A different view of things 
That mattered long ago 
And if you had your way 
Would everything be like it was before? 
Could it be that you would never ask for more? I know that I'd never last a day without you 
I wouldn't last a day without you would it be too much to ask 
If we could save a little time? 
It's such a precious thing 
That seems so hard to find 
And if we get the chance 
Let's hope that you and I won't change our minds 
We'll twist and tangle as our destinies unwind I know that I wouldn't last a day without you 
I couldn't find my way without you 
I don't know what to say without you 
I wouldn't last a day without you I look into into sun - am I the only one 
That doesn't see the future anymore? you wouldn't last a day 
I will not go away 
And in the end there will be no long goodbye
