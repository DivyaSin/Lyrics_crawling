Get me out of this misery 
I fall down to You on my knees 
Get me out of this misery I pray You, God Ow, Lord! Why do You stretch me? 
No no no no 
Whoa, Lord! It hurts so bad 
What now? I'm glad?! Indecision confounds me 
I need Your eyes, look through them to see 
Get me out of this misery I pray You, God Wow Lord, I see it so clearly now 
Wow Lord, You really come through to me, and how!
