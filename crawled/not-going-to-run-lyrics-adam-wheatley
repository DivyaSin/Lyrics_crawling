Don't make a sound 
Don't breathe a word 
Anything you might say 
Is already heard Your trembling hands 
I want to hold 
Oh, my love for you 
Has not grown cold You can't take back 
The things that you've not done I'm not going to run 
I'm not going to run 
I'm not going to run away from you Climb on my back 
There's miles still to go 
We'll set our feet 
Where they tread long ago And we'll look back 
On all that we've become I'm not going to run 
I'm not going to run 
I'm not going to run away from you Right by my side 
Is only for you 
Look in my eyes 
They speak only truth I'm not going to run 
I'm not going to run 
I'm not going to run away from you 
I'm not going to run away from you
