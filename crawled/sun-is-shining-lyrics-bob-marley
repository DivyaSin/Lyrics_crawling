Sun is shining, the weather is sweet 
Make you want to move your dancing feet 
To the rescue, here I am 
Want you to know ya, can you understang When the morning gather the rainbow 
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too 
To the rescue here I am 
Want you to know ya, 
Can you, can you, can you understand Sun is shining, the weather is sweet now 
Make you want to move your dancing feet 
To the rescue, here I am 
Want you to know just if you can 
Here I stand, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
Can you understand me, now baby Do you believe me?
