[Chorus] 
One plus one, is one. 
I know it's crazy, but it's true. 
One plus one, is one. 
And that one is me and you. It's mathematics. 
You know the score. 
When you talk about you and me, 
It all adds up to something more. 
No complications. 
No compromise. 
No need to stop to figure it out. When you're this united, 
You can't be divided. [Chorus] No calculations. 
No little lies. 
But we just can't hold off the power of love, 
The joy just multiplies. This love is total. 
This love is right. 
I think we found the answer this time. There is no subtraction, 
From a real attraction. [Chorus] Oh yeah, 
Oh baby come on [Chorus] Plus one is one, 
I know it's crazy, but it's true. 
One plus one, is one. 
And that one is me and you. 
One plus one, plus one is one
