I was nothing 
Until I found your love 
Till I found your love 
Until I found your love Lately you've been on my mind 
I didn't know that I would ever see you again 
Baby don't leave me alone 
You know that I need you so desperately 
Love love you and me 
Is all of all that I need 
So don't don't think I don't care 
Oh baby my life was nothing till I found you I was nothing 
(Until I found you) 
(Until I found you) 
My life's never been the same Can I talk to you baby? I'm so happy you didn't leave me 
I don't know what to do 
And by the way oh baby girl 
You are my world 
And nothing can come between us 
You you turn me on 
It feels like nothing can go wrong 
So don't don't be confused 
My life was nothing till I found you Until I found you 
Until I found you 
My life's never been the same I was nothing 
Until I found you 
Until I found you 
My life's never been the same Oh every time I see you 
I stop and thank God for your love 
Please girl don't ever leave me 
I don't know what I'll do without you I was nothing 
Until I found you 
Until I found you 
My life's never been the same 
(2x) Can I tell you what you did for me? 
You took a frown and made me happy 
You took the tears and dried them away 
My life, my life's never been the same 
Until I found your love (Chorus)
