She rolled up with her top down 
Makeup like a hot clown, yessiree 
Think I know why she hates me 
Her crush is crushin' on me She'll wind up in some bathroom confessional 
Spilling her heart to some frat boy 
Who just wants to get sexual And all the boys 
Talk talk to me 
Talk 
Talk talk to me 
Talk 
Talk talk to me 
Talk talk 
How you like me now? 
How you like me now? 
(2x) She took shots playing flip cup 
She needs help just to stand vertically 
I can walk in a straight line 
And she looks like a fool next to me She'll wind up in some bathroom confessional 
But when guys kiss me 
It's completely intentional And all the boys 
Talk talk to me 
Talk 
Talk talk to me 
Talk 
Talk talk to me 
Talk talk 
How you like me now? 
How you like me now? 
(2x) White girl (WASTED!) 
Frat boy (WASTED!) 
Love is in the air but she's too drunk to taste it 
Add another name to the frenemies list 
Drink Four Loko till you're clinically sick 
White girl (WASTED!) 
Frat boy (WASTED!) 
Love is in the air, and baby I can taste it 
Me and her boy sitting under the stars 
While she's passed out sharpied in the back of a car And all the boys 
Talk talk to me 
Talk 
Talk talk to me 
Talk

Talk talk 
How you like me now?
