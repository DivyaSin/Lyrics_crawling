He wants to take her out to a movie 
But he's not sure if he wants to go 
And he don't wanna take it too quickly 
And he don't wanna take it too slow 
Yeah, she's the kind of girl he's always dreamed of 
Oh, but this time it looks like it's real 
And he knows she makes him feel happy 
But he don't know what he wants to feel (chorus) 
It's a little disaster -- little disaster 
He wants everything to work out perfect 
But she only wants to be with him He buys her flowers that he never sends her 
'cause he's afraid she might misunderstand 
And then he knows he might not deliver 
The love that he knows she'll demand Yeah, and he's ready for the altar 
But suddenly he's running away 
And he knows he'll love her forever 
But he don't know if he wants to stay Chorus He loves her (he loves her) -- he can't understand 
Why it should be such a struggle 
He's happy (he's happy) -- but it's not enough 
Somehow he still ends up lonely... lonely Well there's a train that leaves saturday morning 
So she can summer with friends out of state 
And it feels like it came without warning 
And all of his words are too late Yeah, and he stammers and stares at the station 
And her bags are as heavy as lead 
And he wanted to tell her he loved her 
But the train pulls away instead Chorus 
It's a little disaster -- little disaster -- little disaster 
He wants everything to work out perfect 
But she only wants to be with him 
Little disaster -- little disaster -- little disaster...
