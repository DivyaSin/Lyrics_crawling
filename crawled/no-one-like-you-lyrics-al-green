[Chorus] 
There's no one in life quite like you, you baby 
There's no one in life quite like you, you baby As I sit and wonder baby 
How you do the things you do, yeah 
I know deep down in my heart 
I'll never see all the way through, no 
I smile when I'm glad 
You're the best thing that I ever had [Chorus] One more thing, 
Smoke stacks, signal your love 
Coming from my window pane 
The love I need from you baby 
To take you in my arms again 
One smile from you is all I need 
To see me through my days [Chorus] One word from you, is all I need 
One, one, one kiss from you, always set me free [Chorus:Repeat x2] Like you, like you, early in the morning, hey 
Smile on your face, fade in the midnight hour 
No one can take your place 
Even sashes
