In my life, there's been changes 
But nothing seems to satisfy me the way you do, no 
You make it easy, the way you please me, every time i'm close to you 
All this temptation, i can't see wrong from right 
It's a new sensation, you know i'm blinded by the light (feels like) i'm walking on holy water 
Feels like i'm walking on sacred ground, baby 
(feels like) i'm walking on holy water, every time (that) you come 'round You were all i ever wanted, never had a girl in my life 'til i met you, oh 
No 
I got a certain feeling, you got my senses reeling 
Whenever i get close to you 
You're my salvation, i found you just in time 
My one temptation, you know i can't believe you're mine (feels like) i'm walking on holy water 
Feels like i'm walking on sacred ground, baby 
(feels like) i'm walking on holy water, every time (that) you come 'round Ooh yeah, it's funny how it see,s like yesterday, lovin' of the first degree 
One word was all i heard you say, ooh baby 
It's funny what you've done to me, just want to see you run to me All this temptation, i can't see wrong from right 
It's a new sensation, you know i'm blinded by the light (feels like) i'm walking on holy water 
Feels like i'm walking on sacred ground, baby 
(feels like) i'm walking on holy water, every time (that) you come 'round
