Don't you know where I've been? 
I have climbed every mountain 
Don't you know what I've seen? 
The Earth, the sky and the Moon 
Above, and inbetween, I'll shine like I should've In a way, without hate, I wouldn't be what I am 
In a way, without hate, I wouldn't be what I am Don't you know what I've been? 
Did I cause every tension? 
But I want you to be 
The Earth, the sky and the Moon 
In love, and in between, I'll shine like I should've In a way, without hate, I wouldn't be what I am 
In a way, without hate, I wouldn't be what I am Into a world I can do without 
Into a world I can do without Undecided 
Should I pray to something else 
Undecided 
Should I pray to something Fuck the devil 
Fuck myself Now 
Look at me now 
Look at me now 
Now 
Look at me now 
Look at me now 
Look at me now, now, now
