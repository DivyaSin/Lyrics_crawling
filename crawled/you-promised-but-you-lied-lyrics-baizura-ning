Please don't leave me now with all this pain 
Cause you're hurting me again and again 
I close my eyes and dream away 
Here in my heart there's an empty space 
Where you used to be 
Well I can't forget the day that you left me 
When you walked out the door out of my life 
Maybe I need a little love 
For you it's just a game 
You play... 
Cause you... 
For once you promised me but then you lied 
You say... 
You'll never ever leave and let love die 
Come back (come back) 
For all the love I've found in you 
And made my lonely dreams come true 
Say you'll stay but you go away 
Baby, why did you let me know 
But I'll watch where you go 
Believing you'll someday come back to me... come back to me
