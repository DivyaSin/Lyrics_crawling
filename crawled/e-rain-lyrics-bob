and there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no, 
and you dont know where to go, cause your in the rain, 
and and there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no, 
and you dont know where to go, but your in the rain and it keeps pouring down on you,the suns gone and your feeling blue, 
and its pouring down on you,but you keep on moving through, 
and its pouring down on you,the suns gone and your feeling blue, 
and there you are standing all alone in the rain, and the rain comes pouring down 
yeah yeah by no means am i livin in vain, but I, 
sit in the rain, im adicted to pain yeah, 
it feels good when it enters my veins, 
and evertime i wakeup its a similair day, 
cause im stuck in my ways, 
and everywhere i go the suns running away, 
but this is what i get for my troublesome ways, 
so here comes the rain to fuck up my parade, 
i aint got nothing to say, and there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no, 
and you dont know where to go, cause your in the rain, 
and and there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no, 
and you dont know where to go, but your in the rain and it keeps pouring down on you,the suns gone and your feeling blue, 
and its pouring down on you,but you keep on moving through, 
and its pouring down on you,the suns gone and your feeling blue, 
and there you are standing all alone in the rain, and the rain comes pouring down 
yeah yeah and as i fall into the rain, swimming through the flood, 
trying to unclog the drain, if you trying to find me my adress is memory lane, 
living amongst the darkness, so the dungeon is my domain, 
higher than the moutains feeling lower than the plains, 
but this is what i chose so how can i complain, 
and tryin to find some brain is, realy not my aim, 
stuck in inside my head, so it replays again, and there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no, 
and you dont know where to go, cause your in the rain, 
and and there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no, 
and you dont know where to go, but your in the rain, and it keeps pouring down on you,the suns gone and your feeling blue, 
and its pouring down on you,but you keep on moving through, 
and its pouring down on you,the suns gone and your feeling blue, 
and there you are standing all alone in the rain.
