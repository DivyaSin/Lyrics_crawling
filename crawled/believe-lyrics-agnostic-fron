I know I can trust myself cause I believe in what I say 
I believe in my friends, because they're with me everyday 
Believe that we can overcome because the scene is strong today 
Believe I live this life, because I know hardcore's the way 
Believe we are right 
Believe we are strong 
Believe in yourself 
Believe, hardcore 
I know things look bleak sometimes I wish it wasn't that way 
We know we're in the right, we stand proud today
