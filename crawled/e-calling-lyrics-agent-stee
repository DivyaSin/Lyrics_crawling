In every living thing in this planet has an aura. 
The area that you are discussing now is the aura of this planet. It is 
the Communicative Channel to which the Millionth Council governs this 
planet. Anyone going into the area when the Communicative Channel is 
open do not disappear, but they are in the timeless void. They're all 
perfectly alive and well. It is the only area to which the Council can 
communicate with this planet.
