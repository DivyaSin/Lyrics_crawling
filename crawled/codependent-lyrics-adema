Most people don't care 
Some people just stare 
There's so much pressure that my life will feed us 
Don't need a reason 
I will get even 
This is the season where I feel so manic You hurt yourself and blame me when you fall 
Co-Dependent 
You have lost control and crashed into a wall 
Co-Dependent 
You're Co-Dependent I am a bad seed 
It fills my own needs 
I never was scared to take my chances 
I see the temple 
'Cause I'm not social 
I've got my own life and you can't stand it You hurt yourself and blame me when you fall 
Co-Dependent 
You have lost control and crashed into a wall 
Co-Dependent 
Life has found a way where karma slaps you in the face 
Co-Dependent 
You depend on me for everything 
You're Co-Dependent 
Co-Dependent

Co-Dependent 
You're Co-Dependent You hurt yourself and blame me when you fall 
Co-Dependent 
Life has found a way where karma slaps you in the face 
Co-Dependent 
You depend on me for everything 
You're Co-Dependent 
You're Co-Dependent 
You're Co-Dependent 
You're Co-Dependent

You're Co-Dependent
