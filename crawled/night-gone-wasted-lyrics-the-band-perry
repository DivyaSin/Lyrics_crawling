Well you can find my face where the moon light lingers 'cause it's 
Friday night and it's as hot as ever 
Oh my heart is banging to the beat 
Of the band 
Me and my pals we got scars from the week 
But now we're making our noise and we're moving our feet 
As we do our best to let things get out of hand Oh it's a night gone wasted again 
I'm making up with my enemies and loving my best friends 
Well well well 
It's the best medication to make the whole wide world go around 
Oh it's a night gone wasted, oh yeah Well all of our eyes they got rings of fire 'cause we're 
Burning time like, there's no tomorrow 
Oh it's gonna take a while to blow off, a week's worth of steam 
So tell your, your sweet mama not to worry her pretty little head 
'Cause I'll have you home soon and then I'll tuck you in bed 
But until then let's do our best to get out of hand Man oh man It's a night gone wasted again 
Oh, I'm making up with my enemies and loving my best friends 
Well well well 
It's the best medication to help the whole wide world go around 
Oh it's a night gone wasted 
Oh yeah Oh what a riot it's been 
I'm gonna save up some more money to spend 
Another night Well well well 
It's the best medication to help the whole population survive 
It's a night gone wasted 
Oh it's a night gone wasted 
Oh it's a night night gone wasted 
Tonight Alright 
We're going out tonight, 
Ha
