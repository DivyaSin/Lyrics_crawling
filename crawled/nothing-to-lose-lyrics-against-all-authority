He's running wild through the streets at night 
But he's hiding in the shadows by the break of day 
He's got a clip-on Spydarco knife 
But it's just for keeping the wolves at bay 
2 AM, fucked up again 
He's living with the bottle cause he's living with the pain 
Insane, poking veins he's standing in the rain 
He's go nothing to lose and everything to gain 
Unwanted, unforgiving 
He's tired of fighting and he's tired of living here 
Swigging bear with nothing to fear 
He's got nothing to lose... so he's always winning. 
He's suffocating - the pain can be excruciating 
And liberating - it helps him forget the world he's hating 
Now he's waiting - and there won't be any negotiating 
He's got nothing to lose, he's been bloodied and he's been bruised 
He ain't taking anymore abuse 
He's had enough of theirs institutions 
And all the rules he was told to obey 
They offered no solutions 
So he hit the street before they put him away 
In a deprogramming youth care center 
To rid him of his insubordinate ways 
"You know that boy ain't right" 
Is what you'll hear his parents say 
Down on the world and down on his luck 
He's got nothing to lose he don't give a fuck about shit 
Takin' risks in the street throwing bricks 
With nothing to lose... you drove him to this 
Trying hard to forget the past 
He's sleeping under the overpass 
Of I-95 just trying to survive 
Just waiting for the moon to arrive
