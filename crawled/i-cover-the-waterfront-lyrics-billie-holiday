I cover the waterfront 
I'm watching the sea 
Will the one I love 
Be coming back to me? I cover the waterfront 
In search of my love 
An I'm covered 
By a starlit sky above Here am I 
Patiently waiting 
Hoping and longing 
Oh, how I yearn 
Where are you? 
Have you thought back time? 
Will you remember? 
Will you return? I cover the waterfront 
I'm watching the sea 
Will the one I love 
Be coming back to me? Here am I 
Patiently waiting 
Hoping and longing 
Oh, how I yearn 
Where are you? 
Have you thought back time? 
Will you remember? 
Will you return? I cover the waterfront 
I'm watching the sea 
Will the one I love 
Be coming back to me? Will the one I love 
Be coming back 
To me?
