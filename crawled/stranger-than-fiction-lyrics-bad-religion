A febrile shocking violent smack 
And the children are hoping for a heart attack 
Tonight the windows are watching 
The streets all conspire 
And the lampost can't stop crying 
If I could fly high above the world 
Would I see a bunch of little dots spell the word stupidity? 
Or would I just see hungry lover homicides 
Loving brother suicides 
And olly olly oxenfrees, who pick a side and hide The world is scratching at my door 
My morning papers got the scores 
The human interest stories, and the obituary Oh yeah, cockroach naps and rattling traps 
How many devils can you fit upon a match head? 
Caringosity killed the kerouac cat 
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction In my alley around the corner 
There's a wino with feathered shoulders 
And a spirit giving head for crack 
He'll never want it back 
There's a little kid and his family eating 
Crackers like thanksgiving 
And a pack of wild desperadoes scornful of living The world is scratching at my door 
My morning papers got the scores 
The human interest stories, and the obituary Oh yea, cradle for a cat, Woolf looks back, 
How many angels can you fit upon a match? 
I want to know why Hemmingway cracked 
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction Life is the crummiest book I ever read 
There isn't a hook, just a lot of cheap shots 
Pictures to shock and characters an 
Amateur would never dream up Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction
