[Chorus: Amanda Mellid] Oh can someone tell me why 
I cry 
'cus these tears down my face 
Don't signify life 
Oh can someone tell me why 
I try 
When I'm the only one to fail 
I swear the grass is greener on the other side [Verse: Aaron London] This life is such a bitter-sweet symphony 
another quick epiphany 
I feel like I'm the new kid 
There's no room for me 
In this world 
Deceit 
When I Speak Truthfully 
And everyone around me live their life 
Unfruitfully 
Is that the finish line I can see 
And the other side there 
Waiting on me 
My leg goes weak 
My brain goes a fortnight 
Unable physically and mentally [Pre Chorus: Aaron London] All of the things that I've done in my life 
Can someone tell me what I must do to make it right 
I know I must run 
I know I must run 
But I stand tall ready to fight 
X2 [Chorus: Amanda Mellid] Oh can someone tell me why 
I cry 
'cus these tears down my face 
Don't signify life 
Oh can someone tell me why 
I try 
When I'm the only one to fail 
I swear the grass is greener on the other side On the other side 
On the other side 
On the other S-i-ide 
On the other side [Verse: Aaron London] If we were to compare 
The colour of the grass 
It's greener in my past 
You can't kill the roots 
That why the nightmare won't pass 
and I'm sailing this ship without a mast 
And I need to get to the other side fast [Pre Chorus] All of the things that I've done in my life 
Can someone tell me what I must do to make it right 
I know I must run 
I know I must run 
But I stand tall ready to fight 
X2 [Chorus: Amanda Mellid] Oh can someone tell me why 
I cry 
'cus these tears down my face 
Don't signify life 
Oh can someone tell me why 
I try 
When I'm the only one to fail 
I swear the grass is greener on the other side [Bridge] On the other si-i-i-i-i-ide 
They laugh but not cry-y-y-y-y 
One day I'l make it there 
Oh I'll make it there [Chorus: Amanda Mellid] Oh can someone tell me why 
I Laugh 
With a smile on my face 
That signify's life 
Oh can someone tell me why 
I don't cry 
When I've made it to the other side 
The grass is greener on the other side On the other side 
On the other side 
On the other S-i-ide 
On the other side
