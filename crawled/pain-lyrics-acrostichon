Portraits, all over this wall 
Murdered morals taking my fall 
Velvet footsteps caressing the floor 
Listen carefully, I want to be sure The pig is laughing, moments of doubt 
Addicted to hatred, forcing the pain All these portraits remind me of the 
Water is burning, forcing away Slip into 
The sin of living 
Has been forgiven 
I ask for war 
(But) I'm getting more 
I don't understand
