Here I am back again. 
And wishing now was then. 
And I could write all the wrongs instead of writing songs. 
Its you I think of now 
And how I push it like a snow plow 
You come racing through my mind 
Was it me or you I left behind? 
You gave me love so pure 
But no loves for sure 
Now Im not so sure.
