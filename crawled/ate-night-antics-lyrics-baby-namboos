We're coming 
They're going 
They're smoking their hash 
Spending your address 
We've only got to look around 
To know these boys are sound 
We're here looking at sights 
We're not here for the fights 
Fights, fights 
Keep trying to bring me down 
I'll go out 
And I'm chilled out 
As life is still living 
I'm staying around 
Looking for a life 
Listening to sounds 
Things going off, all around 
Kids getting shot 
Turn your face to the ground 
Hey kids, hey kids stay around 
We're not here 
We're not here 
We're not here to live 
Live life for the brawl 
Hey kid, we've all got to die 
Pick yourself up 
Reach for the sky 
Hearts full of power 
Hearts full of power 
Blood's running in and out of my veins 
In and out,in and out of my veins 
The love, the love comes from inside 
The girl is so lovely 
So this is for you babe 
I'm going to stay true 
Because of my love, that's here for you Sneaking out of school 
Looking for something to do 
Caught up with the law 
You think I'll make it through? 
Two kids sitting in local 
With my back against the wall 
Center of this 
It's mister behavior 
Waiting to have a brawl Sneaking out of school 
Looking for something to do 
Caught up with the law 
Do you think I'll make it through? 
Sitting in a local 
With my back against the wall 
Back against the wall 
It's mister behavior 
Waiting for the brawl I wake up in the morning 
I'm looking at you 
I wake up in the morning 
I'm looking at you Playing your love 
Knowing I'm there to live life for you 
Babe, keep staying true 
We're flying through 
It will be sad 
Living life here without you We have another toll check 
While my dj plays the house decks 
See I like the hard age underground 
But we're looking for our own sound 
Exclude us from the street 
We're against what they usually beat 
I think it's just a load of drivel 
That keeps me hungry and living 
Keeping up with a fast pace 
Is like some crazy race 
I never thought that having a go 
I take pistols in the snow 
He thinks he's gonna take me 
I don't think so Late night antics 
Here we go again 
Moving as neighbors 
'cause moving is them 
Tight t-shirt boys 
On their wheels,jeans with those 
Forget the cheap thrills 
Just walk, just walking the streets 
Kids having a go 
See it in the face no more 
They see us guests,look love Late night antics 
Here we go again 
Move these neighbors 
'cause moving is them 
Tight t-shirt boys 
Hollow wheels,jeans with those 
Forget the cheap thrills 
Just walking the streets 
Kids having a go 
Can't see your face no more 
They see us guests,look love
