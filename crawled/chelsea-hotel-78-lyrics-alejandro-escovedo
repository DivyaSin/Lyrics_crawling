I lived in the Chelsea once 
On 7th and 23rd 
We came to live inside the myth 
Of everything we heard 
The poets on their bar stools 
They just loved it when it rained 
They comb their hair in the mirror 
Grow addicted to the pain And it makes no sense 
And it makes perfect sense 
And it makes no sense 
And it makes perfect sense I saw Neon Leon 
Spider and the boys 
Just before the cops arrived 
And took off with the noise 
It was nothing special 
Just another bar 
The baptist Kansas City life 
Makes everyone a star It makes no sense (It makes perfect sense) 
And it makes perfect sense (And it makes no sense) 
And it makes no sense (And it makes perfect sense) 
And it makes perfect sense (And it makes no sense) Oh 
C'mon Nancy called up to her rooms 
Said c'mon and help us sit 
We went down 
And looked around 
The dealer let us in 
We thought he was hysterical 
But not the way he joked 
Don't know if did what he said he did 
Nobody really knows I stood out on the sidewalk 
When we busted through the door 
In a white tuxedo jacket 
(?) 
You know to show off that thing 
Nobody knows for sure 
We know they found us 
In our black underwear 
Dead on the bedroom floor It makes no sense (It makes perfect sense) 
And it makes perfect sense (And it makes no sense) 
And it makes no sense (And it makes perfect sense) 
And it makes perfect sense (And it makes no sense) I lived in the Chelsea once 
On 7th and 23rd 
We came to live inside the myth 
Of everything we'd heard 
The poets on their bar stools 
They just loved it when it rained 
They comb their hair in the mirror 
Grow addicted to the pain It makes no sense (It makes perfect sense) 
And it makes perfect sense (And it makes no sense) 
And it makes no sense (And it makes perfect sense) 
And it makes perfect sense (And it makes no sense) We all through down 
(And it makes perfect sense) 
We all through dark 
(And it makes no sense) 
So we all moved out 
(And it makes perfect sense) 
So we all moved on 
(And it makes no sense) 
And on and on
