Life is a play and we all play a part 
The lover, the dreamer, the clown 
The dreamer and lover are always in tears 
The clown spreads sunshine around 
The life with a smile is the life worthwhile 
The clown till the curtain comes down Even though you're only make believing 
Laugh, clown, laugh! 
Even though something inside is grieving 
Laugh, clown, laugh! 
Don't let your heart grow too mellow 
Just be a real punchinello, fellow You're supposed to brighten up a place 
And laugh, clown, laugh! 
Paint a lot of smiles around your face 
And laugh, clown, don't frown 
Dressed in your best colored humor 
Be a pallietto and laugh, clown, laugh!
