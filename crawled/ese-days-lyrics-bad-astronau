Houston we don't understand 
The rescues launched are incomplete 
We lost it again, we lost it again 
We could not locate its pride, 
we have no found its strength 
In spite of endless search, in spite of every mission 
Yeah that's the way things go some days 
They will come take you away 
How I wanded to be more than the man I am today 
Just when we embarked on space, 
its design came crashing down 
Far from conclusion, far from its objective 
Traveling by stereo its suspension time in space 
Your best, your worst 
As you journey through the system you define 
Body and mind 
Yeah that's the way we fall, that's the way we falter
