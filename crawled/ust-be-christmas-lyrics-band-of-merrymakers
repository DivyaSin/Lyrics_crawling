It's the greatest holiday 
Goodwill and peace on earth 
Finally they don't seem so far away Stockings stuffed with candy canes 
Old friends are back in town 
And once they're home 
It's just like nuthin's changed So hurry up Santa crank that sleigh When there's only merry in your heart 
And you're feeling nicer than you are When the day is made of wishes. It must be Christmas Ho ho ho ho hooo (2x) Colored lights are all a glow 
Last minute shopping list 
You barely made the mall before it closed 
Wrapping paper, tying bows 
Secret crushes hope they'll kiss 
Beneath a bough of mistletoe We're making angels in the snow When there's only merry in your heart 
And you're feeling nicer than you are When the day is made of wishes. It must be Christmas 
Ho ho ho ho hooo (2x) So if you're feeling like a scrooge 
Remember those less fortunate than you 
You and I could be the someone who makes someone's dreams true Oh oh oh oh When there's only merry in your heart 
When you're feeling nicer than you are 
When the day is made of wishes. 
It must be Christmas When the north winds knockin at your door 
When the yuletide fires keeps you warm 
And your love's the greatest gift 
It must be Christmas Ho ho ho ho hooo
