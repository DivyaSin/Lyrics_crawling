On your street 
In your pause between sentences 
I can tell what's banging 
Around 
In your chore 
Roll around on the kitchen floor 
I know what's been getting 
To you 
Well you do have it tonight 
(I don't know, I can't find it) 
Well are you ready tonight 
(I don't know, but I'll try) 
She came on through me 
She came right through me 
She came right through me 
She came right through me 
All worked up 
Let that clown buy our memory 
A word you said meant something 
To me 
Chewing gum 
Killing time till the morning comes 
You can stay or maybe 
you'll leave 
Doesn't make a difference to me 
She came on through me 
She came right through me 
She came right through me 
She came right through me
