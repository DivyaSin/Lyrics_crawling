Go! 
When I fall down on my own 
It came out to meet to me 
(You) just like waitin' for me the night The children of the night, in my mind (It just the bleeding light) 
Glowing bright 
Children night 
Glowing bright 
It just the bleeding light 
It's just the bleeding light Glowing bright into the night 
Glowing bright in the bleeding light
