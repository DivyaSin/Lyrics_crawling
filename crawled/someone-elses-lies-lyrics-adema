We are friends 
And you feel like we've grown apart 
That's not the case 
You know i'm speaking from my heart Friends should last forever 
Bitches come and go 
Someone's lying to you 
And i'm ready to explode Why would you think 
That i would be a liar and your friend 
I'll show you what they told you 
Are someone else's lies 
I'll show you what they told you 
Are someone else's lies What about the days 
When we would all hang out 
We would talk about our dreams 
And drive around Friends should last forever 
Bitches come and go 
Someone's lying to you 
And i'm ready to explode Why would you think 
That i would be a liar and your friend 
I'll show you what they told you 
Are someone else's lies 
I'll show you what they told you 
Are someone else's lies Liar 
Someone's lying to you Liar 
Someone's lying to you I'll show you what they told you 
Are someone else's lies 
I'll show you what they told you 
Are someone else's lies Why would you think 
That i would want to hurt you 
Why would you think 
That i would be a liar and your friend
