Every night before I go to sleep 
I thank the lord down on my knees 
For the bare necessities 
Food, water, shelter, love We're so busy judging right from wrong 
Rich and poor, weak and strong 
When all we need our whole life long 
Is food, water, shelter, love We can soldier on through each day 
If we have a home to keep our family safe 
And if your heart can be warmed by somebody's love 
That's enough People go hungry struggle to survive 
While we fly New York to London in the blink of an eye 
Why must it be so hard to provide 
Food, water, shelter, love We can soldier on through each day 
If we have a home to keep our family safe 
And if your heart can be warmed by somebody's love 
That's enough Every night before I go to sleep 
I thank the lord down on my knees 
For the bare necessities 
Food, water, shelter, love 
Food, water, shelter, love
