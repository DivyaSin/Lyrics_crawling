Youre in the rain now 
Youre trying to strike the match 
I'm tinder dry now 
Oh yes I'm gonna catch 
So pour it over 
You give me what you've got 
Now I'm so dead baby 
Now I'm running hot yeah 'Cause I feel like I'm walking on fire 
When youre talking theres smoke coming out of my head 
And I'm broken down like a strong man burning, over you! 
Yeah I got burned (I got burned) X 4 Its in your eyes now 
Youre going to light the fuse 
Youre always thinking 
You just can't loose, no 
Ill take your poison 
Ill even take the blame (sometimes) 
Well our love sugar 
Is going up in flames now 'Cause I feel like I'm walking on fire 
When youre talking theres smoke coming out of my head 
And I'm broken down like a strong man burning, over you! 
Yeah I got burned (I got burned) X 4
