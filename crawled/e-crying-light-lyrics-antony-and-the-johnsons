Let I 
Shy cry 
Under the light 
Let I 
Cry sight 
A child at night 
I can 
Have courage 
To receive your love 
I can 
Step steps 
Follow my blind 
Inside 
My self 
The secret grows 
My own 
Shelter 
Agony goes 
I was born to adore you 
As a baby in the blind 
I was born to represent you 
To carry your head into the sun 
To carve you face into the back of the sun
