There's a moment when you realize that something's changed 
All the bits and pieces start to fit (so fab!) 
When nothing that you know will ever be the same (ring a bell, that's my queue) 
Gotta try something new Gonna shine and make the moment mine 
Now my time has arrived 
Gonna shine so bright 
The sun will run and hide 
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky 
I'm gonna shine Listen up fellas Now there's nothing in this universe to hold me back (bye, Gab) 
The endless night can keep me in the dark 
And I just might give my dear old dad a heart attack 
But he'll live and he'll see what his girl is meant to be Gonna shine and leave the past behind 
Gonna try to fly so high 
Gonna climb and make the prize all mine 
And I'll write my name in letters across the sky 
I'm gonna shine And if my present luminescent state is second rate 
I'll turn it up a notch past nine and watch the world go blind Got a diva dazzle that you just can't touch 
Like an angel in Armani I'm too fabulous 
They'll be lining up for blocks once I bop to the top 
With a poochie in my Gucci, I just can't be stopped I'm gonna shine and make the moment mine 
Now my time has arrived 
Gonna shine so bright 
The sun will run and hide 
And I'll be the only star that lights the sky 
I'm gonna shine
