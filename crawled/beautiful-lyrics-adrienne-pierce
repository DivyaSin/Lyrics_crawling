So sorry to hear the peace parade woke you up today 
So sorry to hear another hair has turned grey Play the victim, so I let you 
Believe the world is out to get you 
Play the victim so well, so we let you 
Believe the world is out to get you [CHORUS:] 
And you say, why can't they see 
I am beautiful, I am beautiful 
And each day, you want to scream 
I am beautiful, I am beautiful So sorry to hear another friend got engaged 
Can't stand to see another sad scene you've staged Play the victim, so I let you 
Believe the world is, out to get you 
Play the victim so well, so we let you 
Believe the world is out to get you [CHORUS:] 
And you say, why can't they see 
I am beautiful, I am beautiful 
And each day, you want to scream 
I am beautiful, I am beautiful One day I saw you smile 
Forgot about yourself for a little while 
And you were beautiful, beautiful [CHORUS]
