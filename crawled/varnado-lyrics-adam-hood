The darkest hour is always before the dawn 
And it sure is dark out here driving all alone 
Well I love you baby, I will for all my life 
But it's sad to say I can't come home tonight Because I'm down below the Mississippi line 
where the clouds are dancing in the full moon light 
I love you baby but i gotta go to Varnado tonight 
On the side of the road underneath the pines 
There's a big arrow flashing my name on the sign 
I love you baby but I gotta show in Varnado tonight I tried to call you up and tell you so 
but i can't use my phone on the paris road 
Still I love you baby you know I'd never be untrue 
sometimes it gets so hard when you're on the move When your down below the Mississippi line 
where the clouds are dancing in the full moon light 
I love you baby but i gotta go to Varnado tonight 
On the side of the road underneath the pines 
There's a big arrow flashing my name on the sign 
I love you baby but I gotta show in Varnado tonight
