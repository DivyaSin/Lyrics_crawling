An old man is proud 
but behind his modest smile lies the grief 
Only one picture of his brave son remains It seems that the vicious circle 
Can never be broken through The hopeful ones gathered their strength 
To achieve the apparent impossible 
But all plans seem to be in vain As a soldier of Allah 
He's an example for the others 
On his bloody way to immortality It seems that the vicious circle 
Can never be broken through 
Because old wounds are reopened every time This Intifada as a device 
To thwart the peace negotiations He can rely on a reward in the hereafter 
Eternal paradise awaits him Pugnacity 
With our blood 
Show no mercy 
With our soul 
Die for heaven 
An eye for an eye 
Burn to let them... 
Suffer for all their actions We will not move an inch 
They won't play in our hands 
We will not tolerate those who defy We will not hesitate 
To start an attack 
If you undermine the agreement Let them suffer!
