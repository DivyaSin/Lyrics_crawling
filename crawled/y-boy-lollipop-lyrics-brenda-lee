My boy lollipop 
You make my heart go giddy up 
You are as sweet as candy 
You are my sugar dandy Woe oh my boy lollipop 
You never, never leave me 
'cause it could grieve me 
My heart told me so I love you I love you I love you so 
But I don't want you to know. 
I need you I need you I need you so 
And I'll never let you go Oh My boy lollipop 
You make my heart go giddy up 
You set the world on fire 
You are my one desire 
Woo my lollipop I love you I love you I love so 
But I don't want you to know.
