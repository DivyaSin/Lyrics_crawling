Last night I saw her out 
In the city crowd 
Laughing in the breeze 
She smiled at me 
Just like a movie scene 
It was her and me 
Waltzing in our heads 
All by ourselves 
And as she passed me by 
I could see it in her eyes [Chorus] 
Everywhere she goes, she goes there knowing 
I just want to be with her 
Everywhere she goes, she goes there knowing. 
I just want to be 
I just want to be with her Seems like I see her face 
Every couple days 
Playing hard to get 
I can't handle this 
Something about the way she moves 
The looks she gives, the attitude 
It pulls me in [Chorus] When's she gonna stop these games? 
When's she gonna stop? 
(Everywhere she goes) 
I just want to be with her [Chorus]
