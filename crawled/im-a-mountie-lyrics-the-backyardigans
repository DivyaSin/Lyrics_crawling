I'm a Mountie and I'm marching through the snow 
I'm a Mountie to the Yukon I must go 
I'm a Mountie, a perfection, if something needs protection 
Then there's no protector you could know Mountie on duty, Mountie on duty 
I'm a Mountie and I'm marching through the snow We are Mounties and we're marching through the snow 
We are Mounties to the Yukon we must go 
We are Mounties and we're good sports and we like defending snow forts 
We are Mounties and we're marching through the snow Yes, we are Mounties in our Mountie matching suits 
You can tell us by our Mountie salutes 
[Incomprehensible] for a Mountie there's no stopping 
We are Mounties marching in our Mountie boots
