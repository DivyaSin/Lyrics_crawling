Take one last breath 
You're about to jump to your death 
You're about to jump to your death Sail away from the shoreline 
Sail away from the shore 
I'm in front of Heaven's door. Sail away from the shoreline 
Sail away from the shore 
I'm in front of Heaven's door. Captain! Captain! 
Before the sail rips 
Captain! Captain! 
I see the enemy ships 
Captain! Captain! 
Before the sail rips 
Gasp for air 
ABANDON ALL SHIPS! The currents strong, the waves will rise 
The binding chains made me realize 
Sin is the anchor, holding you down. 
I'm on a cruise to Paradise. 
I'm done with sin, I've paid my price. 
God is your captain, change your direction 
ABANDON ALL SHIPS! We'll part the sea 
(Choose your side) 
Don't come with me 
(You decide) 
We'll part the sea 
Don't come with me Sail away from the shoreline 
Sail away from the shore 
I'm in front of Heaven's door OH! Look what we've built, walking the plank of guilt.[x2] 
Look what we've built, walking blindfolded. 
Look what we've built, blinded walking on the plank of guilt. 
Look what we've built The currents strong, the waves will rise 
The binding chains made me realize: 
Sin is the anchor 
Holding you down I'm on a cruise to paradise 
I'm done with sin, I've paid my price 
God is your captain, change your direction.
