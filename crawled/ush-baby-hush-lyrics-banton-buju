Man well rough woman no stop request the wuk

Bedroom destruction woman you man a killa 
Have fi give it up when she see the ragga ragga 
Wicked on the trigger man is a good digger 
Woman a wiggle jus a jiggle a cry you get bigga 
Where have you been you jolly bad fellow

So hush baby Chorus Rain start to fall, your inner nature start to call 
You need a good soccer player to kick the football 
Direct free kick, curve it around the defense
