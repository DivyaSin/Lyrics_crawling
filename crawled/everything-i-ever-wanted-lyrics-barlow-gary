You're everything I ever wanted and more 
You're the girl that I've needed for so long I think I'm old enough to know now 
The reason I feel the way I do now 
In my own words this love is so meant to be 
It's in your eyes each time you're listening to me 
I'm saying things I've never said before 
And so naturally you coming back for more 
There's a reason why this love is changing my life You're everything I ever wanted and more 
You're in my mind in my heert in my soul 
Each time I think about reason, my work, losing time 
I just think about you and leave responsibility behind 
My day it opens with your head on my shoulder 
I love to kiss, touch, I love to hold you 
Our time it moves so fast 
Every hour's a second till at last 
We will sleep one night and that night is forever You're everything I ever wanted and more 
You're in my mind, in my heart, in my soul 
Each time I think about reason, my work, losing time 
I just think about you and leave responsibility behind 
There's a reason why this love is changing my life 
You're everything I ever wanted and more 
You're in my mind, in my heart, in my soul 
Each time I think about reason, my work, losing time 
I just think about you and leave responsibility behind
