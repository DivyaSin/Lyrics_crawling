At night I feel the air just slip through my fingers 
In daylight it sticks like glue 
When I consider all the things that creep under my skin 
None of them are quite as sweet as you So don't cry And if I leave, and coming back I lose my way 
Don't change the locks on the back door 
Cause even though my brain may be twisted and unsound 
You know that my heart is true So don't cry 
So don't cry 
So don't cry 
So don't cry
