Dark is the night 
Gray is the day 
It's cold outside 
But his halo lights my way He says to me 
I wanna light you up 
I wanna light you up 
In the dark and the day 
My halo's bright 
Follow the way It's hard to see 
It's hard to say 
I'm without knowing 
But his halo lights my way The water is wide 
This side I can't stay 
I don't know where I'm going 
But his halo lights my way
