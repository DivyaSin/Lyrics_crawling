Don't play me a symphony 
A simple song will do 
Diamond rings 
Sparkling bright 
Gold and silver things 
Candle lights 
But I wish you bought 
Real light 
One day you understand 
The meaning in my eyes 
Don't play me a symphony 
A simple song will do 
Don't buy me no jewellery 
Won't make my dreams 
Come true 
Fancy cloths I never wore 
And books I never read 
All I want is your 
Love is all I need 
Don't play me a symphony 
I'd rather hear a song 
Harm a note and melody 
So I can harm along 
Love is all I have to give 
And love is all I need 
All I want is your 
Love is all I need 
Sympathy is not allowed 
When you talk to me 
You don't shout 
If you gave more 
More of your life 
I could easily 
One day be your wife. 
Don't play me a symphony 
A simple song will do 
Don't buy me no jewellery 
Won't make my dreams 
Come true 
Fancy cloths I never wore 
And books I never read 
All I want is your 
Love is all I need 
Don't play me a symphony 
I'd rather hear a song 
Harm a note and melody 
So I can harm along 
Love is all I have to give 
And love is all I need 
All I want is your 
Love is all I need 
Love is all I have to give 
And love is all I need 
All I want is your 
Love is all I need
