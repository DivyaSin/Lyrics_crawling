Inside my lungs your breath did reach. 
Chorus of sighs from you to me. 
Love meant for someone else's lips. 
But broke the seal of mine instead. Oh how I wonder how we slept. 
The tightness dry as our mouths met. 
Inside my lungs your breath did reach. Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh Within my ribs your breath did creep 
Exhale of lies between the teeth. 
It felt of someone else's lips. 
But broke the seal of mine instead. And now its set out to constrict 
my veins, my bones, my nerves, my neck. 
Within my ribs your breath did reach. 
And choked me. Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh So no more begging, no kiss to give. 
I lay here gasping for what's left. 
And no more thieves will steal this breath. 
Let free the air within my ribs. 
Within my ribs. Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh 
Oh...
