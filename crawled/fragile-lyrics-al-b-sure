If blood will flow,when flesh and steel are one 
Drying in the colour of evening sun 
Tomorrow's rain will wash the srains away ,but something in	our mind will allways stay 
Perhapsthis final act was meant to clinch a lifetime's argument 
That nothing comes from violence and nothing never could 
For all those born beneath an angry star,lest we forget how fragile we are. 
On and on the rain will fall like tears from a star,like tears from a star. 
On and on the rain will say how fragile we are,how fragile we are.
