Wider than a smile 
The truth can be unkind 
To take the only one 
You thought you were someone 
No apologies 
I live the life I lead 
I hope you understand 
That none of this was planned 
No apologies 
I live the life I lead 
I hope you understand 
That none of this was planned 
Who am I to ask you why 
You feel the way you do 
If you feel the way you do 
Is there something we could do
