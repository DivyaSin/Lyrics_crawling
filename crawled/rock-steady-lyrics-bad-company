Now I, when I 
Want to rock steady, baby 
I know that I've got to get ready now, alright 
Close my eyes and I'll let myself go 
I listen to, baby now let the music flow Turn on your light 
And stay with me awhile 
Ease your troubled mind 
Turn on your light 
Rock steady When my love 
Gets a little bit too heavy 
She's mine but I've got to get ready now 
Close my eyes, let myself go 
I listen to, c'mon baby, let the music flow Turn on your light 
And stay with me awhile 
Ease your troubled mind 
Turn on your light 
Rock steady Turn on your light 
And stay with me awhile 
Ease your troubled little mind 
Turn it on for me baby 
I want you to rock rock rock Turn it on baby 
Stay with me awhile 
Ease your troubled mind 
Turn it on baby, yes 
Rock steady
