When you think you've seen it all 
Through tears in your eyes 
Your head hanging low 
The moon on the rise Well I think of you 
Yeah I pray for you 
May your days pass like Sundays 
May your nights lay you down Let your heart not be troubled 
Cast your doubts to the wind 
Lay your chains in the rubble 
Let your heart not be troubled 
Anymore Well your bedsheets grow cold 
Every now and again 
Each stone in the road 
A place where we been But where are we now 
Tell me where are we now 
Lay your dreams on my pillow 
And we'll get there somehow Let your heart not be troubled 
Cast your doubts to the wind 
Lay your chains in the rubble 
Let your heart not be troubled 
Anymore Well sometimes a love 
Comes undone in the wind 
You can't see your shoes 
Where you goin' 
Where you been 
So I wait around right here 
So I don't lose my way 
I never had no direction anyway Let your heart not be troubled 
Cast your doubts to the wind 
Lay your chains in the rubble 
Let your heart not be troubled Let your heart not be troubled 
Cast your doubts to the wind 
Lay your chains in the rubble 
Let your heart not be troubled 
Let your heart not be troubled 
Let your heart not be troubled 
Anymore
