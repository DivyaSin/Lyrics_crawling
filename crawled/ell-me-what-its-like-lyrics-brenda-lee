You know we've been close friends a long time now 
And I just needed somebody to talk to 
I hate to bring this subject up 
Because I know how you've been hurt 
With someone you really loved 
And your whole world just crumbled apart 
But I thought it might help me to know what it's like 
When it happens so I came to you 
'Cause I can feel it comin' on Tell me what it's like to lose the only thing you care about 
Tell me how it feels to know your only dream is gone 
Tell me how you live when you've lost something you can't live without 
Tell me what it's like, I can feel it comin' on 
Tell me what it's like to wake up crying every morning 
With an aching heart that just won't set you free Tell me what you do when there's no one that you wanna do it with 
There's nobody else you really wanna see 
Tell me what it's like when those four lonely walls start closin' in 
Tell me how it feels to spend the nights alone 
Tell me what to say whenever someone ask you how you've been 
Tell me what it's like (tell me what's it's like) 
I can feel it comin' on (tell me) 
Tell me what it's like 
I can feel it comin' on
