SONG LYRICS 
Get a load of that with the snakeskins on 
Looks like a refugee from a head bangin' song 
Sweet July evening, seems all the world we've ever known 
Is here at the breaker, shakin' them restless bones 
Brown baggin' as the music's draggin' on a cheap cassette machine 
Honey, I know no matter where we go 
We're gonna keep us a piece of this routine 
Chorus: 
Like a rembrandt.... 
A one of a kind in a shades-of-grey world 
Like a rembrandt, baby....... 
A genuine find in a come and go swirl 
World's in the moonlight, there's diamonds in the coal 
Layin' on my hood we're runnin' soul in soul 
Yellin' out my name, I think I know who that was 
This moment's got me higher than a black coffee buzz 
Come on girl, you can call your boss and fake a case of the flu 
You and me, we can cast some shadows 
In that nightlight your mama left on for you 
Repeat Chorus 
Drinkin' domestic on a night as majestic 
As a true hell raiser's bliss 
Every workin' day they take a little more away 
But they don't know of a social affair as redeeming as this 
Same tapes as last week, but that makes 'em cool 
Same grooves, same times, drives the social tool 
If this here is heaven then the saints are reelin' 
Some of them crawlin' on a tall grass ceilin' 
Honey, if life don't give us any more - it gave us a season 
To groove 'neath the stars at the number 9 breaker 
Not askin' for answers or reasons 
Repeat Chorus
