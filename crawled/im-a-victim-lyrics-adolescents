She came in out of the rain 
Her eyes reflecting all my sorrow and pain 
I tried to turn her away 
Said 'Get out! Wait a minute, won't you stay?' [Chorus:] 
Come on in? 'Cos I'm a victim 
Come on in? 'Cos I'm a victim 
Come on in? 'Cos I'm a victim 
Come on in? 'Cos I'm a victim Now that I have changed my old ways 
Too many broken hearts have been the price that I've paid 
A lesson I never learned 
A trusting heart is the heart that gets you burned [Chorus] She came in out of the cold 
Well this time I knew I had to tell her 'No!' 
She pleaded 'Just for a while' 
Well I blew my answer when she smiled [Chorus] Tell me why? Why I end up alone, again and again 
Tell me why? Why I bleed frustration; when will the pain end? 
Tell me why? I'm going crazy 
Tell me why? Why I'm going crazy At night, I get on my knees 
And Lord knows I pray WHY??? Loneliness!
