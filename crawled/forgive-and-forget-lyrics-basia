Don't ask me to forgive and forget 
I'm not crying, no more tears left 
How I'm feeling 
You'd never understanding Stop saying you'd like to explain 
Don't promise 
It's far far too late 
Spare the details 
No I don't want to know 
Your honesty only makes me laugh You can't make me love you anymore 
Now I've got to learn to be free 
And it really doesn't worry me 
It don't worry me You're unhappy 
It's something I know 
Time to end it once and for all 
Can you here me 
We're too far 
It's too late 
You're free to go 
Let me now forget 
Let me forget
