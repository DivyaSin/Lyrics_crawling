Why are we so cold 
Why are we so numb 
How did it get like this 
On the sidewalk in the pouring rain 
In the spotlight did you feel the same I wish for us I do 
I pray for us Out and over or don't you think that's true? 
Do you think that's true? 
When it's said yeah when it's done 
Not one place to run 
When it's said and done I wish for us I do 
I pray for us 
I wish for us I do 
I pray for us Lay down, lay down your guns 
Lay down when it's said and done 
Lay down it's just no fun anymore On the sidewalk, in the pouring rain 
In the spotlight don't ya steel my pain I wish for us I do 
I pray for us it's true 
I wish for us I do 
I pray for us
