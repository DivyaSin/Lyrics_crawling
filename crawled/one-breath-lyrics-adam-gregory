Trust in me and I will never let you down Trust your soul when there's nobody else around Trust in love cause it will always heal your heartbreaks And we always learn em better from our mistakes For me there'll never be nobody else but you I thought of walking by myself But I could never make it through - without you There's nothing we can't over come Were staring at a bright new sun Well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache Well touch the earth and kiss the sky As the same moment passes by Then well be sure to stay one breathe away from heartache One breathe from the heartache Touch my hand if I ever feel that you're weak Lay your head here on my shoulder when you need Tell your secrets to me when they get too heavy And Ill make sure that I'm always there for you I don't need anybody else but you - for me I don't know if Ill find the words But if I do will you believe There's nothing we can't over come Were staring at a bright new sun And well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache Well touch the earth and kiss the sky As the same moment passes by Then well be sure to stay one breathe from a heartache And I will catch you if you fall My heart will be there if you call And I will cover you through anything at all One breathe from a heartache there's nothing we can't over come Were staring at a bright new sun Well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache One breathe from a heart ache Trust in me and I will never let you down
