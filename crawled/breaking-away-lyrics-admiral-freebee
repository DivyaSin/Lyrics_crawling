I'm busted now baby 
I'm breakin' away 
Kind of all the things that I forgot to say 
And I'm looking at life with 
Fresh eyes today 
I'm busted now baby 
I'm breakin' away Livin' on hope depends 
Lost ...and plans 
And I won't be filled up by one night stand 
And I don't feel bad for 
Let it go 
I just feel sad for letting know I'm busted now baby 
I'm breakin' away 
Kind of all the things that I forgot to say 
And I'm looking at life with 
Fresh eyes today 
I'm busted now baby 
I'm breakin' away I'm too fucked down to make you return now 
I hope we get our apps together girl 
To be adults somehow 
I see a lady standing in the sun 
And I didn't know where she goes 
I ask her who she is 
And she answers: everyone
