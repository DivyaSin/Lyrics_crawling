She's like them Reese's Peanut Butter cups, mnm that I love so much

But then she burn it up and I be like mmm-mmm-mm-, ah-ah I remember everybody said it, it's the love bug you're gettin,

But ever since she put it on me, oohooh I think she's got me,

But now I know because I feel it so much, much

Body's like umfphh. 
French manicure, pedicure's in her foot. 
When she strolls by, everybody looks. 
But nobody says a word, everybody's schwup. 
She don't deal with your car. 
She dont' know who you are. 
Round here it's music and movie stars. 
Straight from the bottle, who uses cups? (Not me) 
Her swagger's mad crazy. 
Forget about the tears on Page 3. 
she's tasty and open ears. 
But when her smile appears, it's 1080 HD. 
Holla at me baby. 
I'm a bachelor. 
BBM, no girl it's not that. 
iPhone 4, wassap? I never knew that I could feel it so much, much 
But now I know because I feel it so much, much 
Even if I tried, couldn't think of no one 
Who does it quite like you do 
it's so much, much, much.
