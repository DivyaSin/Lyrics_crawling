Nippers Corner Bumping down the county road, some sneaky in the beat 
Agnes sighs and checks her thighs shes movingmovin through the 
Heat, it takes a heavy toll that the people love to pay 
So get your roll of dimes and your sippin wine 
Cause forgettin times the order of the day Yellow bus drops Gospel Jones, he lost that eye in 43 
With a soggy smile, hell preach a while about losin 
Losin nothing but a state of mind like a roll of dice, 
You gotta let em fall where they may 
But the gospels gold is in the glass he holds 
And aint nobody gonna take it away Token stories, trading glory for the flame 
Stumbling softly, fire gently soothes the soul Detroit hank looking for some love raises a glass to Lemon Klein 
Looking bold, shes off parole and gleaming 
Scheming from behind a different bar and a darker star 
Where everyone takes a seat 
Cos when yer fightin time & yer soaked with wine 
You forget that you can leave Gospels watching Agnes dancing near the flame 
Stumbling softly, fire gently soothes the soul 
Heated prancing she keeps dancing with pain 
Gospelssinging Nippers Corners gonna blow Bumpin down the county road, some sneaky in the beat 
Agnes sighs and drops her eyes 
Shes movin
