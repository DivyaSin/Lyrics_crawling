In fact 
You're sorry that 
You ever had to go 
But you won't go back 
You know and 
It's sad 
It's all you had 
You never had to give it away Countdown 
Your wings have ground 
One leg at a time 
And still flapping around 
It's bad 
It's all you have 
You never had to give it away 
You never had to give into it Congratulations 
Space angel 
Psycho-superstar 
Infatuation 
For one solitary life 
You never had to give it away Young fan 
Celestial man 
Sleuthing the sky 
For adreneline 
It's sad 
It's all you had 
You never had to give it away Unstrung 
A heroes son 
Fiberglass wings 
And a tommy gun 
It's sad 
It's all you had 
You never had to give it away 
You never had to give into it Congratulations 
Space angel 
Psycho-superstar 
Infatuation 
For one solitary life 
You never had to give it away If I come there 
Would you come near 
To giving it all away? 
If you were here 
Would you still fear 
You're giving it all away? 
Interplanetary 
Solitary 
You're taking me back today 
Wax halos melting 
Space angels belting 
We're going back today Congratulations 
Space angel 
Psycho-superstar 
Infatuation 
For one solitary life 
You never had to give it away
