Lyrics by: Andrew Winn 
Appears on: Seed Welcome to the world of the northern hemisphere 
Greet the winds of this heavenly frontier 
Water pure as the blood of Mary's son 
Cast your fears to the northern lights above 
Take the time, pull this splinter from your eye 
View her tears as they're falling from the sky 
Virgin child, on the verge of great demise 
From the hands of the ruthless human kind Chorus: 
Don't tarnish this silver realm 
Don't rain on her golden dreams 
Don't lie to these open arms 
Then wake up to find she's gone and won't be home again Twilight is the time, vibrant colors paint the sky 
Across the mountains, capped with snow and whipped-creamed clouds 
The wind, she sings in a whisper soft and mild 
Coaxed to sleep all the children of the land 
Stand in awe as you're drifting off the shore 
Watching glaciers cast their elders to the sea 
A winter's rain cools the fever from your soul 
Bringing peace to your spirit as it soars Our ways have turned the world around 
Split the chain and broke it down 
She's drowning in the dark Goodbye to the love of the land that graced our lives 
Come corporations, watch the smoke infect the skies 
Oil, it stains the beaches once alive 
Test your conscience, test your will to pull the line So save your sister homeland, you can, you can, yeah you can
