Do you want to make 
I want to know 
I love you baby 
I'm hurtin' so 
But oh if you could see me baby 
And understand the things I've done 
I know you can do that baby 
And if you could see me fly 
Do you need me 
Come on let's go 
I love ya baby 
On the ceiling 
The walls and the floor 
But oh if you could see me baby 
And understand the things I've done 
I know you can do that baby 
And if you could see me fly 
Don't look at me like you can't stand 
I'm in the mood 
Talk loud 
Take my money like a wanted bandit 
I've had enough 
Do you love me 
I want to know 
I love you baby 
I'm hurtin' so 
Come on and love me 
Come on all night 
Come on here baby 
Do it once again right 
But oh if you could see me baby 
And understand the things I've done 
I know you can do that baby 
And if you could 
And if you could see me fly
