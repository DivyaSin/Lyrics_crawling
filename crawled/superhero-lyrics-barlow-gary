Barlow/Martin/Lundin/Skinner 
(To be your superhero ...) 
I can't sit and wait 
For you to say 
If there's room inside your heart 
I'm not used to playin' 
That silly game 
Turn me down or let me start 
You have to believe I'll make things right 
Open your arms, give up the fight 
CHORUS 
For all that you want, For all that you're feeling 
There's a place where you can go 
For all that you need, I will be waiting 
To be your superhero 
Now if you decide 
To run and hide 
It's only you you're cheatin' 
(The key's in your hand) 
The key's in your hand 
(You must understand) 
You must understand 
I won't be defeated - no! 
I really believe this goes inside 
Open your arms, let me see your life 
REPEAT CHORUS 
(To be your superhero) 
I'm sure that you've heard this before so many times 
(So many times) 
Girl look inside my heart and you will find 
You'll find your superhero 
I'll be the one to hold you 
I'll never let you go 
I'll always understand you baby 
To be your superhero 
REPEAT CHORUS TWICE
