Sunday morning the kids are playing in the street 
Lookin' for pennies in the cracks of the concrete 
And I'm looking down at them while I'm sittin' on the roof 
Prayin' to a bottle of 86 proof Well, the sun she came a-risin' so strong and proud 
Took one look down upon this town and hid behind the clouds I don't need no reasons or excuses for myself 
I laugh to keep from cryin' like everybody else I lost my job but I don't like to think about it 
I get enough money to drink enough to forget about it 
I ain't no beggar but they say I got the symptoms 
They break a man's legs and then they blame him for limpin' Well, the sun she came a-risin' so strong and proud 
Took one look down upon this town and hid behind the clouds I don't need no reasons or excuses for myself 
I laugh to keep from cryin' just like everybody else
