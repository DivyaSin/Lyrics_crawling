Time, it's supposed to heal our wounds 
Joy, I never knew till I met you 
On that summer night in the moonlight 
When you were there by my side 
Peace, it only comes when I have you 
(when I have you) If you put your arms around me 
I can never (ever) let you go 
If you put your arms around me 
I can never (ever) let you go Love is the only thing that I have left 
And now I know I'm no better than the rest 
And I try and I try to win you back 
With every line in my heart and mind dream 
Of the time when you were by my side If you put your arms around me 
I can never (ever) let you go 
If you put your arms around me 
I can never (ever) let you go Never let you go 
Never let you go, no, no 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Oh no, no 
Never let you go If you put your arms around me 
I can never (ever) let you go 
If you put your arms around me 
I can never (ever) let you go 
If you put your arms around me 
I can never (ever) let you go 
If you put your arms around me 
I can never (ever) let you go
