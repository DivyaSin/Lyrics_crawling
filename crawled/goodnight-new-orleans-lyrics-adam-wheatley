Goodnight New Orleans 
You took me in and took me down 
Wish I had known I wanted nothing more 
Than to see your sunrise open up my eyes 
But the day won't come Love only rides on hope so long 
Before there's work to be done Goodnight New Orleans 
Saint Charles is fading from my mind 
No, you're not my home Your sky was burning 
With colors that have paled to black and white 
Yeah, your fire is gone Love only rides on hope so long 
Before there's work to be done Goodnight New Orleans 
I'm leaving Jackson Square behind 
No, I won't come around Love only rides on hope so long 
Before there's work to be done 
Time keeps on singing me her song 
I guess ours is gone
