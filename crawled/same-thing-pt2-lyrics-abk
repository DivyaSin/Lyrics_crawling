I'm as crazy as I wanna be, ain't no stopping me 
Buck wild, tearing up the streets in the D 
Just a native with some war paint actin a fool 
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too Smoking weed like it's free and the first to kill a 40 
Only one to shoot a pistol in the middle of a party 
Hanging on the block without a clue what to do 
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too I'm not sayin we no good just a little abnormal 
Underground is where we lay, the main stream is too formal 
I'm learning things they don't teach in the school 
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too [Chorus x2] 
If you do what I do (Yea) 
And I do what you do (Yea) 
Wouldn't that kinda make us all the same (Yea) Wait for the right time, patient like a snake 
Slither to your enemy then show his ass some hate 
This is just something that I like to do 
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too Always down with a BBQ, drinkin brew with the crew 
Up til the sun come, way past curfew 
Talking about things that I wanna pursue 
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too Never sit and argue, squash it with my tennis shoe 
Kung-fu a motherfuckas head into fondue 
That's how it is, and I'll never improve 
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too [Chorus x2] I prefer Yager bombs instead of Absolute 
But I'd rather have a blunt packed with purple or blue 
Red skin with the hatchet running looking confused 
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too Ever since I was a youth in pursuit to amuse 
Crassin(?) Avenue I cruise to promote my new 
I did everything I could to make my name break through 
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too I was showing up late cause I had to finish smoking 
You know how the weed have you in slow motion 
Thank god I'm not alone because it wouldn't be cool 
I'm so glad ya'll be doing the same things too (What time, um, I thought this was tony from the block 
Tonys' on after this rap) [Chorus x2] You do (yeah) 
I do (yeah) 
Wouldn't that kinda make us all the same? (yeah) (x2) 
You do

You do, come on put your hands up just like this 
You do

Yeah you old lady in the back, shake them hips grandma 
You do

Somebody in this bitch get me a drink. I'm thirsty 
You do

Yeah yeah thank you
