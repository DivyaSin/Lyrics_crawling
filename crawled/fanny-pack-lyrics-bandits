As we walkin to the mall 
people staring dropping jaws 
cant belive just what they saw 
two dudes with a fanny pack 
makin a phone call 
so i ask him why you frontin 
dont you see my star wars button 
he asked me what i got inside 
and so i pulled out omtomise prime 
what happened next he couldnt belive pokemon on DVD 
Then he called me a little girl 
i dont care im on top of the world (course) 
Cut me some slack 
and get off of my back

Strap it up
