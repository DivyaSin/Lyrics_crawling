I like to rumble, I love to fight 
I like to see somebody my side 
I like drinking, love to get stoned 
I live the fast way and won't get old Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll is my life 
My life, my own 
I'm a rock 'n' roll monster, 
National Nightmare 
Better watch out 'cause I'm on the run I love a good fuck, I love it rough 
I don't need love, oh god I'm tough 
I like music, I love it loud 
I like to be mena, just hear me shout Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll is my life 
My life, my own 
I'm a rock 'n' roll monster, 
National Nightmare 
Better watch out 'cause I'm on the run Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll is my life 
it's my life 
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll 
I said sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll is my life 
Rock 'n' roll monster! 
I'm the National Nightmare I'm a rock 'n' roll monster 
I'm the National Nightmare I'm a rock 'n' roll monster 
I'm the National Nightmare
