I believe that this world was made for everyone 
I can see all that wealth won't make a champion 
All that matters in my world (life) 
All that matters to me is you 
Only you, only you 
All that matters: only you 
I don't care what people say, what people do 
(Let 'em talk) 
I don't share that state of mind, that point of view 
(Let 'em sue) From the top of my head to the tip of my toes 
From the sole of my shoes through every stitch in my clothes 
Each beat of my heart, each molecule 
All that matters to me is you 
All that matters to me is you 
All that matters to me is you 
Believe me, it's true 
(You're all that matters) 
Now I wish you'd believe it too 
Only you, only you
