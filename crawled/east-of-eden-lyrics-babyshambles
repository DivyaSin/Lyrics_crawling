I've been wandering East of Eden 
Been lost, cold, lonesome as a sparrow in the rain 
I found myself tumbling to a sinking feeling 
When someone said I done gone wrong 
Couldn't feel no shame 
I'll be leaving town on the very next train 
You can wait for me little girl 
But I won't be coming this way again 
And it ain't nobody's business if I do There's a slow train rumbling east of a place called Eden 
Ah, the wind blowing in proud as the trees upon the plain 
And a stranger's voice talked to me of liberty and freedom 
Yeah, it seems like he done gone wrong again 
And he wears the hat like shame Well he tasted the fruit of another 
And when his Margie, when she discovered 
Said she's gonna love him ten times more 
Ain't nobody's business if she do He said "some men born rich, some men born poor 
But they're rich in other ways" 
Into my heart his wisdom poured It's no good crumblin', I'm making tracks to live 
When I laid my love down in the light 
You should've seen all the things my shadow did The filth and the fury, the fear and the pain 
It's all disappearing now 
Faster than the smoke from this old train 
And it ain't nobody's business if it do
