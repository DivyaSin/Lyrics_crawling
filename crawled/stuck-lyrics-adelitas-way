I gotta ask you to live 
I gotta ask you to piss 
I see, somethin's missing 
I guess they said it was love 
I guess I said that I'm done 
What's this, I've been feeling stuck 
And I feeling like I never 
Get to smell the sun 
Do you ever think to yourself? 
Maybe it's, I'm that stuck I don't like that I'm the only one that's slipping away 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) I don't wanna be the one who keeps on counting my days 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) I don't like that I can see my second's slippin' away 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) It sticks before you could know 
You ever saw what was wrong 
I see someone's listening 
I guess they said it was love 
I guess I said that I'm done 
Wise words and now I'm stuck 
And I'm feelin' like I never 
Get to smell outside 
And I'm feelin' like you never 
(Cause maybe it's , I'm that stuck) I don't like that I'm the only one that's slippin' away 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) I don't wanna be the one who keeps on counting my days 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) And I don't like that I can see my second's slippin' away 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) And I don't wanna be the one that always gets in the way 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's, I'm that stuck) 
I know It's I'm that stuck I don't like that I'm the only one that's slipping away 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) I don't wanna be the one who keeps on counting my days 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) And I don't like that I can see my second's slippin' away 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) And I don't wanna be the one that always gets in the way 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's, I'm that stuck) And I don't like that I can see my second's slippin' away 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) 
I don't wanna be the one who keeps on counting my days 
I'm stuck (Maybe it's I'm that stuck) 
I'm stuck
