Love like a burning fire 
Creeping up on you 
Watch as the flame grows higher 
Can you see it through? Don't you know the die is cast? 
Got to keep on running faster than time 
And you're riding high above 
Are you gonna lay your love on the line? Out where the light is burning 
There's a heart that's true 
Sounds of the night returning 
Put a spell on you Don't you know the die is cast? 
Got to keep on running faster than time 
And you're riding high above 
Are you gonna lay your love on the line?
