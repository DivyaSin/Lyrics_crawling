It's like a force 
walk to the doorway 
into the hall. In this facade 
dripping with paintings 
down the walls.. And only I can see it. 
No one else believes me. 
And only I can know it. 
Lost in my own moment. Fantastical eyes 
sugar and tea cups 
riddles and rhymes And they will find 
nobody's different 
only I. And only I can see it. 
No one else believes me. 
And only I can know it. 
Lost in my own moment. And only I can see it 
no one else believes me. 
And only I can know it 
lost in my own moment.
