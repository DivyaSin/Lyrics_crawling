Other side of love 
Other side of love 
There was another 
She took your trust and threw it away 
Leaving you lonely for too long, so long 
I know your've been broken hearted 
It cut so deep 
You never thought the hurting would end 
Just try to foget her 
Just be strong, hold on 
I'm here(I'm here) 
For you(for you) 
Gonna make you believe 
Yeah Chorus: 
This is the other side of love 
Babe I'll give you everything you've been dreaming of 
After all you've done for me 
No one told you 
There was another side of love 
God must have delivered a message from above 
The day you came to me 
We saw the other side of love Picture a summer day 
A gentle breeze to blow all your troubles away 
A picture os happiness that will stay, always(always) 
I'm here(I'm here) 
For you(for you) 
And always all be 
Yeah Chorus I happen to know the way you feel 
It's happened to me so many times 
But baby believe in me 
I swear this is the other side 
Other, otherside, other Chorus
