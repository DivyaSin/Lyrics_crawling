i see you walking down the street 
i dunno what to say 
you break my heart when you look away 
i know you can't help it you look so good 
but you cant get involved with a common street hood 
your friends make fun of me thats just my luck 
all i am to them's some low rent punk 
i see you coming & i start to shake 
yeah i've fallen for you and that's no mistake 
you're breaking my heart & you know its true 
i never thought i'd feel this blue 
cause i'll never stand next to you 
i see you walking with your new boyfriend 
i wanna kill him i cant pretend 
i see him walking with his arm aroung you 
yeah he's gonna die that much is true
