Steady woman won't you come on down? 
I need you right here on the ground 
I've walked the outskirts of this town 
Been terrorized by what I've found I saw a standing virgin bride 
Where holy Dionysus died 
She tore the heart out from his side 
And laid it there, and there she cried (Whoa's x4) She said, "Hello, I'm a monster too." 
"What poisons me is what poisons you." 
Into these animals we grew 
(But) When we were young our eyes were blue I take my medicine on my knee 
Twice a day but lately three 
Keeps the devil from my door 
And it makes me rich and it makes me poor I'm a beggar in the morning, 
I'm a king at night, 
My belt is loose, 
But my trigger is tight May come without warning, 
At the speed of the light 
Make it shine so pretty 
Make it shine so bright (Music Break) I think I've come a long, long way 
To stand before you here today 
They're yours alone, the songs I play, 
To take with you or throw away Whoa-o-o-o, Whoa-o-o-o-o-o-o, Whoa-o-o-o-o, Whoa-o-o-o, Whoa-o-o-o 
(Away forever or fade away) Oh, I want an angel to wipe my tears, 
Know my dreams, my hopes, desires and fears 
We may capsize, but we won't drown 
Hold each other as the sun goes down I'm a beggar in the morning, 
I'm a king at night, 
My belt is loose, and 
My trigger is tight May come without warning 
At the speed of the light- 
Make it shine so pretty, 
Make it shine so bright.
