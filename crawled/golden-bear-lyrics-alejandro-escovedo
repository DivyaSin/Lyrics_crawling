There's a creature in my body 
There's a creature in my blood 
Don't know how long he's been there 
Or why he's after us [Chorus: ] 
Oh why me (gold bear's running down) 
Oh why me (gold bear's running down) 
Oh why me (gold bear's running down) 
Oh why me (gold bear's running down) But I'm as stubborn as a tree trunk 
A screen door in the breeze 
And like a wildcat in the summertime 
The sun can't hide from me [Chorus: ] Last night as I lay dreaming 
Caught an endless wave 
My brothers battled out behind me 
And formed a circle round my grave [Chorus: ]
