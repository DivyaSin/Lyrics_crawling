A captive soul returns 
Limited to materialistic boundaries 
Repeating the process of learning 
As previous knowledge dissolved long ago Bewildered by totems in nature 
We quest universe reflection 
But when mind potentialities exhaust 
The answers remain untapped Homosapiens terrorize one another 
Conforming like drones 
Homosapiens, molesters of nature 
Homosapiens, parasites of the earth Concepts of existence astonish 
Reality resides within myself 
Significance is questionable
