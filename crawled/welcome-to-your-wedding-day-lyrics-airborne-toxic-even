Well it's another fine day of the nation building 
Well let's have a parade 
You can dance on the graves and the bones of the children 
If you know what to say 
And you know its begun from the beat of the drum 
And the screams from the mouths of babes 
And we pray as were watching the charade 
Welcome to your wedding day And it's a damn good day 
For the heart and the mind 
And the party is happening here 
If you'll advert your gaze form the word on the sign 
Let me wispier it in your ear 
'Cause the sign says run 
'Cause the sign says run 
'Cause the sign says run 
'Cause the sign says run 
'Cause the sign says run And you know its begun from the crack of the guns 
And the screams from the mouths of babes 
And we pray as we're watching the charade 
Welcome to your wedding day 
Welcome to your wedding And we want peace 
Yea we want peace 
And we don't negotiate with terror [Repeat x6] 
We don't negotiate with terror We only make or break 
And we know its begun from the crack of the guns 
And the screams form the mouths of babes 
And we pray as we're watching the charade 
Welcome to your wedding day 
Welcome to your wedding
