You'll never know just how much I miss you. 
You'll never know just how much I care. 
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you. 
You oughtta know, for haven't I told you so 
a million or more times? You went away and my heart went with you. 
I speak your name in my every prayer. 
If there is some other way to prove that I love you, 
I swear I don't know how. 
You'll never know if you don't know now.
