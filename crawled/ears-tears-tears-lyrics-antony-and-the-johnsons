I tried hard to make you want me 
But we're not supposed to be 
And the truth will always haunt me 
Even though it set me free 
And my tears flow like the ocean 
As they floated in the breeze 
They were falling in slow motion 
And they brought me to my knees Oh, you're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain 
Turn off the light and now all that remains 
Fills me with doubt 
And I'm shouting your name out loud 
Why do you wanna put me through the pain? 
I get the feeling I'll never escape 
I can't hide away from the shame of you Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow 
You won't bring me down 
And I'll get over you 
These tears will get me through 
And I'll get over you I'll, I'll, I'll get over you 
I'll, I'll, oh yeah 
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you 
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you When did you lose your emotion? 
When did you become so cruel? 
And if you want to cut me open 
Says a thousands words 'bout you 
And in time I know you'll leave me 
Like a distant memory 
I know love can be so easy 
If I start by loving me, oh You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain 
Turn off the light and now all that remains 
Fills me with doubt 
And I'm shouting your name out loud 
Why do you wanna put me through the pain? 
I get the feeling I'll never escape 
I can't hide away from the shame of you Oh, tears on the ground, tears on my pillow 
You won't bring me down 
And I'll get over you 
Oh yeah, woah, I'll get over you 
Woah, tears on the ground, rain at my window 
The pain washes out 
And I'll get over you 
These tears will get me through 
And I'll get over you I'll get over you 
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you 
I'll, I'll get over you 
I don't need you to call me tonight 
(I'll get over you) 
I don't need you to see me if I'm alright 
(I'll get over you) 
You left me, so leave me, I'm fine 
I'll be here getting on with my life Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow 
You won't bring me down, I'll get over you 
Rain at my window 
The pain washes out 
I'll get over you 
Woah, tears on the ground, rain at my window 
The pain washes out 
And I'll get over you 
Oh yeah, I'll get over you I'll get over 
I'll get over you
