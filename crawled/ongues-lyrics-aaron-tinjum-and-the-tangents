[First Verse] Go on 
Speak slowly in your own tongue 
And if I get the translation wrong 
Would you let me know? 
Or let me sound like a fool? [Chorus] [Second Verse] And I respond 
Speaking stuttered in my English tongue 
Hoping not to get my meaning wrong 
But for so long 
I've been tongue-tied 
When trying to talk to you [Chorus] [Bridge] And if I speak too slowly 
You'll probably let me know 
But if I get it right 
Tonight 
Well, okay [Third Verse] Later on 
We can tangle our foreign tongues 
To see if the friendship we spun 
Was just for fun 
Or if there could be something more 
Going on [Chorus]
