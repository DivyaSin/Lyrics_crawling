You've got this thundercloud around you, and I'm waiting for the storm. 
I've brought my boots, my coat, my umbrella, and I'm just tryin' to keep you warm. 
I've made a list of things I've always, but never meant. 
Let me take you to your bed, so I can erase them from your head. Get home faster, this is a disaster, I should know better than dress for the weather. 
Call me crazy, I think you're amazing, this is the part where we get a little closer. Casey, I know you think that I'm rarely worth your time, but baby, would you be willing to change your mind? 
And I pick myself up, and dust myself off before I get a chance to speak. 
If you have the time, just give me a chance, I'd love to change your mind about me. Get home faster, this is a disaster, I should know better than dress for the weather. 
Call me crazy, I think you're amazing, this is the part where we get a little closer now. 
Get home faster, this is a disaster, I should know better than dress for the weather. 
Call me crazy, I think you're amazing, this is the part where we get a little closer now. Get home faster, this is a disaster, i should know better than dress... 
Call me crazy, I think you're amazing, this is the part where we get a little closer now. 
Get home faster, this is a disaster, I should know better than dress for the weather. 
Call me crazy, I think you're amazing, this is the part where we get a little closer. You've got this thundercloud around you, and I'm waiting for the storm.
