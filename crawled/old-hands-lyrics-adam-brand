He's an old hand at fixing cars and bailing hay 
And there's nothing he can't do on that old farm 
He's tougher than leather for a man his age 
But he's 21 when she's lying in his arms She's and old hand at baking bread and washing clothes 
And rocking little babies to sleep 
But the calloused hands are softer than the morning rose 
And she always seems to know just what he needs When old hands hold hands 
With just a touch they understand 
Life and love and making plans 
'Cause they're old hands They've pulled a load together down a long hard road 
And they both know that their journey will end 
But they won't be afraid when it's their time to go 
'Cause chances are they'll just go hand in hand
