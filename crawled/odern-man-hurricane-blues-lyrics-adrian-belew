When I was a boy 
Simple times, simple joy 
And life was not full of hate and chaos 
A modern man 
Lives in some kind of hurricane 
I need your love to keep me calm 
When the world is a storm Hell fire man desire 
Downtown scream siren 
Ghetto gun drug lord 
Kill children stillborn 
Asphalt flesh bone 
Trash bag alley bomb Hey, hey, it's a sin 
About the shape the world is in 
Hey, hey, it's a shame 
Modern man hurricane Earth dump suck soil 
Sewer spit sea oil 
Toxic ocean chemical fish 
Man made death wish Hey, hey, it's a shame 
Modern man hurricane I need your love to keep me calm 
When the world's a storm
