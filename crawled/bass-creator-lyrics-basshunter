And every once in your life 
And every once in your life "I'm your Bass creator!" The moment I saw you I was in a trance 
And the feeling inside was more than I could bare 
Baby its not right if there's no promise land 
Because the meter is on and I'm already there 
Yeah And every once in your life 
And every once in your life And every once in your life 
You will feel 
Once true moment wo-ho 
So baby open your eyes 
And feel it, feel it 
And every once in your life 
You will feel 
It coming over wo-ho 
So baby open you eyes 
And feel it, feel it "Woah, I'm your base creator" And every once in your life "I'm your Base creator" Ah, ah, ah "Woah, I'm your base creator" And every once in your life 
You will feel 
Once true moment wo-ho 
So baby open your eyes 
And feel it, feel it 
And every once in your life 
You will feel 
It coming over wo-ho 
So baby open you eyes 
And feel it, feel it
