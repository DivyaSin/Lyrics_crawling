Get money addict 
I'mma get "money" tatted 
Money in the attics 
Money in the stashes Money in the cabinets 
Stuffed in the mattress 
Safe full of guns 
More money up in that shit Taz Arnold TI$A 
Jeremy Scott Adidas 
Maison Martin Margiella 
Three strap sneakers Riding with a feature 
Student and a teacher 
It's money over bitches 
No room for a skeezer Thinking of a Lambo 
Bathing Ape camo 
Play with the money 
Turn Rocky into Rambo Patience is a virtue 
Life is a handful 
Friends, they'll hurt you 
Learned that from my grandfolks Me under a lamp post 
While I got my hands closed 
Haze to my brains 
Like eggs, got it scrambled Yeah I feel Rihanna 
And I understand Hov 
What you think I rap for? 
To push a fucking Land Rove? Now I'm looking back 
When you said I shouldn't rap 
Some slept on me 
Other niggas took a nap Now I'm in the basement 
Probably cooking crack 
Gave you teaspoons full 
But instead, you took a cap They say Tyga and Diggy 
But Rocky been Jiggy 
Currency from The Wiz 
Ain't enough to get me home Can't really hate 
When they compare me to Drake 
Could have been J.Cole 
If I met J-Hov Who dat? 
ASAP, But I'm fly like I never left 
You's a lie, like fly without the letter F If hip hop is dead 
Fuck it, let it rest 
Reincarnated through me 
When she resurrect Long hair, Blue jeans 
Live on U-Stream 
High top boots 
Like Pac in a Juice scene No it ain't a movie 
Diamonds in by new gleam 
Dead tone 
Cuz the redbones is my new thing Nigga, I do things 
Let the coupe sing 
Niggas say I'm insane 
Saddam Hussein Niggas still jokers 
Me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne 
Fly kicks, my shit 
Yeah I'm on that Liu Kang I ain't bragging when I do this 
My shoes is Bermudas 
I'm bougie in that Gucci 
But my nudies is my newest 
And your foolishness and rumors 
I give two shits 
I only hear the money 
Save the bullshit for the Q-Tips Swag is the coolest 
My bitch is the rudest 
My jeweler is Jewish 
And my wrist is the bluest And I get it poppin on the block 
Like who kid 
ASAP standing on the block 
Like the new kids
