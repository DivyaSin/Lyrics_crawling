Look at this face, 
I know the years are showing, 
Look at this life, 
I still don't know where it's going. Chorus: 
I don't know much, 
But I know I love you, 
And that may be all I need to know. Look at these eyes, 
They've never see what matter, 
Look at these dreams, 
So beaten and so battered. Chorus: 
I don't know much, 
But I know I love you, 
And that may be all I need to know. So many questions still left unanswered, 
So much I've never broken through, 
And when I feel you near me, 
Sometimes I see so clearly, 
The only truth I've ever known, 
Is me and you. Look at this man, 
So blessed with inspiration, 
Look at this soul, 
Still searching for salvation. Chorus x3: 
I don't know much, 
But I know I love you, 
And that may be all I need to know.
