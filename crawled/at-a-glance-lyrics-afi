No haven now as I watch it pour from everywhere 
Just like the storm that has come out of thin air 
Gentle caresses, just as paper thin, frail 
And only lack the strength to hold What if I could go to sleep for days 
Would you count the hours 
Or would your restlessness consume 
Fading memories of me? Fall into open arms that offer their protection 
Quick to deny that their open to deceit 
Long to believe, support will never cease 
Bitter and lonely, those they've left before What if I could go to sleep for days 
Would you count the hours 
Or would your restlessness consume 
Fading memories of me? The vibrant heart so quickly growing old 
The warmest eyes so quickly growing cold 
Just a glance for they don't care to see 
What becomes of me The vibrant heart so quickly growing old 
The warmest eyes so quickly growing cold 
Just a glance for they don't care to see 
What becomes of me 
What becomes of me 
What becomes of me What if I could go to sleep for days 
Would you count the hours 
Or would your restlessness consume What if I could go to sleep for days 
Would you count the hours 
Or would your restlessness consume 
Fading memories of me?
