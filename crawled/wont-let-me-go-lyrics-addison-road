Welcome to my latest disaster 
Same book just another chapter 
I never though it could be worse then last year 
But here I am again today 
I laugh 'cause it hurts when i scream 
But I'll make it through 'cause I believe Chorus: 
That even when my heart breaks 
And everything's shaken 
I'm left alone in the rain 
You won't, you won't, won't 
You won't let me go 
When life's insane 
And everything's crazy 
You carry me through the pain 
And you won't, you won't, won't 
You won't let me go Here we go it's a three-ring circus 
Juggling it all, trying to find my purpose 
With each new day, I'm praying just to make it through 
When my next disaster is near 
I know that you'll meet me right here Chorus: 
That even when my heart breaks 
And everything's shaken 
I'm left alone in the rain 
You won't, you won't, won't 
You won't let me go 
When life's insane 
And everything's crazy 
You carry me through the pain 
And you won't, you won't, won't 
You won't let me go I feel your love that surrounds me 
My world can shake but it won't drown me 
'Cause I'm trusting you 
No matter what I'm going through Chorus: 
That even when my heart breaks 
And everything's shaken 
I'm left alone in the rain 
You won't, you won't, won't 
You won't let me go 
When life's insane 
And everything's crazy 
You carry me through the pain 
And you won't, you won't, won't 
You won't let me go
