I got your phone number, baby 
I'll call you sometime 
I think I might, be out tonight 
Maybe give you a ride 
Cocktails for two, down lover's lane 
I want cha so bad, after tonight 
I'll never walk the same 
And you're to blame 
I want to get cha high 
I want to get next to you 
I want to feel everything about cha, girl 
I want to feel good 
You make me feel good 
Baby, you don't know 
Just how I lie awake 
And dream awhile, about your smile 
And the way you make yo ass shake 
If that ain't love 
I guess I'll never know 
A sweeter lie, you'd be surprised 
Just how far I'd go 
To make it so
