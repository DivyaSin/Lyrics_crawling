Show us, father. 
make the stars fall for us. 
Show us father. 
we'll follow you. Time's running out, and we've been gone for a long time. 
we need a sign, bring in the cure. 
lost in open water,this is a war, and we can't deny. 
just take our hands and follow. Ride the ship, but don't let it sink, I promise, it's not as hard as you may think. 
jump on board,(jump on board) but don't let it fall (but don't let it fall), you can take us to the other side of the wall. We've been caught in between, the venom infected our homes. 
these creatures deserves a better place. this walk can be the last. 
In search for answers,we will find the conclusion. 
the storm will make them bleed. 
it will make em' believe. 
so pull yourself together 
what we'll do tomorrow is what we'll do forever 
and this will be the last time. Show us, father. 
make the stars fall for us. 
Show us father. 
we'll follow you. i will follow you, i will follow you.
