A sickening display 
A scar for every line 
The beauty and the pain 
Of total agony These lacerations 
The stench of slow decay 
It desecrates 
Making beautiful profane A tragedy 
The suffering of loss 
That separates 
A fragile soul from its remains Lay down and you'll suffer 
Would you die for your affliction? 
Held down, now you suffer! 
Would you kill for what destroys you They pick at the remains 
The dead in perfect lines 
The beauty in the pain 
Of total agony These lacerations 
The stench of slow decay 
It desecrates 
Making beautiful profane A tragedy 
The suffering of loss 
It separates 
A fragile soul from its remains [Chorus] In darkness, I close my eyes 
A prayer to ease the pain 
In silence I realize 
The darkness will always..
