Looking into me 
Too many different choices 
Too many different voices 
Telling me what to do Feeling find again 
So many words and faces 
So many sounds and noises 
Where do they lead 
Where do they lead 
Where do they lead Before the summertime 
I'm gonna clear my mind 
I'm feeling fine Before the summertime 
I'm gonna clear my mind 
I'm feeling fine Before the summertime Hiding 
Inside of me 
Your sleeping, growing waiting 
Alive and real Listen 
Your whisper softly speaking love everywhere Knocking opendoor 
Illusions fade to clear Before the summertime 
I'm gonna clear my mind 
I'm feeling fine Before the summertime 
I'm gonna clear my mind 
I'm feeling fine Before the summertime Before the summertime 
I'm gonna clear my mind 
I'm feeling fine Before the summertime Before the summertime 
I'm gonna clear my mind 
I'm feeling fine Before the summertime 
Before the summertime
