I watched you change and never 
That you would be like all the rest 
You were so true to good to be true 
I trusted you and feel apart again I can not change the fact 
That your not coming back 
So depressed I'm your slave Betrayed me your not the one 
To be trusted with my love 
Betrayed me your not the one 
Who should be trusted with my love I had to leave so I could breath 
I hate to fight that's not what I want 
You were so true to good to be true 
I trusted you and feel apart again
