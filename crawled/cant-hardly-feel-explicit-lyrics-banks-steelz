What happened to us? 
What's going on? 
What happened to us? 
Where did we go wrong? 
Where did we go wrong? 
Where did we go wrong? I can't hardly feel your love 
It all just seems so real 
I could be dreaming through my gold eyes 
The cypher's incomplete, undone 
If everything is real 
I could be speeding to a cold sore Have you ever had this feeling once in your life 
In which you like a girl so much 
You wish that she was your wife 
But 
She's not your girl, she's barely a friend 
Just someone you see every now and then 
Although seemed impossible my heart has been touched 
By this girl who I desperately want in my clutch 
As time goes on, I got to know her 
And the love that I had inside, I had to show her 
She had a man but we had brunches together 
The waitress had a hunch that we wanted each other 
And yo, she was right 
By the end of the night, we satisfied each other's appetite 
Like wow I can't hardly speak 
My love 
You truly are unique 
I should have seen you to the goodtimes Caramel complexion 
We had a strong connection 
But somewhere we went the wrong direction 
On long walks I would stop to listen 
To the sound of the city local street musicians 
She lost interest, cut me off in mid-sentence 
The rain storm grew to a tempest 
The light at the end of the tunnel was a train 
Shock at the end of the rumble, wasn't pain 
We stumbled, but who could we blame? 
The oxycontin, weed, alcohol or cocaine 
We pushed out limits in the streets of Venice 
Passage for lovers, we only stayed a minute, wow I can't hardly feel you love 
But every time we meet it will be deep of course 
What happened to us? 
What's going on? 
What happened to us? 
Where did we go wrong? 
Where did we go wrong? 
Where did we go wrong? Eight years later 
In a hotel lobby 
I'm multi-platinum, everybody loving Bobby 
And I saw her 
Still had some feelings for her 
She looked lonely and lost 
I heard her man divorced her 
I took her upstairs to my room and I tossed her 
Took her upstairs to my room and I tossed her 
And all my past desires had lust reforged 
But when I looked into her eyes she lost her aura 
Shh wow These are not the same girls 
Can you imagine 
They're not the same 
That wanting is better than having 
These are not the same girls 
Psst its crazy 
It's not the same (its not the same) I can't hardly feel 
I can't feel you no more (your love) 
I can't hardly feel your love 
It truly was unique 
I should have seen it through the first time 
I can't feel you 
I can't feel you no more 
I can't feel you 
I can't feel you no more
