Your spoken words are deadly 
Theyre so dangerously naughty 
Your eyes, Your lips, Your touch 
You want it easy like Im nobody Now my sexiness is killing 
Papi, you better get ready 
My cockiness is stealing 
You just wanna shake that body You think its easy 
to get me 
Wont be necessary 
Tryna impress me.. 
Chorus: 
Now baby boy listen to me, boy show me 
How youre gonna get me paralyzed 
This is me now tell me 
When youre gonna get me paralyzed 
This is me, boy get me 
How youre gonna get me paralyzed 
Imma let you slide Cuz I wont lie 
I want you to get me paralyzed 
How youre gonna get me paralyzed 
When youre gonna get me paralyzed 
How youre gonna get me paralyzed 
Are you gonna get me paralyzed If I don't have you, 
I don't want nobody baby 
If I don't have you 
hey.. hey.. hey! 
You think its easy 
to get me 
Wont be necessary 
Tryna impress me..
