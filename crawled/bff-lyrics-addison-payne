a special few of friendship 
we seem to have no choice, 
for each has made an impact 
memory will live with us for forever 
These people we call friends. 
You, to me, are such a one. 
friendship like tree 
sends its roots down deep 
so when the storms of life abound 
and the winds of adversity blow, 
it shakes and bends 
and goes with the flow 
but doesn't break or fall 
every minute spent angry is sixty seconds of happiness wasted. 
we want live forever young 
b'cuz we are young 
Every story LOVE starts with a SMILE , 
grows with a KISS 
, and ends with a TEAR. 
so let stay A BEST FRIEND 
is like a four leaf clover 
, HARD TO FIND Good FRIENDS are hard to find, 
harder to leave, 
and impossible to forget.
