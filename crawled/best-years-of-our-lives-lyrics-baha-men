I get such a thrill 
When you look in my eyes 
My heart skips a beat, girl 
I feel so alive 
Please tell me baby 
If all this is true 
Cause deep down inside 
All I wanted was you Oh, makes me want to dance 
Oh, it's a new romance 
Oh, I look into your eyes 
Oh, best years of our lives! When we first met 
I could hardly believe 
The things that would happen 
That we could achieve 
So let's be together 
For all of our time 
We'll go out so thankful 
That you are still mine Oh, makes me want to dance 
Oh, it's a new romance 
Oh, I look into your eyes 
Oh, best years of our lives! My world's a better place 
Cause I know you're mine 
This love is so real 
And it's no surprise Come on and say yeah! 
I got a song 
Yeah! 
Cause through the years 
I'll be right by your side Oh, makes me want to dance 
Oh, it's a new romance 
Oh, I look into your eyes 
Oh, best years of our lives! See, you always consider me 
Like a ogre, nothing 
And treat me 
Like a Notre Dame 
I says why 
I helped you keep my shine on 
A perky little something 
To keep my mind on 
Cause you had my mind gone Ah, ah, ah 
Turn the lights on 
Come on baby 
Let's just rewind the song 
Cause all I want to do is make 
The rest years the best years 
All night long Oh, makes me want to dance 
Oh, it's a new romance 
Oh, I look into your eyes 
Oh, best years of our lives! Oh, makes me want to dance 
Oh, it's a new romance 
Oh, I look into your eyes 
Oh, best years of our lives!
