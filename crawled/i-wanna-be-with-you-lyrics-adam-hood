Put down the cigarettes 
Don't take those sleepin' pills 
Stay up and talk to me 
Cause I wanna be with you Nobody's callin me 
There's nowhere to be tonight 
So come in and lock the door 
Cause I wanna be with you Love's never easy 
And I know I'm hard on you 
I think you realize you're hard on me too So when the going's tough 
We can't put our weapons down 
Cause this love's strong enough to stay around 
They can't tear this fortress down These people talk too much 
And I'm a conversation piece 
We can't let 'em split us up 
Cause I wanna be with you And I'm not a pay check 
And you're more than trailer trash 
And a power too big for us 
Has kept me here with you Love's never easy 
And I know I'm hard on you 
And I think you realize you're hard on me too So when the going's tough 
We can't put our weapons down 
Cause this love is strong enough to stay around 
They can't tear this fortress down You know that talk is cheap 
I speak my heart in melody 
And I'll use this song to say 
That I want to be with you
