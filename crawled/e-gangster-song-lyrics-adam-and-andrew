i'm a gangster. i'm straight up. 
i'm a gangster, i'm a straight up G. the gangster life is the life for me. shooting people by day, selling drugs by night, being a ganster is hella tihgt. i walk around town with a stark erection, and gave your mom, a yeast infection. i saw the policeman and i punched him in the eye. to serve & protect, what a lie! 
i also dont like white people, you shouldn't, too. and dont get me started, about the jews. i'm a gangster, grr i'm mad. i'm a gangster, my rhymes are bad. i'm a gangster, i'm iced out like a freezer, i'm a gangster, i dont listen to weezer. 
i dropped out of school at the age of 3 
*why?* 
cuz all the teachers tried to player hate on me. my rhymes are cool, just like doing cocaine. my rhymes are hot, like a burning flame 
cisco is my homie, he's a gangster, too. me and cisco are the leaders of the gangster crew. i like to be in jail and he likes to sing and dance. some say we're the perfect match. 
*step off! step back! step awaay! step back!* 
i also wanna- 
*don't step forward, step BACK! step back!dont step forwards,step backwards! backwards! don't step to me! do not step to MEEEEEEE!* 
i'm givin a shout out to my homies in cell block 8. being in jail sucks because you always have to masturbate. except when a jewish person goes to jail, all my homies cheer. they will make mincemeat out of his rear. ben petty helped me make the gangster beat to this song. i shot him in the face cuz he looked at me wrong. 
i'm a gangster, i drop bombs like hiroshima, i'm a gangster, bitch suck on my weiner, i'm a gangster, i drive a cool car, i'm a gangster, i smoke weed in a cigar. yo. my gangster flow. yo. yo yo yo. 
i'm rolling on dubs, like ice hockey. i got kicked out of japan for drinking all the saki.f*** a b*****, gimme head, ho. whats up to my dogs? yo yo yo. they play this song on the radio all day long, so everyone can hear my gangster song. 
no body thought i'd blow up like a winter snow tire.oh there's no beat left!
