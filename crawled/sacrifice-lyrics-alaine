OK ready For you (I swear) 
For you (I will) [Chorus] 
For you I will sacrifice for all of my life 
You and me will be together 
For better or for worse 
I vow through ups and downs 
Here and now until forever 
I'll sacrifice Baby, you and me 
Made it through so much 
So many storms have come and 
Still we're holding on 
And I would be a fool to find your love 
And then just let it go 
It's me and you and you already know that [Chorus] You're sure that you love me unconditionally 
Do whatever, you'll stay by my side 
You're the one I trust with all my secrets 
All my hidden fears 
I run to you and you are always there [Chorus] Sacrifice my love, my life 
Baby, I know I will adore 
I know but see into you 
To you, to love, I'll hold on tight 
No matter what may come my way 
I'll do whatever it takes [Chorus x2]
