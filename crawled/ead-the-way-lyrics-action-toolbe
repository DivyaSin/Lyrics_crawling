Coat tails, are dragging all around 
Ride them, straight into the ground 
With a bottle in your hand, you can do anything but stand, and deliver too 
You won't see this thru Uptown, has never been so low 
Shot down, with no place left to go 
I can't get this lit, Will I get fired before I quit, on all of you 
Never seem to choose Wait.....I can't seem to catch a break 
Won't you help me play this game 
Cause I just dropped the ball again 
Now I can't hear what I want to say 
Cause these sirens come in spades 
Crashing thru the view that lights the room 
And drives us all insane Then you say the last place that I look's the first place you'll stay 
You'd sell your broken heart to make sure 
I'd pay for all that I've done wrong 
I'll let you lead the way 
It's easier to pass along the blame Wait.....I can't seem to catch a break 
Won't you help me play this game 
Cause I just dropped the ball again 
Now I can't hear what I want to say 
Cause these sirens come in spades 
Crashing thru the view that lights the room 
And drives us all insane You want it, still want it 
You can't wait to pawn it 
You want it, still want it 
Can't wait to throw it all away
