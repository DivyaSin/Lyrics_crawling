You ask me if I love you and I choke on my reply 
Oh, I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie 
But who am I to judge you on what you say or do? 
I'm only just beginning to see the real you, oh But sometimes when we touch, the honesty's too much 
And I have to close my eyes and hide 
I wanna hold you till I die, till we both break down and cry 
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides Romance and all of its strategy leaves me battling with my pride 
But through the insecurities some tenderness survives 
But I'm just another singer still trapped within my truth 
I'm a hesitant prize fighter still trapped within my youth But oh, sometimes when we touch, oh, the honesty's too much 
Oh, and I, I've to close my eyes and hide 
I wanna hold you till I die until we both break down and cry 
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides Oh, I wanna hold you till I die until we both break down and cry 
And I have to close my eyes and hide 
Oh, I wanna hold you till I die, till we both break down and cry 
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides Oh, sing the song Hold you till I die, both break down and cry 
Oh, and I, I have to close my eyes and hide 
Oh, I wanna hold you till I die, till we both break down and cry 
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides, ooh, ooh, oh, oh Oh, I wanna hold you till, till I die, till we both break down and cry 
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
