Crazy 
The crazy things I heard you say Im mad about you all the same 
I never really saw the crime Yet went ahead and served my time 
I never met someone like you before But sometimes that is not enough 
Cuz I cant help just feeling I must be crazy for leaving you Must be crazy for feeling blue 
But my heart lately has been untrue I must be crazy, crazy for leaving you 
I will regret this chosen mind I never wanna see you cry 
I care about u endlessly u deserve a deeper love than me 
I dont know if Ill make it on my own But I tried so hard to let it go 
And I cant hide this feeling And I know that I will miss you like a fool But theres something in my life 
And I cant hide this feeling I must be crazy for leaving you 
Must be crazy for feeling blue But my heart lately has been untrue 
I must be crazy, crazy, crazy for leaving you
