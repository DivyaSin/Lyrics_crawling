As fast as a river 
As deep as an ocean roar 
As big as a mountain 
Full of emotion I don't want to be strong anymore 
I just want to lay here on the floor 
Don't want to have to be brave all the time 
I just need to rest for a while Won't you take care of me 
Could you hold me up? I keep falling 
Won't you take care of me? 
Could you dust me off I've been crawling Can you feel it? 
It's life, yeah 
Can you feel it? 
That's right I can feel me falling into the sky 
I'm blowing away in the wind 
But we won't ever have to say goodbye 
I'm just leaving this life that I'm in Everything keeps opening 
All these endings and beginnings 
Make it stop I don't want to be strong anymore 
I just want to lay here on the floor 
Don't want to have to be brave all the time 
I just need to rest for a while Won't you take care of me? 
Could you hold me up I keep falling 
Won't you take care of me? 
Could you dust me off I've been crawling I can feel me falling into the sky 
I'm blowing away in the wind 
We won't ever have to say goodbye 
I'm just leaving this life that I'm in Can you feel it? 
It's life 
Can you feel it? 
It's life 
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
It's life 
Can you feel it? 
It's life 
Can you feel?
