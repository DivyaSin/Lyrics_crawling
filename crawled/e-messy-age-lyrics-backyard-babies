I've been too crazy I don't feel that good 
Just breaking things around the neighbourhood 
Some people say you're walking on really thin ice 
But I don't care cause I ain't that nice 
Throw away the garbage and clean up my act 
Every inch is fucked that's a matter of fact 
Evereybody think that you will leave her and betray 
So what's the point of splashing you can go the whole way How could I be so wrong 
How could I be so damn wrong 
Every minute I'm in it 
Always been a bit too strong 
How could I be so wrong Tried too pay my shrink with another drink 
Ice-cubes bigger than a hockey-rink 
Every now and then we get together and there's peace 
The smaller currency's the more we're hurting these 
Dropped out of school I don't wanna stay 
Everyday I dreamt about the holiday 
I'm gonna go now and leave it all 
No arms no legs no cookies can someone please catch my fall How could I be so wrong 
How could I be so damn wrong 
Every minute I'm in it 
Always been a bit too strong x2 I'm tired of bein' an unemployed millionaire 
I'm sick of bein' a Swedish tourist-souvenir 
I'm sick of this 
I'm bored with that 
I'm happy with 
Nah I won't tell you that 
Do live the life 
Do pay the price 
Do not follow my advice How could I be so wrong 
How could I be so damn wrong 
Every minute I'm in it 
Always been a bit too strong x3
