Tell me something I don't know 
About discretion 
Manic deception 
Oh hari kari here we go 
I don't know 
No, I don't know 
How to let it go 
To where the wind blows No fighting, no hiding 
The hurricane we're riding 
No fighting, no hiding 
We can't say either way 
The piper has been paid 
We can't say why we must pay 
For death on Friday Tell me something I don't know 
About salvation 
Annihilation 
Oh hari kari here we go 
I don't know 
No, I don't know 
How to let it go 
Oh hari kari here we go
