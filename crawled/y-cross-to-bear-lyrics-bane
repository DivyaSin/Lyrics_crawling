THERE ARE NO WORDS NOTHING CAN EVER BE SAID TO MAKE SENSE OF THE EXIT THAT YOU 
MADE OR THIS SADNESS FORCED ON OUR LAP LEFT US STUCK WITH THESE HAUNTING 
QUESTIONS WHERE ARE ALL THE BEAUTIFUL ANSWERS WHERE IS THE BUTTON TO PUSH THAT 
TAKES IT ALL BACKI SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE CROSSED BURNING BRIDGES TO MEET YOU 
WHERE WAS I WHEN YOU RAN OUT OF WALLS TO PUNCH AND I KNOW THAT YOU WOULDN'T 
WANT US TO BLAME OURSELVES OR ANYTHING BUT THE WORLD AND THAT YOUR ACTIONS WELL 
THEY WERE NEVER TENDER BUT STILL NOTHING PREVAILS LIKE THE EMPTINESS OF A WORLD 
FOREVER WITHOUT YOU I CAN STILL SEE THE WAY THAT YOUR TEETH SHOWED WHEN YOU 
SMILED HEAR THE SOUND OF YOUR GUITAR I THINK OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE 
GIVEN YOU THE STRENGTH TO GO ON WITH THE HORROR OF OUR LAST WORDS STILL RINGING 
IN MY EARS ANYTHING WE WOULD'VE DONE ANYTHING TO KEEP YOU AROUND SOMETIMES YOU 
JUST CAN'T HOLD THE MADNESS AT BAY ALONE WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE BEFORE NO ONE 
MAKES IT HERE ALONE
