lay down your head 
it's not as bad as it seems to be 
come to my bed 
hand over all of your grief to me 
and scream so sweetly as you're losing all your ground 
and fall so neatly as it all comes crashing down feel it wash away 
save it for another day 
don't just let yourself fall 
feel it wash away 
don't give in 'til one more day 
nobody can tell you what's wrong now hold your breath 
whisper your secret dreams to me 
clutch it to your chest 
forget your fears and just let it be 
and fight so fiercely as you find your piece of mind 
and come so quickly as you leave it all behind feel it wash away 
save it for another day 
don't just let yourself fall 
feel it wash away 
don't give in 'til one more day 
nobody can tell you what's wrong
