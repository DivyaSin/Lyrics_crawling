Verse: 
With everything in our lungs 
We sing out Your praises 
Lift them with our voices 
You alone are God We hear Your people 
Reaching out, we need You 
We lift our hands in praise 
You alone are God When this life gets hard 
We reach out to You Chorus: 
With all that we are 
We're screaming out 
You alone are God 
You're hope of the world 
The risen one 
You alone are God
