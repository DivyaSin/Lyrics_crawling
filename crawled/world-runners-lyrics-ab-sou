These days I'm so focused 
Fast life, slow motion 
These, these days I'm so focused 
These days I'm so focused 
Fast life, slow motion Or maybe I'm just a dreamer 
And life is but a dream 
And I would never leave her 
But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me 
And I be all night, no sleep, real talk go hard until the AM 
You can have my shine, I give you my light opportunities you take them 
And you can take your time on your own time I be at the finish line waiting 
'Cause some people chase the world other people let the world chase them, yo We run, we run, we run the world (Get high)(Yeah) Yeah, can you hear it? 
I spread love, can you feel it in your spirit? 
When doves cry shit get serious 
You feel like a prince in a pharaoh's pyramid 
Scheme turned dream turned nightmare on Elm Street 
Ye ain't got your heart in the right place 
How the hell you plan to stay on beat, on beat? 
Yeah, I put that on me 
I got a gun and a good book, leave all your homies holy, moly 
Black sheep, no miss Bo Peep 
Motherfuck police 'til they release all of my OG's 
You could lean on me 'til you Morgan Free 
You don't need no sleep Or maybe I'm just a dreamer 
And life is but a dream 
And I would never leave her 
But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me 
And I be all night, no sleep, real talk go hard until the AM 
You can have my shine, I give you my light opportunities you take them 
And you can take your time on your own time I be at the finish line waiting 
'Cause some people chase the world other people let the world chase them, yo We run, we run, we run the world (Get high)(Yeah) Can't spell Illuminati without Lu can't spell Lu without you 
Can't spill blood without blue now ask yourself what is what I do 
Let you put that together without glue without stue, fast life 
Built a time machine in my past like 
A horror story about as long as Fukushima half-life 
And mostly I'll be ghost, and to talk about it have to rhyme into a flashlight 
Now that's a long way from blackface track that they using for your rat race 
Connected to a cat face, you can ask them pussies how a lap taste 
Maybe like cookies to a monster 
Run a mouse to the miles of meows, call me now Full speed ahead, full speed ahead 
To allow no limits, there are no limits 
No limits allowed, no limits exist There are no limits Or maybe I'm just a dreamer 
And life is but a dream 
And I would never leave her 
But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me 
And I be all night, no sleep, real talk go hard until the AM 
You can have my shine, I give you my light opportunities you take them 
And you can take your time on your own time I be at the finish line waiting 
'Cause some people chase the world other people let the world chase them, yo We run, we run, we run the world (Get high) (Yeah) Go, go, uh 
Yeah, no roof on the jeep with a big old chain 
Niggas left for the sniff and came back for the base 
You could tell he was tripping by the look on his face 
No new jacks in my city 
Aye, I'm feeling like G money, money, money 
Yeah, uh, I'm feeling like G money, money, money 
Yeah, no new jacks in my city 
Bitch, I'm G money, money, money
