Swing through sadness, tears of joy 
Curse the sunlight, arsenic for the girls and boys 
Drink the madness, smoke so coy 
Smile injection, serum of a will destroyed 
Serum of a will, serum of a will destroyed The seasons change, change without me 
I remain in shadows growing wings 
The spirit song still surrounds me, in refrain 
In shadows growing wings Swing through sadness, tears of joy 
Curse the sunlight, arsenic for the girls and boys 
Drink the madness, smoke so coy 
Smile injection, serum of a will destroyed 
Serum of a will, serum of a will destroyed The seasons change, change without me 
I remain in shadows growing wings 
The spirit song still surrounds me, in refrain 
In shadows growing wings Like an angel with two broken wings 
Reach to the sky again 
Like a Devil, meant for better things 
I will find my place on high The seasons change, change without me 
I remain in shadows growing wings 
The spirit song still surrounds me, in refrain 
In shadows growing wings
