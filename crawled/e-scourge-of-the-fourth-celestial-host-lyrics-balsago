They possess power unparalleled 
Ageless, remorseless, without pity or conscience 
Manipulators of evolution on countless worlds 
Gods of the stars, the Celestial Host Zenn-la 
I beseech thee, great ones 
Spare this insignificant planet, this earth 
Humankind, behold your creators 
Behold your destroyers Arishem, Exitar, judge and executioner They who sow the fields of the stars 
They return to reap the evolution harvest Arishem, Exitar, judge and executioner Time, space, soul, mind, reality, power I am the last scion of Zenn-La 
Never more to embrace Shalla-Bal 
I was born to soar beyond the stars And lo, the Exterminator 
The Destroyer of Worlds 
The Purifier of Galaxies The edge of oblivion beckons I am the protector of this world, I wield the Power Cosmic Arishem, Exitar, judge and executioner I shall scatter your atoms to the four cosmic winds Time, space, soul, mind, reality, power Hail Arishem, hail Exitar 
The Star-Gods have returned The vast sea of stars stretches into infinity before me I am the last scion of Zenn-la 
Never more to embrace Shalla-Bal 
I was born to soar beyond the stars [Incomprehensible]
