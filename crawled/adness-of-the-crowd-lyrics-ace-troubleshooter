Here I go against the grain 
It's time to yet again complain 
And make some noise 
Make some noise We've got all our sciences 
Making our appliances 
To dull the pain 
It's Novocain for the soul, for the soul Hollywood, pop culture's best 
Do no good, you vultures nest 
And I want out 
I want out It's gambling now, the more you wait 
And think that you can have your Kate 
And Edith, too 
And so to lose your own soul, your own soul I'll call your bluff, I've had enough 
Oh no, ho-jo So is it fantasy or is it reality TV? 
So here's your world condoned 
You get the chisel, I'll get the stone Know that with each path we take 
We become the choices that we make 
It's true and so do you Forbear to keep obstinate will 
And to choose to wait 
Until the dream dissolves 
And we're absolved from our guilt 
From our guilt I'll call your bluff, I've had enough 
I'll call your bluff, I've had enough 
I'll call your bluff, I've had enough 
I'll call your bluff, I've had enough 
Oh no, ho-jo So is it fantasy or is it reality TV? 
So here's your world condoned 
You get the chisel, I'll get the stone So numbed, to fate resigned 
And in your grave you'll lie 
And in your grave you'll lie 
And in your grave you'll lie
