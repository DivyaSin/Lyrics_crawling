Spiritual warriors in life 
Battles with sword in hand 
I will fight the good fight in life 
Conquering I'll make my stand 
And overcome the ties that day by day the world hides 
Knowing that I've found a place upon the solid ground I'll always be a warrior 
When I started to carry the warrior's sword 
Evils came my way 
Even though I would see defeat sometimes 
I would never let it lead me astray 
And I began to see the way true life could be 
The opportunity to reach a perfect destiny I'll always be a warrior
