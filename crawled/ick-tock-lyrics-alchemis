Uh, yeah, yeah, yo, it goes tick tock 
This is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks 
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch 
Because niggaz, well, live they shits pop Hey, hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes 
Make your hips rock 
Light a L, baby, let the Crys' pop 
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day 5-8 with double-X-L, pen saggin' blunts draggin' 
But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street 
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap 
The other street opportunity, the chance to live sweet 
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete So you can be an architect, design apartments and shit 
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip 
Soon as I'm on the set, I'm never on a chick, I play it cool 
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet, it's just the booze Check my niggaz, what's the gossip, what's the word 
Puff some herb, all I see is niggaz runnin', chin shots 
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground 
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down Now it's back to the same old shit 
You know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit 
In the jungle swingin' on vines 
I saw the gat with the same old clip 
Another nigga layin' the hit Bloodied up, screamin', I'm dyin' 
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are 
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks 
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch 
Because niggaz, well, live they shits popped Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes 
Make your hips rock 
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop 
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day It's like this nigga, it's on, toilet up for me, roll that shit big 
While I reveal the story of a wild street kid 
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit 
The spittin' image of how I live Well, first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks 
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen 
"Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open" 
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot Deuce, deuce, had my pockets full of bullets, I was real loose 
Thug parties out in wave crash, always got shot up 
Thug parties out in Queens bridge, always got shot up No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic 
Niggaz aim on the fight, we cut yo melon 
Drinkin' that old English Red Bull and Blue Bull 
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit, fuck it, we was broke Little bad ass, my nigga rap sat me down, like this 
He said, "P, you gon' wind up dead 
You and Hav' real good with that music shit 
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind off the street" And it stuck in the back of my head 
Though I still did my little bit of menacin' 
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight 
Like these things really happen 
Niggaz get cut up, I put it in my rappin' It's non fiction, it's the real deal fiscal 
It couldn't get more graphic, I'm so trail 
I said, it's non fiction it's the real deal fiscal 
City you havin', let me touch that ass So tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks 
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch 
Because niggaz well live they shits popped Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes 
Make your hips rock 
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop 
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks 
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch 
Because niggaz well live they shits popped Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes 
Make your hips rock 
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop
