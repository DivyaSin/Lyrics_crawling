Here we go, 
Damn, here we go again. 
Loving you has caused so much pain 
But you don't see it, you never see it. So why apologize? 
I was just doing what I had to do baby 
An eye for an eye! God knows I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to break your heart 
(Your heart baby) 
God knows I never meant to turn you out, turn you out 
Never meant to take it that far, that baby 
God knows I never meant to hurt you 
Hurt you, hurt you, hurt you, hurt you, hurt you Graving, guilty as charged, I'm not gonna lie, baby 
I did you wrong so many times, yes. 
So, I know why you crossed the line 
Oh, but girl, I never dreamed you'd cheat on me. But I, (no, no) I apologize (Don't apologize, don't apologize) 
Oh baby, the pain I put you through (I put you through it too) 
What I did to you (I did the same to you) 
I made you cry God knows I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to break your heart 
(Your heart baby) 
God knows I never meant to turn you out, to turn you out 
Never meant to take it back off, back off baby. 
God knows I never meant to hurt you (to hurt you) 
I never meant to break your heart 
(Your heart baby) 
God knows I never meant to turn you out, to turn you out 
Never meant to take it that far, that far baby. 
God knows I never meant to hurt you 
Hurt you, hurt you, hurt you, hurt you, hurt you, woah Can we start over, can we? (Woah) 
Can we start baby, best friend. (Woah) 
Give me one more try 
The tender kisses you gave to me. 
(Oh they're the only thing that I'd ever need) God knows I never meant to hurt you (No, baby) 
I never meant to break, to break your heart, oh no 
(I never meant to take, take things too far) 
God knows I never meant to hurt him 
I never meant to break your heart 
I never meant to break your little heart 
God knows I never meant to turn you out, to turn you out 
Never meant to take it that far, that far baby 
God knows I never meant to hurt you, to hurt you 
I never meant to break your little heart 
Uh, baby baby
