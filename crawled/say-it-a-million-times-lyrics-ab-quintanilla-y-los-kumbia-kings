Say it once, say it twice, or a million times 
Say you love me, say you need me, 'till the end of time 
Say those three little words I can't wait to hear 
Say that you love me don't waste any time 
Say it once, say it twice, or a million times 
With the kiss from your lips, even with a smile 
With the touch of your hands, with a warm embrace 
Say that you love me in every way When we're all alone, I want to hold you close 
Look into your eyes and hear those three little words 
Coming from your heart, from deep inside your soul 
So you can prove to me that you won't let me go I'll light the candle lights, and lay you on the floor 
And kiss your body slowly from your head to your toes 
As I can feel you shake and every breath you take 
When I can vaguely hear every word as you say "Hold me, touch me 'cause this just feels so right 
Kiss me, love me, just love me through the night" Say it once, say it twice, or a million times 
Say you love me, say you need me, 'till the end of time 
Say those three little words I can't wait to hear 
Say that you love me don't waste any time 
Say it once, say it twice, or a million times 
With the kiss from your lips, even with a smile 
With the touch of your hands, with a warm embrace 
Say that you love me in every way As we are making love, I hold your body tight 
*Ain't looking at the clock, don't want to have sense of time 
'Cause when I'm close to you, that's all I want to do 
For I would be so lost if I didn't have you Don't matter whose around, don't matter where the place 
I just want to tell you that I love you always 
You know you hold my heart, you know you hold the key 
My door is open for you for always, Hold me, touch me, 'cause this just feels so right 
(this just feels so right) 
Kiss me, love me, just love me through the night Say it once, say it twice, or a million times 
Say you love me, say you need me, 'till the end of time 
Say those three little words I can't wait to hear 
Say that you love me don't waste any time 
Say it once, say it twice, or a million times 
With the kiss from your lips, even with a smile 
With the touch of your hands, with a warm embrace 
Say that you love me in every way Just say those three little words 
(Just say) 
The words I've been wanting to hear 
(the words, babe) 
Now don't waste any time 
(mmm-hmmm) 
Say it once. Say it twice. Say it a million times Say it once, say it twice, or a million times 
Say you love me, say you need me, 'till the end of time 
Say those three little words I can't wait to hear 
Say that you love me, don't waste any time Say it once, say it twice, or a million times 
(Say you love me) 
With the kiss from your lips, even with a smile
