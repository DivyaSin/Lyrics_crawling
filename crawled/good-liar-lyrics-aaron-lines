It was a pretty good performance 
Yesterday out on the street 
Maybe they should give me an Emmy or an Oscar 
'Cause you didn't suspect a thing We made small talk on the sidewalk 
I even laughed out loud 
And I didn't blink an eye 
When I told you that I'm happy now I'm a good liar, I had you believing 
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving 
I'm good at pretending, I stood there unflinching 
Baby, with my heart on fire, hey, I'm a good liar Truth is I've had a lot of practice 
I've put on this show before 
Just like the day you told me we were history 
I was brilliant standing right outside your door I convinced you and me too 
It was gonna be all right 
That we'd both be better off 
That I would get on with my life I'm a good liar, I had you believing 
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving 
I'm good at pretending, I stood there unflinching 
Baby, with my heart on fire, hey, I'm a good liar It's time I came clean, it's time I told the truth 
No matter what I say I'm still in love with you 
Baby, I'm still in love with you, yeah I'm a good liar, I had you believing 
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving 
I'm good at pretending, I stood there unflinching 
Baby, with my heart on fire 
Baby, my heart's on fire, hey, I'm a good liar
