I miss your breathing when sleep doesn't come 
I can't help pretending you'll be home 
I can't face the future, now you're in the past 
Seems all of the best things never last But there's no use in crying 
There's no point denying 
I'm waiting for daylight to come They say I get through this 
But how could they know 
How can I make it on my own? 
Your here in the shadow, you cover my heart And I hear you whisper in the dark 
There's no use in crying 
There's no point denying 
I'm waiting for daylight to come I don't wanna let you go 
But in time, but in time 
I'll wake up for all I know 
I'll be fine But there's no use in crying 
There's no point denying 
I'm waiting for daylight to come
