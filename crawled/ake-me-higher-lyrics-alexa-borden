Treasures and dreams 
are trapped tight 
in the safety net of your mind 
And all the small fears 
That you fight 
are revealed despite all your might I still feel, feel greatly for you 
Just let yourself breathe 
And you'll find an opening of your eyes I know that we'll devise a way. We are wandering, we are wandering 
Lilting and volatile 
Hope is in sight 
We are wandering, we are wandering 
Sail at an untouched height 
only you can take me higher 
take me higher A mind full of kindness and good 
You're slightly misunderstood 
intention are sweet, but you should 
stop loving me like I could Like I could steal, steal something from you 
We're a wondrous two 
And we'd soar 
if you just believed in me more Don't tell them what they wanna hear We are wandering, we are wandering 
Lilting and volatile 
Hope is in sight 
We are wandering, we are wandering 
Sail at an untouched height 
only you can take me higher 
take me higher We can calm these turmoil things 
Crack the stone walls in your head 
We can put your worries to sleep 
And then we'll run like hell 
To make it out of this We are wandering, we are wandering 
Lilting and volatile 
Hope is in sight 
We are wandering, we are wandering 
Sail at an untouched height 
only you and I 
We are wandering, we are wandering 
Lilting and volatile 
Hope is in sight 
We are wandering, we are wandering 
Sail at an untouched height 
Only you can take me higher 
Take me higher
