I run for my life 
Under the black sunlight 
On deserted streets 
Uneasy dreams I sleep 
In this forgitten place 
I'm a forgotten face 
Sometimes I don't exist 
Like the dust swept aside Fade away on the wind fadeaway 
To walk away into the tide walkaway That's the end 
That's the end 
The end of the great black gold 
That's the dream 
That's the dream 
The dream that I wake up to 
The dawn of the great black sun 
It shines on me Scream for help 
From this silent soul 
This man feels no pain 
This pride will not break 
I want to breathe the night 
I want to feel the air 
I want to take it in deep 
I want to set myself free Fade away on the wind fadeaway 
Walk away into the tide walkaway 
Walkaway That's the end 
That's the end 
The end of the great black gold 
That's the dream 
That's the dream 
The dream that I wake up to 
The dawn of the great black sun 
That shines on me 
Shines on me 
Oh yeah Shines on me 
Oh shines on me The great black sun 
That shines on me 
Shines on me 
The great black sun 
Shines on me
