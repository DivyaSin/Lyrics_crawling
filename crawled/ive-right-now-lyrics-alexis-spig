(Verse 1) 
Irrevocable decisions, irreversible mistakes 
Irretrievable conversations, irreplaceable day 
What can I do about what's gone 
It's like holding on to the fog 
It's impossible (Verse 2) 
Undeniable nature, uncontrollable pain 
Understandable emotions, unconditional fate 
Tell me what can I do about what's lost 
It's like hiding light in the dark 
It's impossible (Bridge 1) 
I can't live life in rewind 
So I turn my eyes to the moment (Chorus) 
And I'm gonna live 
I'm gonna live now 
I'm gonna live 
I'm gonna live right now I'm gonna live 
I'm gonna live now 
I'm gonna live 
I'm gonna live right now (Verse 3) 
Irrational promises, irrefutable regrets 
Irreparable damages, irremovable debts 
Tell me what can I do about what's been 
It's like counting dust in the wind 
It's impossible (Bridge 1) 
I can't live life in rewind 
So I turn my eyes to the moment (Chorus) 
And I'm gonna live 
I'm gonna live now 
I'm gonna live 
I'm gonna live right now I'm gonna live 
I'm gonna live now 
I'm gonna live 
I'm gonna live right now (Bridge 2) 
All I can do is forgive myself for yesterday 
And live 
Live right now 
I'm gonna live right now Oooooh... woooah... (Chorus 2x)....
