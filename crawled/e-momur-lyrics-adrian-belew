Late last night 
I was speaking with my wife 
When she turned into a momur 
Tried to put me uptight 
I said "you don't scare me" 
Then she let out a scream 
That's when my heart started jumpin' 
Like a broken t.v. She was a momur and it was just like I told ya' 
She said "you better watch out, I might bite a big hole in ya'" The very next morning 
I was watching cartoons 
When I thought I saw a momur 
It was you know who 
Well, she backed me in a corner 
Tried to kill me with a broom 
And shouted personal remarks 
From across the living room She was a momur and it was just like I told ya' 
She said "you better watch out, I might bite a big hole in ya'" Late last night 
I was speaking with my wife again 
When she turned into a momur again 
Tried to put me uptight again 
She took me favorite guitar 
And she smashed it on the floor 
When she danced around on top of it, 
I thought I might get sore She was momur
