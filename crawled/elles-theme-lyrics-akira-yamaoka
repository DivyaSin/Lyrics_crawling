Where have you been? 
You are a different man... You disappeared... 
And just like that, you're here... So did your time, away from here... 
Renew your soul... To make you strong... 
For your return I thought you knew... It feels good, just holding you. She's gone, I feel... 
I think there's something wrong... 
Have you seen her? 
She's been away too long... So look around... 
This dismal place... 
Some things have changed... 
Or can't you tell? I'm glad you're here. 
I see you're well. You're welcome home... 
Embrace your hell. In a town hungry for the lonely... 
Lost, innocent child... 
Forbidden life taken in a moment... 
Life, too late for saving... ...or just in time. In my mind, places keep returning... 
I still see his smile. 
And the dark fear that I am feeling... 
Dies once in a while... And as the moon makes it through the madness... 
There, standing alone. I feel the breath, coming from the shadows... 
Streets, almost alive... I heard a sound (I heard a sound!) I heard a voice (I heard a voice!) Why, making a choice? (Why, do you have no choice?) I need to know... 
I need to know... 
I need to know... And all these words take me back to my home... Can I trust who you say that you are? 
And who I am now... (And who am I now...?) Too late for me... ...or just in time.
