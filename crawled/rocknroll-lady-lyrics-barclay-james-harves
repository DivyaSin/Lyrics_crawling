In the light of the night 
Trying hard to forget 
All the cries and the lies 
Of the people she met Hypnotized by the sight 
That you're seeing and yet 
Can't disguise in her eyes 
There's a look of regret So she drifts into tomorrow 
Maybe she can find a better way 
To love and see her sorrow 
Vanish in the haze Rock 'n' roll lady, keep on trying 
Like the sand that is washed on the shore 
Don't believe all the tears and the crying 
She's running back for more In the bars where the stars 
Drink tequila and wine 
Loud guitars, fancy cars 
And the feeling is fine See her face every place 
Every movement in time 
But don't choose or a loser you'll be 
When she throws you her line And she drifts into tomorrow 
Maybe she can find a better way 
To love and see her sorrow 
Vanish in the haze Rock 'n' roll lady, keep on trying 
Like the sand that is washed on the shore 
Don't believe all the tears and the crying 
She's running back for more
