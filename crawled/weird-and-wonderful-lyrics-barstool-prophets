A man invades a sacred temple in the desert 
And makes off with the Pharoah's holiest of treasures. 
It brings him wealth and fame 
And credits to his name. 
But when he disappears, 
All those who hold it fear the same. 
Weird and wonderful. 
A family driving on a lonely stretch of highway 
Returning sadly from a very pleasant holiday. 
Just then the starry night 
Is filled with blinding light. 
They'd later testify 
They'd never seen a greater sight. 
Weird and wonderful. 
In Sicily there lives the daughter of a peasant, 
Who every Christmas gets a special kind of present. 
They come from foreign lands 
To try to comprehend 
The blood that's flowing 
From a little child's feet and hands. 
Some things you can't explain. 
Weird and wonderful.
