Turn down the light 
Turn down the bed 
Turn down these voices 
Inside my head Lay down with me 
Tell me no lies 
Just hold me close 
Don't patronize me 
Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me 
If you don't 
You can't make your heart feel 
Something it won't 
Here in the dark 
In these final hours 
I will lay down my heart 
I'll feel the power 
But you don't 
No, you don't 
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't 
And if you don't 
No, you won't I'll close my eyes 
Then I won't see 
The love you don't feel 
When you're holding me Morning will come 
And I'll do what's right 
Just give me till then 
To give up this fight And I will give up this fight 'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't 
I can't make your heart feel 
Something it won't 
Here in the dark 
In these final hours 
I will lay down my heart 
And I'll feel the power 
But you don't 
No, you don't 
I can't make you love me if you don't 
And if you don't 
No, no, no, you won't I found love darling 
I found love darling 
I found love darling, yeah 
I found love darling, yeah 
I found love darling, darling 
Love in the nick of time 
I found love darling, yeah 
Love in the nick of time
