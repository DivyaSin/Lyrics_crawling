I closed my eyes, a blind and cold-hearted fool, 
Last night I lost my mind and came so close to losing you 
So close to losing you 
Misread your smile, misunderstood your tears, 
Ignored the pleading voice and every sigh 
Even your words of love I would not listen It's a lesson I'll never forget 
No communication gave rise to fear 
Tell me, who's to blame What I really meant to tell you I panicked, 
'cause I would die if something happened to you 
I'd die if something would But I'm so spoilt by your patience and devotion 
That only now I recognize some of my cruel ways 
Some of my cruel ways 
Maybe it's good, maybe it was meant to be 
There was no other way you could get through 
Now it's my turn to get through to you baby It's a lesson I'll never forget 
No communication gave rise to fear 
Tell me, who's to blame 
What I really meant to tell you, I need you 
And I would die if something happened to you 
I'd die if something would 
What I really meant to tell you, I love you 
And I would die if something happened to you 
I'd die if something would What I tried to tell you baby, what I tried to tell you darling 
Could not live without you honey, would not live without you, no 
If only you were with me baby, if only you were with me darling 
'Cause I've been waiting for you honey, I've been waiting for you I closed my eyes, a blind and cold-hearted fool, 
Last night I lost my mind and came so close to losing you, 
So close to losing you 
So close to losing you
