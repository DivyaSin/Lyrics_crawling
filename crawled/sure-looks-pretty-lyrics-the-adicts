Never had no luck 
never had no dreams at all 
Never had a reason 
To feel the way I do 
When a soul train man 
Sings do do do do to me 
My heart is aching, baby 
And I know where I should be 
Never had no love 
For a thousand years or more 
Sometimes its easy 
Sometimes it really gets me down 
When a mowtown girl 
Cries a melody 
I'll know for sure, oh baby 
Somewhere someone waits for me Chased me from here to the other side of there 
Another night inside but I don't care 
Beat me up in the rain 
Wrong man again 
They're only.....etc.
