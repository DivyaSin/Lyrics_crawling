VERSE: 
What can I do for You 
What can I bring to You 
What kind of song would 
You like me to sing 
'Cause I'll dance a 
Dance for You 
Pour out my love for You 
What can I do for You 
Beautiful King CHORUS: 
'Cause I can't 
Thank You enough 
'Cause I can't 
Thank You enough VERSE: 
What can I do for You 
What can I bring to You 
What kind of song would 
You like me to sing 
'Cause I'll dance a 
Dance for You 
Pour out my love for You 
What can I do for You 
Beautiful King BRIDGE: 
Then I hear You say 
You don't have to do a thing 
Simply be with me and 
Let those things go 
They can wait another minute 
Wait this moment 
Is too sweet 
Please stay here with me 
And love on Me a little 
longer 
'Cause I'm in love with you
