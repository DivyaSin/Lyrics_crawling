Can someone tell me "who i am?" 
I haven't recognized myself in a while. 
And since you left i stay up every night, 
thinking if you were here, you put me right. 
I know i was stupid to let what we have go to waste, 
why does everything i love always get taken away? 
Ghost in the wind calling you to take me home, 
ghost in the wind crying "Where do i belong?" 
Can anyone hear me now x2 
Ohhh ohhh x2 Do you remember when we were young, 
when i was terrified, you were by my side. 
Now you're gone i have nowhere to run, no place that i belong, left burned in my search for love. I know i was stupid to let what we have go to waste, 
why does everything i love always get taken away? Ghost in the wind calling you to take me home, 
ghost in the wind crying "Where do i belong?" 
Can anyone hear me now x2 I've been thinking about all the mess that i made, 
Ohh, ohh, ohh,, 
I've been thinking of you and the things that i said. 
Ohh, ohh, ohh,, Never meant to lose you, 
never meant to lose me. Ghost in the wind calling you to take me home, 
ghost in the wind crying "Where do i belong?" 
Can anyone hear me now x2 
Never meant to lose me. Ghost in the wind calling you to take me home, 
ghost in the wind crying "where do i belong?"
