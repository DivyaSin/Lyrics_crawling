Aesthetics Versus Architecture 
See Linda, I told You We Weren't Misogynists 
I see the dust around your eyes 
The vultures lick their lips 
But, while you breathe let me say... 
You were a waste of a man 
You have innocence... 
Tied up in your basement 
And you can taste her on your lips 
Your heart is racing 
Your heart is racing 
You'll swallow your tongue 
You'll never speak again 
Your teeth will fall out 
Of your filthy mouth 
I'll save her life if it's the last thing that I do 
Look me in the eyes as I devour you 
You lick your lips 
And pull her hair 
I'll pull you limb from limb 
For how you've lived your life 
You better pray 
I see the dust around your eyes 
The vultures lick their lips 
But, while you breathe let me say... 
You were a waste of a man 
You have innocence... 
For once your neighbors will hear a mans cry from in your house 
They'll wonder what happened to you 
And find out on the evening news 
I will tear you apart 
I'll eat your fucking flesh 
I will watch you rot 
I am fucking death 
I will tear you apart 
I'll eat your fucking flesh 
I will watch you rot 
I am fucking death 
Death 
Death 
Death 
Death 
Death 
Death 
Death
