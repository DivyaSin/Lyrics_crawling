They said the joint was rockin' 
Goin' 'round and 'round 
Oh baby, with that crazy sound 
And it never stopped rockin' 
'Til the moon went down You know it sounds so sweet 
I gotta take me a chance 
Rose out of my seat You know I had to dance 
Started movin' my feet 
Oh, clappin' my hands And we kept on rockin' 
Goin' 'round and 'round 
Oh baby, with that crazy sound 
And it never stopped rockin' 
'Til the moon went down And we kept on rockin' 
Goin' 'round and 'round 
Oh baby, with that crazy sound 
And it never stopped rockin' 
Til the moon went down Twelve o'clock 
And the place was packed 
Twelve o'clock And we kept on rockin' 
Goin' 'round and 'round 
Oh baby, with that crazy sound 
And it never stopped rockin' 
'Til the moon went down And we kept on rockin' 
Goin' 'round and 'round 
Oh baby, with that crazy sound 
And it never stopped rockin' 
'Til the moon went down
