Though it took me by surprise 
One by one I realized 
There was something I could do I lost my way. 
That's what she said 
Back to the 101 
If we don't know 
Somewhere to go 
Back to the 101 I never said to feel relaxed 
I never said to love me back 
What was I next to you? In my mind it all goes back 
Lost control of what I had 
All my thoughts left one by one I lost my way. 
That's what she said 
Back to the 101 
Back to the one 
I never won 
Back to the 101 I count the one 
I count the one 
I count the one oh one I know (I count the one) 
I lost (I count the one) 
My way (I count the one oh one) This time (I count the one) 
We'll find (I count the one) 
A place (I count the one oh one) I know (I count the one) 
I lost (I count the one) 
My way (I count the one oh one) This time (I count the one) 
We'll find (I count the one) 
A place (I count the one oh one)
