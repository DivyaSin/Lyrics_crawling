Celtic Woman, Anne Murray Out on the Mira on warm afternoons, 
Old men go fishing with black line and spoons 
And if they catch nothing they never complain, 
I wish I was with them again. As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore, 
Teasing the ones that they dearly adore, 
And into the evening the courting begins, 
I wish I was with them again. Can you imagine a piece of the universe 
more fit for princes and kings? 
I'll trade you ten of your cities 
for Marion Bridge and the pleasure it brings Out on the Mira on soft summer nights 
Bonfires blaze to the children's delight 
They dance round the flames singing songs with their friends; 
And I wish I was with them again. And over the ashes the stories are told 
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold 
The stars on the river they sparkle and spin; 
I wish I was with them again. Can you imagine a piece of the universe 
more fit for princes and kings? 
I'll give you ten of your cities 
for Marion Bridge and the pleasure it brings Out on the Mira the people are kind, 
They'll treat you to home-brew and help you unwind. 
And if you come broken they'll see that you mend 
I wish I was with them again. And thus I conclude with a wish you go well, 
Sweet be your dreams, may your happiness swell, 
I'll leave you here, for my journey begins, 
I'm going to be with them, going to be with them, 
I'm going to be with them again.
