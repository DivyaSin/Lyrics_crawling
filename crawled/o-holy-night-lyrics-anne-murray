O holy night the stars are brightly shining 
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
Till he appeared and the spirit felt its worth A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices 
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn 
Fall on your knees oh, hear the angel voices O night divine, the night when Christ was born 
O night, O holy night, O night divine 
O night, O holy night, O night divine Led by the light of faith serenely beaming 
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand 
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming 
Now come the wise men from out of the orient land The king of kings lay thus lowly manger 
In all our trials born to be our friends 
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger 
Behold your king before him lowly bend 
Behold your king before him lowly bend Truly he taught us to love one another 
His law is love and his gospel is peace 
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother 
And in his name all oppression shall cease Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we 
With all our hearts we praise his holy name 
Christ is the Lord then ever, ever praise we 
His power and glory ever more proclaim 
His power and glory ever more proclaim
