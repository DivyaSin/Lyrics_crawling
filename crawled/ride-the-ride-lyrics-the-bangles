Take all of the money 
Take all of the sweet plum of the pie 
Don't say that you love me 
Don't say it';s for me, it's a lie, it's a lie. Now you got yourself so wrapped up in it 
All you gotta do is wait a minute 
All you gotta do is ride the ride. Ride the ride 
Ride the ride. Blow me a smoke screen 
Never lookin' at me in the eye 
You make it look easy (you make it look easy) 
For someone afraid of falling to fly. Now you got yourself so wrapped up in it 
All you gotta do is wait a minute 
All you gotta do is ride the ride. Ride the ride 
Ride the ride. Take all of the money 
Take all you believe is the prize 
Just leave me a moment (leave me a moment) 
Just leave me a bright piece of the sky, a bright piece of the sky. Now you got yourself so wrapped up in it 
All you gotta do is wait a minute 
All you gotta do is ride the ride. Ride the ride 
(Now you got yourself so wrapped up in it 
All you gotta do is wait a minute) 
Ride the ride 
(Now you got yourself so wrapped up in it 
All you gotta do is wait a minute) 
Ride the ride 
Ride the ride. Ride the ride 
Ride the ride. We're gonna ride the ride the (we're gonna) ride the ride 
(We're gonna ride the ride) 
(We're gonna) Ride the (gonna) ride 
(Gonna ride the ride) 
Ride the ride 
(We're gonna ride the ride). We're gonna ride the (gonna) ride 
(Gonna ride the ride) 
(We're gonna) Ride the (gonna) ride the ride the (gonna) ride 
(Gonna ride the ride). (We're gonna) Ride the (gonna) ride
