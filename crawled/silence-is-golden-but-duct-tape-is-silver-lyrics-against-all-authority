Me and Billy like to sleep all day, on the floors where we decay. 
Mohawks in disarray from cutleridge to motherfucking Biscayne Bay. 
The gangs tried to kill us but we wouldn't take flight, brass 
knuckles and rusty knives keep the wolves at bay, and we pray from 
traffic downtown, turn it up and take me away. [Bridge:] 
What do you do when there's nowhere to go? Empty pools and punk 
rock shows, after that nobody knows and the sun goes down and the 
streetlights glow. We rolled through the city in a bucket of rust 
with the punk rock south day girls screaming lyrics at us. From the 
backseat kicking up dust to the sound of the only people we can trust. [CHORUS: x2] 
Out of control and you've shivered my timbers, i'm all fucked up the 
moon's just a sliver yea silence is golden but duct tape is silver 
like the lining of the clouds that conceal the killers. The streets aren't safe when the winds start blowing, in the eye 
of the storm the blood starts flowing, we're gathering bricks and 
we're gonna start throwing them at you (We'll throw them at you) Yea, The streets aren't safe when the winds start blowing, in the eye 
of the storm the blood starts flowing, we're gathering bricks and 
we're gonna start throwing them at you (We'll throw them at you) Me and Billy like to sleep all day, on the floors where we decay. 
Mohawks in disarray from cutleridge to motherfucking Biscayne Bay. 
The gangs tried to kill us but we wouldn't take flight, brass 
knuckles and rusty knives keep the wolves at bay, and we pray from 
traffic downtown, turn it up and take me away. [Bridge] [Chorus x2] The streets aren't safe when the winds start blowing, in the eye 
of the storm the blood starts flowing, we're gathering bricks and 
we're gonna start throwing them at you (We'll throw them at you) Yea, The streets aren't safe when the winds start blowing, in the eye 
of the storm the blood starts flowing, we're gathering bricks and 
we're gonna start throwing them at you (We'll throw them at you) Kick us when we're down we're not going away, we're the stray dogs that 
chase you the ones that betray you. And wild through the streets 
and sleep with the decay of all that you have left us like fit disarray Out of control and you've shivered my timbers, tell us to shut up 
and we'll give you the finger, yea silence is golden but duct tape is silver 
silence is golden but duct tape is silver OBEY!
