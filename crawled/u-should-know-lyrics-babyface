On the first day I saw you 
I knew I would fall in love with you 
And every since I fell for you 
I never loved another that's the truth 
In my heart and in my arms is where you belong 
I won`t let you fall 
Baby you should know 
You should know I think you are incredible 
Baby your so beautiful simply irresitable 
You should know there's not a day or 
Night that I don`t think bout you 
I`m in love with everything that you do Just the very thought of you 
Makes my head spin no lie it`s true 
Now I understand what God can do 
Look at what he did in the making of you 
In my arms and in my heart is where you belong 
I won`t let you fall Baby baby you should know 
You should know I think you are incredible 
Baby your so beautiful simply irresitable 
You should know there's not a day or 
Night that I don`t think of you 
I`m in love with everything that you do Please know it`s all about you 
I sacrafics for you God knows I worship you 
Baby you should know I love your dirty draws 
?????any reservation I speak the truth to you 
It just ain`t conversation 
Your the beginning and the ending of my day 
All that's in between my everthing
