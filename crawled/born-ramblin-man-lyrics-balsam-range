I'm awake in a sleepy old town 
Streets deserted, there's no one around 
Don't care where I'm going, 
Don't know where I've been 
Don't know how it started or how it will end 
That's the life of a born ramblin' man I met a girl from the town of no where 
I couldn't stay, got restless back there 
I don't blame her for giving, Lord, 
I needed her then 
She knew my way of living 
Wild and free as the wind 
That's the life of a born ramblin' man If the plans that I made yesterday 
Fall apart on some lonesome highway 
I'll sleep by the roadside 'til it's morning again 
Wash my face in the water 
From a creek around the bend 
That's the life of a born ramblin' man Big semis keep passing me by 
That old sun's getting hot in the sky 
A shade tree oh bottles and battered beer cans 
Dust from a tractor plowing up the rich land 
Seen it all as a born ramblin' man 
That's the life of a born ramblin' man
