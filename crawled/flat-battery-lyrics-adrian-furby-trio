I gotta talk to them 
Its really important that I get in touch 
But my phone battery's gone flat 
I tried to recharge it 
By forcing the end into a power socket 
But that didn't work 
Lordy lordy lordy my phone battery's gone flat 
Buy a 
pigeon 
Buy a pigeon 
Teach it carry your message home 
Buy a pigeon 
Buy a pigeon 
But make sure its not too fat 
Goddamn it! Ay! 
Time to buy a new battery!
