A little white picket fence around your heart 
It's everything you wanted 
Now it's tearing you apart 
You're gonna raise a family now 
But you don't know where to start I remember you 
Me I pack a suitcase 
And move from town to town 
A little east of Eden 
Too late to turn around 
Marionettes on wires 
You dance out of control I remember you 
Are you crying in your sleep tonight 
When you're lying with him 
Do you turn out the light 
Are you hiding in your dreams tonight In your world 
I will be the ghost in your heart 
The ghost in your heart 
Well you said you couldn't take it You had to settle down 
And I was the wild one 
With both feet off the ground 
I could never understand you 
But I loved you anyhow 
I remember now Are you crying in your sleep tonight 
When you're lying with him 
Do you turn out the light 
Are you hiding in your dreams tonight 
In your world I will be the ghost in your heart 
The ghost in your heart 
Yeah Something in the first kiss 
Is written in the sand 
We held it for a moment 
But it slipped straight through our hands I stare at your reflection 
And sometimes see my face 
I remember you 
You remember too Are you crying in your sleep tonight 
When you're lying with him 
Do you turn out the light 
Are you hiding in your dreams tonight 
In your world Are you crying in your sleep tonight 
Are you lying with him 
Thinkin' 'bout me tonight 
Are you hiding in your dreams tonight 
In your world I will be the ghost in your heart 
The ghost in your heart 
In your heart 
In your heart 
Ghost in your
