Hey brother, tell me what it is 
Do you think you might forget yourself if you forgive 
You don't answer, so long since you did 
Am I wasting time just waiting to find out 
The answers behind how you live Hey sister, do you like this place 
Don't it seem it all revolves around a pretty face 
Don't lose your amazing grace 
And keep in control of you heart and your soul 
Which no one will ever replace Somewhere under the rainbow 
There's sunlight maybe a sprinkle of gold... Hey genius, tell me what you see 
Is it everyone around this girl or is it just me 
Your martyr, I will never be 
Because I'm willing to fight for all of the rights 
You've wrongfully taken from me And somewhere under the rainbow 
There's sunlight maybe a sprinkle of gold 
I've been waiting, seems like a lifetime 
For someone to take all this rain off my mind Mmm hmm... Hey Jesus, do you hear my prayer 
I've been waiting forever for you to tell me that you care 
I'm lonely and it don't seem fair 
I was hoping that you would tell me you do 
Have a way out of all this despair...
