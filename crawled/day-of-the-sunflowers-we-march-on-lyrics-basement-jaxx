Millions of kisses fall from the sky 
Millions of tears for sunshine to dry 
Millions of kisses fall from the sky 
Millions of tears for sunshine to dry Incandescence, let them flow 
The rivers, rivers of being We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on Love is being real love 
Take my hand 
You'll fly like doves 
Sleep aside the steamy crabs 
Tremble tremble in the dust Incandescence, let them flow 
The rivers, rivers of being We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on Open like a flower 
Come get naked with me 
Music take me whole 
Tie me up in melody 
Just a touch 
It's all we need 
Just a kiss, uh, um Day of the sunflowers, we march on 
Day of the sunflowers We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on Open like a flower! We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on Just a touch, oh, it's all we need 
Just a touch, mm, it's all we need 
Just a kiss, uh! uh! it's all we need 
Just, just, just a kiss 
Just, just, just, just a kiss 
Just a kiss And so they came! 
Twenty thousand fishes, flying down from the sky 
Poka dot sun, five miles wide, apple pie Uh! Uh! I'm bigger now 
When I stretch to the clouds 
My feet are bigger than three lagoons 
And I can roll like a magnificent beach ball 
Striving high! Uh! Uh! Uh! I touch everything as I roll 
The fish tickle my skin 
The trees feel so nice on my knees 
And nothing is crushed Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Oh it's a big soft, a breath of mountain-air Ah ha ha ha ha ha! I reach out for you, but so is the ball red? 
My hand stretches for a thousand miles 
Within the spiral of an infinite cosmic coil Oh oh oh ah ah ah ah! Cows they look like dots 
I'm smaller now, I'm smaller now There's no way through the window 
And it is lost, it is lost 
My dreams and my idol fantasy 
Lay in front of me 
As dust Rivers of being We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on 
We march on
