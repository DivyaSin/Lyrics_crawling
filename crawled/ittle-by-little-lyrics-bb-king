Baby, out all night 
Until the break of day 
Snap me up in everything I say 
Little by little 
Only you know that I can see 
Bit by bit 
Your love is slipping away from me What you're doing, baby 
You know it ain't right 
I wonder what you're doing 
That takes all night 
Little by little 
Only you know that I can see 
Bit by bit 
Your love is slipping away from me Get so disgusted 
When I try to kiss you 
I just don't feel 
Like I used to do 
Little by little 
Only you know that I can see 
Bit by bit 
Your love is slipping away from me Tried to trail you last night 
Baby, in my car 
But I'm scared I might see 
What I'm looking for 
Little by little 
Only you know that I can see 
Bit by bit 
Your love is slipping away from me
