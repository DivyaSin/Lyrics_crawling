Raisins come from grapes 
People come from apes 
I come from Canada 
I came in first place 
In a nonexistent race 
To rebuild the Parthenon The Parthenon's in Greece 
Or was it in Grease 2? 
I can't keep my movies straight 
When I make mistakes 
I use a lot of salt 
Cause salt makes m'steaks taste great I don't want to be a bother 
But I think the phone's for you I've got orange pants 
I wear them when I dance 
But I don't get out that much 
You are just too loud 
I passed you in a crowd 
Thank you and keep in touch I don't speak Chinese 
Not even words like "please," 
"Thank you," or "how are you" 
But I can Parle Francais 
I parled a bit today 
It seemed like the thing to do I don't want to be a bother 
But I think you're in my seat
