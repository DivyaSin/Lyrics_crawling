People ask me everywhere is that really all your hair, I just tell them that if it ain't well it sure don't mean that no I can't. Just don't believe it's fair to judge a man by the lengh of his hair. Take two words, like hip and square the truth will shine and not your hair. Even the blind can damn near see whats outside you and inside me. Down or high the truth or lie. A weak man's laugh can be a strong man's cry. Black or blond or nappy or fair, you can't judge nobody by hair. If I thought that yyou would care I'd wear a wig up undeer my hair. Down or high the strongmans cry. People everywhere ask is that really all your hair. I just tell them if it ain't well it sure don't mean I can't. I just don't belive it's fair to judge a man by the length of his hair.
