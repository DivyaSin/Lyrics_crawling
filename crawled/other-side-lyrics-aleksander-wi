look at my eyes 
you are the first to see me cry 
look at my hands 
you know i used to lift them high 
look at my feet 
be the first to see me fall 
the first to see me fall look at my knees 
as i get down on the floor 
look at me bleed 
now that my dignity is gone 
look at my back 
you are the first to see me fall 
the first to see me fall Am I really what you idolize? 
do you want to see me 
feel me 
find the man behind the lies 
do you really want to look inside 
do you want to know what is on the other side hold my hand 
you are the first to see me broke 
hear my breathe 
feels like i am about to choke 
feel my fear 
be the first to see me fall 
the first to see me fall
