Caught in numbers, steel machines, face flat on cold desk 
Errors, systems, directions, could I really care less? 
Aside from all these trucks and cars, and vacant spiral stares 
Are visions of infinity from people who don't care.. 
These schedules clocks, and stopwatches, and plastic bank accounts 
It sends a shiver up my spine, and fills my mind with doubts 
Because anything is only big relative to it's size 
And there is something else that's hidden, you will soon realize.. 
The wishful thinker terrifies the man behind the mask 
For it is he, authority, who will be taken to task 
Despite his preachings and noble words he has a dark side too 
And video cameras will keep him pent up in his personal zoo.. 
Fierce crusaders fighting battles lost long ago 
Tripping over old truths that they can't see any more 
Battling warlords left and right, they know will always win 
Feeling that if they weren't to do so, it would be a sin..
