Kelly's got a problem yeah she's dyin' every day 
She sits all by herself and hope that it will go away 
She's got everything a girl could want 
Got money and a car 
When your mind is sickly spinning 
It won't get you very far 
Sleeping pills and alcohol 
One more time she'll take a fall 
Sleeping pills and alcohol, gonna have a ball 
Everybody cries for the Homecoming Queen 
Everybody cries for the Homecoming Queen 
You've got high school popularity defining 
Your self worth 
But it doesn't really matter when they sink you in the dirt 
When Jesse lost his will to live 
They said it was a shame 
But when Kelly drains her artery 
It'll rocket her to fame 
Get escape - is what you need 
Someone planted on jealousy 
Get escape - is what you need 
Slit your wrists and watch 'em bleed
