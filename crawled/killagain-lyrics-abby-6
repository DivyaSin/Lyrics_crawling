little girl, little girl 
lay me that swirl 
but I got a taste for your new world. 
you could be mine. 
you could be mine. 
syllable, syllable, 
syllable, syllable, 
silly girl. 
my grandfather calls me Marvin K Mooney, 
hell yeah he's got a right a to say. 
one man knows where the other brother goes, 
I got you wet, so wet. 
look into my eyes 
look into my eyes, 
to my eyes, my eyes, my eyes 
this could be my disguise 
REPEAT 
what we doing now sailin 
she just might killagain 
REPEAT 
little boy, little boy 
she's not a toy 
but you continue and you do annoy 
runnin your mouth 
makin her doubt 
syllable, syllable 
syllable, syllable 
silly boy, you got a silly, silly habit 
the pricks got you damn it 
watch what you say 
we're okay 
one man knows where the other brother goes 
i got you wet, so wet 
look into my eyes 
my eyes, my eyes, my eyes 
this coud be my disguise 
REPEAT 
this is a test 
this is what you get 
for looking into my eyes 
REPEAT 
my eyes
