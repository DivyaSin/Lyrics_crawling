Dipped and writ his own ransom 
Chest full of spliffs told the bitch it was cancer 
Hit the road for some months 
For the fan in the front row, getting punched out 
Screaming "whoa" with his hands up 
The glorious bastard is back 
In that hoodie like a vein that collapsed cause it's black 
Sittin' shotty in the Mazda, back of a lap and his 
Daddy lacked an answer, cause he never had one 
Eyes all low on the counter what the grass done 
Higher than the mass ton 
Five star telly, nice belly on the bad one 
Heavy with the raps way cause a nigga chip em out 
Be really what attract the bitches 
Switchin' brackets with the taxes never actin' different 
Boney nigga think he's thin, kind of baggy 
With some niggas that be trappin', shippin' packages 
Their cake is up 
Got my mama tripping like she jogging and her ankles touch 
Now I'm at the Waldorf stressin' 
Fidget with the zipper on the warlord leather 
Whisky with the spliff, because it goes more better 
Why bench him if he's scoring under full court pressure Put me in coach 
Put me in coach 
I got this man I'm on fire tonight 
Telling you Your bitch pussy smells like Sway's hat 
I'm like Swayze mixed with Sajak, in a straight jacket 
Aim the iron at your facial bracket 
You can't escape great magic 
My mind make the fishes swim in strange patterns 
Drift in the bay, Saturn 
Switchblades, new face, get the face tatted 
Inside my lungs look shattered 
Hanging backwards off a ladder 
EBT card got my baby momma face on it 
Big checks with my name on it, put my name on it 
My face is on the pen, cause I'm a G 
Looking for some other shit, send 'em down the street 
Can't even compute on how much I spent on then retreat 
I spent up about a eleven thousand Yen just on the feet 
Another twenty seven thousand Yen just for the heat 
Play the guitar with my teeth (Yeyeyeye-ya) 
Coach called him off the bench, told his ass to sit down 
Motherfucker you were picked up in the sixth round 
Throw him in the tub that's filled with hot sauce 
I'm laid back, gettin' sucked, eatin' nachos You know it's me motherfucker 
(You know it's me) 
And it's me again 
Dinosaur legs in the building
