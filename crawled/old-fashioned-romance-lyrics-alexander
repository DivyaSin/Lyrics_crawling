A glance back to envy him and an answer he wouldn't forget 
This is what i'ts like now, please grandad don't be ashamed

The story's of how lust and romance were once told and how it used to be 
But I can't keep up with the pages that are turning, I can't see it happening He said love is a fast song, he said it's exiting 
But when your barely holding on, the record you play just keeps skipping 
You'll want to set new tracks and move on, but when your barely holdidng on 
You know your holding on The story's of how lust and romance were once told 
And how it used to be as beautiful as cellar door 
The taste was so clean yet so pure and raw

The taste was so clean yet so pure and raw 
If only we could turn back time enough to see 
How lucky we could of been, it should have been If only we could turn back time enough to see 
How lucky we could of been, it should have been When things used to be as beautiful as cellar door 
The taste was so clean yet so pure and raw 
If only we could turn back time enough to see 
How lucky we could of been
