We are simple, simple creatures 
I remember my most zen moment 
It was when you found me dead 
Next to you I laid I remember a happy moment 
With the paint covered clouds above 
You were there 
Just as meaningless as me and you We are basic in disguise 
We are stuck in these moments of time 
Will we let go 
And let the past pass us, goodbye again? Our lives are fearful from sin 
Fooled in believing that there is wrong 
But what is wrong 
And what is rightfully our sins? Words are meaningless and trite 
Parallel to our attractive less lives 
We are little fragments 
Tiny fragments, just floating in the air Floating in the air 
Floating in the air 
Floating in the air 
Floating in the air Floating in the air 
Floating in the air 
Floating in the air 
Floating in the air We are simple, simple creatures 
I remember my most zen moment 
It was when you found me dead 
Next to you I laid
