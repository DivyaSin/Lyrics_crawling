You get up every morning 'fore the sun comes up 
Toss a lunch box into a pickup truck 
A long hard day sure ain't much fun 
But you got to get it started if you want to get it done. 
You set your mind and roll up your sleeves 
You're workin' on a Working Man's Ph.D. With your heart and your hands and the sweat on your brow 
You build the things that really make the world go 'round 
If it works, if it runs, if it lasts for years 
You can bet your bottom dollar it was made right here 
With pride and honor and dignity 
From a man with a Working Man's Ph.D. Now, there ain't no shame in a job well done 
From driving a nail to driving a truck 
As a matter of fact, I'd like to set things straight 
A few more people should be pullin' their weight 
If you want a cram course in reality 
You get yourself a Working Man's Ph.D. When the quittin' whistle blows and the dust settles down 
There ain't no trophies or cheering crowds 
You'll face yourself at the end of the day 
And be damned proud of whatever you've made 
Can't hang it on the wall for the world to see 
But you've got yourself a Working Man's Ph.D.
