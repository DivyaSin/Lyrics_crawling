Don't want to through my mess around 
All through the night, one more time 
Add a little link to the neighbours gate 
Stumble, tears, the lock 
It slow my mind 
Slow my mind Gonna get wasted all night long 
Gripping on tight to the cutlery the when the paranoia come Thinking about it maybe it's been a while 
Ponder it all you like, 
You can take your time 
Give me a rest from this strange fate 
Show me that you're mine 
But it saved my life 
It saved my life I'll be with you all in years 
Now fame might die before I'm back 
See me laughing through those tears Baby won't you bring that hammer down 
Doin' it to myself 
Just leave these things alone 
Playing on a couch with a record on 
Wouldn't that be fine 
The days turn cold 
Oh, the days turn cold All the trees are turning gold 
You see me fucking with the mercury when a change of scene comes
