As much as I've been trying to say 
As much as I appear okay 
I'm holding on, pretending nothing is wrong 
There's many things I wanna see 
But first of all I gotta see me 'cause I can't breathe Now that we're over, life's getting colder 
Trying so hard to feel the sun Can I begin to re-live my life? 
Release all the pain inside 
Over done now, I wanna love again 
Every day is a different vibe 
Up and down like a fairground ride 
Over done now How can I begin? 
Oh, oh, oh 
How can I begin? 
Oh, oh, oh I'm not trying win 
Oh, oh, oh 
How can I begin? 
To love again Situated in my bed 
Pictures running through my head 
Some are good 
Some wish I never took no, no 
The probability of me 
Feeling down and lonely 
I'm no longer scared Now that we're over, life is getting colder 
Trying so hard to feel the sun Can I begin to re-live my life? 
And release all the pain inside 
Over done now, I wanna love again 
Every day is a different vibe 
Up and down like a fairground ride 
Over done now How can I begin? 
Oh, oh, oh 
How can I begin? 
Oh, oh, oh I'm not trying win 
Oh, oh, oh 
How can I begin? 
To love again Hold on 
When all the hope is gone 
I'm starting at the ending 
And I'll just move on Fall down, still wearing my crown 
Nothing's gonna hurt me 
'Cause what goes around comes around 
Yeah, oh, oh 
What goes around comes around Baby, can I begin to re-live my life? 
And release all the pain inside 
Over done now How can I begin? 
Oh, oh, oh 
How can I begin? 
Oh, oh, oh I'm not trying to win 
Oh, oh, oh 
How can I begin? 
To love again
