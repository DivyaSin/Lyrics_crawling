Darling 
There is an angel 
To teach you see 
With the eyes of Emerald Green 
For darling 
All love is witchery 
Godforsaken deviltry 
To draw our blood for all world to drink 
And love will come 
And love will go 
Oh suffer not a wish to live 
For you can't follow 
Darling 
There is an angel 
To teach you wisdom of all Heaven 
The pride of all Hell 
For darling 
All knowledge comes with pain 
And things are still the same 
No matter what their name 
And if nothing is true 
More or less 
The only truth must be 
Nothingness 
(The call of the 2nd & 3rd Aethyr by Fr. Perdurabo) 
Darling 
Be sure of the Devil 
Be wary of knots 
Tied as a ladder 
Under a hill 
For darling 
There is an angel 
To teach you see 
With the eyes of Emerald Green
