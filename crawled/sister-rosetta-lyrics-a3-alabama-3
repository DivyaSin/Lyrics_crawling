In that morning 
I want to be walking, yeah 
I want to be walking on 
I want to be walking on to glory On line of the horizon I can see 
City lights shining, yeah 
Shining like a diamond, 
Lord I believe I'm coming home Guitar You gotta help me now 
You gotta help me now You say you looked for the light in the words of St. Matthew 
Took heed of the call to come and congregate 
I got me a ticket for that gospel train 
But lord I got to the station just a little too late But into the night, I went looking for angels, 
Only to find that I was walking alone 
Searching the line for some sign of salvation, lord 
But I found none Mississippi Guitar You gotta help me now 
Some brother, some sister, somebody 
You gotta help me now I buried my bible at the back of the barroom 
I bought me a bock 
Jukebox plays Jerry Lee 
I stumbled and staggered in the heat of the moonshine 
A whole lotta shaking going on in me 
Up in the skies, thunder is rolling, 
A river is running to red down below 
I'm gonna raise up my hands in some sweet supplication 
It's coming, coming on strong now 
So help me now
