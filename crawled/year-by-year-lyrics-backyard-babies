All my dreams are haunting me 
Nothing seems to be for real 
Can people change this world around 
Can people change my life to come 
It's been too many nights of fear 
It's been too many days not clear 
Can you believe a word they say 
Can you control the righteous way I even out my life 
I even try to fight my 
War and peace 
Goin' round and round 
Year by year, am I the only one?! So you think I'm doin' fine 
Stealing things 
That are not mine 
Be careful what you do wish for 
You end up losing even more I even out my life 
I even try to fight my 
War and peace 
Goin' round and round 
Year by year, am I the only one?! 
War and peace 
Goin' round and round 
Year by year, am I the only one?! 
Feel bad for you, so sad for you 
I'm so done with you, overcome all the 
overnight sensations and my patience 
creates my ghost, yeah my patience creates my Many men have traveled far 
To try it all over from the start 
Who you are is what you get 
There is nothing that you can reset I even out my life 
I even try to fight 
You boys just can't resist 
Resist what girls won't miss 
War and peace 
Goin' round and round 
Year by year, am I the only one?! Well I fight my 
War and peace 
Goin' round and round 
Year by year, am I the only one?!
