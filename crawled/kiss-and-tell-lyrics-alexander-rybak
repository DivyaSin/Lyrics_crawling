And you always try to warn me 
Of the pretty girls out there 
Now I finally learned my lesson 
And she's got a story to share. Don't kiss and tell! 
Don't kiss and tell! This is song my mama said 
Love don't cost a thing. 
Happiness is free for all 
Just treat it like it's keen. 
If you true of list a day 
Mature to go wrong. 
The girl will I follow the way 
As she waves so long. Don't kiss and tell! 
And you always try to warn me 
Don't kiss and tell! 
Of the pretty girls out there 
Don't kiss and tell! 
Now I finally learned my lesson 
And she's got a story to share. Some years later I found love, 
When it seems to go my way. 
The girl is like a fairytale, 
I didn't have to pay. 
So one day my sweetheart went 
Then mama's words come true 
Crying with a broken heart 
I was left all blue. Don't kiss and tell! 
And you always try to warn me 
Don't kiss and tell! 
Of the pretty girls out there 
Don't kiss and tell! 
Now I finally learned my lesson 
And she's got a story to share. Love is always 
Love is always for sale 
Cause someone's willing 
Someone's willing to pay. Don't kiss and tell! 
And you always try to warn me 
Of the pretty girls out there 
Now I finally learned my lesson 
And she's got a story to share. Don't kiss and tell! 
And you always try to warn me 
Don't kiss and tell! 
Of the pretty girls out there 
Don't kiss and tell! 
Now I finally learned my lesson 
And she's got a story to share.
