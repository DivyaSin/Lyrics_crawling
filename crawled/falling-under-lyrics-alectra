I've had this sweet obsession 
Ever since I remember 
I want it, got to have it 
If it's wrong, it don't matter Oh want you shakin' in your bones 
Oh want you shakin' in your bones I've got my plan in action 
Casting my spell right at ya 
I act so innocent but 
Just wait until I have ya Oh want you shakin' in your bones 
Oh want you shakin' in your bones I'm sick I'm dangerous, oh 
and I'm coming close 
Sleep with the lights on baby 
You're the one I chose 
I've got a taste for blood 
There's nowhere left to go 
You will give in to me your under my control Falling Under 
(Bring the beat back) You think you've won me over 
Just wait till you discover 
I'll break your heart and mount it 
On the wall with all the others Oh want you shakin' in your bones 
Oh want you shakin' in your bones I'm sick I'm dangerous, oh 
and I'm coming close 
Sleep with the lights on baby 
You're the one I chose 
I've got a taste for blood 
There's nowhere left to go 
You will give in to me your under my control
