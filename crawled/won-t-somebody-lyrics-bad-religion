Out in the cold, like a bundle of coal, 
Little packets of darkness, wanting to grow, 
Well there's nobody home, 
And there's a wreck in the yard, 
And maybe their coming back, 
If we wish really hard, if we wish real hard now, Won't somebody please come up with something 
Cause Jesus just don't seem to be 
Impartially working, 
And all of the rest are really down in the ratings, 
But everyone, is going to keep on waiting Waiting for peace, 
At the end of our street, 
Back behind our apartments, 
In our passenger seats, 
Just a moment of bliss, 
Of it all of the ways, 
But despair and oblivion, 
Of our precarious ways, 
It's ours to face now! Won't somebody please come up with something 
Cause Jesus just don't seem to be 
Impartially working, 
And all of the rest are really down in the ratings, 
But everyone, is still right here waiting Now I know, nothing lasts forever, 
So we might as well wish for a God damn fix 
Of this toxic change in weather Won't somebody please come up with something 
Cause Jesus just don't seem to be 
Impartially working, 
And all of the others can barely stay in the running, 
But everyone, is still right here waiting Won't somebody please come up with something 
Won't somebody please come up with something 
Won't somebody please come up with something 
Won't somebody please come up with something
