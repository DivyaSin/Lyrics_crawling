Sit me down 
Well I know I haven't been by your side 
Well I'm dragging my feet, lost my stride 
I've been painting pictures in my head and falling short 
Losing my direction, turn me around I've been just coasting 
My mind put to motion 
We move like the ocean 
But I can't swim anymore Wake me up 
I fell in love in a dream, oh, but I can't remember your face 
Take me for a test drive 
Chew me up, spit me out 
I don't need your pat on the back, no I've been just coasting 
My mind put to motion 
We move like the ocean 
But I can't swim anymore I've been just coasting 
My mind put to motion 
We move like the ocean 
But I can't swim I've been just coasting 
My mind put to motion 
We move like the ocean 
But I can't swim no But I can't swim
