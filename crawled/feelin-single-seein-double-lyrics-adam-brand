Well I really had a ball last night 
I held all the pretty girls tight 
I was feelin' single seein' double I wound up in a whole lot of trouble 
And today I'll face the big fight 
But I really had a ball last night When I came home from work this morning 
My baby was feeling low 
She told me what was on her mind 
And she told me where I could go I didn't go where she told me to 
'Cause the water was cold in the lake 
There's something fishy 'bout this whole deal 
I don't know where I made my mistake When I woke up this morning 
Like me the sun was high 
I started walking the long way home 
Just to think of an alibi I couldn't think of a single thing 
That hadn't already been said 
I might as well go out again 
'Cause I'm already dead
