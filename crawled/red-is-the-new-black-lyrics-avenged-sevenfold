Can't pretend that you're nothing special 
You've got to look at all of your options 
You can't decide what to go for 
When it's all about trust 
Its all about trust 
You see yourself on the TV 
You read your magazine 
You can't explain how it's come to be this 
Stop and think... 
When it's all about trust 
Its all about trust THIS COVERAGE, your center spread 
YOUR NEON LIGHT DAYDREAM will 
Shatter and break 
AND IF YOU THINK I'M THINKING OF 
YOU'RE VALUE HERE 
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S 
YOURE THE ONE WHOS 
LOSING CONTROL This eventual stop, this break in the mould 
I scream down this hotline 
Just to feel something This eventual stop, this break in the mould 
I scream down this hotline 
Just to feel something THIS SITUATION isn't getting any better 
I SEE THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYES (that look in your eyes) 
YOU WANT TO SEE A PRETTY FACE? 
There isn't anything wrong with giving up 
And for what it's worth 
STILL HATE YOU This eventual stop, this break in the mould 
I scream down this hotline 
Just to feel something This eventual stop, this break in the mould 
I scream down this hotline 
Just to feel something Just to feel something(X8) This situation isnt getting any better 
I see that look in your eyes 
(X3)
