I still remember the piano 
Playing the same old melodies 
The late-night crowd 
Was wild and loud 
But then a shot 
Outside the bar-room. And then I saw you for the first time 
The way you stepped out of the dark 
Up to the bar 
Said: here we are 
Whiskey for me, 
For you tequila The devil send you to Loredo 
Because he knew that I was there 
A man with such a face 
In such a lonesome place 
Can only be a desperado The devil send you to Loredo 
Because he knew that I was there 
And when I heard you'd stay 
I felt right away 
You'd shake my life 
Like a tornado I still remember the piano 
Playing a different melody 
You won at cards 
You won at darts 
Left all the men without a dollar And now you gotta leave Loredo 
They want you out of here by noon 
Oh, I can tell 
I'm in a spell 
So here we go to Amarillo..
