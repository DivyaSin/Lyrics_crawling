Before I came to the Lord, I played in a rock and roll band 
We were out on the road, and played a lot of one night stands 
Well, the Lord said "Don't stop, but now I want you playing for Me 
"Get out and make joyful noise, and sing about Christ from Galilee" 
"Marshalls and drums, cymbals and bass 
Get out and blow 'em away; playin' for Me 
You'll be playin' for me" Mybe you think this is a funny thing for Christians to do 
But we love Jesus, and we would like to show Him to you 
God sent His Son to die on the cross for your sins 
We'll make all the noise we can, so you'll believe in Him 
Marshalls and drums, cymbals and bass 
Get out and blow 'em away; playin' for Him Christ Jesus the Lord, you know He's coming back pretty soon 
And if you reject Him, you know you've sealed your own doom 
The Lord Jesus, he wants to stand by your side 
He's giving you heaven; if you say "no", hell opens wide 
Marshalls and drums, cymbals and bass 
WE're up here making all of this noise 
To tell you of Him 
We want you to know Him 
We're gonna sing about Him
