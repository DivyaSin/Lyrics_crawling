Go tell the Sheriff 
John Roland Woods found Jesus 
Now he's livin' at the foot of the cross 
He testified on the main drag this evening 
Said his gonna spread the gospel to the lost The meanest sinner to ever live and breathe 
Said he's been clean and sober for a weak 
He said his soul was not troubled anymore 
He hocked his gun and gave the money to the lord Go tell the Sheriff 
John Roland Woods found Jesus 
At a tent revival right outside of town 
Oh what a friend this town has in Jesus 
If you look at what John Roland had tore down Before the spirit touched his soul 
He left the street signs full of bullet holes 
Back then when he was raising hell 
You knew he was comin' by the blue lights on his tail Go tell the Sheriff 
John Roland Woods found Jesus 
Now that water tower must be full of wine 
Let not your weary heart be troubled 
Turn your women and your children back outside What will we do on Friday night 
Without John Roland shootin' out the lights 
Carry that old jukebox away 
He traded B9 for amazing grace Go tell the Sheriff 
John Roland Woods found Jesus 
Now he's livin' at the foot of the cross
