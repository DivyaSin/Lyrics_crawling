Anyone here in the audience, 
With a pad that I can crash in, 
I'd really appreciate you letting me know, 
'Cause the gig is over soon. 
I've been out on the road for a couple of weeks, 
And we didn't take much cash in. 
It's raining outside and to tell you the truth, 
I've been locked out of my room. [Chorus] 
Do you care' 
Do you pity the poor musician' 
Don't you know, 
What it's like out on the road' 
Don't you think, 
Don't you think I'm always wishin', 
Someone would stand up, 
And offer a hand up, 
And take me home' Anyone here in the audience, 
Who can make a dish to fill me, 
I'd really appreciate you letting me know, 
Haven't eaten all day long. 
I've been out on the road for a number of weeks, 
And the greasy food is killing me. 
I'm hungry and tired and to tell you the truth, 
All my will to pay is gone. [Chorus] Anyone here in the audience, 
With a heart that I can cling to, 
I'd really appreciate you letting me know, 
If you've got some love to spare. 
I've been out on the road for a number of weeks, 
And I've found no one to sing to. 
And I just need to know, 
Yes I just want to know, 
Is there anyone there' [Chorus] Mmm, someone would stand up, 
And offer a hand up, 
And take me home.
