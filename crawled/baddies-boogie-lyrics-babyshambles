Baddie's bound by ancient codes of decency and secrecy 
He understands about stabbing backs and shaking hands 
So if or when you're behind bars or in front of them as you are 
Look out for the man who'll bum your wife and then shake your hand Oh you've been here before, you fell in love and carried her over the threshold 
Thinking, she's far too good looking to do the cooking 
Now, but that's twenty years ago...twenty years ago That's a lousy life for the washed up wife of a permanently plastered, pissed up bastard 
a lousy life for the washed up wife of a permanently plastered, pissed up bastard 
a lousy life for the washed up wife of a permanently plastered, pissed up bastard 
Lousy life, lousy life Kid was singing will I ever be free, does this town hold no more for me 
Club Tropicana the drinks are free, stick one in his face for me Baddies bound to decency and secrecy
