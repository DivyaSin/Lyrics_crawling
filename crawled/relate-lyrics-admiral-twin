When all the love 
Has turned to hate 
How can we relate 
When all the things we say 
Are heard another way? When all the trust 
Has turned to doubt 
Who will hear it out 
And strive to take the time 
See what it's all about? How can we relate? 
Love has turned to hate If all the light 
Will burn and fade 
What will separate 
The day from night? 
Or is it shades of gray? When bridges broken 
Wash away 
Is there any hope 
That there will be a link? 
A way to clemency? How can we relate? 
Bridges wash away How can we relate? When all our songs 
Are tools of jade 
How can we convey 
The things we need to share? 
Is there a better way? When falling short 
Our dreams retire 
Mired and smothering 
In self-beguile and shame 
How can we make the scene? How can we relate? 
Is there hope in fate? How can we relate?
