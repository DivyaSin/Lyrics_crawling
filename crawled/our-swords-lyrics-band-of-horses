Out on the wall, sounds of banging is constant, coming from your head 
And desperate, the calls came and ringing from those wanna wring your neck 
Wring your neck Open your mouth, sounds of breathing found it spilling from your face 
Best to be dim to the humble of traffic stepping on your name Count on us all, follow our own swords tonight And chilling walk home down the portions roads they're leading straight to your place 
And look like the tin can with swallows the kitchen plugging up your space
