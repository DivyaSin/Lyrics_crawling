I was always a runner 
I was always a runner you know 
I was always a runner 
Became a forgiver and now I have nothing to show I was the way you don't go 
I was the way that you never go 
I was the way that you never go baby you lie 
Oh my And your house is an eyesore 
I sing in it and feel half alive And the way that you go on 
And the way that you go on and on Oh listen 
Lay down what you know 
Your back face is the cave my soul- 
There's a sugar 
There's a sugar 
There's a sugar Get to set it 
Be or be 
Think love's for everything 
That's the way 
That's the way to sugar a lie Oh non-attachment 
Didn't wait and so 
Your swell barely- 
Didn't waste 
It's a waste- 
A waste- 
It's a-wasting You 
Up above some launch, dive 
You 
Up above some launch, dive 
You 
Up above some launch, dive ooh 
Can I spend life on for you? You 
Up above some launch, dive 
Can I spend life for you? 
Hey You 
Up above some launch, dive 
Say my- 
Can I spend life fucking quivering? Up above some launch, dive 
Say my- 
Can I spend life fucking quivering?
