I tried and tried to look out for number one, but all I see are homeless and empty streets. There are no families here, there are no friends. Only strangers lie beneath empty beds. Cast myself aside from memories, built my bridges, dug my trench. A grave to make a home, only strangers lie beneath empty beds. No one know your name. Unfortunately we are one and the same.
