What happened to the plan? 
I'm confused. I just don't understand. 
Promises, that I heard, 
Of great things, were only so many words. 
Only words. 
I wanted so much more. 
We grow up so naive. 
Just say it and we will believe. 
Believe it. 
Too trusting, we made no stand 
Until things got so out of hand. 
Out of hand. 
I wanted so much more. 
I don't know what to say. 
I can't believe I live this way. 
All I know is I expected so much more. 
I don't know what to say. 
I can't believe I live this way. 
All I know is I expected so much more. 
I don't know what to say. 
I can't believe I live this way. 
All I know is I expected never to be so neglected. 
I don't know what to say. 
I can't believe I live this way. 
All I know is I expected so much more. 
And wanted so much more. 
I wanted so much more. 
So much more. 
More.
