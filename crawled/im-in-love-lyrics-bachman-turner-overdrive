1, 2, 3 
Walked in through the brass door 
Of an unassuming bar 
Bought a drink, mixed around 
Same routine so far 
I saw her, she saw me 
Then she smiled openly 
I sat too long 
The chance was gone 
But she didn't wait 
Saw me hesitate 
She drew right in I'm in love, I'm in love 
I'm in love, I'm in love Said she'd seen to many 
Mixed up scenes before 
To ever think of love 
Til tonight, you walked in 
I saw you, you saw me 
You got those things I've never seen 
Said she knew I'd take all night to make a move 
She had more in sight than being polite 
I said, me too I'm in love, I'm in love 
I'm in love, I'm in love Oh baby what'cha do to me 
Everything feels alright 
I never knew it could be this way 
Til we got lucky that night 
I'm in you, you're in me 
Just one thought, just one need 
Then I knew what it was I had to do 
Cause it came to me 
That all I need in life, is you I'm in love, I'm in love 
I'm in love, I'm in love 
Love 
I'm in love, I'm in love 
Love 
I'm in love
