Home, Reflections of ice shine bright in my mind remind me, 
I long, To be cold and feel alive for that's what inspires me. 
Home, To be free just to breathe only see in the eyes that know me, 
Home, Like a dream out of reach I can't see through the film that clouds it. Memories fade to dust, Slowly losing touch. To belong, Is the feeling I want 
Is it wrong, To miss the time that we had 
Now it's gone? Didn't plan for this, 
Home is where my heart is... Is the feeling I want, Is it wrong, 
To miss the time that we had 
Now it's gone? Didn't plan for this, 
Home is where my heart is... Home, Used to wish to be gone, to be far from the ones who'd choke me 
Now, All I want is to hear, to be near, feel them all surround me. Memories fade to grey, Take me to the place. Where I belong, Is the feeling I want 
Is it wrong, To miss the time that we had 
Now it's gone? Didn't plan for this, 
Home is where my heart is... Is the feeling I want, Is it wrong, 
To miss the time that we had 
Now it's gone? Didn't plan for this, 
Home is where my heart is... I'm grateful for the chance that is mine 
So I'll cherish every second of time. To belong, Is the feeling I want 
Is it wrong, To miss the time that we had 
Now it's gone? Didn't plan for this, 
Home is where my heart is... Is the feeling I want, Is it wrong, 
To miss the time that we had 
Now it's gone? Didn't plan for this, 
Home is where my heart is... 
Didn't plan for this, Home is where my heart is...
