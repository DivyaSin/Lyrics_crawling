I'm taking chances, 
I wear my heart on my sleeve. 
I wonder slide slide, under the big sky, 
Who's gonna' take care of me. I'm not sure if I really want to, 
I'm not sure what it all means 
I just want somebody to talk to, 
To talk to me. I'm taking chances. 
I'm talking carelessly. 
And I'm walking backwards, into the future, 
This world is getting too deep. I'm not sure if I really want to, 
I'm not sure what this all means. 
I just want somebody to hold on, 
To hold me. I keep falling, 
I keep falling, 
I keep falling, 
And I keep tumbling under the deep, deep, All I can do now, is give up the whole thing. 
I'm not sure if I really want to, 
I'm not sure what this all means, anymore. I'm taking chances, 
I'm taking chances, 
I'm taking chances, 
I'm taking chances, Yeah-Yeah. 
Taking chances, 
I'm taking chances, 
I'm taking chances, 
I'm taking chances, Yeah-Yeah. 
Taking chances, 
Taking chances, 
Yeah-Yeah. Taking chances, 
Taking chances, 
Yeah-Yeah.
