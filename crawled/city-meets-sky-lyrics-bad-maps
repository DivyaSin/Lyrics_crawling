City lights; sober eyes 
Wasting my time the way I wasted all my life 
Its alright, its alright Mothers eyes; father ties 
Squandering trust the way I risk it climbing so high 
Its alright, its alright Dreary nights in Mountain Time 
Inspire a change in the cloth of city and sky I hit the floor 
Anxiety exaggerates once mitigated pain 
From trying to soar 
God, I got it wrong 
Nostalgia just commemorates 
The faulty paths and turns I tend to take 
I charted up a course 
Waked further from the beaten path 
Missing who I was a day before 
God, I lost the will to try 
To be who I was before
