You! 
Pull me out and plug me in 
Light the brain 
Start me up 
Automatic we're bound 
We wind up like clocks Assimilation of perfection 
My flesh and bone exists no more 
Viral program in me Am I just your creation? 
Terminate this operation 
Taking back the chance to feel alive Disconnect me from the dream 
You infused with reality (release me) 
Cut the cord that defines you Memories are fading 
My life's disintegrating Initiate the procedure to transform my body 
Into a greater form to serve your gain 
Access the brain to eliminate 
The source that constrains us to be humane Am I just your creation? 
Terminate this operation 
Taking back the chance to feel alive Disconnect me from the dream 
You infused with reality (release me) 
Cut the cord that defines you Disconnect us from your dream 
Bleeding out the circuitry 
You've got to cut the cord 
Cut the cord and wake up! Memories are fading 
My life's disintegrating
