Girl, ever since you walked into my life 
You took everything that was wrong and made it right, that's what you did 
I'm blessed 'cause I don't have to settle for the rest 
Took some time but now I found the best that I ever knew 
I've never been in love before 'cause I've been waiting all my life for you So, tell me I'm right and I'm not crazy 
There are no ifs no ands or buts or maybes 
Is it bad that I only want to be together? 
'Cause each passing second it just keeps getting better, keeps getting better Babe sometimes it's hard to find the words to say 
You're the reason I'm the man I am today 
You know what you did 
At last, you know you don't even have to ask 
[?] 
I never been in love before 'cause I've been saving all my love for you So tell me I'm right and I'm not crazy 
There are no ifs no ands no buts or maybes 
Is it bad that I only wanna be together? 
'Cause each passing second it just keeps getting better, keeps getting better Way back when we met I knew it then 
Girl, I knew you were the best there's ever been 
So, I don't know how you do the things you do 
But, every day you open up your eyes I'll be right there 'cause I belong to you So, tell me I'm right and I'm not crazy 
There are no ifs no ands no buts or maybes 
Is it bad that I only want to be together? 
'Cause each passing second, with each passing minute with each passing hour 
It just keeps getting better Is it bad that I only wanna be together? 
'Cause each passing second it just keeps getting better 
Keeps getting better
