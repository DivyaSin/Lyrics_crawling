They say that times are getting harder 
Well that's easy to say 
And this crazy world can't go much farther 
It's spinning faster each day 
But not everything has changed [Chorus] 
Kids still get restless on rainy days 
Lilacs still fill the air in spring 
Love's still the only word that I can use in telling you 
The way I feel and I'll love you always 
Some things never change Seems like we're always in a hurry getting no where fast 
We're all wrapped up in work and worry but all of that will pass 
It's the simple things that last [Chorus]
