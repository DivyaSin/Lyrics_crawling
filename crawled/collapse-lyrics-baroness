We are all soured milk 
When we look in the mirror, we collapse 
We are all soured milk 
When we look in the mirror, we collapse 
When our time has come 
When our finger's on the trigger, we collapse 
Arms are fading 
Swirling like a poison in the sink 
Like the southern bell 
Playing songs of horror, like teeth among the grass 
Like a bullet shell 
Whistle and a howl 
Watch the good folks run 
We are all rotten fruit 
When the pipeline's are still flowing, we collapse 
When our time has come 
When the city needs a lynching to collapse 
Arms are fading 
The devil's in the eye of every man 
Water in the well 
A baptist and a baby were rolling in the leaves 
Keep her spirit well 
And (toppit?) baby's father will lay her out to dry
