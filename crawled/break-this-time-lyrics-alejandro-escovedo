If you could see you 
The way that I see you 
The way I perceive you 
No, I never came to deceive you 
Or sit high above you 
Or lock doors behind you 
But only to love you 
Inside the refrain But I just might break this time Mothers and fathers 
They don't have all the answers 
Can't see past the chain link 
They laid on the line 
So break another picture 
Or better yet sit there 
Inside the stillness 
Oh, this time But I just might break this time 
Yeah this time Whoever told you 
There'd be no danger 
Nothing to fear here 
In this house of pain 
So speak to me softly 
And tell me you love me 
And we'll join together 
Inside the refrain But I just might break this time 
Yeah, I just might break this time 
I just might break this time 
This time 
Yeah this time 
Uh huh uh huh this time
