(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh) 
(Uh-oh, uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh) (Uh-oh) I can hear it 
Can't you hear it 
I can feel it 
Sneaking up behind 
At my shoulder 
Getting closer 
Taking over body and mind. Telling me I'm guilty 
(I can't remember) 
All I'm doing wrong 
(I can't remember) 
Wouldn't wanna change 
(I'm only human) 
Doubt I ever get it right. Could be a great somebody 
In a brand new body 
If I get another try. Karma Karma 
Cut the drama 
Never satisfi-yi-yied 
Karma Karma 
Dalai Lama 
Even had to do it right. (Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh) 
(Uh-oh, uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh) High above us 
Nearly hopeless 
Try to focus 
On the in and there 
Yeah I mean to 
But I seem to 
Always lean to 
Having lot of fun. Telling me I'm guilty 
(I can't remember) 
All I'm doing wrong 
(I can't remember) 
Wouldn't wanna change 
(I'm only human) 
Doubt I ever get it right. Could be a great somebody 
In a brand new body 
If I get another try. Karma Karma
