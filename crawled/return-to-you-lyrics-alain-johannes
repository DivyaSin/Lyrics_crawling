Given love 
All the hardness of a world gone astray 
Is kept far away 
Give love 
Every seed can find it's way to the sun 
While having fun 
Given love 
All the emptiness is filled 'til it bursts 
Releasing the curse 
For better or worse 
You took me away 
Made me forget this is real 
Forget this is real 
You took me away 
Into that place I have lost 
But I will return I will return to you 
Given love 
The impossible becomes what you do 
Becomes what you do 
Given love 
You can find yourself inside someone else 
And see who you are 
Given love 
All the emptiness is filled 'til it bursts 
Releasing the curse 
For better or worse 
You took me away 
Made me forget this is real 
Forget this is real 
You took me away 
Into that place I have lost 
But I will return I will return to you
