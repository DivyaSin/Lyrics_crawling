Another place, another time 
I could be yours, you could be mine 
But we both have other lives, play different games 
Sometimes circumstances change but maybe someday 
I could be yours, you could be mine 
Another place, another time Time drags on when you're waitin' for the perfect one 
Someone to touch your heart, make a change Like two trains runnin' 
Down different tracks of life 
Until our destination is the same 
We must play this waiting game 
We gotta play this waiting game Another dream, another dance 
Our eyes meet, we take a chance 
Seems we've been waiting for this moment far too long 
When it makes us feel so right can it be wrong? 
Reach out your hand, wade cross the line 
This is the place, this is the time Time drags on when you're waiting for that perfect one Someone to touch your heart, make a change Like two trains runnin' 
Down different tracks of life 
Until our destination is the same 
We must play this waiting game 
We gotta play this waiting game Time drags on when you're waiting for that perfect one 
Someone to touch your heart, make a change Like two trains runnin' 
Down different tracks in life 
Until our destination is the same 
We gotta play this waiting game 
We gotta play this waiting game 
We gotta play this waiting game 
We gotta play this waiting game
