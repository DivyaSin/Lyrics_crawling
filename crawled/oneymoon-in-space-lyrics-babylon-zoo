Electrics day hangin' over me 
I think we're about to lose control 
Space police say to me 
Hello, Hello, Hello 
Is it me, nobody telephoned Electric rain hangin' over me 
I think we've finally lost control 
Space Police callin' me 
That's why your garden never grows 
But I'm afraid to say hello, hello, hello *When tomorrow comes they'll wipe your fears away 
Celebrating life in space 
When the morning comes they'll wipe your fears away 
Life on earth will stay the same 
She flies with grace (Glides with grace) 
How I love the taste (I love the taste) 
Honeymoon in space (space, space, space...) Better day hangin' over me 
I think we've finally lost control 
Space police say to me 
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello (Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello) 
Is it me, nobody telephoned 
It it me, nobody ever called *Repeat twice She glides with taste 
I love the taste 
Honeymoon in space
