Why are there so many 
Things that remain undone 
Should we hold on to the time 
That we have got Grasp it firmly 
Smother every 
Moment with life 
It still doesn't feel like 
Everything would be alright It feels like there's no beginning 
It feels like there's no end 
Feels like there's only a middle 
From birth to death We walk a path 
Which feels like it never ends 
Every stone in front of us 
Tells us to stop
