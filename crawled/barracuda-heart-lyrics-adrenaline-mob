So, this ain't the end I saw you again today 
I had to turn my heart away 
Smile like the sun kisses for everyone 
And tails it never fails! You lying so low in the weeds 
I bet you gonna ambush me 
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees 
Now, wouldn't you, Barracuda? Oh-oh-ohh Back over time we were all trying for free 
You met the porpoise and me, uh huh 
No right no wrong, selling a song 
A name whisper game. And if the real thing don't do the trick 
You better make up something quick 
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick 
Ooh, Barracuda! Oh-oh-ohh...yeah "Sell me, sell you," the porpoise said 
Dive down deep down save my head 
You I think that you got the blues, too. All that night and all the next, swam without looking back 
Made it to the western pools - silly, silly fools! The real thing don't do the trick, no 
You better make up something quick 
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick 
Ohhh, Barra...barracuda! Yeah Ooohhhhhh-ah!
