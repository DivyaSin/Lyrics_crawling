On my hands, sitting on half a chance, 
Waiting for good things to come 
Passers by looking through broken glass, 
Waiting for good things to come And this cry goes out to everyone, 
Chasing the sun, chasing love 
And my heart goes out to everyone, 
Coming undone, coming done Round and round, spinning through this old dance, 
Holding your heart with your thumb 
Straight to plan goes not so everything, 
Waiting for good things to come And this cry goes out to everyone, 
Chasing the sun, chasing love 
And my heart goes out to everyone, 
Coming undone, coming done Oh, when will I see 
There's more to you, 
There's more to me 
Oh, nobody knows how it will turn, 
How it will turn, 
How it will turn. And this cry goes out to everyone, 
Chasing the sun, chasing love 
And my heart goes out to everyone, 
Coming undone, coming done
