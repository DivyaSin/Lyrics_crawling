Yo, what happened to the headlock battle? 
(Ok, ok) 
You only rap over techno now? 
(Wow) So you went to NYC, huh? 
(Ok, ok) 
Do people even like that sound? 
(Wow) 
Wow Now, when it loops on me 
Gotta make it count like two on three 
Yeah, 'cause I know that they listenin' 
Tryin' to predict what my move 'gon be 
(Yeah) Or is that big-headed? 
Haven't even dropped outside of my country 
I'm only sayin' 'cause they said it 
And these people all make it all sound so funny 
When you believed in you and nobody ever did 
(Yo) Then your record starts to get a little spin 
And they go from a "Thumbs up kinda" 
To acting like they don't know him 
Didn't mean to be in this case and that's with a frown on my face 
To make it up I do whatever it takes, psych, you know that I 
(Either ain't or hate) Yo, why you still livin' out here man? 
(Ok, ok) 
You can't afford a place in town? 
(Wow) (Heh, ok) 
And you don't make money of this now? 
(Ok, ok) 
(I see) 
So that's how I've seen you around 
(Wow) 
Wow Yeah 
Guess they wanna know if I got what it takes 
Even though I reside somewhere foreign 
If you're un-American, over that pond, the other side of everything 
(And yeah) I could probably run laps 'round 
Without me even getting in there dumbin' it down 
It is what it seems, I don't do no chaser 
If you want it watered down, I can't wager 
And I can't hate cha', kinda like the makin' of a robot is 
(Is) Well, now I'm his maker 
Wasn't another one that could be done like this 
(This) 
'Til I rained on it, now they wanna look like me in those garments 
Size 9 shoes are the shoes that I walk And for your information it'll be a little costly 
Bein' plush like I 
(I) 
Hit my new button up looking like "pow" 
(Pow) Any other 3-letter word that rhymes, 'cept for "why" 
'Cause it's not a question, it's more like "uh" 
Sendin' off of every feelin' that I ever ached 
To say anything less would be out of this strip 
Out of this comic, out of this bi-bi-bitch Yo, what happened to the headlock battle? 
(Ok, ok) 
You only rap over house-beats now? 
(Wow) (K) 
So you went to Paris last year? 
(Ok, ok) 
Do people even like that sound? 
(Wow) Oh you wear skinny jeans too? 
(Ok, ok) 
(Oh) 
So that's what's in right now? 
(Wow) (Oh, oh) 
They in the color neon too? 
(Ok, ok) 
Then I ain't gonna say nothin' 'bout it 
(Wow) 
Wow Yo, what happened to the headlock battle?

But, do people even like that sound?
