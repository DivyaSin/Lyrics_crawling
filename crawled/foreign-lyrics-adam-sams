Pull this material skeleton off my skin 
Expose my heart make me raw 
Open me up, let the therapy begin 
Help me heal, make me real I dont want to go home the same man 
Ive become foreign to who I am 
I dont want to leave here the same man Show me how to smile a real smile 
Make me new, make me see through 
Show me what uncomfortable feels like 
Break me down, show me how Im leaving the old part of me 
Im ridding my skin of its treacheries 
Of wanting and flaunting and needing and greed and 
Im throwing away my pride 
And coming alive again
