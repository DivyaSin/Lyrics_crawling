One stolen look cross the room 
An illusive smile, but soon, baby soon. 
One minute for every hour 
But time hasn't been on our side, on our side. Still holding on 
Been waiting so long 
For that indelible time When the stars shines upon me 
And the night feels so lonely then 
I only picture your face 
And remember the days, nights and now 
I spent them with you 
(I spent them with you) Two worlds under the sun 
We melt into one just, come baby come 
All the signs says it's so 
Appointed upon by the hour of love Still holding on 
Been waiting so long 
For that indelable time. When the stars shines upon me 
And the night feels so lonely then 
I only picture your face 
And remember the days, nights and now 
I spent them with you My coffee is cold 'cause I've waited so long 
The thoughts of your smile always makes me feel strong 
I'm drawing a picture of you in my mind 
And the thought of your smile always making me miss you so much When the stars shines upon me 
And the night feels so lonely then 
I only picture your face 
and remember the days, nights and now 
I spent them with you 
I spent them with you 
(I spent them with you) 
I spent them with you 
(I spent them with you)
