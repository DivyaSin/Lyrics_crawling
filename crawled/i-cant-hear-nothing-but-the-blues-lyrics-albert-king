My mother and father were great people 
Oh what a beautiful memory of them 
My father used to sing a sweet love song 
Mother would sing that soul for him I guess I'm just a man with a different mood 
Ah Lord, oh I can't hear nothing but the blues A beautiful bird whispering down through the trees 
I know I can't dig the sweet melody 
I'm so blue and all alone 
I wonder what in the hell is wrong with me? I guess I'm just a guy with a different mood 
Ah Lord, oh I can't hear nothing but the blues Mister bartender 
I want you play the jukebox for me 
I say, I want you to take my last dime 
And put it on B.B. Ray or me I guess I'm just a guy with a different mood 
Ah Lord, oh I can't hear nothing but the blues
