Alone searching for devotion, and the fading melody 
So trying to cross an ocean, and I won't bare to leave 
Locked up my, who know what I try to say 
My heart all the time was stolen, begging for a treat Some nights I talk to myself 
I said the words that I can't say to no one else 
And some nights I talk in my sleep 
I said the words I never said when you were with me 
Some nights I talk to myself 
I said the words that I can't say to no one else 
And some nights I talk in my sleep 
I shout the words I never said when you were with me I'm gone, love has got me open, love is insanity 
So long words I left unspoken, I couldn't set them free 
Won't sure the love [?] [?] going on the thing 
My heart, I left it for broken, [?] Some nights I talk to myself 
I said the words that I can't say to no one else 
And some nights I talk in my sleep 
I said the words I never said when you were with me 
Some nights I talk to myself 
I said the words that I can't say to no one else 
And some nights I talk in my sleep 
I said the words I never said when you were with me 
Some nights I talk to myself 
I said the words that I can't say to no one else 
And some nights I talk in my sleep 
I shout the words I never said when you were with me Oh Oh Oh
