When I hold you in my gaze 
When there's nothing else to say 
I can still find you when you look away 
You can say to me we're through 
You can say that you are free 
But you fool yourself 
You belong to me 
The more you want to run 
You can't make it to the door 
Took a chance on love 
Now we both want more 
And tonight goes on forever 
I can feel it in my life 
I can see it in your eyes 
Going through this world together 
Finding paradise with you 
Into the savage blue 
The savage blue with you 
When the storm has passed us by 
And the crowd has come and gone 
I will be with you 
Cause our love goes on 
And we share a quiet place 
That no one else can touch 
Spirits live as one 
And our souls are free 
I will wait for you 
Now my heart's an open door 
Tell me that you'll stay 
Don't want to lose you anymore 
And tonight goes on forever 
I can feel it in my life 
I can see it in your eyes 
Going through this world together 
Finding paradise with you 
Into the savage blue 
Baby come with me 
And tonight goes on forever 
I can feel it in my life 
I can see it in your eyes 
Going through this world together 
Finding paradise with you 
Into the savage blue 
(Tonight goes on forever) 
When I'm alone with you 
(Tonight we are together) 
Oh yeah 
(Tonight goes on forever) 
Into the savage blue 
(Tonight goes on forever) 
When I'm alone with you 
(Tonight we are together) 
Makin' love to you 
(Tonight goes on forever) 
Into the savage blue 
(Tonight goes on forever) 
(Tonight we are together) 
(Tonight goes on forever) 
(Tonight goes on forever) 
(Tonight we are together) 
(Tonight goes on forever) 
(Tonight goes on forever) 
(Tonight we are together) 
(Tonight goes on forever)
