Some of us laugh 
Some of us cry, 
Some of us lay back watch the world go by 
Some of us fear 
Some of us hate 
Some of us won't wake up 'till it's too late The distance between us is a mystery to us all 
The difference between us is so small There are no answers, only questions 
And we're all strangers to the truth 
But in my mind's eye 
I have found the reason why 
And I carry the burden of the proof Why do we fight? 
Why do we fall? 
Why do we stand there backs against the wall? 
Why don't we change? 
Why don't we try? 
Why don't we turn 'round, help the other guy? The distance between us is a mystery to us all 
The difference between us is so small There are no answers, only questions 
And we're all strangers to the truth 
But in my mind's eye 
I have found the reason why 
And I carry the burden of the proof 
And I carry the burden of the proof
