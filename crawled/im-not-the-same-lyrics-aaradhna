Hey, Mr. Heartbreaker 
do me a favor 
stop making me cry 
cause I feel I ain't strong no more I need you to stop right now 
cause I feel like Im sinking down 
with a pocket full of stones 
and a brick tied around my soul Oooh, oooh I'm not the same 
Oooh, oooh I'm not the same 
Oooh, oooh I'm not the same Heyyy, Hey Mr Heartbreaker 
You know I used to be a fighter 
But ever since you came into my life 
I can't find what's wrong from right Oh you took the hope out of me 
I can't find any joy in any thing 
And all of the things that I used to enjoy 
I don't enjoy them no more Oooh, oooh I'm not the same 
Oooh, oooh I'm not the same 
Oooh, oooh I'm not the same Everybody's wondering 
Where she gone 
The girl that they used to know 
She don't live here no more She's gone 
She's gone 
She's gone Oooh, Oooh I'm not the same 
I'm not the same 
I'm not the same...
