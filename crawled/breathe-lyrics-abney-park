I wish I could breath, I wish I could stand. 
I wish I had a chance here holding your hand. 
Wish I could speak, I wish could talk 
I wish I could breathe Since the first day, I was alive, 
I feared we would meet here in the misty outside 
I wanted to run, I wanted to hide 
I wish I could breathe I feel a chill deep in my bones, 
Nothing can heal, the way my blood moans. 
Nothing can quench, My bitter thirst 
I wish I could breathe. I grasp at my heart, That burns in my chest, 
It's your precious art, That makes my soul stressed. 
I run short of blood, light headed I swoon. 
I wish I could breathe. I fear I can't over come this place 
I know your face, your hands 
I wish I could breathe. I wish I could breath, I wish I could stand. 
I wish I had a chance here holding your hand. 
Wish I could speak, I wish could talk 
I wish I could breathe Since the first day, I was alive, 
I feared we would meet here in the misty outside 
I wanted to run, I wanted to hide 
I wish I could breathe I fear I can't over come this place 
I know your face, your hands 
I wish I could breathe.
