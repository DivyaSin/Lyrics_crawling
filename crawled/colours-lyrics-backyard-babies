Fell out of heaven A.D. 
But it meant nothin' to me 
You never talked about the birds and the bees 
No I want to grow up to be young 
I don't want to be contained 
I just want to feel a little loved 
Good intentions 
Always paved the road to the hell Some things are not just black & white 
Somebody's gotta shine 
In colours and it could be me 
Out of the Jungle 
Into remedy I came out hungry to be me 
Every nothing is for free 
Life is expensive with no salary 
Yeah Can't hold a straydog on a leash 
So let your wild blood run free 
I just learned from a lottery 
That good intentions 
Always paved the road to hell Some things are not just black & white 
Somebody's gotta shine 
In colours and it could be me 
Out of the Jungle 
Into remedy Out of the Jungle 
Into remedy Some things are not just black & white 
Somebody's gotta shine 
In colours and it could be me 
Out of the Jungle 
Into remedy Some things are not just black & white 
Somebody's gotta shine 
In colours and it could be me 
Out of the Jungle 
Into remedy Some things are not just black & white 
Somebody's gotta shine 
In colours and it could be me 
Out of the Jungle 
Into remedy Some things are not just black & white 
Somebody's gotta shine 
In colours and it could be me 
Out of the Jungle 
Into remedy
