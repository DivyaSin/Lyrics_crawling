Early in the misty, misty morning 
Headin' for another freeway jam 
Sleepy eyed and shivering 
Waking up and wishing it was Sunday I wish it was Sunday 
On the radio they're playin' love songs 
Songs that make me want to turn around 
Factory gates are up ahead I wish that I was home in bed with you, my love 
Back home with you, my love But I work to make a living 
And I work without a break 
And I work when I am sleeping 
And I work when I'm awake Yes, and I'd like to leave the city 
But I can't afford the move 
And I think I'm goin' under 
With those way down low down 
Smokey factory blues I was born a lover not a worker 
Money doesn't smell like sweet perfume 
Some of us feel out of place 
With engine oil upon our face 
Believe me, you better believe me
