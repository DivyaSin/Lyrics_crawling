This is how its bout to go down, believe it or not, Im still here 
All you haters, time to shed another tear 
Because Im back in this bitch like your moms ex boyfriend 
All up in your face with some brand new nonsense 
Diss if you want to, go ahead and take a shot 
Sooner or later that shit goin be squashed 
Im a killa with an attitude road ragin like a fool 
Rolling with a family the size of a typhoon Chorus (x2) 
We aint going away 
We aint going away (nowhere) 
We aint going away 
We aint going away (far from reality) Who you think you fucking with? This shit getting serious 
Aint no time for busted lips, the shit I bust will turn you bitch 
Turn your back and walk away, keep on thinking that you safe 
Its a small world after all, so Ill just wait until that day 
To pull my heat and lay you out or grab my blade and start to scalp 
Either way I do not doubt the sweet revenge keeps me around 
Silently right on your trail, if you live only time will tell 
Ill be there though if you aint, so you can see we here to stay Chorus (x2) All my warriors get loud; make some room up in this crowd 
Let everyone else around; see how killers put shit down 
Pull it out and let it pop, listen to those bodies drop 
Let them all lay their in shock, at least now they know we dont play 
Everybody recognize Im not the type to tell you twice 
Fuck with me, I guarantee that someone going pay the price 
Show respect when in the room, Im killing all that I see though 
If you ever did me wrong, then I hope to see you soon Chorus(x4)
