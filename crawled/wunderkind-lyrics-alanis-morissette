Oh, perilous place walk backwards toward you 
Blink disbelieving eyes chilled to the bone 
Most visibly brave no apprehended bloom 
First to take this foot to virgin snow I am magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment 
I am a wunderkind 
And I live the envelope pushed far enough to believe this 
I am a princess on the way to my throne 
Destined to serve, destined to roam Oh, ominous place spellbound and un-child-proofed 
My least favorite shelter bear alone 
Compatriots in face they'd cringe if I told you 
Our best back pocket secret our bond full blown And I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment 
I am a wunderkind 
And I am pioneer naive enough to believe this 
I am a princess on the way to my throne 
Destined to seek, destined to know Most beautiful place reborn and blown off roof 
My view about face whether great will be done And I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment 
I am a wunderkind 
I am a groundbreaker naive enough to believe this 
I am a princess on the way to my throne And I am a magnet for all kinds of deeper wonderment 
I am a wunderkind I am a Joan of Arc and smart enough to believe this 
I am a princess on the way to my throne 
Destined to reign, destined to roam 
Destined to reign, destined to roam
