They're telling me to stop singing country 
That kind of music ain't much chop 
Record company man said hey Mr. Brand 
Why don't you start singing some pop 
You'll make more money, you'll get more honeys 
That's the way to go 
Well I thought for a second and a second's all it took and said 
Nah, I don't think so Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah I don't think so 
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah I don't think so 
I don't think so I've been doing my best to please her 
Even made her breaky in bed 
Cleaned up the yard, polished her car 
Put the rusty old ute in the shed 
But when she said hon, we're going to mum's 
And this time you've gotta go 
Well I thought for a second and a second's all it took and said 
Nah, I don't think so They tell me I should get me a sail boat 
A skipper on a yacht I should be 
Fresh sea air, breeze in my hair 
Sounds like way too much fun to me 
'Cause I've got a need for V8 speed 
And it ain't a race if tyres don't smoke 
Well I thought for a second and a second's all it took and said 
Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah I don't think so
