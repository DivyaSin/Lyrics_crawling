[Chorus] 
You just give a little love and it all comes back to you, 
You know you're gonna be remembered for the things that you say and do [Bashy] 
Boof ,Yo its BBB, 
Could be anything i wanted to be, 
Like movin x-men, 
Put the thought in my mind inception, 
From the hood where the fullstop don't mean the end of your sentence, 
We're tryna' get out like attention, 
Say cheese when I smile, See cheddar, 
In like don't be bitter, be better [Wretch 32] 
I started with nothing but an idea, 
Following my own steps in my Nike airs, 
Yeah, it was all or nothing, 
My story tryna' find a buzz in a lightyear, 
I go in when I step outdoors, 
You cant put in less and get out more, 
I went from opening locks, 
To sellin' jumpers so I'm over the top [Chorus] 
You just give a little love and it all comes back to you, 
You know you're gonna be remembered for the things that you say and do
