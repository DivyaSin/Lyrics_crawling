What is love if you dont have it 
It aint enough when you have it 
Things get rough when its a habit, what is love... 
What is love if you can break it 
What is love if you cant make it 
Falls apart when you forsake it, what is love... What is love, what is love, 
If it takes so long to find 
If it makes you lose your mind x2 
What is love. Ha!. 
What is love... What is gain without the giving 
I go insane without you, living 
Is a shame if you cant forgive me, then what is love... 
What is love if you can break it 
What is love if you cant, make it 
Falls apart if you forsake it, what is love... What is love, what is love, if it takes so long to find 
An if it makes you lose your mind what is love... 
What is love, what is love, love s a heart that never lies 
When it opens your eyes... then its love... You cannot feed the hand that bites you, no, no, 
If you bite the hand that feeds you baby 
Im the woman who needs you, take my hand, be my man... 
Dont ask me stupid questions, I dont wanna hear you mention, What is love, what is love, if it takes so long 
If it makes you lose your mind then what is love... 
Oh, what is love, what is love, love is a heart that never lies 
When it opens your eyes... 
What is love, love, love, if it takes long to find 
An if it makes you lose your mind what is love... oh 
What is love, love, love, its a heart that never lies 
When it opens your eyes 
What is love!
