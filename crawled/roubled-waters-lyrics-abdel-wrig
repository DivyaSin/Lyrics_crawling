Hunger is frequent, can't find food fi eat 
Can't pay the rent, some end up on the street 
Them tax we daily, system indiscreet 
Responsibilities, ends can hardly meet, hardly meet We all know that certain things take time 
But not forever 
Comfort yourself by singing these lines of mine Although the mountain is high 
I know that one day I will get by 
And although the bridges are low 
I'll take my chances 
To touch the troubled waters Poverty done deya, It's a global thing 
Crime and violence mek we head start spin, oh, what a thing 
You see the homeless youths them, trust me, what a thing 
Exposed to abuses, chances very slim, very slim We all know that certain things take time 
But not forever 
Comfort yourself by singing these lines of mine Although the mountain is high 
I know that one day I will get by 
And although the bridges are low 
I'll take my chances 
To touch the troubled waters Take, take, chance, chance 
Take, take, chance, chance Some ghetto youths see no choice but fi tek up the gun 
Some leave school with diploma 
Yet work them can't get none, oh, what a thing 
You think prison and death row system is such a fun, think again 
Suicide to me my view is fire burn, fire burn Although the mountain is high 
I know that one day I will get by 
And although the bridges are low 
I'll take my chances 
To touch the troubled waters Although the mountain is high 
I know that one day we will get by 
And although the bridges are low 
I'll take my chances 
To touch the troubled waters You'll can take a chances 
To touch the troubled waters 
I'll take my chances 
To touch the troubled waters Hunger is frequent, them tax we daily 
Can't pay the rent, poverty done deya
