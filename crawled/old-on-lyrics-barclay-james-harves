There's a girl that lives in the shadows 
Of the street where the music plays 
There she waits and looks from the outside 
There's an angel in her face 
But from her glass she sips a little comfort 
From the boys she takes a little more 
And she knows just how far she can take it 
In a moment she's out on the floor 
Hold on, she's got to keep a-moving 
Hold on, dance with the light 
Hold on, got to keep a-moving 
Hold on, into the night In her eyes they thought they saw a question 
Maybe she is looking their way 
As the night gets older are they wiser? 
Who will take her? No-one can say 
Does she know just how they feel about her? 
Can't she see she's driving them insane? 
When the music starts playing again 
They're saying Hold on, she's got to keep a-moving 
Hold on, dance with the light 
Hold on, got to keep a-moving 
Hold on, into the night
