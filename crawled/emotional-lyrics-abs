Oh, its still a mystery how she got me high 
Anticipating what she's gonna do 
Cause I can't seem to let it go, addicted by her drug 
Aint got no remedy for this contagious kind of love Didnt mean to get emotional 
Feel like I'm sinking 
It wasn't meant unintentional 
I can see what you was thinking 
Got a hole in her soul Thats the shape of a man 
Tell me who's your next victim 
It aint that she hates ya 
Its just her nature 
Baby, dont misunderstand I give her what she needs 
Don't ever seem enough 
Aint got no room to breathe 
Feels like a tainted love I need to get away 
Seems as though its been 
To belong cause when I try 
She pulls me right back in Didnt mean to get emotional 
Feel like I'm sinking 
It wasn't meant unintentional 
I can see what you was thinking 
Got a hole in her soul Thats the shape of a man 
Tell me who's your next victim 
It aint that she hates ya 
Its just her nature 
Baby, dont misunderstand Didnt mean to get emotional 
Feel like I'm sinking 
It wasn't meant unintentional 
I can see what you was thinking 
Got a hole in her soul Thats the shape of a man 
Tell me who's your next victim 
It aint that she hates ya 
Its just her nature 
Baby, dont misunderstand Aint nothing left to give 
Just a broken shell 
Just enough to live 
Just enough to tell a tale Didnt mean to get emotional 
Feel like I'm sinking 
It wasn't meant unintentional 
I can see what you was thinking 
Got a hole in her soul Thats the shape of a man 
Tell me who's your next victim 
It aint that she hates ya 
Its just her nature 
Baby, dont misunderstand
