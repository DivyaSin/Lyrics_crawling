All around me are familiar faces 
Worn out spaces, worn out places 
Bright and early for the daily races 
Goin' no where, goin' no where And their tears are fillin' up their glasses 
No expression, no expression 
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow 
No tomorrow, no tomorrow And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad 
The dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I ever had 
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take 
When people run in circles it's a very, very 
Mad world, mad world Children waitin' for the day they feel good 
Happy birthday, happy birthday 
Made to feel the way that every child should 
Sit and listen, sit and listen Went to school and I was very nervous 
No one knew me, no one knew me 
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson? 
Look right through me, look right through me And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad 
The dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had 
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take 
When people run in circles it's a very, very 
Mad world, mad world, mad world, mad world
