You could have kissed me 
Like this wasn't gonna last 
Kept me from saying 
Something I'll never take back 
You could've held me like there was no chance of me waking up where I am 
You could have stopped short of every dream I ever had So help me girl 
You've gone too far 
It's way too late 
To save my heart 
The way it feels 
Each time we touch 
I know I've never been so loved 
And I can't help myself 
So help me girl You had to be there when that old sun came up 
Making last night feel like a vision of things yet to come 
You just had to hold me like nobody else 
Now look what you've gone and done 
You had to love me 
'Til I just can't get enough So help me girl 
You've gone too far 
It's way too late 
Too save my heart 
The way it's feel 
Each time we touch 
I know I've never been so loved 
And I can't help myself 
So help me girl 
And I can't help myself 
So help me girl
