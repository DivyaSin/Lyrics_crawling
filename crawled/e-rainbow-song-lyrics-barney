Oh I like red it's the color of an apple 
Orange it's the color of an orange 
Yellow its a lemon and a wonderful sun, sun, sun Green its the color of the trees and lots of things that grow 
And then there's blue for the sky 
And purple that's a color that's fun, fun, fun And when you put those colors side by side 
Now what do you think we've done 
We've made a rainbow 
And it's a really beautiful one, one, one Oh I like red it's the color of an apple 
Orange it's the color of an orange 
Yellow its a lemon and a wonderful sun, sun, sun 
And my favorite Green its the color of the trees and lots of things that grow 
And then there's blue for the sky 
And purple that's a color that's fun, fun, fun And when you put those colors side by side 
Now what do you think we've done 
We've made a rainbow 
Oh, we've made a rainbow 
We've made a rainbow 
And it's a really beautiful one
