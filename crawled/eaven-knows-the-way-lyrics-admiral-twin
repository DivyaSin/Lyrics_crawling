Standing outside 
Looking inside 
Through the wall 
I stumbled sagely 
I predicted my own fall 
She pretends 
That she can't hear me 
When I call 
I'm feeling low and... An hour later 
Or maybe it's been three 
I break a door down 
With a neighbors Christmas tree 
I find her in a corner 
Choking on her hopes 
And misery 
She's fading fast 'cos she can't find 
Her own way 
Heaven knows the way 
Heaven knows the way My alibi says 
It was just a social call 
I stumbled sagely 
I predicted my own fall 
The politics of failure 
Never seemed to 
Bother her at all 
She never made a sound 'cos she can't find 
Her own way 
Heaven knows the way 
Heaven knows the way Standing outside 
Looking inside 
Through the wall 
I stumbled sagely 
I predicted my own fall 
She pretends 
That she can't hear me 
When I call 
I'm feeling low and... She can't find her own way 
Heaven knows the way 
Heaven knows the way
