everything i thought was real 
every dream, every feeling cold 
all the ghosts i tried to run from 
all the storms rusting into me 
. . . SO TELL ME HOW TO FEEL 
NOW THAT YOU AREN'T REAL 
THERE'S NOTHING TO REVEAL i ran on glass, broke my bones so i could find you 
i cut myself to be around you 
and when i bled, you disappeared 
just like you knew i always feared 
i closed my eyes, and climbed on you so i could breathe 
i hung my noose around your tree 
suffered addiction to the air around you 
now my whole world exists without you i was a son, i was an angel falling from heaven 
i was a slave to your oppression 
the prophets never spoke of reasons 
for me or for my bitter freedom 
you spit on me, filled my dirt with seeds of black 
as i carved your name across my back 
burned out my eyes into your sun 
oh, can't you see now what you've done to me? if i close my eyes, will this all go away? 
if i take your pill, will it all fade away? 
if i wake myself, will my darkness peel? 
i can't sleep away because nothing is real. 
if i close my eyes, will this all go away? 
if i take your pill, will it all fade away? 
if i wake myself, will my darkness peel? 
i can't sleep, nothing left is real. 
there's nothing left to feel 
nothing left is real 
there's nothing left to feel 
so tell me how to feel
