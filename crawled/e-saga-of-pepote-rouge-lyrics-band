There's a legend of a lady on the mountain 
Lives alone beyond the Mecca plain 
And with her hands she makes it through the winter 
She never goes against the grain To be someone is to be someone alone 
To be someone is known as solitude 
To learn to sing below the surface 
You must adjust your altitude Break the news, the Pepote Rouge is coming to town 
We stand accused, Pepote Rouge, of bein' hell bound 
She had a vision, and now she holds the key 
You don't know what you want, till you find out what you need I was stranded on the damn coast when a lady 
Called to me in a voice so soft and low 
Her words resounded like a fountain of truth 
And then she faded like a rainbow Her golden spaceship with the mother of the earth 
Carved in stone, the queen of avatars 
Where seventy children were given birth 
She then returned back to the stars Break the news, the Pepote Rouge is coming to town 
We stand accused, Pepote Rouge, of bein' hell bound 
She can help us find our way and get across 
You don't know what you gained, till you find out what you lost The Pepote Rouge come down from the mountain 
And lead our people into the light of day 
For they are lost and know not where they're goin' 
And all their leaders are cast in clay Now disbelief and mass confusion 
Spreading wild across the land 
You can call it love or call it wisdom 
To be not savin' a drowning man Break the news, the Pepote Rouge is coming to town 
We stand accused, Pepote Rouge, of bein' hell bound 
She can show us just where we went wrong 
You don't know where you're goin', till you find where you belong
