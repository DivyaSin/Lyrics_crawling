Way down in the land of twins 
We tell ourselves the part like this 
By clues we leave the things that breathe 
Down in the bottom of the sea We're on the wrong side 
Of young Atlantis 
Ah ah Fashioned out of rags and straw

Your face, my shape, my soul, your page 
You changed, you knew that I loved you, blue And on the wrong side 
Of young Atlantis

Yes, I loved you, blue Some treasure stripped from sunken ships 
From those who sailed and lost their shit 
But not their way, they sail with me 
They drown with me, they ride for free And on the wrong side 
Of young Atlantis 
I - And on the wrong side 
Of young Atlantis 
I -
