It was painted red 
It's stripe was white 
It was 18 feet 
From the bow to the stern light 
2nd hand from a dealer in Atlanta 
I rode up with daddy 
When he went there to get her 
Put on a shine 
Put on a motor 
Built out of love 
And made for water 
Ran it for years 
Till the transom got rotton 
A piece of my childhood that'll never be forgotten 
It was, just an old plywood boat 
75 johnson with electric choke 
A young boy, two hands on the wheel 
I cant replace the way it made me feel 
And I would turn it shore line, and, make it wide 
He'd say, ya can't beat the way an old wood boat rides 
Just a little lake across the Alabama line 
But I was king of the ocean, when daddy let me drive Just an old 1/2 ton, short-bed Ford 
My uncle bought new, in '64 
Daddy got it right 
Cause the engine was smokin' 
Couple of burnt valves and he had it goin' 
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load 
Down a dirt strip, where we'd dump trash 
Off of Thickpin Road I would sit on the seat 
And stretch my feet out to the pedals 
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal 
It was just an old hand-me-down ford 
With 3 speed on the column 
And a dent in the door A young boy, 2 hands on the wheel 
I can't replace the way it, made me feel 
And I would press that clutch and I'd keep it right 
He'd say a lil' slower son you're doin' just fine 
Just a dirt road with trash on each side 
But I was Mario Andretti 
When daddy let me drive
