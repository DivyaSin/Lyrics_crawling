Late at night hear the call 
Of the danger to us all 
In the dark he hangs around 
In the dark he'll drag you down He's a rockin' wrecker, he's a rocking man 
He's a rockin' wrecker, he's a rocking man Man, the lifeboat don't go under 
Hear him laugh hear the thunder 
You can cry, you can weep 
He wants to send you to the deep He's a rockin' wrecker, he's a wrecking man 
He's a wreckin' rocker, he's rocking man Wrecker End the storm, can you save 
Your body from a watery grave? 
On the rocks he's hanging around 
He just wants to watch you drown He's a rockin' wrecker, he's a rocking man 
He's a rockin' wrecker, he's a rocking man 
He's a rockin' wrecker, he's a wrecking man 
He's a wreckin' rocker, he's rocking man He's a rockin' wrecker, he's a rocking man 
He's a rockin' wrecker, he's a rocking man 
He's a rockin' wrecker, he's a wrecking man 
He's a wreckin' rocker, he's rocking man
