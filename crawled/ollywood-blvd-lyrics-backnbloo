Ponies on another display 
Faces painted over a time that no longer is 
Riding on another good day 
Look at the show 
Look at 'em go 
Revel in the lies 
You're fading away CHORUS 
Knots and tangles 
Dreams mangled 
Knots and tangles 
Dreams mangled 
To be... 
Walking alone on Hollywood Blvd. Isn't this a wonderful place? 
Peace and quiet shattered by TVs and radios 
Making yet another mistake 
All that they know 
No where to go 
Revel in the lies 
You're fading away CHORUS 
Knots and tangles 
Dreams mangled 
Knots and tangles 
Dreams mangled 
To be... 
Walking alone on Hollywood Blvd. Knots and tangles 
Dreams mangled 
Knots and tangles 
Dreams mangled 
To be... 
To be... 
To be... 
Walking alone on Hollywood Blvd. Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood Blvd.
