Ah! 
You think you've got the looks 
You think you've got the fashion 
You thought you'd have me wanting more 
But don't like my reaction 
You think you're really something 
You're nothing to me now 
You thought you'd keep me coming 
Without ever thinking how 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
You think you're really special 
You think I think you're best 
You think you're really something? 
You're no better than the rest 
You've got everything you wanted 
Don't let yourself be fooled 
You thought that you could play the game 
But I just changed the rules 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
You! 
Why do I hate you 
You think you've got the looks 
You think you've got the fashion 
You thought you'd have me wanting more 
But don't like my reaction 
You think you're really something 
You're nothing to me now 
You thought you'd keep me coming 
Without ever thinking how 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you 
I hate you
