Right now I feel - just like a leaf on a breeze 
Who knows where it's blowin' 
Who knows where it's goin' 
I find myself somewhere I - I never thought I'd be 
Going 'round in circles 
Thinking about you and me 
How do I explain it when I don't know what to say 
What do I do now - so much has changed Nothing I have ever known - has made me feel this way 
Nothing I have ever seen - has made me want to stay 
But here I am - ready for you 
I'm torn 'n, I'm fallin' - I hear my home callin' 
Hey - I've never felt somethin' so strong - oh no 
It's like nothing I've ever known Now you're the one I'm lookin for 
You're the one I need 
You're the one that gives me - a reason to believe 
Following a star - has lead to where you are 
It feels so stong now - this can't be wrong now Nothing I have ever known - has made me feel this way 
Nothing I have ever seen - has made me want to stay 
But here I am - ready for you 
I'm torn 'n, I'm fallin' - I hear my home callin' 
Hey - I've never felt somethin' so strong - oh no 
It's like nothing I've ever known It's like nothing I've ever known Right now I feel - like a leaf on a breeze 
Who knows where it's blowin' 
Who knows where I'm goin'
