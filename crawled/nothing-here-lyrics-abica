I gotta rub my eyes to make sure that I see it 
Yea I see the tats and I can't believe it 
We were just two kids making songs for fun 
Now we grew and spread and the songs begun 
It's like our lives have changed but we're still the same 
It's like I'm stuck here can't get out of this game 
And I know what it's like when you want to quit 
And I know even better to ignore that shit 
I don't need this right now in fact I never did 
You can't keep it under wraps just subtract the lid 
You're just a leech just a bug just a fucking excuse 
With your hand on my shoulder while your tying my noose Chorus 
I'm coming home 
I travel alone this way 
I'm coming home 
I'm coming home today 
I'm coming home 
Nothing here to make me stay 
I'm coming home 
I'll be coming home today I been, I been, I been so true to this 
You wouldn't fucking believe the time I spend on this 
And everything else I pushed it all to the side 
I play my music so loud it's all been buried alive 
I'm talking relationships, It's part of this 
I'm thinking it, it just cannot fit that's why I try to be avoiding it 
The biggest mistake you make from all of this 
Is mistaken how I choose to be alone thinking it's loneliness I'm coming home 
I travel alone this way 
I'm coming home 
I'm coming home today 
I'm coming home 
Nothing here to make me stay 
I'm coming home 
I'll be coming home today Today, today, today 
I'm coming home 
Today, today, today 
I'm coming home 
I'm coming home 
Yeah, to the place I used to go 
The place I used to know is not a place that I can go 
No, no, to the place I used to know 
The place where I'm alone is not a place that you should know 
Looking back like I thought it would be easy 
Like I never thought that my past would ever leave me 
I gotta slow down it seems like everything's faster 
I wanna take this in It's like a beautiful disaster 
You can be my master as I sift through the pieces 
Stuck in the plaster like the folds and the creases 
I wanna do it all before I'm under the stone 
Reminiscing, but I'm missin that I'm already home, come on I'm coming home 
I travel alone this way 
I'm coming home 
I'm coming home today 
I'm coming home 
Nothing here to make me stay 
I'm coming home 
I'll be coming home today
