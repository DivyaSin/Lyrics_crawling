You think you're safe mother fuckers? 
You haven't turned out the lights 
You haven't taken a drink 
And we have yet to start our night 
He said he'd lay them to rest 
By the hands of a shotgun 
The more he spoke of this I was sure he was the Devil's son 
I am the life of the party given all the dead men here that surround me! 
Fuck! 
I am the life of the party given all the dead men here that surround me! 
Ya'll gonna know who I am 
A trigger happy son of a bitch 
God fucking damn, I'm just a mother fucking son of a bitch 
You're a pussy, and I heard you got a death wish 
So pack your bags and saddle up let's ride around town 
And see who is the first one under ground 
Shots! Shots! Shots! 
Shot him in the head 
Shots! Shots! Shots! 
Now he's fucking dead 
Shots! Shots! Shots! 
And I just don't feel bad 
Shots! Shots! Shots! 
For the bastard's Mom and Dad 
Fuck 
I am the Cowboy Killer 
I killed an innocent boy 
There are many imposters 
But I am the real McCoy 
I am the Cowboy Killer 
I killed an innocent boy 
There are many imposters 
But I am the real McCoy
