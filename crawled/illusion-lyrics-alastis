You're still wavering but your heart is strong; 
Sharp and gleaming the blade seduces you 
Your fingers are trembling, your heart races 
You feel well A picture, a dream, you appear I disappear 
Sublime recollection of a past time 
Where reality doesn't count anymore 
Alone with all world, left by your heart Do you remember your distress? 
Do you recall your life? 
Our roads cross but I remove you 
You're not allowed to cheat. United in eternity I give you up to reality, 
Illusory but so sad
