Eyes are still red, coming apart 
The lies won't take me far 
Body aches, these hands shake 
Dealing comes with scars 
It's hard to sleep with all that's questioned Can I find peace of mind 
Barricades in time 
Can I find peace inside 
And let love come save my life Tried to forget, feelings of death 
Invading panic spawns, can't concentrate 
No one relates, stealing all the light 
Spreading thin the soul in sections Can I find peace of mind 
Barricades in time 
Can I find peace inside 
And let love come save my life The enemy's my own thinking 
I never let it show 
The weight of me I am sinking 
I fight this more than you know Can I find peace of mind 
Barricades in time 
(Can I find peace of mind) 
Can I find peace inside 
And let love come save my life 
(Everything is fine) Can I find peace of mind 
(Barricades in time) 
If you ask, everything is fine 
(Everything is fine) 
Can I find peace inside 
(Barricades in time) As I deal with my own strife 
The enemy's my own thinking 
I'll never let it show 
The weight on me I am sinking 
I fight this more than you know
