So salvation, here runs the flood, here dies the love 
The banner of the ungranted and our darkest days 
The feelings that were forced 
Out of fear without a drop of remorse Now, that the pain is released 
With cryptic seals and signs 
Running over the heartstrings wretched and run dry 
When the feathered begin to fall With a voice like glass 
Born to splint and shatter 
The touch of sunlight 
Like heavens plague, the birth of black With hung halos of wrath and decay 
The furthest of faith, the rider of plagues Our hands have reached the end of skin 
Sifted straight to bone 
Bare and broken As the inventors hope 
Unseen by the believed 
Unbelieved by all who see So when you become every dream abhorred 
A being so bitter not worth 
The weight of ice in his words With a voice like glass 
Born to splint and shatter 
The touch of sunlight 
Like heavens plague, the birth of black With hung halos of wrath and decay 
The furthest of faith, the rider of plagues With a voice just like glass 
Born to splint and born to shatter 
The touch of sunlight 
Like heavens plague, the birth of black With hung halos of wrath and decay 
The furthest of faith, the rider of plagues
