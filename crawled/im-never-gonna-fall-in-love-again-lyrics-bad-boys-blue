I have wasted too much time 
Feeling sorry just for myself 
But suddenly I realize 
I don't need nobody else 
I just walk out through the door 
You won't see me anymore [Chorus: ] 
I'm never gonna fall in love again 
I don't want no love no more 
I'm never gonna fall in love again 
For I've been hurt so much before 
Love can shake you, break you 
Love can bring you down 
I was sorry to see you go 
But baby true love can be tough Agony and ecstasy 
Joy and pain I've had enough 
I can make it all alone 
Face my life, just on my own [Chorus: Repeat 4x]
