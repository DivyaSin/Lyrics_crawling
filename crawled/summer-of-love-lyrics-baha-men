Baby, be mine in the summer of love 
Spendin' time in the summer of love I've been waiting all year for the summer 
And a chance that I'll see you again 
Hanging out at one beach or another 
With friends, yeah All the trees start to sway to the music 
And the breeze starts caressing your hair 
Summer love makes my heart 
Sing and jump in the air The days are getting longer 
And the moon stays up all night 
So be mine in the summer of love 
Spendin' time in the summer of love Everybody sing la, la, la 
'cause everybody sing la, la, la, yeah I don't know who you are, but I'll find you 
Your face must shine like rays from the sun 
Then I'll know you're the one 
And the summer's begun The days are getting longer 
And the moon stays out all night 
So, be mine in the summer of love 
Spendin' time together in the summer of love And everybody is going to sing la, la, la 
Come on, everybody, la, la, la Summer love is all around the world 
Summer love is all around the world 
Summer love is all around the world 
So, listen to me, baby, listen to me, baby 
Listen to me Come on, my baby, let me work it 
I want to whip it and we're down to the over 
I may want you to work it 
I may want you to turn it around now I may want you to work it 
You and me, that's how it's going to be now 
Come on, my baby, let me work it 
And you can be mine so bring it down to me 
With that [Unverified] swing The nights are getting longer 
And the stars stay out all night 
Everybody going to be all right 
In the summer of love, the summer of love 
Spendin' time together in the summer of love Everybody is going to sing la, la, la 
Na, na, na, la, la, la, oh, oh, la, la, la
