The first news was there's Americans on the shore 
Maybe maybe maybe now we're all going to war 
Maybe maybe maybe they will be screaming out for more 
Maybe maybe maybe they will be running for the door Got the tickets and a dirty nose 
No one wants to help but everybody knows 
Start with babyshambles and your friends will come to blows 
And babyshambled when you're timid at the shows You don't need no one 
You don't need no one who feels the same old way 
Oh it's a shame, we were just getting comfy The first news was there's Americans on the shore 
Maybe maybe maybe now we're all going to war 
Maybe maybe maybe they will be screaming out for more 
Maybe maybe maybe they will be running for the door
