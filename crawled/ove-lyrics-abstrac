I'm tired of being afraid 
But nothing's gonna change 
It's more than just a stupid friend 
Yeah he's got a hold on me 
Singing why would you do this 
Why put me through this All I wanna do 
I'm tired of saying you love me 
And hate it 
All I wanna do is move 
All I wanna do is move Another night with you again 
Hands shaking tryna move the pen 
Killing me on you I depend 
No matter what I do you always in my head 
You took over my life 
Got me living dreams that keep me up at night 
Are you even aware of my sacrifice ? 
Took away any hope of a normal life You laugh cause you know I never wanted that 
You took over my future to help with my past 
Is that a deal with the devil? 
Or is that a deal with a god? 
Am I just at war with the odds 
Or am I about to break even? You know that I would be lying to you to say 
I never think about leaving 
Somehow I keep on believing 
Bigger reasons that you keep me breathing 
I know there's people who need it I just hope that it's right that I lead em 
I hope you got something bigger planned 
Cause lately I'm questioning everything 
But I know that we came too far to go back 
Just hope that you don't stab me in the back Singing why would you do this 
Why put me through this 
All I wanna do 
I'm tired of saying you love me 
And hate it 
All I wanna do is move 
All I wanna do is move Back in my bedroom studio 
Thought we'd be outta here years ago 
Working 2 jobs not countin you 
You aint really pulling weight like you said you'd do 
You ain't really taking shape like they said you would You ain't really making moves 
Like we thought you could 
But fuck it we work till we on for good 
Millie on Millie when im talkin views 
It aint like the world hasn't heard what we do Working these hours just so I can move 
Get back to the city and back to the crew, 
Back to the grind 
I swear I'm losing my mind 
I swear I'm losing the time 
I swear that I'm overdue for the crown 
You know I'm working for mine Singing why would you do this 
Why put me through this 
All I wanna do 
I'm tired of saying you love me 
And hate it 
All I wanna do is move 
All I wanna do is move
