In the deepest darkness of your eyes, 
Where the beautiful silence lies, 
Where no light has ever shinned, 
Where no one has ever looked inside... Behind the peaceful presence, 
Covered beneath lays the essence, 
Of all human-like abhorrence... The one I shall forever despise, 
Once shinned in my own eyes, 
The one that is now my enemy, 
Was once a part of me... Raped by the screams of your inner voice, 
Still remaining unconscious of your choice, 
The torturing methods you deserve to feel, 
Would be far beyond impossible to heal...
