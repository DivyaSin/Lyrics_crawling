Let me put my arms around you 
Give me refuge in your soul 
I have drunk from fire water 
Free spirits rising in the world The new moon rises from the darkness 
Lord I need a healing prayer 
Give me a medicine for fever 
Give me the cure, give me the cure so I can see Raw 
Burnt back to the bone 
Raw 
You gotta leave this child alone 
Raw 
I ain't got no home 
I Burnt right back 
Burnt right back to the bone I am falling, I am falling 
Feels like I fixin' to die 
Wild, wild horses could not drag me away 
From this earth to heavens gate Raw 
Burnt back to the bone 
Raw 
You gotta leave this child alone 
Raw 
I ain't got no home 
I Burnt right back 
Burnt right back to the bone Running like a river 
Rolling like a train 
Free spirits rising 
In the world today Free spirits rising in the world Raw 
Burnt back to the bone 
Raw 
You'd better leave this child alone 
Raw 
I ain't got no home 
Raw Raw 
Burnt back to the bone 
Raw 
You'd better leave this child alone 
Raw 
I ain't got no home 
Raw Running like a river 
Rolling like a train Raw 
Why don't we do it 
Why don't we do it 
Why don't we do it in the raw You'd better leave this child alone 
Come on baby 
Come on baby
