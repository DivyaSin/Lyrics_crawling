Drenched in Moonlight, your eyes just right 
You moved me from the day we met 
Today I'm lost, a moment gone 
In a dream like emotion You was on my mind, every single night It wont be long now, before we get drowned 
Before we hit them clouds 
It wont be long now, before we get drowned 
Before we leave this demon world 
It wont be long now, before we get drowned 
Before we leave this demon world We set them goals of nothing 
Searching trying to find something 
We get blinded by them bright lights 
We get blinded by our own insides You was on my mind, every single night It wont be long now, before we get drowned 
Before we hit them clouds 
It wont be long now, before we get drowned 
Before we leave this demon world 
It wont be long now, before we get drowned 
Before we leave this demon world
