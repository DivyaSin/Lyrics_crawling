Every time I walk on by 
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world 
a thing left to repeat And I was walking on your floor 
begging to get more 
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world 
a thing left to ask for yeah 
So leave my broken bones 
I'll take a load of your skin 
throw me all your stones 
for me to sit around in 
yeah Every time I walk on by 
Stroll along these streets 
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world, 
a thing left to repeat So leave my broken bones 
I'll take a load of your skin 
throw me all your stones 
for me to sit around in So leave my broken bones 
I'll take a load of your skin 
throw me all your stones 
for me to sit around in Don't you know 
Don't you know what to say 
Every time you think about it 
talk around it again Don't you know 
Don't you know where to stay 
Every time you think about it 
talk around it again Don't you know 
Don't you know where to stay 
Every time you think about it 
talk around it again
