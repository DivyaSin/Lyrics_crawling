Inside a seed 
a thread of life winds oh so aimlessly from breech to breech 
and in between to rise 
and blossom oh so gently toward the sky 
to catch the eye 
of passersby the colors fade 
into duller days 
with bleak terrain Life will bloom so delicately 
right before our eyes we see it clearly passing time slips oh so quickly 
out from under rolling skies Inside a seed 
a thread of life winds oh so aimlessly from breech to breech 
and in between to rise 
and blossom oh so gently toward the sky 
to catch the eye 
of passersby the colors fade 
into duller days 
with bleak terrain when a cycle strays 
from dark alleys 
for fear of change Tides will rise while mountains crumble 
In the end the earth will tremble Life will bloom so delicately 
right before our eyes we see it clearly passing time slips oh so quickly 
out from under rolling skies And we'll resign 
to the dirt to reside 
'til the earth can unwind 
and stand still for all time...
