I've never been wrong 
But you're the only one I trust to 
Show me the way, I always hear your voice 
And in my dreams I hear you calling my name What is it about you? 
Some kind of light shines from your face 
And I can't turn away I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes 
I've been taken and I've been hypnotized 
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes 
I've been taken, I've been hypnotized And your eyes say everything 
You wanna keep me here forever 
I can't escape, one minute's so sincere 
Then you completely turn against me and I'm afraid You don't have to say, you love me 
'Cause if you want me, I'll stay 
'Cause I can't turn away I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes 
I've been taken, taken by surprise 
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes 
I've been taken and I've been hypnotized I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes 
I've been taken, I've been taken and I've been hypnotized 
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes 
I've been taken, I've been taken by surprise
