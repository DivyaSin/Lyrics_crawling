Around the bed frame hollow cans 
and rings from coffee cups line the pages on the desk 
monday spent mourning the sun 
while taste still lingers from something lost along the way and you're the worst 
at what you love the best 
and up till now: 
an experiment around the staircase pools of dried blood 
singing you to sleep 
the dishes will know to do themselves 
I can't remember places but I do recall the name 
of something lost along the way and we used to know where we all would go when where gone 
and whispers of doubt that escaped our mouth carried home 
and as the night kept our parents in bed we burned new york to the ground 
and we used to know where we all would go when were gone
