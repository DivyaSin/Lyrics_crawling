You a-go tired fe see me face 
Can't get me out of the race 
Oh, man, you said I'm in your place 
And then you draw bad card

Say you want to bring another life to shame 
Oh, man, you just a-playing a game 
And then you draw bad card (draw bad card) 
A-make you draw bad card (draw bad card) 
A-make you draw bad card I want to disturb my neighbour 
'Cause I'm feelin' so right

Blow them to full watts tonight, eh 
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style 
In a rub-a-dub style, in a rub-a-dub style 'Cause we guarding the palace so majestic 
Guarding the palace so realistic
