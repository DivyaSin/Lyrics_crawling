A chemical weapon has been released now well never rest in peace 
Hunted and gutted for a weapon of death, 
clutching the bombs you draw your last breath 
The greedy homeless are picking at the locks, 
and soon infectious gas is swirling around 
Burning the skin of the living, transformed were the living dead 
Poisoned the earth and poisoned the sky 
Clouds of death cause hundreds to die 
Zombie Nation - rotting corpses roam the streets 
Zombie Nation - where the dead no longer sleep 
Zombie Nation - witness to this gruesome scene 
Zombie Nation - cant pretend its only a dream 
The greedy homeless are picking at the locks, 
and soon infectious gas is swirling around 
Burning the skin of the living, transformed were the living dead 
Poisoned the earth and poisoned the sky, clouds of death cause hundreds to die 
But some will rise and return to feed, preying on the living with murderous greed 
Zombie Nation - ghouls feeding on the screaming 
Zombie Nation - dearly departed on the grieving 
Zombie Nation - Hideous creatures all around pulling themselves out of the fucking ground 
Zombies - walking bags of rotted meat 
Zombies - think your flesh is quite a treat 
Zombies - created for power gains 
Zombies - another weapon its all the same 
Zombies - grisly armies of the night 
Zombies - devouring the country side 
Zombies - more and more at the gates 
Zombies - mankind has sealed his fucking fate 
A suicide mission from the start 
Now youve returned without a beating heart 
Feel your body start to change 
Give the weapon back to the deranged
