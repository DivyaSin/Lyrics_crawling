It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it 
And that's what gets results It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it 
And that's what gets results You can try hard don't mean a thing 
Take it easy and then your jive will swing It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it 
And that's what gets results I thought I was smart but I soon found out 
I didn't know what life was all about 
But then I learnt I must confess 
That life is like a game of chess It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it 
And that's what gets results You can try hard don't mean a thing 
Take it easy and then your jive will swing It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it 
And that's what gets results It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the time that you do it 
And that's what gets results It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it 
It ain't what you do it's the place that you do it
