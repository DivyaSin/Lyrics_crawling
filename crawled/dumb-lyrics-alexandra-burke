Baby I'm loving your lips, 
Cause you know how to use them 
I wanna fall in your eyes but there's nothing behind them 
Look too good to eat, I just can't believe we can't talk about nothin' 
You so fire hot but that's all you got, you're just all about one thing 
So bye bye baby 
Could've had it 
Should've had it 
Would've had it 
If you were a little less dumb Could've had it 
Should've had it 
Would've had it 
If you were a little less 
Dumb dumb dumb dumb 
Bye bye baby 
Dumb dumb dumb dumb 
Bye bye baby You spend more time on look than the rest of my girl friends 
I keep trying to go deep but you don't have a deep end 
There's just nothing there you play with your hair, 
Stuck in front of that mirror 
I need something more, more than a ken doll, 
I can't make it more clearer 
So bye bye baby Could've had it 
Should've had it 
Would've had it 
If you were a little less dumb Could've had it 
Should've had it 
Would've had it 
If you were a little less 
Dumb dumb dumb dumb 
Bye bye baby 
Dumb dumb dumb dumb 
Bye bye baby For such a pretty face, boy your such a waste 
Dumb dumb dumb 
For such a pretty face, boy your such a waste 
Dumb dumb dumb Could've had it 
Should've had it 
Would've had it 
If you were a little less dumb Could've had it 
Should've had it 
Would've had it 
If you were a little less dumb Could've had it 
Should've had it 
Would've had it 
If you were a little less dumb Could've had it 
Should've had it 
Would've had it 
If you were a little less Dumb dumb dumb dumb 
Bye bye baby 
Dumb dumb dumb dumb 
Bye bye baby
