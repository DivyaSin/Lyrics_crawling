I never thought I was strong enough 
To handle raising my own son 
You'll feel what you've never done 
I hope he'll know me when I come home Nothing's gonna change my love for you 
I love my child 
He's got his mother's smile 
I'm so fortunate 
So fortunate 
Life can get tight 
But I will make it right 
I'm so fortunate 
So fortunate Oh yeah 
I had to learn what meant more to me 
My families became everything 
I miss you more than you'll ever know 
I wish that I can just leave, come home Nothing's gonna change my love for you 
I love my child 
He's got his mother's smile 
I'm so fortunate 
So fortunate 
Life can get tight 
But I will make it right 
I'm so fortunate 
So fortunate 
So fortunate
