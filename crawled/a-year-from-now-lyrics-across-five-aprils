Complete and total adoration, 
My gift to you, my heart was yours. In ten weeks you shaped it, 
In one night you murdered it. Torn from my chest and laid at your feet, 
That first step you took was the worst. 
Since then you've walked a thousand miles in silence and short remark, 
I still have these memories, 
But we'll never see what we could have been. Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now? 
Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go? 
Remember, cause that's all you can do. We'll never make another memory, 
We'll never make another memory. I wish I'd have died in your arms the last time we were together, 
So I wouldn't have to wake without you today. 
This time I thought things were real. 
You said they were, what happened? 
You were a priority, was I an 
option? I let you see a side of me that I don't share with anyone. 
Promises are just words unless they are fulfilled. 
you knew from the beginning all I had to offer you was my heart, 
I'm sorry that wasn't enough. So, we'll go our own ways, 
And hopefully you'll remember the things I've told you, 
Hopefully you'll understand that everything I said was in sincerity. A broken heart is not what I wanted from this, 
But I guess I've learned from it. But aren't you supposed to learn from your mistakes? 
I don't consider this a mistake, 
I just wish the story didn't end this way, Cause I'm still in love with the person who helped me write it. Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go? 
Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now?
