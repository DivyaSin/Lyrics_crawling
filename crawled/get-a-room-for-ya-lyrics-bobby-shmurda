[Hook - Abillyon] 
Baby, I'm gon' get a room for ya 
I look like a goon to ya 
You don't know what I'll do to ya 
And you look like the usual 
I feel like I'm losing ya 
I'm gon' bust my tool for ya 
You don't know what I do for ya 
I'm gon' keep my cool for ya [Verse 1 - Bobby Shmurda] 
Cool kid, girl I might bust a juice in your eye 
Tell her go and get a room key, girl Imma get a room for us 
Hit me, she told me bout my groupies 
Girl that's just groupie love 
Then I told her bout my two seat 
And who I had in my two seater 
I was rolling like them Drake from DeGrassi, I think I'm fancy 
I won't let em feel this cash me, I let em pass me 
Anigga all about that cash see but if you ask me 
I like em classy but love em nasty 
She gave me head up in my backseat, that's where my gat be 
I leave a million in the alley to fly to Paris 
But then she call me like a taxi so she can text me 
I told that bitch go get my batteries and rub my Cali [Hook] [Verse 2 - Rowdy Rebel] 
Late nights, great sex 
She came first, I came next 
Fucking up this telly 
Watch the walls in this room sweat 
Took a train, I called a jet 
Tell them nigga come get wrecked or Billy Holmes to cut the check 
Put a foot on nigga's neck before a nigga disrespect I disconnect a nigga's neck 
Took a trip out west just to help me with the stress 
Girl excuse me for my foolish thought cause I'm just getting used to you 
Before the brother's [?], grab a room for ya 
I swear to keep it true to ya 
Because true was all she knew before she met me, now it's two of us 
I got her riding in the newest stuff 
I bought the Bentley coupe, baby girl says she wants the Beamer truck 
Fill her tank up, I fill her bank up 
Kiss her, make up, we always break up 
Girl look what this world do to us 
Let's go and get lost baby, I got a room for us
