Goin' on my way, 
Packin' up today, 
I can't live a life with this way of thinkin' 
'Cause I know what's right, 
I'm gonna leave tonight, 
and put all the past behind me 
Chorus 
Show me life,bigger than I know I wanna feel more than alive 
Show me love,beautiful and true,change the old to new inside 
Show me life,Yeah yeah yeah ye-aah 
Can i fall apart ? 
right into your arms, 
open my eyes to the road that leads beyond my heart..Oh 
Chorus 
Show me life,bigger than I know I wanna feel more than alive 
Show me love,beautiful and true,change the old to new inside 
Show me life,show me li-iiiife 
Goin' on my way, 
Packin' up today, 
Can I fall apart and let go in your arms 
Chorus 
Show me 
life bigger than I know I wanna feel more than alive 
Show me love,beautiful and true,change the old to new inside 
Show me life,bigger than I know I wanna feel more than alive 
Show me love,beautiful and true,change the old to new inside 
Show me life,Show me life,Yeah yeah yeah ye-aah 
yeah yeah ye-aah,yeah yeah ye-aah 
Show me li-iife
