Well I wrestle with my toothbrush each morning at noon 
I stumble into the bathroom and have my shampoo 
I'm livin' in a suitcase; lookin' for a call 
Leerin' at the telephone and laughin' to the wall 
Now I got me a sweet thing she keeps me insane 
She lays on my chest in the morning if it rains 
I'm livin' in a suitcase; lookin' for a call 
Leerin' at the telephone and laughin' to the wall I'm a road dog at the motel holiday 
I often wonder what I wanna say 
Give me stage lights on a hot night 
And the bottom line is a real good time While the waitress is waiting for the waiter to wink 
She checks on her checks and she drinks on her drink 
I'm livin' in a suitcase; lookin' for a call 
Leerin' at the telephone and laughin' to the wall 
Now the nights go quickly when you're asleep 
But I'm out shufflin' for someplace to eat 
Like a breakfast at the egg house, a waffle on the griddle 
I'm burnt around the edges but I'm tender in the middle
