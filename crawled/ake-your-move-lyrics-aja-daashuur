Ive been waiting for you all of my life 
Ive been waiting for you to make that sacrifice 
Cant you see by the way I stand next to you 
That I want you to say that you love me too? (Chorus) 
So make you move, its time to choose 
Tell me youre mine before were out of time 
Make your move, its time to choose 
Tell me youre mine before were out of time Do you think about me late at night? 
Am I on your mind when you turn out the lights? 
I cant make it unless you tell me true 
That youll love me always, like I love you (Chorus) 
So make you move, its time to choose 
Tell me youre mine before were out of time 
Make your move, its time to choose 
Tell me youre mine before were out of time Ive been told that you like certain girls 
Girls with fair skin and hair with no curls 
But I can tell by the way you look at me 
That you will love me real soon, that we were meant to be Ive been waiting for you all of my life 
Ive been waiting for you to make that sacrifice 
Cant you see by the way I stand next to you 
That I want you to say that you love me too (Chorus) 
So make you move, its time to choose 
Tell me youre mine before were out of time 
Make your move, its time to choose 
Tell me youre mine before were out of time
