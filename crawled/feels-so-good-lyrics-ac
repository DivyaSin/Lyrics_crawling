Well, everybody's got an opinion 
That's loud and unbendin' 
I spend my time healin' and mendin', together 
It's a question of whether live positive well I give P-Nut joins our back, must be arthritic 
Tim is from the '70's and so we live it 
SA has the wisdom of a Nobel Laureate 
I'm down for our days of glory It's easy to do when you're up with Sexton 
A rhythmatic genius, turnin' up the next one 
Would you know, you're a bro 
I flow in that circumstance 
You'll get your chance Because payback is a motherfuckin' mission 
To the sharp-ass rocks slippin' on us but we rock 
It comes to writin' on us derision 
Sendin' you a voice now we're sendin' you a vision And those who fought me 
They say they taught me everythin' I know 
I go aww, when I hear that, that chit and that chat, bullshit 
So sick of me knowin' everything, saying In your face, that's right 
And it feels so good 
In your face, yeah 
It feels so good Take it to 'em bro, throw down, now say 
Settin' forth a course I'm really wiggin' out 
In my dome I roam, no time to doubt 
Fucked up you right there while I was rhymin' 
Now you're sulkin' in the corner, a baby cryin' Hittin' up now we feelin' to rock Mars 
Fuckin' up the shit, now their heads bob 
We ain't new to Jack Swing, the groove and that 
We got crazy factiffs and we all that I don't often rock and I'm a laureate 
I don't pull the punch you know I'm throwin' it 
Freestyles my style on the mic and flex 
You're stalkin' the mind of a punk that's next I get restarted now that I started you know 
A condition which I keep close together 
Like the kind buds you know my scene 
My team thinks I sin supreme But you, the weasel, 
Try to bring us down but in reality 
It make you look like a clown 
Too bad cause we'll be sittin' in the sun 
And choose a rocky ass fast ball In your face, that's right 
And it feels so good 
Choose a lock y'all 
In your face, yeah 
It feels so good 
Yo, P-Nut, beat that thing Won't you warm the mic Nicholas 
Can't get with this my stream 
Of conscience is a sea 
Much like Bukowski with a rage Speakin' to page 
Beasts in the cage 
Jumpin' off the stage 
Divin', thrivin' 
Strivin' for a better day or say Beat back by flesh 
Shattered doors braggin' fists 
To the sky we're feelin' high 
Has to live and die Just take a moment 
To have a bit once in a while 
You know, you know 
I do it daily and like it 
But that's my style, yeah, here I go In your face and down your throat 
And it feels so good, 'fraid so 
Fuck it up y'all 
In you face and down your throat 
It feels so good, that's all
