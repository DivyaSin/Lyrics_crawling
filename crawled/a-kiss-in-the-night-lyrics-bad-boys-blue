A kiss in the night Can't find a second chance for love 
Because a broken heart is never strong enough 
To find a new horizon where the dreams come true 
But even though my heart is longing for you A kiss in the night, lost in the dark 
When lovers hide, angels are crying 
Heaven's closed, no tears allowed 
When lovers try to say goodbye, goodbye 
A kiss in the night I feel you're still a part of me 
I will always love you in my fantasy 
The streets are dark and lonely, we walk hand in hand 
I understand our love has come to an end A kiss in the night, lost in the dark 
When lovers hide, angels are crying 
Heaven's closed, no tears allowed 
When lovers try to say goodbye, goodbye 
A kiss in the night A kiss in the night, you're mine A kiss in the night, lost in the dark 
When lovers hide, angels are crying 
Heaven's closed, no tears allowed 
When lovers try to say goodbye, goodbye 
A kiss in the night, oh, I go, a kiss in the night, oh, I go 
A kiss in the night, you're mine, a kiss in the night
