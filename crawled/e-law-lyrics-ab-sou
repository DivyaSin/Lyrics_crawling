[Intro: Ab-Soul] 
Love, Love is the law, love is the only law 
Yeah 
Love, Love is the law, love is the only law 
You should, you should do without [Hook] 
I've been slewing through the mail 
Fishing for a feed, to feed my female 
ASAP 
Nature is a mother, and life is a bitch 
I am convinced, God coming she just taking her time 
God coming she just taking her time 
Hey 
God coming she just taking her time 
God coming she just taking her time 
Ay [Verse 1] 
I get the feeling that you only playing hard to get 
Cause you ain't forget how much I love a challenge 
I know we were divided to restore the balance 
Hope I still get you wet while you bending over backwards 
Watching over me in ecstacy expecting me 
Ya number is 6 and 50 interestingly 
I hope you're still blue, with golden ovaries 
On your tippy toes for me, just how you posed to be 
They spoke of us in Cairo quite some time ago 
How these atoms adapt to this it's incredible 
They love to go to sleep, but hate to be awake 
Treat the eye of horus as if it's just a symbol 
Unattainable, they read the wrong rights 
They see the signs but ain't see what the sign saw 
But luckily love is the only law 
Love, love is the only.. [Hook: Mac Miller] 
I've been slewing through the mail 
Fishing for a feed, to feed my female 
ASAP 
Nature is a mother, and life is a bitch 
I am convinced, God coming she just taking her time 
God coming she just taking her time 
Hey 
God coming she just taking her time 
God coming she just taking her time 
Take your time baby [Bridge] 
Cause all my thoughts are lavender and pastel green 
And you the only one that know what I mean 
You know what I mean [Verse 2] 
And they say our separation was sacrificial and all 
But I'm in awe 
These hybrids getting high but they don't get it at all 
The pain of division is nothing 
The joy of disillusion is all but I'm in awe man 
I know that you were my discarded woman 
Like to say you everything but nothing 
But you nothing but my everything 
How should I explain 
Aye man [Hook: Mac Miller] 
I've been slewing through the mail 
Fishing for a feed, to feed my female 
ASAP, yeah 
Nature is a mother, and life is a bitch 
I am convinced, God coming she just taking her time 
God coming she just taking her time 
Yeah 
God coming she just taking her time 
God coming she just taking her time 
Take your time baby [Bridge] 
One time for the women 
Two times for the ladies 
Three times for the bitches 
Can't forget about the Queen [Verse 3: Rapsody] 
Queens, we are nodding back 
Understand we are his back and 
When he puts the arc in your back understand 
That we took him to heaven where those golden arcs are at 
Golden as sundrops, Queen 
When he looks in your eyes you show him where the stars are at 
And your beautiful, beautiful darkness 
And in return he replies that girl I'll be your night 
Your knight in shining armor 
Cause you're my heart, queen 
And lying on his chest our hearts beat box 
And you and I are queens 
We remind him that he can be all ours 
Cause we all Gods 
And God is Queen and God is love and 
Love stays above all 
Heaven, stars, queen, God, God [Bridge] 
Love 
Love 
Love 
Love is the only law 
Love is the only law 
Love [Outro] 
Ay yo Bentley, remember that chick you brought by the studio? 
You thought that was your woman, your woman 
Ain't your woman, she's soul's woman 
[laughing] 
It's love tho B it's love 
Yeah
