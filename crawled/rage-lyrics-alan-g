Hell will rise in the heart of a young boy 
He will grow into a man of Rage 
If his spirit can't fight what is lurking 
Watch the world, burn in flames Grieving fury will never be silenced 
Breaks the darkness with a violent dawn 
The drums of war sound an omen for battle 
The time has come, his sword is drawn Grief will unleash 
Every tear with the fire of the anger of angels 
Lost in his need 
Vengeance waits for a sign - oh! Rage 
Burns in the hearts of our sons 
This is the warning 
This is the hour 
Pain 
Damage that can't be undone 
See the anguish 
Feel the power 
Rage Future kings who inherit the silence 
Bear the penance of the lost and broken 
Their generation now doomed by the violence 
All their hope, unspoken Desperate fear 
Burdens their souls with the anger of angels 
All they hold dear 
Crashing down on them now - oh! Rage 
Burns in the hearts of our sons 
Fear their silence 
Fear the fury 
Pain 
Damage that can't be undone 
We are the guilty 
They are the jury 
Rage Tears for a world held hostage 
By a boy and his gun 
Heaven will weep forever 
For the loss of its sons Those who live between Heaven and Hell 
Out of the shadows their destruction will start 
Neglect is the crime, Retribution the weapon 
And the day will bow to the darkest of hearts - Oh! Rage 
Burns in the hearts of our sons 
This is the warning 
This is the hour 
Pain 
Damage that can't be undone 
See the anguish 
Feel the power Rage 
Burns in the hearts of our son 
Fear their silence 
Fear the fury 
Pain 
Damage that can't be undone 
We are the guilty 
They are the jury 
Rage
