I have the saddest feeling again, inside 
Don't think that I would hear from you, tonight 
Now the moon lights up, and all the stars will shine 
But I can't explain the way I feel inside Every shade of blue I see (I see) 
When you're away from me 
Thinking about you, oh-whoa 
Thinking about you Every shade of blue I cry (I cry) 
'Til the colors all but dry 
When I'm with out you, oh-whoa 
When I'm without you Alone in the darkness I can dream, of you 
Always the daylight comes around, too soon 
And the night goes on just like it never ends 
I keep holdin' on 'til you come back again Every shade of blue I see (I see) 
When you're away from me 
Thinking about you, oh-whoa 
Thinking about you Every shade of blue I cry (I cry) 
'Til the colors all but dry 
When I'm with out you, oh-whoa 
When I'm without you And the night goes on just like it never ends 
I keep holdin' on 'til you come back again Every shade of blue I see (I see) 
When you're away from me 
Thinking about you, oh-whoa 
Thinking about you Every shade of blue I cry (I cry) 
'Til the colors all but dry 
When I'm with out you, oh-whoa 
When I'm without you
