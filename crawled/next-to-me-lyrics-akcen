You might think I`m going out of my mind 
But I`m chasing out my dream 
`Cause I would go to the moon and back 
Just to tell you how I feel You claimed my heart, you claimed my soul 
I will never let you go 
You are my world, my favorite girl 
You make me lose control I wanna hold your hand by the sea 
Wanna feel you next to me 
I wanna see the sunrise in your eyes 
Wanna keep you by my side You claimed my heart, you claimed my soul 
I will never let you go 
I wanna see the sunrise in your eyes 
Wanna keep you by my side (I love you my baby 
You drive me so crazy x2 ) You might think I`m wasting all of my time 
But I`m not changing my mind 
`Cause I will hold you girl by my side 
I will hold you then in mind You claimed my heart, you claimed my soul 
I will never let you go 
You are my world, my favorite girl 
You make me lose control I wanna hold your hand by the sea 
Wanna feel you next to me 
I wanna see the sunrise in your eyes 
Wanna keep you by my side You claimed my heart, you claimed my soul 
I will never let you go 
I wanna see the sunrise in your eyes 
Wanna keep you by my side (I love you my baby 
You drve me so crazy x3 
I love you, I love you, I love you )
