A mindless pop song to distract you from the problems that occupy your 
life. 
A little story about a man who should have listened to his own advice. 
His eyes were hazel --he worked for public radio and drove a Chevy truck. 
His sister Rachel lived with a man who walked in circles getting nowhere 
fast. 
And one fine Sunday, as they were grilling teriyaki it started raining 
-And Rachel Evans looked at her husband and her brother and started 
laughing 
Cause on the hacienda the barbecue was slowly filling up with water. 
So they ordered pizza, and listened to a record by some band from Chapel 
Hill. 
And they sang: Na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na -- mindless pop song 
Na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na -- mindless pop song 
Na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na -- mindless pop song
