Sensitive boys 
Sensitive clothes 
Sensitive words 
Wrapped up in sensitive poems Big dreamy eyes 
Long French sleeves 
Shivering in the cold light 
Of the New York City heat Sensitive boys 
Here they come Nothing's ever what is seems 
Too much just ain't enough 
Wore it like an open wound 
You always felt too much Faded posters 
Peeling off the walls 
Sensitive boys 
Want all your love 
And they want no luck at all Sensitive boys 
Don't you let 'em get you down3 Sensitive boys 
Turn your amps up loud 
Go ahead and run us off 
But make your baby proud The road to nowhere 
The rubber back in your face 
But I'm still out here somewhere 
And no one can take your place Sensitive boys 
The world needs you now 
Sensitive boys 
I need you 
More than ever now
