She stands, a target behind the counter 
And she burns a little more with evry encounter 
Spit on again and again till her eyes are bloodshot 
And now they've slowly sunken in 
"There's gotta be more to life than this" 
She whispers under her breath as she pulls another double shift 
She's 21 a single mother of two 
And this fucking dead end job barely buys enough food 
It's slowly killing me I've gotta go 
Cause I can feel my blood pumpin' like the stereo 
I've kept it bottled up inside but now it's gonna blow 
So... what are you gonna do when it comes down to you 
10 years of fuckin' fast food 
I've been shot at twice and always talked down to 
Unappreciated, misunderstood 
Overworked, underpaid, dodging bullets in the hood 
One thing I've learned is that this life's not for me 
I can never be a functional member of society 
The only thing that's been keeping me sane 
Is playing these songs cause it eases the pain
