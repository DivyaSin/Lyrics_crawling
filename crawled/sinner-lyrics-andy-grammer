I've been throwing stones, waiting by the river 
I've been on my own, praying like a sinner 
You've been gone too long, I'm waiting out the winter 
I've been on my knees, praying like, praying like a sinner Well you've built a city right in me 
And brick by brick and piece by piece 
And love in both your hands 
Try to make an honest man 
From when I woke until I went to sleep 
You planned my life so carefully 
Sculpted me like clay, I can see you in my face And I never thought I'd live this life without your guiding light I've been throwing stones, waiting by the river 
I've been on my own, praying like a sinner 
You've been gone too long, I'm waiting out the winter 
I've been on my knees, praying like, praying like a sinner And I heard the walls are paper thin 
From where you are to where I am 
But I don't feel a thing 
If you are, keep pulling strings 
And send on down a message please 
Light a boat, go home my dreams 
I'd just like to know 
That you hear me, that you're close And I never thought I'd live this life without your guiding light I've been throwing stones, waiting by the river 
I've been on my own, praying like a sinner 
You've been gone too long, I'm waiting out the winter 
I've been on my knees, praying like, praying like a sinner You've been gone for too long 
You've been gone for too long I've been throwing stones, waiting by the river 
I've been on my own, praying like a sinner 
You've been gone too long, I'm waiting out the winter 
I've been on my knees, praying like I've been throwing stones, waiting by the river 
I've been on my own, praying like a sinner 
You've been gone too long, I'm waiting out the winter 
I've been on my knees, praying like, praying like a sinner 
Praying like a sinner I've been throwing stones, waiting by the river 
I've been on my own, praying like a sinner 
You've been gone too long, I'm waiting out the winter 
And I've been on my knees, praying like, praying like a sinner
