You're all over my face 
This is your place 
You wannabe! 
You're running your big mouth 
You're gonna get knocked our 
You wannabe! 
You step into my life 
And I rock it big time 
You wannabe! 
Don't think you can beat me 
You'll never defeat me 
You're pushing me! 
You wannabe! 
I stand undaunted. 
You gonna see 
I am undaunted. 
Kill! 
Don't think you can shake me 
'cause you'll never break me 
You wannabe! 
You only get one round 
It's time for the takedown 
You wannabe! 
You're talking the big talk 
But I walk the big walk 
You wannabe! 
You'll never forget me 
You'll live to regret me 
You're pushing me! 
You wannabe! 
I stand undaunted. 
You gonna see 
I am undaunted. 
Can't you walk away 
Don't you look at me 
Listen what I say 
You're just a wannabe! Just walk away 
Don't you look at me 
Listen what I say 
The fear inside of me! 
[Mike Orlando's solo] 
I stand undaunted 
You gonna see 
I am undaunted 
Don't look back, just walk away 
I stand undaunted 
You wannabe 
I am undaunted.
