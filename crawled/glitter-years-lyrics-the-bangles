Denny was working it real hard 
Down Sunset boulevard 
Back in 1973 
Why would he bother going home 
His parents left him on his own 
Who knows 
Maybe they were out getting stoned I don't really know 
How we survived the glitter years 
What did we do it all for 
Do you remember the glitter years We were the lost and lonely ones 
We hid in the discotheques all night long 
'Till we could see the morning sun 
Denny was king, 
he'd rock the place 
Dressed like a working girl 
from outer space He was dancing like he wanted to dance 
His life away 
In December of '74 Denny wrecked 
His father's car 
Driving home that night he was singing 
"You better Hang on to Yourself"
