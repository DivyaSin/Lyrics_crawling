Can't sleep 
Too many tears too remember 
Can't believe it's this close to December 
And here I am 
Alone in the dark 
Silently missing you so 
I'm tired of pretending I don't love you 
When your with me in everything that I do 
And there you are so dear in my heart 
And still I just can't let you go 
That's why I came here, so you know 
That I don't wanna live 
If livings without you 
And that I would give my all 
Just for one more day 
Don't tell me it's over 
Coz for me it has just begun 
Baby please let's give us one more try 
I can give you what money can't buy 
If you let me be there 
Every moment beside you 
Feel love and let feelings just guide you 
Trust in me and you'll never be hurt 
Coz I'll keep you safely you know That I don't wanna live 
If livings without you 
And that I would give my all 
Just for one more day 
Don't tell me it's over 
Coz for me it has just begun 
Baby please let's gives us one more try 
I can give you what money can't buy 
It's not about money, no 
I'm so tired of pretending I don't love you 
That's why I, I just can't let you go 
That's why I came here 
To let you know 
That I don't wanna live 
If livings without you 
And that I would give my all 
Just for one more day 
Don't tell me it's over 
Coz for me it has just begun 
Baby please let's gives us one more try 
I can give you what money can't buy 
Can't sleep 
Too many tears too remember 
Can't believe it's this close to December
