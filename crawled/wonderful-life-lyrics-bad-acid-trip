Multi-million dollar market - theyre our prisons 
Keep the menace off the streets - we dont need them 
Build bigger better prisons - for our children 
Beat em, bash em, fucking rape them - hail our system 
They declare war on drugs - what a joke 
Fucking Bush dropping bombs - snorting coke 
CIA sells the crack - industry 
They allow all the drugs - in the country 
What the fuck is going on 
Hopes of a future are gone 
Using our taxes for bombs 
When children live in slums 
Theres no money for schools 
The poor are treated like mules 
Equal opportunity is bullshit 
When the rich rule all markets 
Its a wonderful life 
Work real hard and break your back - youre still poor 
Pimp your ass for a loaf of bread - youre a whore 
Politicians lie and cheat - all the time 
Fuck your mother for a nickel - or a dime 
Buy their products and their food - theyre the best 
Eating all their chemicals - grow a breast 
Rape the land, pollute the seas - just for profit 
Killing man with their disease - causing havoc 
Its a wonderful life
