There`s snow on the mountains, and fog in the street; 
flickering candles in the room. Hear the churchbell ring. 
See the children playing. I fell the pure delight, 
and the snow is falling, taking me away. 
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams, 
reflecting the sound of my heart; it`s my taste of freedom. 
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams, 
don`t try to tear me apart; cold winter dreams 
Find myself in peace, warm from underneath. 
Wish you would be here in this magic scene. 
I`ve escaped from reality, dancing in the snow. 
Cold, blue sky gives me the innocence I need. 
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams, 
freezing the heat in my heart; it`s my taste of freedom. 
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams, 
chill me and tear me apart; cold winter dreams. 
The world seemed so clear, like a wonderful diamond, 
Can`t imagine there`s meaness. Can`t imagine one lie 
But when I`m dead and gone and snow`s pouring down, 
I`m burried and covered, peaceful under millions of stars. 
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams, 
reflecting the sound of my heart; it`s my taste of freedom. 
Cold winter nights, cold winter dreams, 
don`t try to tear me apart; cold winter dreams
