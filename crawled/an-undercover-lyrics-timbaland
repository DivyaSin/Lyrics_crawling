[Aaliyah] and & (Missy) 
Say what 
You look good 
(say it two times) 
You look good good 
(say it three times) 
You look good good good 
(say it four times) 
Oh oh oh oh good [Aaliyah] 
I, I, like the way, way, you get down, down 
(thats the way I like it) 
You're the kinda guy 
That makes mom feel proud 
Don't have to show you're the boy, oh 
I, I, like you the way that you are [Chorus] 
I like my man undercover 
Smooth dark brotha 
Fly to the bone 
You don't need no fly jeep 
To come and scoop me 
You can drive what you own 
(thats the way I like it) 
A man undercover 
Smooth black brotha 
Fly to the bone 
Don't need no Gucci sweater 
To make you look better 
You can wear what you own [Aaliyah] 
I, I, love, love the way that you smile, smile 
You, you the type of guy 
That got his own style 
All I want to do is be with you 
You, you got me feelin' 
The way that I do [Chorus] 
I like my man undercover 
Smooth dark brotha 
Fly to the bone 
You don't need no fly jeep 
To come and scoop me 
You can drive what you own 
(thats the way I like it) 
A man undercover 
Smooth black brotha 
Fly to the bone 
Don't need no Gucci sweater 
To make you look better 
You can wear what you own [Aaliyah] and & (Missy) 
Say what 
You look good 
(say it two times) 
You look good good 
(say it three times) 
You look good good good 
(say it four times) 
Oh oh oh oh good [Timbaland] 
We be freakin' up in my jeep (my jeep) 
Listenin to this phat LP (LP) 
Lets cruise around the town (the town) 
I'm diggin' you are you diggin' me 
Lets hop on my holiday (holiday) 
That costs about 20K (20K) 
What it takes me to persuade (persuade) 
Turn ten night in to day (to day) 
I never seen a girl (a girl) 
Who hypnotize like you (like you) 
Who walk just like you (like you) 
Who talk just like you (like you) 
I want to be your lover (your lover) 
That ill type brotha (brotha) 
Baby girl baby girl (baby girl) 
We can keep it undercover [Chorus until fade]
