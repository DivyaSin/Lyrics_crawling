I'm a man 
Torn in two 
State and nation 
I've got to choose 
For on these streets 
That I spit upon 
There's no money in my pocket 
No soles on my shoes 
Ain't got no religion 
But the workingman blues Oh I, I've got the workin' man blues 
Oh I'm kicking the dirt off my shoes 
Devolution workingman blues I don't dance 
No rich mans tune 
I won't play 
The poor mans fool 
Within these eyes 
That you look upon 
There is fear mixed with pride 
A dangerous device 
For talkin' devolution 
Talkin' workin'man blues Oh I, I've got the workingman blues 
Oh I'm kickin' the dirt off my shoes 
Devolution workingman blues Devolution workingman blues Oh I, I've got the workingman blues 
Oh I'm kickin' the dirt off my shoes Oh I, I've got the workingman blues 
Oh I'm kickin' the dirt off my shoes Oh I, I've got the workingman blues 
Oh I, I've got the workingman workingman blues 
Devolution workingman blues
