I hear your voice from the place next door 
They tune you in more and more 
Wherever I go I can't get away 
When they broadcast every word you say 
Oh no, not that station 
Hey man, please turn it off 
How can they do this to me 
They got my baby on the air 
They say your show is a lot of fun 
They say that girl is a number one 
But they don't know what you did to me 
And they can't see my misery 
Oh no, not that station 
Hey man, please turn it off 
How can they do this to me 
They got my baby on the air 
You broke my heart 
Now you're rubbin' it in 
Telling our secrets 
To any dumb fool who calls in 
You wrecked our lives 
And you knocked me right down 
Now you're making it public 
And spreading it all over town 
You're talking hip like you know where it's at 
You tell them love is as easy as that 
They're calling in to get your advice 
They like to hear you 'cause they think you're so wise 
Oh no, not that station 
Hey man, please turn it off 
How can they do this to me 
They got my baby on the air 
They put my baby on the air

radio - i.e. the exact opposite of the English version...]
