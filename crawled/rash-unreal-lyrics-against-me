If she wants to dance and drink all night 
Well, there's no one that can stop her 
She's going till the house lights come up or her stomach spills onto the floor 
This night is gonna end when we're damn well ready for it to be over 
Worked all week long, now the music is playing on our time 
Yeah, we do what we do to get by, and then we need a release You get mixed up with the wrong guys 
You get messed up on the wrong drugs 
Sometimes the party takes you places that you didn't really plan on going 
When people see the track marks on her arm, she knows what they're thinking 
She keeps on working for that minimum 
As if a high school education gave you any other options, you know They don't know nothing about redemption 
They don't know nothing about recovery 
Some people just aren't the type for marriage and family No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie 
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone 
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie 
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone She's out of step with the style 
She don't know where the action's happening 
You know the downtown club scene ain't nothing like it used to be 
You reach a point where there's not a lie in the world 
That you could use to make the boys believe you're still in your twenties 
But they keep getting younger, don't they, baby? She's not waiting for someone to come over and ask for the privilege 
She can still here that rebel yell just as loud as it was in 1983, you know 
There ain't no Johnny coming home to share a bed with her, and she doesn't care No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie 
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone 
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie 
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone 
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie 
And if she had to live it all over again, you know she wouldn't change anything for the world
