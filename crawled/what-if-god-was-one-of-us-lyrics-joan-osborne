If God had a name, what would it be? 
And would you call it to His face? 
If you were faced with Him in all His glory 
What would you ask if you had just one question? And yeah, yeah God is great 
Yeah, yeah, God is good 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah What if God was one of us 
Just a slob like one of us 
Just a stranger on the bus 
Trying to make His way home? If God had a face, what would it look like? 
And would you want to see? 
If seeing meant that you would have to believe 
In things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints and all the prophets? And yeah, yeah God is great 
Yeah, yeah, God is good 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah What if God was one of us 
Just a slob like one of us 
Just a stranger on the bus 
Trying to make His way home? He's trying to make His way home 
Back up to Heaven all alone 
Nobody calling on the phone 
Except for the pope maybe in Rome And yeah, yeah God is great 
Yeah, yeah, God is good 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah What if God was one of us 
Just a slob like one of us 
Just a stranger on the bus 
Trying to make His way home? Just trying to make His way home 
Like a holy rolling stone 
Back up to Heaven all alone 
Just trying to make His way home 
Nobody calling on the phone 
Except for the pope maybe in Rome
