I see your tears 
I hear your words 
Girl, I feel how much this hurts 
I know you can't, see it now, 
But I promise you, somehow its gonna be beautiful 
Its gonna be easy 
Its gonna be magic 
Its gonna be healing 
There's a place you're meant to be, 
But its somewhere 
Down the road from me I ask god, "what do I do?" 
"what's the best way I can love you?" 
He said, "son, you gotta set her free, 
'cause I have a way, 
That she has just gotta see." its gonna be beautiful 
Its gonna be easy 
Its gonna be magic 
Its gonna be healing 
There is a place you're meant to be 
But its somewhere 
Down the road from me
