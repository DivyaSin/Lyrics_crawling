This night came quicker than you thought 
Found you in a mood for heavy storm 
Sitting in the attic 
Listening to falling drops It was a blink of an eye 
First time I saw your face 
I thought that in your eyes 
Theres snow and rain 
Rain and snow What are your dreams for every day? 
And why are your nights so alone? 
You talk to them all, but 
No ones there to hold you tight 
When you feel so cold 
To hold you tight 
When you feel so small What it gives if you stand by your side 
What it would if you lost control? 
Beyond this picture in your mine 
Beyond safe and known So, so, so, so many ways to go home 
So many wishes in your head, 
But still in your soul 
Snow and rain 
Rain and snow What are your dreams?
