It's in my blood I love to dance 
It's in my blood I love to jam 
Cuz I sing pop You don't have a chance 
Don't sing the lyrics you don't understand 
I made it so clear I said it so deap 
I love to drink a glass of beer 
It's in my blood and it's in my veins 
I love to dance on the dance floor We are going back and forth back back 
Back and forth when I know you want some more 
Back and forth back and back back 
Back and forth when I dance on the dance floor I love see you dancing 
I love hear you singing 
I want to see you dance 
Like me we are Going back and forth back back 
Back and forth when I know you want some more 
Back and forth back and back back 
Back and forth when I dance on the dance floor It's in my blood I love to dance 
It's in my blood I love to jam 
Cuz I sing pop You don't have a chance 
Don't sing the lyrics you don't understand 
I made it so clear I said it so deap 
I love to drink a glass of beer 
It's in my blood and it's in my veins 
I love to dance on the dance floor We are going back and forth back back 
Back and forth when I know you want some more 
Back and forth back and back back 
Back and forth when I dance on the dance floor I want you to dance with me 
I don't want to be alone 
I just want to go back and forth 
back back back and forth We are going back and forth back back 
Back and forth when I know you want some more 
Back and forth back and back back 
Back and forth when I dance on the dance floor 
Going back and forth back back 
Back and forth when I know you want some more 
Back and forth back and back back 
Back and forth when I dance on the dance floor
