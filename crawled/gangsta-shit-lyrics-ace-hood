[Intro] 
Now that's some gangster shit 
Don't know who you're fucking with 
Listen [Verse 1] 
Uh 
Now I've been known to kill them with the flow 
The beats is back off to attack him, kicking down your door 
You looking at a pro, smoking them like some indigo 
See we are Seminoles, running right through your end zone 
I'm coming as soon as they holler, I get them, I got them 
They know it's on 
No more of the games, you know what the name 
I aim to bang the chrome 
It's Mister Whatever, about my cheddar if you've never known 
Money over bitches, now you can carry on 
Some call me arrogant, I'm like a veteran 
Big shit nigga, I ain't talking elephants 
Now what you know about it? 
My niggas they bothered about it 
It's We the Best the mod, something like Illuminati 
I'm taking the coupe to college, trying to find a model about it 
Take them to the crib, now it's time to party [Chorus] 
Uh 
Now that's some gangster shit 
Not fucking with lames, or fucking with faith 
Now that's some gangster shit 
You fucking with me, or fucking with you 
Now that's some gangster shit 
All my niggas about it about 
Now that's some gangster shit 
Now that's some gangster shit 
I'm fucking with real and never fake 
Now that's some gangster shit 
I'm chasing that dough and never hoes 
Now that's some gangster shit 
All my niggas about it about 
Now that's some gangster shit [Verse 2] 
Uh 
And now I'm back off in the place to be 
Got rid of the nice in me, it's nice to meet my enemy 
Don't run up on me though, I give you a overdose 
I leave them on the stretcher, I ain't talking cardio 
I'm sorry you didn't know, I'm dipping, I'm moving a '64 
I'm fucking the baddest hoes, I'm beating the pussy like Baggio 
Now cut the music up, and pour me up a cup 
And roll you up a blunt, if you getting major bucks 
Now welcome to gangster shit, I'm hopping up out of the fancy whip 
Them chains around my neck, and every diamond costs a grip 
See I'm a superstar, I'm never at the bar 
I valet park the car, pockets on that salad bar 
Nasty with the flow, you can call it caviar 
Uh, now that's some gangster shit 
I'm with a gangster clique 
And all my niggas toting the clip
