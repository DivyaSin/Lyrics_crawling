Hey you 
Are you all used up like me 
Are you old and ? 
You can barely see 
Hey you 
Are you all played out like me 
Are you going off the tracks 
You can barely breathe 
Dye it black 
Burn it clean 
Where'd you get that evil streak 
Kiss of death 
Kiss of death 
Whoa lips are stealing my breath 
Kiss of death 
Kiss of death 
Whoa lips are stealing my breath 
Hey you 
Can ya spare some change for me 
Cause there aint no pulse in my veins 
Left that I can see 
Hey you 
Can you kill this trip disease 
Can you fill my soul with the fire 
That it used to be 
Dye it black 
Burn it clean 
Where'd you get that evil streak 
Kiss of death 
Kiss of death 
Whoa lips are stealing my breath 
Kiss of death 
Kiss of death 
Whoa lips are stealing my breath
