From my apartment in my bedroom 
To the sound of your headphones 
We can dream of California 
Like it won't run out of gold And I could sing the same thing over 
But to me it don't get old 
With the same hooks and the same words 
You already know I'm still learning to live like I've heard nothing else 
But this one thing, love your Savior 
And your neighbor like yourself 
You can know everything but your knowing won't help 
So once again love your Savior 
And your neighbor like yourself If you listened to the chorus 
You don't need a second verse 
And if you missed it, good, you're honest 
I'll repeat what I said first 
And I'll keep singing the same thing over 
So you can't forget the words I'm still learning to live like I've heard nothing else 
But this one thing, love your Savior 
And your neighbor like yourself 
You can know everything but your knowing won't help 
So once again, love your Savior 
And your neighbor like your I'm not trying to buy you, you're not mine to own 
I've got nothing to sell you but all of my 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Jesus, what would You tell us today 
If we asked You, what's the best thing we could do or say? 
Bet You'd remind us of the things that You already said 
To get the point across You did 
To get it stuck inside our heads No questions left 'cause I'm still learning to live 
Like I've heard nothing else 
But this one thing, love your Savior 
And your neighbor like yourself 
You can know everything but your knowing won't help 
So once again love your Savior 
And your neighbor like yourself Yeah, once again love your Savior 
And your neighbor like yourself 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
