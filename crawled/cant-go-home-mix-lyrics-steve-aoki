Don't let your head hang low 
You've seen the darkest skies I know 
Let your heart run child like horses in the wild 
So take my hand and home we'll go 
The sun it glows like gold 
Feeling warm as a burning coal 
Let your soul shine bright like diamonds in the sky 
So take my hand and home we'll go Home we'll go, home we'll go 
Home we'll go, home we'll go Home we'll go, home we'll go 
Home we'll go, home we'll go Don't let your head hang low 
You've seen the darkest skies I know 
Let your heart run child like horses in the wild 
So take my hand and home we'll go 
The sun it glows like gold 
Feeling warm as a burning coal 
Let your soul shine bright like diamonds in the sky 
So take my hand and home we'll go Home we'll go, home we'll go 
Home we'll go, home we'll go 
Home we'll go, home we'll go 
Home we'll go, home we'll go Don't let your head hang low 
You've seen the darkest skies I know 
Let your heart run child like horses in the wild 
So take my hand and home we'll go Home we'll go, home we'll go 
Home we'll go, home we'll go 
Home we'll go, home we'll go 
Home we'll go, home we'll go
