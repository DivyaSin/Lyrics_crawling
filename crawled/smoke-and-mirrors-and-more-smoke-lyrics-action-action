Comatose, feed my head with liberty 
Ive got an appetite for deceit 
Im done, well done, stick a fork in me 
Cover me in apathy, discreetly and distinct able I am trying to break your heart 
Im plagued with doubt, no frogs, or murdered first born 
My thoughts are just a little sun burnt 
Dismantle all that ever was, strip it down, withdraw the blood Something is gonna break real soon 
Whos covering whose eyes? 
Safety in knowing others lies 
Pulled by the strings of time Hold me back 
Im going to throw it all down on the table 
Do you expect us to believe in these fables? 
Oh what to do with you? With you, with you, with you? Hold me tight 
It seems all I really have is in front of me 
Is the rest just a dream or a fallacy? 
Oh what to do with you? With you, with you, with you? A throw back to all those 80s slasher flicks 
Youre a cheap killer, and Im getting sick of it 
God's dead, and all bets have waived theyre rights 
All is fair in love and time, who will win the game of war? Illusion, a delusion, a terrible secret 
What one does see is anothers lost prophet 
Hold me close, I can see right through you 
Challenge all youve ever heard, incite the search and motivate Somethings gonna break real soon 
Whos covering whose eyes? 
Safety in knowing others lies 
Pulled by the strings of time. Hold me back 
Im going to throw it all down on the table 
Do you expect us to believe in these fables? 
Oh what to do with you? With you, with you, with you? Hold me tight 
It seems all I really have is in front of me 
Is the rest just a dream or a fallacy? 
Oh what to do with you? With you, with you, with you? Please read between the lines 
A simple compromise between the sands of time 
[Incomprehensible] Hold me back 
Im going to throw it all down on the table 
Do you expect us to believe in these fables? 
Oh what to do with you? With you, with you, with you? Hold me tight 
It seems all I really have is in front of me 
Is the rest just a dream or a fallacy? 
Oh what to do with you? With you, with you, with you?
