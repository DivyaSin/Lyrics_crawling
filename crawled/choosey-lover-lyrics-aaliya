[Chorus: x2] 
Choosey lover, 
Boy I'm so proud of you 
I'm so glad you 
Chose me, baby 
And I'll make 
You so happy 
Thought I had a lover, 
But I was 
Kidding myself, baby 
By the time I learned 
The truth about it, 
He was sleeping 
With someone else 
But not you baby 'Cause you're giving me, 
Giving me security, baby 
And you've proven 
What you said (Oh) 
Never worried 
About you baby, 
Jumping in 
And out of bed 
Oh 
But not my baby [Chorus: x4] Thought I had a lover 
But I was kidding myself, baby 
By the time I learned 
The truth about it, 
He was sleeping 
With someone else 
Baby, baby, baby Choosey lover, 
Boy I'm so proud of you 
I'm so glad you 
Chose me, baby 
And I'll make 
You so happy 
Thought I had a lover, 
But I was 
Kidding myself, baby 
By the time I learned 
The truth about it, 
He was sleeping 
With someone else 
But not you baby Cause you've given me 
Given me security 
Giving me security, baby 
Yeah you've proven 
What you said 
See I never worry about you, 
Jumping in and out of bed Choosey lover, 
Boy I'm so proud of you 
I'm so glad you 
Chose me, baby 
And I'll make 
You so happy 
Thought I had a lover, 
But I was 
Kidding myself, baby 
By the time I learned 
The truth about it, 
He was sleeping 
With someone else 
But not you baby
