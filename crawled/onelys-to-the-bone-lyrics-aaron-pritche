Lonely's To The Bone I took her keys, she took a cab 
She made sure the front door slammed 
Between the rain and the whiskey the whole thing was still a blur She caught a plane to San Antone 
I got that far then the trail went cold 
Since then I haven?t heard a single word from her 
Then I found out that All I?ve lost is all I want 
And all I?ll ever need 
And I realize the deepest cut 
Can take a while to bleed 
'cause suddenly it hit me that 
She left me all alone 
And leaving?s only skin deep 
But lonely?s to the bone The phone would ring once or twice 
It?d be some number I don?t recognize 
But nobody?s ever home when I call it back Door?s unlocked, coffee?s on 
The fire?s burnin? but she still ain?t home 
Don?t know if I?ll ever learn to live with that 
And I found out that CHORUS Oh, it would be so easy if 
Her memory?d just move on 
And leaving?s only skin deep 
But lonely?s to the bone Lonely?s to the bone x3
