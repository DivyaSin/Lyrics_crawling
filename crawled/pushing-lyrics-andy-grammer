I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life 
I've been pushing all my life 
I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life 
I've been pushing all my life For some want to see right through all the false alarms I've pulled 
For some want to stand their ground when I start to tear them down 
Someone to outlast the home, that hold me back 
For someone to make it past the guards of a cynical hearts 
Sick, sick of singing now Oh, I always jump ship 
We are closer than I've ever been 
I said we stay in the fire 
And hope we can burn our way out (Oh) 
The road to my heart gets hot as hell I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life 
I've been pushing all my life 
I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life 
I've been pushing all my life For someone to call me out when I start to run my mouth 
For someone to talk me down of ledges that I have found 
Someone to hold me close when I'm screaming to let go 
For someone to make it past the guards of a cynical hearts 
Sick, sick of singing now Oh, I always jump ship 
We are closer than I've ever been 
I said we stay in the fire 
And hope we can burn our way out (Oh) 
The road to my heart gets hot as hell I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life 
I've been pushing all my life 
I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life 
I've been pushing all my life I know that it's not fair to think that you'll still be there 
I know that it's not fair (All my life, all my life, all my life) 
But if you leave when the pattern repeats 
I'm pushing you away but that's not what I mean 
Oh I'm ashamed that I cannot believe 
That this is what it takes just to get close to me 
Is this what it takes just to get close to me? Oh, I always jump ship 
We are closer than I've ever been Oh, I always jump ship 
We are closer than I've ever been 
I said we stay in the fire 
And hope we can burn our way out (Oh) 
The road to my heart gets hot as hell I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life 
I've been pushing all my life 
I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life 
I've been pushing all my life
