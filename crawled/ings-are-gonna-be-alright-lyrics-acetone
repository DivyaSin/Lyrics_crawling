You may try and try again 
Not to be unsatisfied 
Just squeezing by one more time 
But how long do you go on 
Believing things are gonna be alright? Not to decry the simple life 
But lately I've been getting tired 
Just getting by 
Biding my time Now I've always been so sure 
Someday, someday 
But how long do you go on 
Believing things are gonna be alright?
