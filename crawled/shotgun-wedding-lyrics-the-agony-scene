She wasn't born in that brothel I'm told 
Well aware of where she was 
Well aware of where she'd end up in what position 
Dressed in red down on her knees 
She'd done this sort of thing before 
Choking back on this disease dressed to kill To die for 
To die for 
To die for 
To die for Her pretty face hides the demons inside 
The kind that haunt her in her sleep 
She was found face down in that ditch 
Her skirt hiked up 
Dressed in red down on her knees 
She'd done this sort of thing before Make up chases the tears down her face 
The hand prints left on her throat 
He hits her she'd ask for more 
He hits her she'd ask for Just, a little slut 
She lost, a little slut 
She lost, a little slut 
She lost Her pretty face hides the demons inside 
The kind that haunt her in her sleep 
She was found face down in that ditch 
Her skirt hiked up
