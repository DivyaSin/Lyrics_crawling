I can't believe that cupid was a liar 
When he shot you and me 
We were meant to be 
How could I have let 
You turn and walk away 
Right out of my life 
If I'm wrong or right 
Can't take another sleepless night 
Chorus: 
We could never ever be just friends 
My heart is in my hands 
And I'm ankle deep in sinking sand 
I miss you so upon my knees I bend 
And pray someday you'll want me back again 
I pray someday you'll love me once again Oh yeah Got to find a way to get 
Your head back on my shoulder 
Holdin' back the tears 
The future's so unclear 
I never meant to hurt 
The one I love the most 
If I could just rewind the hands of time 
To the days I had you here Chorus Doctor can't you give me something 
Something to help me ease the pain 
Can I come in from the rain Chorus: 
We could never ever be just friends 
My heart is in your hands 
And I'm ankle deep in sinking sand 
I miss you so upon my knees I bend 
And pray someday you'll want me back again 
And pray someday you'll want me back again 
I pray someday you'll love me once again
