There's no need to lie 
Without me half trying, I could love you 
It shows in your eyes 
That you feel the same way I do 
But wherever I go, my conscience goes 
What more can I say 
It's only desire, not yet a fire 
Let's keep it that way 'Cause I don't want to have to tell him a lie 
When I get back home 
'Cause it would tear apart his fairy tale world 
If I did him wrong 
And lying to him would hurt me more 
Than leaving you this way 
So before we forget, we're not cheaters yet 
Let's keep it that way Let's finish this wine 
'Cause I'm not thinking too clearly tonight 
And the touch of your hand 
Makes it so hard for me to tell wrong from right 
He waits at home and he's there alone 
And though I'd like to stay 
Before I give in 
Let's call it just friends 
And keep it that way
