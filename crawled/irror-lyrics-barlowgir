Mirror, mirror on the wall, have I got it? 
'Cause Mirror you've always told me who I am 
I'm finding it's not easy to be perfect 
So sorry, you wont define me 
Sorry, you don't own me Who are you to tell me 
That I'm less than what I should be? 
Who are you? Who are you? 
I don't need to listen 
To the list of things I should do 
I wont try, I wont try 
You don't define me, You don't define me Mirror I am seeing a new reflection 
I'm looking into the eyes of He who made me 
To Him I have beauty beyond compare 
I know He defines me Who are you to tell me 
That I'm less than what I should be? 
Who are you? Who are you? 
I don't need to listen 
To the list of things I should do 
I wont try, I wont try 
You don't define me, You don't define me
