Last night I forgot 
How the sound of your voice 
Whispered sweet, goodbyes 
Your eyes, left to die [Incomprehensible] understand why Why not one more night 
One last kiss goodbye 
My sweet love tonight I hope the stars 
Still spell out your name 
Where you are Kiss my closing eyes 
Help me sleep 
Without you, I'm so lost Tonight I cry, tell me why 
I can't live without 
Your warm embrace Why not one more night 
One last kiss goodbye 
My sweet love tonight I hope the stars 
Still spell out your name 
Where you are I close my eyes and 
You are everything I see 
Goodbye Goodbye to you my love 
I won't forget you 
I'll see you soon Goodbye my love 
Goodbye to you my love 
I won't forget you 
Bye, bye love
