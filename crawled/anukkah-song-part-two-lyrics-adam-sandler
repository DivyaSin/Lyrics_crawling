Time to take out those menorahs! 
Put on your yamaca 
It's time for Hanukkah 
So much fun-uka 
To celebrate Hanukkah 
Hanukkah is, the festival of lights 
Instead of one day of presents 
We get eight crazy nights 
When you feel like the only kid in town 
Without a Christmas tree 
Here's a new list of people who are Jewish 
Just like you and me 
Winona Ryder drinks Manashevits' wine 
Then spins a dredl with Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein 
Guess who give and receives loads of Hanukkah toys? 
The girls from Barukasouhl and all three Beastie Boys 
Lenny Kravitz is half Jewish, Courtney Love is half too 
Put them together, what a funky, bad-ass Jew 
We got Harvey Kitell and falsh dancer Jennifer Bills 
Jasmins Bleuth from Baywatche is Jewish and 
Yes her boobs are real 
O.J. Simpson, still not a Jew 
But guess who is, the guy who does the voice for 
Scooby-Doo 
Bob Dylan was born a Jew, then he wasn't, but now he's back 
Mary Tyler Moore's husband is Jewish ''cause we're pretty good 
In the sack 
Guess who got bar mitzvah-ed on the PGA tour? 
No I'm not talking about Tiger Woods, I'm talking about 
Mr. Happy Gilmore 
So many Jews are in the show-biz 
Bruce Springsteen isn't Jewish, but my mother thinks he is 
Tell that old harmonica, it's time to celebrate Hanukkah 
It's not pronounced Chanukkah 
The C is silent in Hanukkah 
So your your Hooked on Phonic-a 
Get drunk in Teawonica 
If you really really wanna-ka 
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy Hanukkah
