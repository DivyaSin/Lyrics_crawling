Let me see you workin' 
Let me see you tuckin' now 
Let me see you wine it down for me 
Come on girl, let's get wet 
Wanna see you sweat 
Smoke to the beat, shake to the beat You know this party's getting hotter 
It's getting hotter 
I'm feelin' hotter, feelin' hotter You know I want, I wanna get with you 
Your body's groovin' 
Oh, you make my head spin 
I wanna join you, I wanna do it like you do 
I've got the fever You know this party's gettin' hotter 
It's getting hotter 
I'm feelin' hotter, feelin' hotter I wanna let my hair down 
I wanna let my hair down 
I wanna let my hair down 
I wanna let my hair down I think you've got me just where you want me now 
You've got to fake me, oh girl, you just how 
I've got this feelin', I'm never leavin' 
Let me lose my color You know this party's getting hotter 
It's getting hotter, I'm feelin' hotter 
Feelin' hotter I wanna let my hair down 
I wanna let my hair down 
I wanna let my hair down 
I wanna let my hair down You know this party's getting hotter 
It's getting hotter, I'm feelin' hotter 
Feelin' hotter Let me see you workin'
