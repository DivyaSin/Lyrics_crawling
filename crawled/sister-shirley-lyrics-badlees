Everyone that should has got their dark glasses on 
But it's not as warm as I expected 
I've paraded your photo through San Mateo 
Dreamin' '86 was resurrected CHORUS And some thought they'd seen you, sister Shirley 
I swear I saw you meeting them 
With better clothes and a different smile 
Where on Earth should I begin Northern California's got that brochure appeal 
But where's the wine that you poeticized 
Nineteen and pregnant and hatin' the means 
You responded to your thought dream cries CHORUS Sun affirms the Bayshore Freeway, the moon burns bright in Burlingame 
Two weeks straight our Daily Bread's conclusions turn the same 
Face me if and when I face you, black and white, how we embrace you We love you and we hate you CHORUS What's your name now, sister Shirley 
Did you run to better ground
