Valerie was such a honest gal 
Always giving her body out 
To anyone who'll listen to the reasons 
Why her soul is dimmed After every word, I heard enough 
I turned away, turned her out 
She ran out on the rail of the balcony 
As if to say, hey look at me Everybody's looking 
And everyone could see 
That's wish dead, her hands slipped and 
As she fell, twisted and flipped, she said Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live She landed on a car and her head was split 
She had broken her back and her lower lip 
But they put her back together and said she'd live 
She did, now see there's a point here Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live, it's too late 
Hey, wait I wanna live Hey, wait I wanna live 
Hey, wait I wanna live 
Hey, wait I wanna live 
Hey, wait I wanna live
