I wage an unholy war 
Against your fucked up soul 
The shattered illusions of a thousand nightmares 
Preserved in a jar of shit by God 
Surprise you fucking lose Urine dripping from your stigmata 
The stench that surrounds you gives you away 
And the evil moisture that you secrete 
No lie, no shit, this is fucking war I know you fucked my soul 
I know you fucked my soul 
[Incomprehensible]
