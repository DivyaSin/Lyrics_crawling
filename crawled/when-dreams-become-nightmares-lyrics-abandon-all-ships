But you have no clue

So blame me for 
what I'll do. You've fallen victim to, 
the night and it's just me and you. 
You've fallen victim to the night, 
And now it's just me and you. One-This could not be solved with a gun. 
Two-If this is true now it's too bad for you. 
Three-For everything you've done to me. 
Four-You'll burn in hell, you fucking whore. One-This could not be solved with a gun. 
Two-If this is true now it's too bad for you.
