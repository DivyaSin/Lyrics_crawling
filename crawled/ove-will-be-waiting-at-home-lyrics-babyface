What good is a kiss 
Especially if it's not 
With the one you truly love 
Baby, don't kiss your life away What good is a house if it's not a home 
We don't wanna spend our lives alone 
Baby, there's nothing that will stay 
Don't leave me now Some people search but they search too far 
When love is so close to their hearts 
I won't be searching 'cause love was right here 
And it's clear it's right in your arms, baby Don't you go breaking my heart 
Don't run away from these arms 
There's something I need you to know 
Love will be waiting at home Don't you go breaking my heart 
Don't be afraid of these arms 
There's something I need you to know 
That love will be waiting at home What good is a heart 
If it's heart alone without 
Someone special there to hold 
The heart was not meant to waste away What good is a love if it's not sincere 
You need someone special who's always there 
Not someone who'll just drift away Some people search through their whole life long 
Trying to find someone true 
Well don't you go searching cause love is right here 
Don't you fear it's waiting for you Don't you go breaking my heart 
Don't run away from these arms 
There's something I need you to know 
Love will be waiting at home Don't you go breaking my heart 
Don't be afraid of these arms 
There's something I need you to know 
That love will be waiting at home I will be there waiting for you 
You need only call I'm there for you 
I'll give you my heart and I'll be true 
I'll be there for you and only for you Don't you go breaking my heart 
Don't run away from these arms 
There's something I need you to know 
Love will be waiting at home Don't you go breaking my heart 
Don't be afraid of these arms 
There's something I need you to know 
That love will be waiting at home I will be there be waiting for you 
You need only call I'm there for you 
I'll give you my heart and I'll be true 
Love will be waiting for you
