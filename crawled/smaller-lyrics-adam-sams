This ones bout a man 
Who thought that he had figured it out 
Figured it out 
When I found him 
He told me that he didnt need any help 
From anyone else If Ive got this on my own 
If Ive got this on my own 
Then the only hope Im holding onto now is me We live for life, we always climb 
We always want to go further 
Are you really entitled to anything? 
Are you really? Are you really? 
I was bigger when I made myself smaller 
I was bigger when I made myself small As the years went by 
I started asking him What do you deserve? 
What do you deserve? 
If your life revolves around yourself 
Then what are you worth? 
What are you worth?
