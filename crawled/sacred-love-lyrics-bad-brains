Sacred love 
Sacred love 
Sacred love 
Sacred love 
Baby baby baby I don't want come to me as a whore, 
Don't lust off my body baby, that's a bore 
I see our love as being sacred, just you and me 
We don't need our business in the streets, reality I'm in here, you're out there 
We know what's right 
No crying, no lying 
Our hearts declared 
Sacred love 
Sacred love 
Sacred Love 
Sacred Love Maybe maybe maybe 
Jah will bless us to be one tomorrow 
Visits from you every Tuesday 
Right on time
