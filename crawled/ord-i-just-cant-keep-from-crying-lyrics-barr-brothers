My mamma often told me, angels bonded your life away, 
She said I would accomplish, but trust in God and pray, 
I come on the King's Highway, I'm travelin' everyday. But I just can't keep from cryin' sometimes, 
No I just can't keep from cryin' sometimes, 
When my heart is full of sorrow, 
When my eyes fill with tears, 
Well I just can't keep from cryin' sometimes. My mother, she's in glory, thank God I'm on my way. 
Father, he's gone too, and sister she could not stay, 
I'm trusting Him everyday, to bear my burdens away. But I just can't keep from cryin' sometimes, 
Oh I just can't keep from cryin' sometimes, 
When my heart is full of sorrow, 
And my eyes are filled of tears, 
Well I just can't keep from cryin' sometimes. I thought when you first left, I'd grieved for a little while, 
Soon it all would be over, and I'd journey on with a smile, 
But the thought as I get older, I think of what I told her. 
'Cause I'm on the King's Highway, travelling everyday/ But I just can't keep from cryin' sometimes, 
No I just can't keep from cryin' sometimes, 
When my heart is full of sorrow, 
And my eyes fill with tears, 
I just can't keep from cryin' sometimes.
