I'm somewhere now that I've never been 
So far from the world I was living in Baby, I'm lost but I'm not afraid 
I know you're the one to show me the way 
Lost in your arms, lost in your love 
Girl, since I found you, when I'm around you I'm lost I've come so far, I can't turn back 
There was no star, there was no map 
Well, I followed you to this place 
Now it's too late, standing here face to face Baby, I'm lost but I'm not afraid 
I know you're the one to show me the way 
Lost in your arms, lost in your love 
Girl, since I found you, when I'm around you I'm lost It just seems so right to be holding you tight 
I never thought it could feel so good to be lost Lost in your arms, lost in your love 
Girl, since I found you, when I'm around you I'm lost Well, I'm not afraid 
I know you're the one to show me the way 
Lost in your arms, lost in your love 
Girl, since I found you, when I'm around you I'm lost Baby, I'm lost but I'm not afraid 
I know you're the one to show me the way 
Lost in your arms, lost in your love 
Girl, since I found you, when I'm around you I'm lost
