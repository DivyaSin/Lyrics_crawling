Where will we go? 
Where will we go? Sign away all of my decisions 
Tell when I breed 
Terminate opinions 
I dream away my freedom to please you 
Let them talk so they feel important 
They don't mean a thing, this is my own dream 
Why do you have to put this on me? (Where will we go?) 
I'm a mess 
(Where will we go?) 
I'm a mess Do what you want to do 
Where the fuck you want to do it 
Try hard to live your life 
Live life the way that you want 
Do what you want to do 
Where the fuck you want to do it 
Try hard to live your life 
Live life the way that you want Life's okay, so don't complain 
You can't obtain, figure out how to maintain 
It's a shame, make a change 
So life will never ever find me down 
Found out just what it's really all about 
Never doubt, I wish I could get out 
Why do you have to put this on me? (Where will we go?) 
I'm a mess 
(Where will we go?) 
I'm a mess Do what you want to do 
Where the fuck you want to do it 
Try hard to live your life 
Live life the way that you want 
Do what you want to do 
Where the fuck you want to do it 
Try hard to live your life 
Live life the way that you want Find a way 
Repeat (Where will we go?) 
I'm a mess 
(Where will we go?) 
I'm a mess Do what you want to do 
Where the fuck you want to do it 
Try hard to live your life 
Live life the way that you want 
Do what you want to do 
Where the fuck you want to do it 
Try hard to live your life 
Live life the way that you want
