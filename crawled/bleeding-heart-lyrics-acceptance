Sends it home 
In a paper bag 
Says things change 
Maybe it's me [Chorus:] 
You can't fix me up 
You can't fix me up 
This bleeding heart 
This bleeding heart 
Found broken 
My innocence 
My innocence 
This bleeding heart 
Layin' down It grows cold 
Autumn's not the same without you 
The colors fade 
Beautiful to lifeless [Chorus] Waiting here for you 
Say that now we're home 
I write this knowing what to say to you 
Crying 
Crying 
Today there's nothing else to say to you 
Crying 
Crying This bleeding heart 
This bleeding heart 
Found broken 
My innocence 
My innocence 
This bleeding heart 
Lay me down 
This bleeding heart 
This bleeding heart 
Found broken 
Found broken
