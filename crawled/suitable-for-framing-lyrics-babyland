Once upon a time 
Sunk and surrounded 
A comparison began 
And the be-all and end-all 
Well it never happened 
The routine of questioning procedure 
Was pushing me in the one way 
I pretended to choose 
I pretended to choose 
So we experiment 
And give things a chance 
We find ourselves a rut slightly less obvious 
By taking command 
And the package states 
There's no such thing as destiny 
Pick the flavor you want 
The hanger-on will emulate it to a T 
Becoming more than the idol ever was 
It's no experiment 
Everything is a calculation 
We're silly echoes 
Who don't make sense 
Caught up tight 
In the dumb things we do 
We feel the need to release 
The results of reactions 
That take place within our heads 
All the stupid shit 
You counterfeit and fabricate 
Show me anything that's never been done 
One in a million 
One of a million 
The echo's confused 
Each reflection of the past 
Takes a life of its own 
Once upon a time 
We knew it was coming 
We hoped it was coming 
Go build big lies, go build big lies 
It's compensation for the nothings we are inside 
We fuck ourselves just to see what it feels like 
Retch perfection 
It's self-importance all the way 
A chip on my shoulder 
And it's almost as big as yours 
Go build big lies, go build big lies 
It's compensation for the void that we have inside 
Let's pretend we tried to see 
What it feels like 
Shit fulfillment 
It's self-importance all the way 
I've got a chip on my shoulder 
And it's almost as big as yours 
(We're number one)
