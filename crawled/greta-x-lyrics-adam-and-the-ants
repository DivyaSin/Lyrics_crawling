Adam ant Party's over it's time to change 
Shoes away I neatly arrange 
Next the hairdo 
On the block 
Put away my lovely frock 
T.v.-t.v. Underwear all tidied away 
Thirty eight bust just for a day 
Heels so high 
My furs so fine 
All a woman's things, they are mine 
T.v. - t.v. Oh, I'm a joyous glad t.v. 
Why don't you come t.v. with me? 
I know a girl who loves to dress me 
Up like this and then caress me 
To remind me of the way 
I used to go both night and day 
In femininity there's pride 
We'll marry soon 
I'll be the bride
