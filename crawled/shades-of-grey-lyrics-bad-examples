Turn the radio on, they never play your favorite song 
Whats the use of it all when all your colors fade away? 
And theres no-one to wonder why another rainy day 
Is fading in and out of shades of grey like always 
Fading in and out of shades of grey 
Just one breath and youll fade away 
Shadows hang on the walls, in the corners of your mind 
Grandfather clock ticking on, counting all your wasted time 
And theres no-one to wonder why another rainy day 
Is fading in and out of shades of grey like always 
Fading in and out of shades of grey 
Just one breath and youll fade away 
No rainbows to follow 
No rainbows tonight 
Fall asleep on the couch, wrinkle all your clothes again 
Dont bother trying to reach out -- theres nothing there but an empty dream 
And theres no-one to wonder why another rainy day 
Is fading in and out and fading in and out of shades of grey 
Fading in and out of shades of grey 
Fading in and out of shades of grey 
Fading in and out of shades of grey like always
