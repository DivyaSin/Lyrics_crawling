Well, I won two dollars on a scratch off ticket, 
So I went back to the counter and I bought two more with it. 
And I won ten bucks and that was just right, 
So I bought a six-pack and a bag of ice. 
You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got, 
It ain't like we really need a million dollar yacht, 'cause We got an inner-tube, 
We got a trailer hitch. 
We're near the river and far from rich. 
But we have got each other and gas in the tank, 
We're laughing all the way to the river bank. Still can you imagine if we ever struck it, 
I'd go shoot tequila take a lime and suck it. 
And we'd all tell our bosses they can do the same 
We'll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing. 
We'd sail around the world and go to shore in a dinghy 
But 'til that dream comes go and grab your bikini, 'cause We got an inner-tube, 
We got a trailer hitch. 
We're near the river and far from rich. 
But we have got each other and gas in the tank, 
And we're laughing all the way to the river bank. However it goes (Whatever happens), 
We got it made (In these shades) 
'Cause, baby we can float (Behind this boat) 
We can ride a wave. We got an inner-tube, 
We got a trailer hitch 
We're near the river and far from rich 
But we have got each other and gas in the tank, 
And it's a beautiful day. 
We're laughing all the way to the river bank
