No matter how much I say that I have learned life's lessons, 
the only way to know life's lessons is when it smacks you right in the face. 
Rubberband stretched to the limit, but still I cannot help but pull it just a little bit more. 
Once again my whole world crumbles, walls cave in, and I fall backwards, everything I know taken out at the knee. 
Hands stuffed deep into my mouth to keep from choking on the words that show how much I know 'bout knowing nothing, nothing at all. 
I know that these days will have an end, just like I know that I'll be back again. 
This place is awful, but it's familiar.
