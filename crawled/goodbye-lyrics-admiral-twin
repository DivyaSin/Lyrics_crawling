Can you still taste 
that last goodbye? 
Like blood and old perfume 
It haunts you 
It won't go away And while it lingers 
On your tongue 
You let the faucet run 
You stare off 
You don't hear a thing Oh, it's no use to cry 
It's no use to cry 
Now please believe 
You only need 
To say goodbye 
Bye-bye Can you still taste 
That last farewell? 
Like poison in your fruit 
It pains you 
It taints everything And now it's coursing 
through your viens 
And leaving ugly stains 
On the memories 
Of what we once were Oh, it's no use to cry 
It's no use to cry 
Now please believe 
You only need 
To say goodbye 
Bye-bye Oh, it's no use to cry 
It's no use to cry 
Now please believe 
You only need 
To say goodbye Can you still taste 
That last goodbye?
