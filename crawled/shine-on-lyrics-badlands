Yeah, alright Born by a river 
If you look into my eyes the river's end People sometimes think I'm crazy 
But I know this world's gone mad Tell me why 
I can't explain 
Way down inside I'm filled with pain Shine on 
Only you can set me free 
Shine on 
Close my eyes you're all I see 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 
Won't you turn your light on me Oh my Lord, I've been a sinner 
In my time I've seen my ways 
And if I beg down on my knees 
Would you hear these words I say `Cause in the dark I need your vision 
Don't let this poor soul fade away (Shine on) 
Only you can set me free 
(Shine on) 
Close my eyes you're all I see 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 
Won't you turn your light on me, yeah (Solo) Foolish anger is the flame 
That burns inside, it calls your name 
`Cause by a river, my soul is bleeding 
Hold me now Shine on 
Only you can set me free 
Shine on 
Close my eyes you're all I see 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 
Only you Shine on 
Only you can set me free 
Shine on 
I close my eyes you're all I see 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 
Won't you turn your light on me
