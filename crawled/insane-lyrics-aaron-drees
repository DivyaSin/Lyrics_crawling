You know I'll always let you shine 
Your lovely soul and your lovely mind 
Give me reason 
Do you know, do you know, do you know 
Embrace me when I hear you see my name 
All my problems go away, go away, go away Everyone knows you don't want to be me 
when I lose my mind (wasting time on little things) 
I don't believe one word that she said 
now that she has gone (wasting time on little things) You know I'll never set you free 
You'll never see the light of day 
I've got my reasons to be this way, to be this way 
to be this way 
Test me 
Girl you have no shame 
I hate your problems 
I go insane, Ii go insane, I go insane Everyone knows you don't want to be me 
when I lose my mind (wasting time on little things) 
I don't believe one word that she said 
now that she has gone (wasting time on little things)
