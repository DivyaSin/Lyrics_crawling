Written by Kevin Bacon "Kind of exploring the role that fear plays in my life. Thanks to Trav for the cool lick." KB She'll wake you in the morning 
As she fills your head at night 
She'll drop by, without warning 
Just when you thought you were doing all right You think she's far away in California 
But she has never been so near Mother fear She was there the day you turned your cheek 
She led you from the fight 
She was in your throat, when you couldn't speak 
She sings harmony tonight 
She knew just were you lived 
She brought the sedatives 
She brought the whiskey and the beer Mother fear, Mother fear, Mother fear That peaceful feeling's so deceiving 
You check the kids to see they're breathing And as you watch your house come tumbling down 
She stands beside you in the rubble 
She'll be the first to recognize the sound 
Of the bursting of the bubble And as you prance and pose 
In your new emperor's clothes 
She'll get the crowd to laugh and cheer 
And here she comes Mother fear, Mother fear 
Year after year after year
