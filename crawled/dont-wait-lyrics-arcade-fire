Don't wait, don't wait 
Don't wait, don't wait 
You're way too late 
Don't wait, don't wait The beat goes on 
Until it's gone She strolls so slowly with her ball and chain 
The cling clang chatters patterns with the patter of rain 
Stares in a mirror cracked in seven different ways 
With holes in her umbrella dripping on her face Her makeup running down like the tragedy face 
Alone on a city street surrounded by space 
She opens her mouth to scream and shout out the pain 
But all that comes out are silent sobbing sounds of restrain The beat goes on 
Until it's gone There comes a time when she will trust her belly 
Not disappear from the world like Machiavelli no 
Forfeit the pride it's not a crime but she's running out of time 
And denies it's showing while her anxiety's growing old Don't wait, don't wait 
Don't wait, don't wait 
You're way too late 
Don't wait, don't wait The beat goes on 
Until it's gone 
The beat goes on 
Don't wait 
Until it's gone 
Don't wait 
The beat goes on
