Like the summer of Sam, back in '69 
I'd be heavily, betterly, on the grind 
Cause to sing this nice, is the beat of crime 
I've been murdering, I'm murdering 'em 
Like the summer of love back in '69 
You can say that I'm yours, but my body is divine 
I belong to everybody that I walk by 
Like hi, hi 
I'm the master of my destiny 
You haven't seen the best of me 
And if you want the rest of me 
You'll have to pay a lovely fee 
Hard, to stay far, far away from me 
Cause I am the baddest Boy in NYC 
You can look but please don't touch 
Boys stay away from me Baby I'm a cinnamon Boy 
Keeping it fresh, on the far east side 
Baby I'm a tenement Boy 
Keepin' it in ch-ch-cherry pie 
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest Boy in NYC 
Baby I'm a dangerous Boy, 
You should stay away from me 
I've been murdering, I'm murdering em 
I be murdering, I'm murdering em Like the summer of Sam, back in '69 
I've been tying them up, and hang 'em out to dry 
Cause I'm hot like that when I walk to die 
I be murdering, I'm murdering em um 
Like the summer of love back in '69 
When I get on the microphone my, my 
They be looking at each other like ay, ay, ay 
Bye, bye 
Please excuse my mo-vivacity, capacity for head games 
Cause it's incredible 
It's better if you stay away from me, 
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me 
I am the baddest Boy in NYC 
You can look but please don't touch 
But boy step away from me Baby I'm a cinnamon Boy 
Keeping it fresh, on the e-east side 
Baby I'm a tenement Boy 
Keepin' it in ch-ch-cherry pie 
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest Boy in NYC 
Baby I'm a dangerous Boy, 
Baby should stay away from me 
I've been murdering, I'm murdering em happily 
Murdering, I'm murdering 'em ah, ah 
Murdering, I'm murdering 'em
