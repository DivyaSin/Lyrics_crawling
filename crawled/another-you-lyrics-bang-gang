I was sane until you came 
Saw your face it was so strange 
I could not take it Ruined me with your disease 
Changed my heart and broke my dreams 
I could not take it How can it feel so good to die? Help me to find another you 
Try to understand it It was a hard time 
I could not se 
Inside you Help me...
