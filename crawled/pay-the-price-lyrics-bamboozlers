words and music: Steven Rhodes 
When you let me go, I didn't know what to do 
'Cause I was stuck, I was stuck on you 
When you went away, it crushed me 
It shattered all my hopes, my thoughts, and my dreams 
And for a long, long time after that I didn't know what to do 
No one ever saw me all I did was sleep and I stayed up in my room 
Chorus: 
Well Baby it's your fault now you don't lie 
You broke my heart and now you'll pay the price 
You could have me back but otherwise 
You broke my heart and now you'll pay the price 
So now please go away, leave me alone 
Don't try to talk to me, don't call me on the phone 
When you left, I was through with you 
So now please leave, walk away from me 
(Coda) And when you walk away don't turn around because you 
won't find me behind you 
'Cause you when you walked out of the door you didn't turn 
around and I told you that we were through 
Chorus
