Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news 
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues 
My baby's gone, I have no friends 
To wish me greetings, once again Choirs will be singing 'Silent night' 
Christmas carols by candlelight 
Please come home for Christmas 
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night Friends and relations send salutations 
Oh, sure, sure as the stars shine above 
This is Christmas, Christmas my dear 
The time of year to be with the one you love Then won't you tell me you'll never more roam? 
Christmas and New Year will find you home 
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain 
'Cause I'll be happy, happy once again Friends and relations send salutations 
Sure as the stars shine above 
This is Christmas, yes Christmas my dear 
The time of year to be with the one you love Then won't you tell me you'll never more roam? 
Christmas and New Year will find you home 
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain 
'Cause I'll be happy, happy once again
