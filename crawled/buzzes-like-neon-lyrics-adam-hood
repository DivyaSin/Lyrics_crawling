Theres a light in the city 
Standing 5 miles high 
Im crossing that river 
Theres a girl on my mind 
Its high atop the buildings 
Flashing Red 
And Its just a one more reason 
Shes stuck in my head And it buzzes like neon 
And it makes me feel fine 
And the way she leads me on 
Its a real good sign These dirty brick cities 
They all look the same 
Not one damn person 
Ever knows my name 
These clouds aint liftin 
Theres something within 
Says a change in the weather 
Is coming round again And it buzzes like neon 
And it makes me feel fine 
And the way she leads me on 
Its a real good sign From Lawrence to Springfield 
There aint nothing out there 
Just hills and prairies 
And this cold dry air 
Im starting to hear voices 
From home sweet home 
Too far out to turn around 
Tired of being alone And it buzzes like neon 
And it makes me feel fine 
And the way she leads me on 
Its a real good sign Yeah buzzes like neon 
Makes me feel fine 
And the way she leads me on 
Its a real good sign 
It buzzes like neon 
It buzzes like neon
