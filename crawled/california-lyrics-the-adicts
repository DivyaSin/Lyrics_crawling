California sun 
Shining through the window 
Beating up and down 
Like a yellow yo-yo 
Its just the sun California 
California Annie's got a gun 
She knows how to use it 
Points it at the sun 
Its a California shootout 
She's got a gun! California 
California California 
(California) 
California 
(California) California 
(California) 
California 
(California) California sunset 
Always clouds my day 
California dreamers 
With that California way 
Speakin' with a stranger lyin' by the pool 
Dying to be near you 
Oh we look so cool! 
Yes we do!
