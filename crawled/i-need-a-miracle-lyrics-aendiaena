i woke up from a middle of a dream 
of this dream i'd like to live it on 
now it's gone like you have never been here 
but my love for u is steadily growin' just call on my heart 
and we'll make a start i need a miracle, a tiny little miracle 
so come and ease my mind 
three words of u would do 
a miracle, a tiny little miracle 
to come and ease my mind 
it's all because of u 
hey girl, all because of u allright now 
now it's time for our true love to share 
yeah, 
i'm the one to sleep there by your side 
call my name and i will be ready 
when u need some tender love in the night 
just call on my heart 
and we'll make a start i need a miracle...
