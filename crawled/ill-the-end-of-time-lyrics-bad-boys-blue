I just would like to talk to you. 
Maybe a minute, girl, or two. 
You had your time to think it over. 
I tried to call you on the phone. 
Somebody told me you're not at home. 
And I wonder. Wonder. 
And I wonder. Till the end of time my love. 
I can't say good bye till the day I die. 
I'm not giving in my love. 
This heart of mine it won't be changing. 
Till the end of time. 
Till the end of time It's not that I will cry or shout. 
Girl, every time you mess around. 
I simply want to talk it over. 
And maybe I can make you see. 
What in the world you mean to me. 
Remember. Remember. Remember. (Gonna love you till the day I die - Till I die.)
