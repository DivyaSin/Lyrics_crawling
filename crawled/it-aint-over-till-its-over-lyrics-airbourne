Sweatin' it out upon the stage 
Thankful to be out of the cage 
I got no fear 'cause I don't feel pain 
Come on, baby, let's do it again [Chorus] 
It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
I'm gonna ride this train till the end of the line 
Love this bitch till the morning light Drinking all the beer that I can find 
Come on, baby, won't you be mine? 
No slowing down, got no self sense 
Hit the gas, honey; it's rocking time [Chorus] It ain't over, over 
No, it ain't 
Let's rock-'n'-roll 
Over, over, not for me 
It ain't over, over 
No, it ain't 
Let's rock-'n'-roll 
Till the fat lady, fat lady, fat lady screams Let it rock 
It ain't over 
Until it's over Sweatin' it out upon the stage 
Thankful to be out of the cage 
No slowing down, got no self sense 
Hit the gas, honey; it's rocking time It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over 
It ain't over till it's over It ain't over, over, not for me 
It's rock-'n'-roll 
Over, over, no, it ain't, all right 
It ain't over, over, not for me 
It never will be 
Until the fat lady, fat lady, fat lady screams Rock-'n'-roll It ain't over (till it's over) 
It ain't over (till it's over) 
It ain't over (till it's over) 
It ain't over till it's over 
I'm gonna ride this train till the end of the line 
Love this bitch till the morning light
