We passed 800 miles talking circles about living with loss 
You said your sense of humor's always helped you get above & across 
Every hurdle, every chasm, every shocking & unspeakable blow 
Just proves the universe is chaos so you laugh to clear the lump from your throat But if you're fixed on being bitter 
Go be bitter on your own 
We're still two hours from El Paso 
Arizona's such a long way to go The chemicals were coursing through our bloodstreams at incongruous rates 
I was time-traveling inward through a past life I can never erase 
You were hanging out the window, you said: 'We're just a beggar's banquet in space' 
You were laughing at the moon, you were cursing it for wearing your face Me & New Mexico are orphans 
Or is it bastards? Either way: 
I know a guy in Roswell 
We'll hitch a moonride, steal you back your face
