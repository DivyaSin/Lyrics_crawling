Everybody's been standing around like they're ready 
Everybody's been going around carrying signs Come on and get a few things back together 
And don't get lost in the stormy weather 
Or when you're flying like birds of a feather Don't get yourself in trouble 
Don't get yourself in trouble 
Don't get yourself in trouble 
Don't get yourself in trouble 
(Here comes trouble now) Everybody's been standing around like they're ready 
Everybody's been going around carrying signs Just keep on dancing to the music 
It's the only way you're gonna use it 
And when you shake your money maker Don't get yourself in trouble 
Don't get yourself in trouble 
Don't get yourself in trouble 
Don't get yourself in trouble Everybody's been standing around like they're ready 
Everybody's been going around carrying signs Come on and get a few things back together 
Don't get lost in the stormy weather 
And when you're flying around like birds of a feather Don't get yourself in trouble 
Don't get yourself in trouble 
Don't get yourself in trouble 
Don't get yourself in trouble
