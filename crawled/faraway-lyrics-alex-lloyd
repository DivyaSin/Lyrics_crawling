Close to the box 
Received transmission 
One thousand scenes of dramavision 
Oh yeah 
It's making me laugh, it's making me cry 
Blurred red dots when I close my eyes 
Oh yeah You're so far away and I'm still here 
You're so far away and I'm still here 
Waiting for nothing 
Waiting for no one The damage reports are coming in 
The lines are so busy wearing thin 
Oh yeah 
It's making me laugh, it's making me cry 
Blurred red dots when I close my eyes 
Oh yeah Always trying to find a piece of you in someone 
Always trying to find something in someone 
Nothing left to say but I can't find my way
