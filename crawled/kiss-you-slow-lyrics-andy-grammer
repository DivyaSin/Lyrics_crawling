I know you didn't think that loving me meant so much time alone 
Dinner for one on the couch, another movie on your own 
You know that I'm never gonna be a nine to five, that was never me 
I was born with a compass in my hand and a restless soul But when it hurts, when you can't take it 
And when the rubber band feels like it's breaking Hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there 
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair 
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight 
And my vocals tickle your ear 
And you almost can feel me here 
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight As far as ladies go, baby you should know you're so patient 
You're a thick skin, definition of low maintenance 
But it's enough, time goes by 
You can help but dim your light 
An empty house can make a cold heart feel so naked But when it hurts, when you can't take it 
And when the rubber band feels like it's breaking You hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there 
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair 
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight 
And my vocals tickle your ear 
And you almost can feel me here 
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight Yeah, oh, let me be your 
Be your second home for a while 
Home, all you've ever known 
So baby listen close for me inside And hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there 
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair 
When my piano will kiss you slow And hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there 
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair 
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight 
And my vocals tickle your ear 
And you almost can feel me here 
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight 
Will kiss you slow tonight 
Will kiss you slow tonight 
Will kiss you slow tonight
