They should have shut down all the streets 
Presidents and kings should've been there 
With not a single empty seat 
All the schools closed 
And the roads we drove down all lined 
Lined with people cap in hand and crying 
That went on for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles They should have shut down all the streets 
All the papers plastered with tributes 
We should have asked for privacy 
Though we understand if it's someone to share their pain 
We would ask to grieve this in our quiet way 
And they should have asked again and again and again They should have shut down all the streets 
All the brocades piled on the doorstep 
And pages filled with crayon hearts that a second grade class had made in their school that day 
Because the teacher had to give them some small way 
And there weren't that many ways left for her to say They should have shut down all the streets
