Like a warrior that fights 
And wins the battle 
I know the taste of victory 
Though i went through some nights 
Consumed by the shadows 
And was crippled emotionally 
Somehow I made it through the heartace 
I escaped 
I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith 
Kept my faith 
(Chorus) 
And the river was deep I didn't falter 
When the mountain was high 
I still believed 
When the valley was low 
It didn't stop me 
I knew you were waiting 
Knew you were waiting for me 
With and endless desire 
I kept on searching 
Sure in time our eyes would meet 
And like the bridge is on fire 
The hurt is over 
One touch and you set me free 
I don't regret a single moment 
Looking back, when I think of all those disappointments 
I just laugh, I just laugh 
(Chorus) 
So we were drawn together through destiny 
I know this love we share was meant to be 
It's Only Love

When the feelin' is ended 
There ain't no use pretendin' 
Don't ya worry - it's only love 
When your world has been shattered 
Ain't nothin' else matters 
It ain't over - it's only love 
And that's all - ya 
When your heart has been broken 
Hard words have been spoken 
It ain't easy - but it's only love 
And if your life ain't worth livin' 
And you're ready to give in 
Just remember - that it's only love 
You can live without the aggravation 
Ya gotta wanna win - ya gotta wanna win 
You keep lookin' back in desperation 
Over and over and over again 
When your world is shattered 
Ain't nothin' else matters 
It ain't over - it's only love 
If your life ain't worth livin' 
And you're ready to give in 
Just remember - that it's only love 
Ya - that's all 
Ya it ain't easy baby 
But it's only love - and that's all
