My life has scripted lines like a movie 
And youre listening now 
My directors watchful eye is recording 
Every move and sound The camera's on, three, two, one, everyday 
Because it wont be long til its done 
And tomorrow will bring the awesome rising sun 
Like a preview of whats to come Watch me go on the slide 
Scene by scene, my whole life 
Im showing you my heart 
From real to reel Run the tape through my mind 
Fit to screen, cut to size 
Im playing you my Best of how I feel 
From real to reel Ill roll through Hollywood with a chariot 
And gold rimmed shades 
I cant imagine the look on Oscar's face 
When he sees my star on the walk of fame Oh, I believe when I leave 
Ill play a part in this eternitys documentary 
Tomorrow will bring the awesome rising sun 
Like a preview of whats to come Watch me go on the slide 
Scene by scene of my whole life 
Im showing you my heart 
From real to reel Run the tape through my mind 
Fit to screen, cut to size 
Im playing you my Best of how I feel Watch me go on that slide 
Behind the scenes of my true life 
Im showing you my heart 
From real to reel Run the tape through my mind 
Fit to screen, cut to size 
Im playing you my Best of how I feel 
From real to reel My life has scripted lines 
Like a movie and youre listening now
