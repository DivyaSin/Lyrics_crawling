All my little plans and schemes 
Lost like some forgotten dream 
Seems that all I really was doing 
Was waitin' for you Just like little girls and boys 
Playing with their little toys 
Seems like all I really was doing 
Was waitin' for you Don't need to be alone 
No need to be alone It's real love, it's real 
Yes it's real love, it's real I don't expect for you 
To understand 
The kingdom of heaven 
Is in your hands 
I don't expect for you 
To wake up from your dream 
Too late for crying 
Now it seems From this moment on I know 
Exactly where my life will go 
Seems that all I really was doing 
Was waitin' for love Don't need to be afraid 
No need to be afraid It's real love, it's real 
Yes it's real love, it's real Thought I'd been in love before 
But in my heart I wanted more 
Seems like all I really was doing 
Was waitin' for love Don't need to be alone 
No need to be alone It's real love, it's real 
It's real love, it's real 
It's real love, it's real 
It's real love, it's real 
It's real love, it's real 
It's real love 
It's real love 
It's real love It's real love, it's real
