How do you feel now 
We've got a reason to go on 
Newly born 
Seems like I've waited for a lifetime 
But honey I believed in you When I saw her face I had to cry 
I don't know why 
Is she real? 
Seems like I've waited for a lifetime 
But honey I believed in you 
To make my dreams all come true 
We've got a child I tried and tried to talk it over 
Seemed like we'd waited a million years 
Then you conceived our child was born 
And we were one 
Picked her up put her by your side 
Saw the smile that you couldn't hide I tried and tried to talk it over 
Seemed like we'd waited a million years 
Then you conceived our child was born 
And we were one 
Picked her up put her by your side 
Saw the smile that you couldn't hide
