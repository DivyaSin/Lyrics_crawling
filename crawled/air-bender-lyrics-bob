Rush hour, fresh out the dealership 
Me and my homies eat the filthy fish 
I ain't even worried about a silly bitch 
Tell the feds chill with the censorship Members only, I'm the only member with the membership 
Trying real hard not to conversate with pessimists 
Who always want to see you fall down like The London Bridge 
Same song sung by a bunch of kids, can I live? Tabloids watching which crib 
Competition and the bitches got my name on they lips 
Takin' shots like 1 8 7 is they favorite offense 
Real dawg, should've came with a fence 
Smokin' tree, baby I could pitch you a tent
