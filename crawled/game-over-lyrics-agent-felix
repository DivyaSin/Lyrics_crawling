everything that you said 
is kind 
kind of pissing me off so this one goes out to you 
to tell you that I hate you 
and god i hope you hate me too i'm just glad I got to make you cry i'm sorry 
that I ever saw your face 
that i ever asked your name 
that i loved you for that while 
that i ever made you smile try to climb into my head 
so you can see just how i feel 
this hate that was once pretend 
is now turning oh so real 
I realize 
taht im glad that your gone 
wish you were standing on that bridge 
when i burnt it to the ground i've closed this door 
at least 100 times 
but i always leave the key 
somewhere that you will find 
but the next time 
your hand gently knocks 
you will find 
that i changed the all of the locks you pull me in close enough 
to punch me in the face 
still i come back again 
why am i such a disgrace 
you're not worth 
all this pain that I feel 
its over 
im done this time for real take my pictures off your wall
