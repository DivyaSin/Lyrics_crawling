I find myself lost 
For the first time 
And all of the moments I had to myself 
Are now spent picturing you 
But I am not cross 
And this ain't a goodbye 
I am convinced that you one day will realize 
The pain that you're putting me through Yeah I worked on a farm 
Met a girl with a charm and a stable 
We laughed all the time 
Drank our cranberry wine in a fable 
And our lips tasted sweet 
And I loved her as much as I was able 
But I could not fall 
When I'd recall How when you and I walked down the street 
The sky took itself round our heads 
And all of the people we'd meet 
Come to laughin the story we said 
And I just don't know when this will happen again If you are not set intractably forward 
With you cool boyfriend your job and your home 
It's a five hour trip if you fly 
You can come live with me 
Down here in the basement 
It's cold in the winter, wet in the summer 
But I know that we could get by Cause I went into town met a girl in a gown at a bar 
She was smart, talked about art 
Drank her champagne and ate caviar 
We made love in the back 
Of her stretch cadillac fancy car 
But I could not fall 
When I'd recall How when you and I figured it out 
The time was just space for our breath 
And we'd tangle and spiral and soar 
Past the trees that all swayed round our heads 
And I just don't know when this will happen again If I could just say 
I know I'm a shithead 
I know it was me that went off and left you 
But I was just anxious and dumb 
I don't know what I've learned 
I still march to a dyslexic drummer 
Maybe I just needed some time to myself 
To write all the songs that I've sung Yeah I've travelled throughout 
This whole world lived without and within 
Read newspapers and books 
Learned how heroes and crooks lose and win 
I even tried me some drugs, and I still ain't found love 
Then again 
I start to fall when I recall You and I standing alone 
With the glowing sun closing its eyes 
As we'd melt into one in the dark 
And make our own mountains and skies 
And my beat up guitar sounds like rain 
As it pours out the soul of the world 
Which is filled with regrets and mistakes 
And the hearts of a fella and girl And it all breathes in time to this song 
And flashes of blistering red 
It will find you wherever you are 
And wrap itself round both our heads 
And I just don't know when this will happen again
