[Verse 1] 
If you're far from home 
Broken on a lonely road 
Helpless when the sky explodes 
Then I need you to know 
When you're 'round the bend 
Close your eyes and count to ten 
I'll walk through hell and back again 
Anywhere you go [Pre-Chorus] 
If your strength is falling down 
I'll be right beside you now 
And I'll keep you warm 
Yeah, I'll keep you warm 
[Chorus] 
I'll follow you into the storm 
Follow you into the storm 
I will, I will 
Be with you when you call 
Carry you till the dawn 
I will, I will 
Follow you into the storm [Verse 2] 
So violently 
Held captive by your gravity 
Hold your breath and wait for me 
Where the wind may blow 
Through night and dark 
Through fantasies that fall apart 
Know you're always in my heart 
Anywhere you go [Pre-Chorus] 
If your strength is falling down 
I'll be right beside you now 
And I'll keep you warm 
Yeah, I'll keep you warm [Chorus] 
I'll follow you into the storm 
Follow you into the storm 
I will, I will 
Be with you when you call 
Carry you till the dawn 
I will, I will 
Follow you into the storm [Post-Chorus] 
Oh, be with you when you call 
Carry you till the dawn 
Follow you into the storm [Bridge] 
Anywhere that you go 
Anywhere that you go [Chorus] 
I'll follow you into the storm 
Follow you into the storm 
I will, I will 
Oh, be with you when you call 
Carry you till the dawn 
I will, I will 
Follow you into the storm 
Follow you into the storm 
Follow you into the storm 
Follow you into the storm 
Follow you into the storm
