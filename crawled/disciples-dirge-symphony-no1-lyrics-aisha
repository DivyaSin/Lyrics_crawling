Movement 1: The scripture holds true 
Father forgive them 
For they know not what they do 
Among men 
He may have seemed the least 
Why didn't they hold their peace 
The wisdom in this 
Our eyes could not see 
Why couldn't they just let Him be 
We didn't understand 
This great and holy man 
The irony is 
The earth His Father made knows who He is Movement 2: When he died 
Was crucified 
The sun hid its face 
In disgrace 
Withdrew its face 
Refusing to shine 
Because the Divine died Movement 3: The irony is 
The earth, which is His 
Was made by God 
And it is odd 
That the world 
Made of people 
Sought to destroy Him 
As their equal 
But He is not 
For He is God Disciples Dirge 
A liturgy 
But He lives in eternity

And could not keep silent 
the weather became violent 
and manifested it's grief 
The world knew 
Yet we held our peace 
And let this innocent man's life cease 
When we should have been silent 
We called for his death 
When we should have wept 
Barabas laughed at our gaffe 
Judas sent his thanks 
For putting Him on the planks Movement 5: What was His crime 
We have yet to see 
Because He was not guilty 
But the Father was appeased 
This is My Son in whom I'm well pleased 
We should have treasured Him when He was here 
no need to fear 
In our hearts 
He is always near Disciples Dirge 
A liturgy 
But He lives in eternity
