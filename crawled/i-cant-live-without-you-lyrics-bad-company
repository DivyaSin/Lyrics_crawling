The first time you deceived me, it nearly broke my heart 
What hurts me most was I'm the last to know 
So lately I've been thinking, thinking 'bout you 
I know deep in my heart you had to go Last night when I told you, you looked into my eyes 
A wicked smile just spread across your face 
You know I can't resist you, no matter what you do 
The way you treat me babe, it's a disgrace I can't live without you, heaven knows I really tried 
Girl, there's something wild about you 
And it won't let me say goodbye Girl, you drive me crazy, I don't know what to do 
Every night, I keep on losing sleep 
'Cause when I make my mind up, you smile that wicked smile 
That's when I know I'm in too deep I can't live without you, heaven knows I really tried 
Girl, there's something wild about you 
And it won't let me say goodbye You just laugh everytime that I go crazy 
You know too well who's got control 
The way you turn me inside out, you just amaze me 
You got my heart and soul, girl you've got it all I can't live without you, heaven knows I really tried 
Girl, there's something wild about you 
And it won't let me say goodbye I can't live without you, heaven knows I really tried 
Girl, there's something wild about you 
And it won't let me say goodbye I can't live without you, heaven knows I really tried 
Girl, there's something wild about you 
And it won't let me say goodbye
