I don't even know the real me anymore 
I can't even show how I feel 
I hit the floor 
I'm talking rock bottom 
My feelings I fought em 
I can't believe it's come to this 
'Cause I need to a grip on reality Now i wanna feel some sensitivity 
I'm here, i'm telling you i Cleared my life 
I changed my head 
Trying to catch my skin again 
I'm finding out what makes me wanna live 
By living it up again 
It's my world 
I paved my way 
Found my sensitivity 
I stepped back from the edge 
Now i'm living it up again I've been doing fine in my misery 
Not crazy 
I told them not to worry about me But everytime i wanna feel some sensitivity 
I'm here, i'm telling you i Cleared my life 
I changed my head 
Trying to catch my skin again 
I'm finding out what makes me wanna live 
By living it up again 
It's my world 
I paved my way 
Found my sensitivity 
I stepped back from the edge 
Now I'm living it up again Living it up again 
Living it up again 
Living it up now i'm not crazy i'm just sensitive 
I stepped back from the edge I cleared my life 
I changed my head 
Trying to catch my skin again 
I'm finding out what makes me wanna live 
By living it up again 
It's my world 
I paved my way 
Found my sensitivity 
I stepped back from the edge 
Now I'm living it up again Living it up again 
I'm living it up again 
Living it up now i'm not crazy i'm just sensitive 
Living it up again 
I'm living it up again 
Living it up now i'm not crazy i'm just sensitive
