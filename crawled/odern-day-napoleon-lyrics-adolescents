Such a hawk 
Not a dove 
Do you really believe in the god above? Took control when we found ourselves in sticky situations 
Not a gesture of love, but self appreciation Idleness 
Webs of time 
Treacheries you undermined Now you find yourself in a sticky situation 
We laugh as you drown in your own humiliation [Chorus:] 
Search for the truth, wade through the lies 
A smiling face is your disguise 
Eye for a tooth, tooth for an eye 
Abused out trust and broke our ties Waste a week 
Save a dime 
Raping the scene, now you're a victim of the crime Using us pawns for your games of complication 
We suffered because of your ill procrastination Lots of plans 
None complete 
Never would you, could you accept defeat Kept us locked in a state of suspended animation 
Didn't want to let go, clung on like a damn mutation [Chorus] Such a hawk 
Not a dove 
Do you really believe in the god above? Took control when we found ourselves in sticky situations 
Not a gesture of love, but self appreciation Idleness 
Webs of time 
Treacheries you undermined Now you find yourself in a sticky situation 
We laugh as you drown in your own humiliation [Chorus]
