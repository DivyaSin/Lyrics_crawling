I called my mom I called my friend 
Looking for a reason to go home again 
But you make me feel like I don't belong 
Like my heart's too weak and my head's too strong 
Opposites attract sometimes but not the way 
you're attracting mine 
And I can't change the way you are 
Even though you think you're some kind of rock star I want you out of my life 
'cause your heart is as cold as ice 
It's time that you hit the door 
I don't want to see you no more You want me to walk like this and talk like that 
Dye my hair and don't wear hats 
And dress too sleazy and go too far 
But all I want to do is play my guitar 
And I don't think that it's fair 
And I don't think that you care about me 
Yeah but I see the way it's got to be 
I want you out of my life Why am I in this alone 
Is my love too much for you 
What's wrong with home 
I hope you have found your answer 
Becuase I think that I found mine 
I want you out of my life
