Candles dance 
Her softened cue 
She returns 
Then goes away 
Brings you her magic 
And brings you her key 
Leaves you to wonder 
Her mystery 
Yet she contends 
You are her only friend Breathed in dreams 
A frozen fire 
She imparts 
Her labyrinth charm 
Shows you the river 
And leads you to drink 
Promises shrouded 
In mystery 
And you pretend 
You are her only friend
