Baby you know me well you know I mean what I say 
Before I say farewell I'll give you just another day 
So you can find out what's happening find out what's happening before long 
If you don't find out what's happening you're gonna find out that I'm gone 
Tell me what you're gonna now do you better make up your mind 
It all depends on you or I'm leavin' you far behind 
You'd better find out what's happening find out what's happening before long 
If you don't find out what's happening you're gonna find your mama gone Well baby you know it's true we've been through thick and thin 
But if you don't come through you won't ever see me again 
So you'd better find out what's happening find out what's happening before long 
If you don't find out what's happening you're gonna find your baby gone 
Find out what's happening find out what's happening
