Well, Ill be your cigarette man 
Do whatever I can 
Honey, cant you see at the end of the line theres a home 
So far away 
Sittin here like a smoke in the rain 
Im trying to figure out why sometimes I cant tell you 
all the things you wanna hear Oh, yeah, never ever I can walk your garden 
You dont speak, you dont say a word 
It really doesnt matter anyway 
Why am I like a child in the playground 
Wanna touch the rain Oh, why cant you tell me lies 
Like you never ever done before 
Oh, why cant you tell me lies 
I need to hear some more 
Some more 
Some more 
Like you never ever done before Sometimes Ive been so close 
But all of the sudden memories just seems to disappear 
So far away 
It touches me to see your graceless moves 
On the other hand it kills me so shame on you 
To crusify me on your... yeah Oh, yeah, never ever I can walk your garden 
You dont speak, you dont say a word 
It really doesnt matter anyway 
Why am I like a child in the playground 
Wanna touch the rain Oh, why cant you tell me lies 
Like you never ever done before 
Oh, why cant you tell me lies 
I need to hear some more 
Some more 
Some more 
Like you never ever done before Well, life can sometimes be such a tragedy 
You would not understand 
You would not understand 
Why youre bringin me down Oh, yeah, never ever I can walk your garden 
You dont speak, you dont say 
And it really doesnt matter anyway 
Why am I like a child in the playground Wanna touch the rain 
Oh, why cant you tell me lies 
Like you never ever done before 
Oh, why cant you tell me lies 
I need to hear some more 
Oh, why cant you tell me lies 
Like you never ever done before 
Oh, yeah, cant you tell me lies 
I need to hear some more 
Some more 
Some more 
Like you never ever done before 
Some more 
Some more 
Like you never ever done before `Cause Ill be your cigarette man 
I do whatever I can 
But, honey, cant you see at the end of the line theres a home 
Why do I keep telling you these god damn lies?
