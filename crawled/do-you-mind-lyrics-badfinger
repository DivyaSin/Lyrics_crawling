Do you mind if I call you my friend 
Just to say that our love will not end? 
Do you mind? 
Do you worry sometimes? 
Do you find that you hurry sometimes? 
Do you mind when I don't understand 
All the problems that come with your hand? 
Do you mind? 
Do you worry sometimes? 
Do you find that you hurry sometimes? 
Or will you be leaving sooner than you thought? 
Or will you stay longer? 
[guitar solo (Joey Molland)] 
Or will you be leaving sooner than you thought? 
Or will you stay longer? 
Do you mind if I call you my friend 
Just to say that our love will not end? 
Do you mind? 
Do you worry sometimes? 
Do you find that you hurry sometimes?
