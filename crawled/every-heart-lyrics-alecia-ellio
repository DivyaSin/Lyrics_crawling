Every heart has to hurt sometimes 
Every lover knows who's ever been left behind 
Every time you told me 
Every time i believe 
It would never be mine 
I was just standin' in line 
Every heart has to hurt sometimes I've always been on the other side of goodbye 
Handin' out answers to someone else's why 
Baby don't wait for me to ask you not to go 
Why down inside i know Every heart has to hurt sometimes 
Every lover knows who's ever been left behind 
Every time you told me 
Every time i believe 
It would never be mine 
I was just standin' in line 
Every heart has to hurt sometimes I guess it finally got around to bein' me 
Nothin' you do or say 
Is gonna make it easy
