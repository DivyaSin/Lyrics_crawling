I'm flashing back on 
When you were going to sleep 
Your world drawn in every scene 
Now you're trying to see me 
Well I'm still here with the crown 
I'm not going around out of your mind 
As we stay in gravity I will do everything 
You are my beauty queen 
So lets just say it 
I will do everything 
And my words will never change I'm flashing back on 
when you were afraid of dreams 
Your world drawn in every scene 
You're trying to see 
Well im still here with the crown I will do everything 
You are my beauty queen 
You know I'm saying 
And I will do everything 
And my words will never change 
Oh never change 
No no no 
And my words will never change
