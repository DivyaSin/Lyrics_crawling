How come the worlds off track? 
How come do governments attack? 
How come you wont call me back? How come the dollar's king? 
How come its everything? 
How come the phone wont ring? How come the uphill climb? 
How come theres so much crime? 
How come you never try Youve got my number, you know just what to do 
Youve got the answer too 
I tried and tried but I never make it through 
Im just hung up on you How come God lost control? 
How come the human soul? 
How come a line won't toll? How come the funeral pyre? 
How come the forest fire? 
How come you never wire? How come is man so vile? 
How can he reconcile? 
How come you just wont dial? Youve got my number, you know just what to do 
Youve got the answer too 
I tried and tried but I never make it through 
Im just hung up on you, Im just hung up on you Oh, let your fingers do the walking 
Ill listen close to what you say 
Ive got a mind to speak but you can do the talking 
I know you want to anyway Youve got my number, you know just what to do 
Youve got the answer too 
I tried and tried but I never make it through 
Im just hung up on you, Im just hung up on you 
Im just hung up on, up on, up on you
