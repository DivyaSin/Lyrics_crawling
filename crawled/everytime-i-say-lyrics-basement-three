You come into my life 
And I am not surprised 
'Cause every time I see you 'round 
My heart goes up and down You're deep inside my soul 
I lose my self-control 
Every time you go away 
I feel like you're afraid Every time I say you're leaving, lover 
That's when [unverified] comes to me right now 
I want to fly with you, we are together 
You go left, you go right, I'll be by your side Every time I say you're leaving, lover 
Tell me honey I'm your shining sun 
Well baby, now I know I'm your favorite lover 
All I need is your love in your eyes You are my paradise 
My flower in the skies 
Just let me tell you what I want 
The only one I want You're deep inside my soul 
I lose my self-control 
Every time you go away 
I feel like you're afraid Every time I say you're leaving, lover 
That's when [unverified] comes to me right now 
I want to fly with you, we are together 
You go left, you go right, I'll be by your side Every time I say you're leaving, lover 
Tell me honey I'm your shining sun 
Well baby, now I know I'm your favorite lover 
All I need is your love in your eyes
