You won't regret it 
Lets make it happen right now There's no one, no one like me 
I've been told so many times before 
And if it was true 
I know he couldn't do you like I do 
And do the things I do to you, yeah baby You see, you see that I'm a special guy 
I thought you knew everything 
Before you got involved with me 
You know that I'm the one to get the job done 
Oh girl, I love you naturally There should not be a doubt in your mind 
I have to prove myself to you a thousand times 
And if you want real love, then come with me 
I won't do you wrong, I'll love you all night long 1, I'm all about love 
2, It ain't no joke 
3, I can do you right 
4, Just stay the night 
You won't regret it, let's make it happen right now Soon and very soon, you should make that move 
And if you don't somebody will take your place 
But I do care 
I feel I need to have you with me girl 
You better take time and understand my wishes 
But don't get confused with them 
Oh I'm about lovin you and that's all I want to do 
I want to take you to another level There should not be a doubt in your mind 
I have to prove myself to you a thousand times 
And if you want real love 
Then come with me 
I won't do you wrong 
I'll love you all night long You won't regret it, let's make it happen right now (Repeat x 2)
