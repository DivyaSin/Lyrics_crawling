They all wanna go like that 
Damn videos almost crash 
Ya knows make the boys go crazy 
Everytime I turn my back 
That was when I get explained Cause I treat them 
Like I need them 
Cause Imma single 
I don't need them And they try to grab my hand 
Every single time I seen it 
Look what is worst in my jeans 
They wanna spend money on me 
Pop is the whole I seen 
Love me like coffee in the morning Cause I treat them 
Like I need them 
Cause Imma single 
I don't need them I keep from coming back 
They'all wana go like that You wanna tie me up

You wanna wild me up 
Cause Imma bad one Boys the boys love me 
And it keep me coming back all week 
Boys the boys love bad 
And it keep me coming back all day So, walk around here like a boy magnet 
Walk around here like a boy magnet
