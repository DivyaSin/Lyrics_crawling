Tell me before I waltz out of your life 
Before turning my back on the past 
Forgive my impertinent behavior 
But how long do you think this pantomime can last? Tell me before I ride off in the sunset, there's one thing I never got clear 
How can you claim you're a savior 
When those who oppose you are stepped on 
Or cut up, or simply disappear? Tell me before you get onto your bus 
Before joining the forgotten brigade 
How can one person like me, say 
Alter the time-honored way the game is played? Tell me before you get onto your high horse 
Just what you expect me to do, I don't care what the Bourgeoisie say 
I'm not in business for them but to give all my descamisados 
A magical moment or two There is evil, ever around 
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental 
So what are my chances of honest advances? I'd say low 
Better to win by admitting my sin than to lose with a halo Tell me before I seek worthier pastures and thereby restore self-esteem 
How can you be so short-sighted 
To look never further than this week or next week 
Than have no impossible dream? Allow me before you slink off to the sidelines 
I'll pay your fair gift three cheers but first tell me who'd be delighted 
To witness me the top world's greatest problems 
From war to pollution, no hope of solution 
Even if I live for one hundred years There is evil, ever around 
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental 
So go, if you're able to somewhere unstable and stay there 
Whip up your hate in some tottering state 
But not here, dear, is that clear, dear? Oh, what I'd give for a hundred years 
But the physical interferes, everyday more, Oh my Creator 
What is the good of the strongest heart 
In a body that's falling apart? A serious flaw, I hope You know that
