All I can smell right now is your blood 
And God himself knows you better run from me 
You traitor son of a whore 
Well you won't be here for long 
You let your country down 
And I sure as hell won't play the bitch 
I never thought that it would be like this 
I wasn't told that it would be like this 
But I will keep on running, pressing on and fighting 
For everything that I believe 
You won't catch me afraid 
Tell your family you love them 
Leave the oldest in charge 
you will never see them grow up 
I won't become a casualty 
Tie him to the fucking tree 
"My plans are perfect and when I start to carry them out 
May God have mercy on you for I will have none" 
I'll watch you fucking burn 
You may think this is the end 
As I am tied here to a tree 
You may take my body 
But you won't take my soul away from me 
I am the 15th, the 1st and the 99th! 
They took the body; they took the body away from me 
They took the body, they took the body away from me 
Tell your family you love them 
Leave the oldest boy in charge 
You 
You 
You 
You 
You 
Will die!
