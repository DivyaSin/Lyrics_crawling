Take a photograph of his mother 
cause she wants to be a man, 
believes in evil of love Wanna stay a man 
and she rises like a Venus in my mind 
where is the sister gone? 
she feels fine, oh 
she's fine, she's mine Take a photograph of your sister 
cause she wants to be a man, 
believes in evil of love Here's an angel man 
and it rises like a phoenix in my mind 
believes in evil of love, away
