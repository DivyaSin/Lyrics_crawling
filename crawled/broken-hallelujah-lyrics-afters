I can barely stand right now 
Everything is crashing down 
And I wonder where You are I try to find the words to pray 
I don't always know what to say 
But You're the one who can hear my heart Even though I don't know what Your plan is 
I know You make beauty from these ashes I've seen joy and I've seen pain 
And on my knees I call Your name 
Here's my broken Hallelujah 
With nothing left to hold onto 
I raise these empty hands to You 
Here's my broken 
Here's my broken Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah You know the things that have brought me here 
You know the story of every tear 
'Cause You've been here from the very start Even though I don't know what Your plan is 
I know You make beauty from these ashes I've seen joy and I've seen pain 
And on my knees I call Your name 
Here's my broken Hallelujah 
With nothing left to hold onto 
I raise these empty hands to You 
Here's my broken 
Here's my broken Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah When all is taken away, don't let my heart be changed 
Let me always sing Hallelujah 
When I feel afraid, don't let my hope be erased 
Let me always sing Hallelujah Hallelujah (repeat)
