I know it's late babe, but I got to talk to you 
No it can't wait babe, we got to talk it out now 
Your so called friends, they're trying to break us up 
They say that I'm cheating on you, that I can't allow 
It won't take a minute to talk it out, I'll make you believe me somehow [Chorus] 
There ain't a woman like you in the world baby 
Can do what you do, thrill me like you do 
There ain't a woman in the world, can start such a fire the way that you do 
There ain't a woman like you, there ain't a woman like you, no 
There ain't a woman like you, there ain't a woman like you No use pretending to you, you know I've been around 
Won't be no more lying lady, all that's in the past 
You ain't the first girl I really loved, but you'll be the last [Chorus] 
There ain't a woman like you in the world baby 
Can do what you do, thrill me like you do 
There ain't a woman in the world, can start such a fire the way that you do 
There ain't a woman like you, no 
There ain't a woman like you, no, no 
There ain't a woman like you, no
