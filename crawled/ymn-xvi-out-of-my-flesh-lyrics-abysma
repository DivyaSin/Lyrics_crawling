Oh Darkness, 
I will give the throne onto him 
Of Darkness, 
I am harvesting the growth of my first spring 
Of Darkness, 
Through me you gave him the life 
Of Darkness, 
One world shadowed in me Throught you - the birth of the Pillorian Age 
Throught you - the sand of the Gallow's Land 
Throught you - the rest of Velvet Pilloria 
Throught you - I will pass on my given oath So I am falling my son 
For my mission is done 
My visions and you became one 
Out of my flesh... 
...you shall build the town Gallowenia 
Gallowenia 
Gallowenia 
Gallowenia
