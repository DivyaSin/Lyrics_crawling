My life it seems way too short 
Oppurtunities blow past everyone 
by one they go straight through the door 
When will I ever have some fun? I wish tomorrow happened yesterday 
too much to lose, to much to complicate 
It scares me so to think of whats to come 
I don't want to run ahead and throw it all away I guess its all to soon to just assume 
that everythings gonna be fine 
Not sure exactly why I'm so scared 
I guess we'll leave it up to time to decide I wish tomorrow happened yesterday 
too much to lose, to much to complicate 
It scares me so to think of what's to come 
I don't want to run ahead and throw it all away I wish tomorrow happened yesterday 
too much to lose, to much to complicate 
It scares me so to think of whats to come 
I don't want to run ahead and throw it all away 
(Go!) I guess it's all too soon (I guess its all too soon) 
to just assume thats everythings gonna be fine
