In the weird landscape, 
Bristling with demon shapes, 
Leaving of life protrude, 
Remnants of a man, 
Burnt earth and stench, 
Will last forever, 
You became the sovereign, 
Walking among dead bodies, 
Passing round puddles full of blood, 
You have got what you wished, 
The wind strikes up an anthem, 
The anthem of your VICTORY, 
You have got what you wished, 
The wind strikes up an anthem, 
The anthem of your VICTORY, 
You are the last king, 
King of the leavings of life, 
You are the last man, 
So rule if you are the sovereign of the world, 
Isn't it what you wanted? 
You became a victim, 
The victim of greed, 
You have got what you wished, 
The wind strikes up an anthem, 
The anthem of your VICTORY, 
You are the last king, 
King of the leavings of life, 
You are the last man, 
So rule if you are the sovereign of the world, 
Isn't it what you wanted? 
You became a victim, 
The victim of greed.
