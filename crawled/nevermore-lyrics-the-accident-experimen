flying on a midnight plane 
just to keep away from sanity 
taking in electric breeze 
throw away the line to set me free 
i'm so blind, the pain is all i see 
trapped inside the veins of memories 
i'm so blind, time is just a scene 
left behind a photograph of me NEVERMORE THE RAIN, 
TO FEEL IT FALLING DOWN ON ME... 
EVERMORE THE SAME, 
WHERE YOU LEFT ME HERE TO BE... stole away my halo just to 
auction it away to charity 
just before i lost myself 
drowning in the storm inside your sea
