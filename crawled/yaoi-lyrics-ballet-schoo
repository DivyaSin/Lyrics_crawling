And when we met 
You had a feeling that you knew my face 
Another life, another dream 
Another woman in another place 
Another one who broke her heart 
Trying to keep herself clean The heart or the chain? 
The heart or the chain? 
(I love, you blame) 
Baby, call me by my name I never wanted to pretend 
That we could be the same 
Cause I've been living my own life 
And I've been dreaming my own dream 
It's not a battle if you always win The heart or the chain? 
The heart or the chain? 
(I love, you blame) 
Baby, call me by my name I've been dreaming my own dream 
Dreaming my own dream 
I've been dreaming my own dream 
Dreaming my own dream 
While you're taking what you need 
I'm losing everything, losing everything The heart or the chain? 
The heart or the chain? 
(I love, you blame) 
Baby, call me by my name
