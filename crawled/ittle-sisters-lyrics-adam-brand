Little Sisters, Little Sisters 
They'll niggle and annoy you 
Like a blister in your shoe 
But God bless my Little Sisters 
'Cause this big brother 
Well he's looking out for you I grew up with my sisters 
There was Flatty, Nat and Dee 
I was on my own 'til they hustled in on my territory 
It's tough to be a fella 
And outnumbered one to three We'd squabble in the car 
When Dad would take us for a run 
The girls would get all teary and say 
"Look what Adam's done" 
And while the girls got ice cream 
I got booted in the bum Now we've grown up and it's been years 
Since I moved away Flatty, Nat and Dee they 
dropped in yesterday 
We got on like a house on fire 
And I wanted them To stay
