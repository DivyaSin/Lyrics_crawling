Coercing or leaving 
Shutting down and punishing 
Running from rooms, defending 
Withholding, justifying [Chorus] 
These versions of violence 
Sometimes subtle sometimes clear 
And the ones that go unnoticed 
Still leave their Mark once disappeared Diagnosing, analyzing 
Unsolicited advice 
Explaining and controlling, 
Judging opining and meddling [Chorus] This labeling 
This pointing 
This sensitive's unraveling 
This Sting I've been ignoring 
I feel it way down way down [Chorus]
