You're the worst of all, 
With all your accusations and compunction 
I can't suffer this duress, 
From someone so deprayed and selfish 
You embody all that I've been through 
Without you I am sure I will be loved My existence conforms to your distress 
Your ambition, the cause of mine 
A disruption, I'm nothing, even less 
Misfortunes never come singly and I was there to stay You don't allow me a single place, 
Nor any love into your lives 
An unperceived, annoying presence you'd rather ignore 
But in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness Where you used to be 
Impotent screams will turn 
Into the love of silence 
My liberation, then silence, 
Will be perfect and pure 
It's all in my dreams, 
I'll remove you 
And all our mutual disgust In my dreams, 
I solve the problem by removing it 
My wish is to see you grovel, 
Like you once forced me to There's no other way, here's my course of life 
A path without the sickening trace of you 
I need the beauty of a cleared, pure world 
This eternal interruption of your rash life can save me You don't allow me a single place, 
Nor any love into your lives 
An unperceived, annoying presence you'd rather ignore 
But in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness It's sad to feel you don't believe in love, 
It's sad that you're so cold 
And I'll be the same, 
If you keep on poisoning my life 
Drowning in self-sacrificing visions 
When you're gone, then we will all be released It's sad my life has been like hell so far, 
It's sad that you're the cause 
And I'll be cured in this beautiful, empty world 
Floating, floating away with your perilous visions and hate 
When you're gone, silence will fill up the emptiness When you're gone, we all will be released In my dreams I shall rinse my body and soul 
My wish, 
The accomplishment lies here before me in my hands I will be released from your accusing eyes 
And torrents of verbal abuse 
You'll know the causes are your own mistakes 
While life flows out of you 
and exempts me forever!
