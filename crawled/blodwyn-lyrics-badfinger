I put away the knife, the chisel, and the saw 
I've locked away my life behind this old, oak door 
To make a simple spoon, a token of my love 
In hope that maybe soon, it's me you're thinking of So take my spoon, Blodwyn 
Make it soon, Blodwyn 
The valley knows the way I feel today 
So take my spoon, Blodwyn 
Make it soon, Blodwyn 
Before some other spoon takes you away My life may not be long, was working down below 
For so much can go wrong, but what else do I know? 
So take these precious years and make them precious too 
And say you'll take from me what I will give to you So take my spoon, Blodwyn 
Make it soon, Blodwyn 
The valley knows the way I feel today 
So take my spoon, Blodwyn 
Make it soon, Blodwyn 
Before some other spoon takes you away
