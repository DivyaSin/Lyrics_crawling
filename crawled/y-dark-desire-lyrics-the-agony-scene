Her touch intoxicating 
She holds my heart within her hands 
Unmerciful 
She has become my everything! Kissed with broken glass 
The softest touch will penetrate 
And steal my breath 
I close my eyes and suffocate She is my dark desire 
With all the trappings of regret 
Dressed in blasphemy 
(She pulls the stitches from my eyes) 
She's my suffering 
The taste of death is on her lips 
Dressed in blasphemy 
She takes my breathe and takes my life She is my misery 
To touch her skin of whitest lies 
So beautiful 
She has become my everything
