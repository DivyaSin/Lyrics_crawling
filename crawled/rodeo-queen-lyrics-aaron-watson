We pull into town, try to find the fairgrounds 
Park this Cadillac out back, behind the loading chutes 
Finally made the big show, traveling with the rodeo 
I'm one of the boys that make sure nobody pays with their 
Life ain't easy for a joker like me 
I've got a smile painted on my face 
It's only make believe She's got me where she wants me 
Got me blinking when they cover the gate 
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt 
'Cause I'm not thinking straight 
I'm in love with the rodeo queen 
A clown in love with the rodeo queen Every night the crowd goes wild when they see her riding 
Shining like a diamond, she don't even know my name 
I try to turn my feelings off before they load the roughstock 
Gotta get my stuff together, take a shot and forget 
How much time stands still when the bull starts spinning 
When the bull starts spinning 
When the bull starts spinning She's got me where she wants me 
Got me blinking when they cover the gate 
(I'm) Afraid someone's gonna get hurt 
'Cause I'm not thinking straight 
I'm in love with the rodeo queen 
A clown in love with the rodeo queen And baby bye, I'll tell you right 
I might work up the nerve to tell 'er right 
I ain't just some fool in a barrel no 
There's a real heart beating underneath my 
Over-sized wranglers, yellow suspenders 
I might look like it but I ain't a pretender 
No no 
I gotta tell 'er, gotta tell 'er 
Gotta tell 'er that (She's) Got me where she wants me 
Got me blinking when they cover the gate 
(I'm) afraid someone's gonna get hurt 
'Cause I'm not thinking straight (She's) Got me where she wants me 
Got me blinking when they cover the gate 
(I'm) Afraid someone's gonna get hurt 
'Cause I'm not thinking straight 
I'm in love with the rodeo queen 
A clown in love with the rodeo queen
