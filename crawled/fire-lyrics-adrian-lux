When you feel the fire taking over 
Let it make your feelings be evolving 
We're too young 
Your heart, whenever goes 
You're too young 
Your heart, will never leave you 
When you feel the fire taking over 
Let it make your feelings be evolving 
Please let your heart breath in... 
When you feel the fire taking over 
Let it make your feelings be evolving
