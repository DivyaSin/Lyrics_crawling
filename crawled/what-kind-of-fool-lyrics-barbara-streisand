There was a time when we were down and out 
There was a place when we were starting over 
We let the bough break 
We let the heartache in 
Who's sorry now? There was a world when we were standing still 
And for a moment we were separated 
And then you found her 
You let the stranger in 
Who's sorry now? Who's sorry now? What, what kind of fool 
Tears it apart 
Leavin' me pain and sorrow 
Losin' you now 
Wonderin' why? 
Where will I be tomorrow? Forever more that's what we are to be 
Without each other, 
We'll be rememberin' when 
There was a time when we were down and out 
(We cried) 
There was a place when we were starting over 
(We lied) 
We let the bough break 
We let the heartache in 
Who's sorry now? Who's sorry now? What , what kind of fool? 
Tears it apart 
Leaving me pain and sorrow Oh, losin' you now, how can I win? 
Where will I be tomorrow? 
Was there a moment when I cut you down 
Played around? What have I done? 
I only apologize 
For being as they say, the last to know 
It has to show when someone is in your eyes What, what kind of fool tears it apart? 
Leaving me pain and sorrow 
Losing you now, wondering why? 
Where will I be tomorrow? 
What, what kind of fool 
Tears it apart, leavin' me pain and sorrow 
Losin' you now how can I win? 
Where will I be tomorrow?
