[Intro - Ace Hood & Jay-Z] 
[Ace Hood] 
What? [Jay-Z] 
If money talks 
If money talks 
If money talks 
If money talks 
If money talks 
The whole world about to hear me out [Ace Hood] 
I'm laughing to the bank baby! 
You follow me? [Chorus - Jay-Z] X2 
If money talks 
If money talks 
If money talks 
If money talks 
If money talks 
The whole world about to hear me out 
If money talks the whole world about to hear me out 
If money talks the whole world about to hear me out [Verse 1 - Ace Hood] 
I'm Mister Hood! 
Okay, money in the building, sanitize the room 
You ain't talking paper nigga you can get the snooze 
See I'm here for paying dues 
Quarter million worth of jewels 
See the shoes Louis V. plus my bitch in Jimmy Choo 
Why you plotting all your moves, I be dipping in the cool 
Got an educated top, but now he dropping out of school 
Now my future looking bright, introduce you to the ice 
VVS's so precise, not a flowering in your sight 
Big money in the place, money in the safe 
Got the type of money that'll ban you from the state 
Nigga money what we talking, step into my office 
Stacking dead presidents, that's way too many coffins [Chorus] [Verse 2 - Ace Hood] 
Okay, money and the power, taking what is ours 
Hoe niggas and bullshit, send his mother flowers 
Dealing with them wolves, homie you can get devoured 
We get bookoo dollars, see me bitches holler 
Gucci, Louis, Prada, on my sneaker, belt, and collar 
Fly as Delta Airlines, an Army Navy chopper 
They say money rule the world, diamonds and the pearls 
See I just think it's easy when it come to getting girls 
So I just introduce them to the liquor not the Earl 
And they must wear a sweater 
Because my diamonds make the them burr 
Like the Gucci Mane bitch, read the label on the kicks 
See my foreign leather whip, FEDS think he moving bricks 
But uh [Chorus] X4
