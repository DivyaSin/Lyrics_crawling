Don't like your stare 
Don't like the arm in the air 
Your style is so brash 
And that silly moustache 
It was, table talk 
The evil I see 
Sends bad vibrations through me 
And oh what a square 
With your diagonal hair 
It was, table talk L said to Gilly 
'how do you do table talk?' 
'how do you do table talk?' 
And this is what she said; 
'love love love love 
The love of his life 
Too close to become a wife 
And the death of this girl 
Came close to saving the world 
From his table talk
