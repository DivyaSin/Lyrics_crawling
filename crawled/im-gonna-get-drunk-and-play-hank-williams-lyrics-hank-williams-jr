My good gal left and I cant stand this pain 
When she walked out my tear drops fell like rain 
So set em up Joe and give me some dimes 
I got an appointment with a friend of mine 
Im going to get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long 
Cause the wedding bells will never ring for me 
And that whippoorwill aint got no sympathy 
Im broken down and torn apart 
The moanin blues and your cheatin heart 
Im gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long 
The love sick blues sure aint no state of mine 
Mixed with a broken heart and juke joint wine 
But I aint leavin, done turned in my keys 
Bartender told me, stay as long as you please 
Im going to get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long 
Cause the wedding bells will never ring for me 
And that whippoorwill aint got no sympathy 
Im broken down and torn apart 
Whiskey bent and your cheatin heart 
Im gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long 
Cause the wedding bells will never ring for me 
Long gone lonesome blues sure fits me to a tee 
Im broken down and torn apart 
Whiskey bent and your cheatin heart 
Im gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long 
Why dont you love me like you used to do 
Yeah all night long
