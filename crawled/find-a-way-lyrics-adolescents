He said, I see dawn as a fading looking glass 
I'm on an island, alone in the mass 
I can't swim, I'm sinking fast 
No future, no connection to the past Life has no meaning, and that's the catch 
I gotta find a way out of here 
Help me find my way out of here 
He started weeping, turned and wiped away a tear 
Please help me find my way out of here I said, I know you when you're inside here 
It's overwhelming that the darkness never clears 
At the edge you're stepping near 
All the nightmares, all the fear 
Listen to your heart, can't you hear? 
You can find your way out of here 
You can find your way out of here 
No anxiety, no fear 
You can find your way out of here 
You can find your way out of here 
No anxiety, no fear 
You can find your way out of here 
You can find your way out of here Someone take this, 
Someone take this, 
Someone take this pain away from me
