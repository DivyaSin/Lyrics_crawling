Dark is the night 
I can weather the storm 
Never say die 
I've been down this road before 
I'll never quit 
I'll never lay down, mm 
See I promised myself that I'd never let me down [Chorus] 
I'll never give up 
Never give in 
Never let a ray of doubt slip in 
And if I fall 
I'll never fail 
I'll just get up and try again Never lose hope 
Never lose faith 
There's much too much at stake 
Upon myself I must depend 
I'm not looking for place or show 
I'm gonna win No stopping now 
There's still a ways to go, oh 
Someway, somehow 
Whatever it takes, I know 
I'll never quit, no no 
I'll never go down, mm, mm 
I'll make sure they remember my name 
A hundred years from now [Chorus] When it's all said and done 
My once in a lifetime will be back again 
Now is the time 
To take a stand 
Here is my chance 
That's why I [Chorus] Mm, I'm gonna win
