I ain't your prom queen 
I aint the one u need 
I aint some lil ball of clay u can mold 
In the palm of ur hand 
I dont need protection 
Or for u to hold my hand 
Or u to stick up for me just 'cause u can I can do it myself I can be just a little bit 
Of a little bitch when i want 2 
I can be that 
Lil bitch to you 
U know that u 
Don't appreciate dont want me 
So why u actin 
Like u really do? 
'cause i'll feel what i want to 
Do what i gotta do 
Say what i mean 
So no to you 
Why are u trippin 
What r u sippin 
If u think 
We'd be good I'll never call ur cell 
Make u hurt like hell 
Not really care about what u do 
Piss u off so bad 
Get u really mad 
I hear opposites attract 
But not in this case 
I aint ur type 
U know i'm right 
So stop playin 
Ur foolin urself 
Don't wanna end it 
Lose our good friendship 
But we ain't meant to be
