You show discontent 
That's fine, I don't care 
You're never happy anyway 
You care way too much 
About what everyone else thinks 
They might have liked you 
But then you had to change *chorus* 
Good times will come 
People will change 
It could be worse you could be left with nothing 
Instead you've got everything you want 
You're empty inside 
But only you know 
You'll have everything 
So it will not show 
Nothing's ever good enough for you You say you're giving up? 
You say life's too hard? 
That's typical for you, you never were very strong 
You say it's too hard to try 
And things can't get better 
Like you're the only one with problems 
You've always been self centered
