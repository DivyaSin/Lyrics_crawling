Faded photographs the feelings all come back 
Even now some times you feel so near 
And I still see your face like it was yeasterday 
It`s strange how the days turned into years 
Years of hanging on the dreams are already gone 
Dreams of wishing you were here 
After all this time you`d think I wouldn't cry 
It`s just that I still love you after all theses years 
Night time gentaly falls another day is gone 
I turn around to find your still not here 
I leave the hall light on 
in case you come back home 
But I've been saying that for years 
Years of hanging on to dreams are already gone 
It`s a wishing you were here 
After all this time you`d think I wouldn't cry 
It`s just that I still love you after all theses years 
After all theses years
