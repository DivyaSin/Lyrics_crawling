Busted down and broken all in two 
But you never thought this would happen to you 
Wake up and stumble, trip and fall 
You had so much and now you've lost it all. How could you do it (how could you do it) 
It's not like you 
To be the one to lose 
Why did you do it (why did you do it) 
It's not like you 
But I'll be around for you. Such a sad and sorry twist of fate 
You tried to change but it's too late 
If you ever find out what you do 
Well, then it'll all come back to you. How could you do it (how could you do it) 
It's not like you 
To be the one to lose 
Why did you do it (why did you do it) 
It's not like you 
But I'll be around for you, yes. Busted down and broken all in two
