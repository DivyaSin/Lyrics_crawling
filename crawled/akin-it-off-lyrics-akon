My binoculars on 
Alone staring out of my window 
I see the best creation of woman that I ever saw in a long long time 
Some say it is wrong, but what if she knows that I'm spying on her 
Once she strip down naked and entertain me 
Oh my gosh she's doin' it Takin' it off [x5] 
She's gettin' naked [x4] She threw her shirt, up on a floor 
Then threw her bra, up on a floor 
Then threw her skirt, up on a floor 
Then threw her dress up on a floor I can't believe, she's gettin' naked [x4] I wanting her, up on a floor 
To go on top of her, up on a floor 
There's no stoppin her, up on a floor 
She knows I'm watching her, up on a floor I can't believe, she's gettin' naked [x4] My binoculars on
