Girlfriend 
Want you to be 
Girlfriend Reached into my mind for reflection 
The truth is obscuring my perception 
So take a hit on this ship filled with resin on our fingertips 
And watch it below, below, let it go 
Reached into my mind for reflection 
The truth is obscuring my perception 
So take a hit on this ship filled with resin on our fingertips 
And watch it billow, billow, let it go Schedule that freely, you can pick a day 
We can roll em up and roll em up 
So I can watch everything ricochet Six months since I last seen you 
Clip blunts in them ash trays 
While we speak up on them past days 
You know I still have faith 
It's been ten months since I last seen you 
Clip blunts in them ash trays 
While we speak up on them past days 
You know I still have faith Schedule that freely, you can pick a day 
We can roll em up and roll em up 
So I can watch everything ricochet 
Schedule that freely, you can pick a day 
We can roll em up and roll em up 
So I can watch everything ricochet 
(Reached into my mind 
Reached in, reached into, to my, to my mind 
Let it, let it) Innocence lost, it's never retained 
It's never the same, it's never the same 
Leave this world with some inspiration 
I'll take the bait before a pure of gold 
Come to grips with your intuition 
Hear the whispers of your soul 
Steer you down the road you're on 
It's all your own 
Innocence lost, it's never retained 
It's never the same, it's never the same 
Leave this world with some inspiration 
I'll take the bait before a pure of gold 
Come to grips with your intuition 
Hear the whispers of your soul 
Steer you down the road you're on 
It's all your own
