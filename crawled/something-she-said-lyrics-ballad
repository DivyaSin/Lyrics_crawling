[Verse] 
I thought I knew you, but how much did I really know? 
You say youre sorry, I tell you words will never show 
I pray you dont leave me, you say its better to let go 
I cant let go 
But what about me, what about us? 
What about the love, when did it turn to dust? 
When did you start to feel distant? 
When did you turn so cold? 
So many things ill never know 
But one thing ill never forget

[Verse] 
I didnt see the signs, I couldnt read you 
Your love was never mine, how did I keep it? 
Keeping secrets away from me, I was too blind to see 
Time wasnt on our side, our love was meant to die 
No, no, no 
You cant go, go 
But I know its so 
Best way for me to act, let go with my heart intact 
Her words run through my head

You dont know what you did

You dont know what you did 
You dont know 
And im so so so so torn apart by
