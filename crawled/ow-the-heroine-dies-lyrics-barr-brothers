I thought if I fought you 
In the open field 
Your bayonet would crack 
On my hot iron shield 
But you caught be running 
Now I'm at your command 
A servant to forces 
That I don't understand If you were the shepherd 
And I was the lamb 
And long was the journey 
And dark was the land 
Who would be following, 
Who would be free 
Who would believe 
That the shepherd was me When that poet decides 
How the heroine dies 
He commits original sin 
When that last ray decays 
From the boardwalk parades 
Yours is the longest shadow to fade Oklahoma, don't bury your eyes 
Night receives morning 
Like death receives life 
Blown are the ashes 
Of the emperor's clothes 
All through the cornfields 
Planted in rows
