sweet, sweet castaway 
don't need the love but you can't stay away 
so, so lonely 
can you forget it or are you just like me never meant that much to me 
lost in a world that only i knew 
said you'd like to set me free 
but i never really wanted to be 
never meant that much to me 
still i only ever think about you 
said you'd like to set me free 
right now you're all i really need i'm sorry if i don't care 
i'm sorry for what you think 
i'm sorry for feeling good 
i'm sorry for you i said it, i said it, i meant it, i meant it 
i feel like i gave you time to vent it 
i couldn't prevent it, you just sat 
as she stole your thoughts away 
i want a beginning with no certain feeling 
centered on another time with no one interfering 
i miss it, i need it, i feel it fade away i'm sorry if i don't care 
i'm sorry for what you think 
i'm sorry for feeling good 
i'm sorry for you never meant that much to me 
lost in a world that only i knew 
said you'd like to set me free 
but i never really wanted to be 
never meant that much to me 
still i only ever think about you 
said you'd like to set me free 
right now you're all i really need i'm sorry if i don't care 
i'm sorry for what you think 
i'm sorry for feeling good 
i'm sorry for you can't lift my feet from the ground lately 
can't feel nothing but the sound 
don't stop moving around, face me 
please, please keep me around
