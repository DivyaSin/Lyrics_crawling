For all of the days when the world seems crazy 
All of the nights when you cry alone 
For all of the times when your heart's in trouble 
Facing the storm and you're on your own Someway, somehow 
Even though I feel so helpless now 
I know your love will see me through somehow 
Someway, somehow 
As you turn to me and say 
Somehow love will show us the way All of the times when it's such as struggle 
All of the heartache you've ever know 
And when the tears seem to come so easy 
There's just no joy that you can call your own Chorus When I need a beacon to guide the way 
When I fell too weary to face the day 
Trying to make it through the darkest hour 
You can turn to love and feel it's power.... I know love will see us through 
Someway, somehow Choruses out
