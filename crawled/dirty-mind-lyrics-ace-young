Baby What's up today 
Do you want it do you need it girl what you say 
Can't get on with my life 
'Cause I want it I need it everyday and night You're creeping into my head just like I'm tied to your bed 
Keeping me waiting in the dead of the night 
You've got a smile on your lips you know I'm losing my grip 
Girl you always want it your way [Chorus] 
Your dirty mind is taking a hold of me 
Can't seem to get away by the way 
Your dirty mind is making a mess of me 
Lost in the games you play Look what you've done to me 
I've been sweating soaking wet and it's hard to breathe 
I feel like a loaded gun 
And you use it abuse it just to have your fun Your kiss is killing me slow your teeth are ripping my clothes 
Your body's jumping on my bones for a ride 
The way you're snapping those hips 
Just like you're cracking the whip 
Girl you always get it your way [Chorus] Another place another time another life I wouldn't want you 
Another night another day as time goes girl i'm a slave to 
It's all those things you do to me You're creeping into my head just like i'm tied to your bed 
Keeping me waiting in the dead of the night 
You've got a smile on your lips you know I'm losing my grip 
Girl you always want it your way [Chorus] So dirty babe
