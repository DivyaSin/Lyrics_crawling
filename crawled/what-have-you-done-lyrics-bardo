Nothing else matters in the world today 
You know my car won't start and there's bills to pay 
I've left my summons on the bedroom floor 
You know they just don't scare me anymore All these things will change in time 
Everything will turn out fine 
If my prying conscience calls 
I'm not home, not here at all [Chorus] 
Ooh what have you done 
I'm feeling like a rebel today 
Ooh what have you done 
You've made me believe I am someone I've turned my back on the girl of old 
You know I've packed her off with her self control 
Its written on the lines her upon my face 
You know I'm just not suited to obedience I won't be told what's cool to wear 
I won't told I can not swear 
I make my rules up as I go 
A love defiance don't you know [Chorus]
