Trouble comes in shapes and sizes 
Some of them are friends 
Trouble is what trouble does 
It always has an end I've got to keep myself together 
Got to get it straight 
I've got to find some better things 
Before it gets too late Then I found myself a woman 
She's the one who keeps me in line 
When I go wrong 
She's always there beside me 
She's keeping time 
She's keeping time Failure comes before success 
Tries to bring you down 
Before you give up please call your baby 
She likes to hang around You got to get yourself together 
You got to get it straight 
You got to find some peace of mind 
Before it's way to late Then I found myself a woman 
She's the one who keeps me on the line 
When I go wrong she's always there beside me 
She's keeping time 
She's keeping time 
She's keep keep keeping time Then I found myself a woman 
She's the one who keeps me on the line 
When I go wrong she's always there beside me 
She's keeping time

Everything I do
