Pussy nigga try me if you wanna 
We open fire on your corner 
Beef, you know you don't want it 
Better go on with all that bologna 
Boy you flaw and you phoney 
I'm as real as it gets 
Your homie soft and he pussy 
I'd rather chill with his bitch 
Finna set it off in this bitch, set it off in this bitch 
Double breasted Smith n' Wesson to set it off in this bitch 
Set it off in this bitch, set it off in this bitch 
Double breasted Smith n' Wesson to set it off in this bitch Shout of them niggas 
On the frontlines with them yoppas 
AOP my nigga, play me on a 1 
I call them knockas 
Money by the bag and fuck your jug 
I get it mando 
Daddy never sleeping when I'm creeping 
It's extendo 
Hanging out the roof I yell my city 
Then I flex up 
Me and Problem gonna check up 
Everything from the neck-up 
My dealer Stony, and he next up 
Skinny nigga hold that tec up 
Beef with me, that shit messed up 
Put 50 shots where you rest up 
Down ass nigga go ape shit

Big boy don't say shit 
Got Little niggas don't play shit 
Hundred k on your people 
To make you niggas look see-through 
Bad Lucc is the preview 
Tear shit down what we do Pussy nigga try me if you wanna 
We open fire on your corner 
Beef, you know you don't want it 
Better go on with all that bologna 
Boy you flaw and you phoney 
I'm as real as it gets 
Your homie soft and he pussy 
I'd rather chill with his bitch 
Finna set it off in this bitch, set it off in this bitch 
Double breasted Smith n' Wesson to set it off in this bitch 
Set it off in this bitch, set it off in this bitch 
Double breasted Smith n' Wesson to set it off in this bitch While I took over the city 
Niggas wonderin' how we did it 
Married to the grind, you only shine if you committed 
Overlook your kind 
I don't got time for nothing kiddy 
Got soldiers like lieutenants 
That knock logos off of fitted's 
Be that guy, go 'head be that guy 
Fire in that eye, soldier fly 
Bla bla bla, say hi to Allah 
Fuck these marks, nigga fuck these marks 
I decide your fate 
Young nigga acting like a G, old drug dealers hate 
That ain't real nigga 
That ain't real nigga 
And your squad ain't one real nigga, ain't one real nigga 
On my mom, 'cause if it was 
They woulda told your ass about fuckin' with me though 
Don't ever mention Mike with Tito 
He ain't on my level boy
