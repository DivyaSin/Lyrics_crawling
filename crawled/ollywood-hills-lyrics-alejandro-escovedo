Say goodbye 
To Hollywood Hills 
There's not much here 
To keep us warm 
Keep the mud off your heels Hey do you remember me 
I was the complicated one 
I wore that silver leather jacket, you remember 
That shined in the sun Happiness can't be bought or sold 
You shared what you had 
But you gave me love 
Gave me love 
Precious love I still got a photograph 
You in that convertible 
I think it was outside King City 
Two lovers on the run Now I'm standing here 
In the middle of nothing, baby 
I know you would hate it here 
Everyone walking around half dead 
The bars are always closed Happiness can't be bought or sold 
You shared what you had 
But you gave me love 
Gave me love 
Precious love I forgot what I was saying 
I noticed 
You haven't touch your drink 
Maybe it's time, to put the boy to sleep Happiness can't be bought or sold 
You shared what you had 
But you gave me love 
Gave me love 
Precious love So say goodbye 
To Hollywood Hills 
There's not much here 
To keep us warm 
Keep the mud off your heels
