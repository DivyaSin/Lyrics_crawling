I grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow 
I hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow 
Egyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains 
You witnessed our abduction which possibly explains How I know you 
How I know you Before that fateful morning my family enjoyed 
A privileged existence for my father was employed 
As advisor to the king no less which surely rings a bell 
For as your are his daughter, you probably can tell How I know you 
Yes I know you You know too much and what you say 
Is better left unknown 
And now I'm just a slave like you 
Our lives our not our own I never have abandoned 
And nor I think could you 
That spark of hope for freedom 
No terror can subdue My only hope is silence 
You've never seen my face 
No you remain a princess 
In any time or place You don't know me 
Yes, I know you 
You don't know me How I know you 
How I know you
