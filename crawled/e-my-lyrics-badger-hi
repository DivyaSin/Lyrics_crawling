Me and my, me and my head 
Just want a break, and I just want a change from it all I dipped a little the further you went 
Don't you judge this; should have know me as a kid But I learned a little the further you went 
All I love's the same as you; must be something that I'm doing wrong A better me could pick you up 
A better me was all you'd want and more 
A better me could pick you up 
For so long The winner gets closest to door 
You're getting nervous; don't let them notice The loser sits closest to the door 
I'm sorry Karen; I need a line for you now A better me could pick you up 
A better me was all you'd want and more 
A better me could pick you up 
For so long We can lock this door 
We can hide here on the floor 
And they won't, no they won't 
Find us no more We can hide, we can hide, hide on the floor 
No they won't, no they won't, find us no more 
No they won't, no they won't, find us no more
