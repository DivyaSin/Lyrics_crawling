I wanna start a revolution 
A type of personal solution 
We all have got our own pollution 
It's all about the execution You've got something to say, 
Your hands are tied 
Open your mouth, open it wide 
Let the freedom begin 
Get on the floor, just let it drop 
Don't it feel good, don't it feel hot 
Feel the fire within I wanna see you strut strut strut 
Come on walk for me 
Strut strut strut 
How you want to be 
Everybody's looking for some love 
But they don't know 
How to let it all hang out 
And that's why they're solo, solo, solo 
Don't want to be solo, solo, solo 
Don't want to be solo We're a complicated nation 
And now we're in a situation 
Let's take a make-believe vacation 
And get yourself some validation You've got something to say, 
Your hands are tied 
Open your mouth, open it wide 
Let the freedom begin 
Get on the floor, just let it drop 
Don't it feel good, don't it feel hot 
Feel the fire within 
I wanna see you strut strut strut 
Come on walk for me 
Strut strut strut 
How you want to be Everybody's looking for some love 
But they don't know 
How to let it all hang out 
And that's why they're solo, solo, solo 
Don't want to be solo, solo, solo 
Don't want to be solo I'll be your mirror 
Darling let you hair down 
Show me what you're working with and let me see you 
Strut strut 
Strut strut 
How you want to be 
Everybody's looking for some love 
But they don't know 
How to let it all hang out 
And that's why they're solo, solo, solo 
Don't want to be solo, solo, solo 
Don't want to be solo 
Strut on me and show me what you're working with 
Strut on me and show me what you're working with 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah
