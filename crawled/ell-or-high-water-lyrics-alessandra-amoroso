Oh so they say 
That we're star-crossed 
And stay away 
I won't hesitate 
We're a love story 
Made of fate 
Straight through the fire 
There's no mountain I wouldn't climb 
I'd give my life 
'Cause for you I'd die a thousand times Don't worry what people gone say 
Don't listen wont get in my way 
No matter what I'll make it to you 
Whatever you need from me 
Baby is guaranteed 
I give it cause I wanna 
Whatever I got to do 
Baby to get to you 
Come hell or high water 
I'm comin' come hell or high water 
I'm comin' come hell or high water 
So tell em bring on the rays 
The clouds the hurricanes 
I'm comin' come hell or high water Oh so the say 
That we're reaching the end of days 
But I see your face 
And time seems like nothing baby Don't worry what people gone say 
Don't listen wont get in my way 
No matter what I'll make it to you 
Whatever you need from me 
Baby is guaranteed
