Welcome, and wake up 
This is not a dream but something in between that and reality 
Wake up if you dare 
This is not the regular nightmare Before your eyes the world will change 
Slowly take you down to unknown places 
Welcome to a world that's only yours 
Wake up if you dare and just follow me! Leave me alone 
My dreams speak to me or am I still awake? 
Leave me alone 
I'm my own threat, I'm a victim of my mind 
Let go I fooled you, I warned you though 
I won't let go before you've dreamed all your dreams 
I'll play you 
You want me to 
You ask for more 
You want to know Leave me now, I need to know I'm in control 
Leave me alone 
Leave me be within my private fantasies 
Let go I told you you, I won't let go 
I want to show you what dreams can do for you 
They'll free you, they'll open doors 
They show you all you want to know As some is light and some is dark, dreams can be both 
They have two sides Fear 
I am your fear deep inside Fear 
Face all your fears deep in this dream 
We are the dark side of your mind 
Pain 
I am your pain deep inside Pain 
Feel all your pain deep in this dream 
Feel it's a part of you 
You are like your dreams, both light as dark 
Come with us now and explore Silence, I'm here 
No words, no sounds, no pain or doubts 
I'm floating 
Even time itself can never touch me 
I am free Silence, I'm here 
No voices, no music 
I'm roaming through this soundless place 
Leave me here where I am free Doubt 
I am your doubt deep inside 
I am all you try to hide 
Hate 
I am your hate deep inside 
I am your mirror, your fright Energized by nightly views 
You are the dream, the dream is you 
Aah So face it, you know I'm right 
You have no reason to resent me and fight 
You are me and I am you 
The other side of the sleepy truth Leave me please, how can I rest with you inside? 
Leave me alone, I'm too tired for these crazy theories 
Let go I'll leave you, but won't let go, for I am part of all you'll ever do 
I'll help you, I'll open doors and show you all you need to know 
For I'm your dream energizer
