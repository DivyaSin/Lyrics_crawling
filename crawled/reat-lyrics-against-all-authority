You know all the cool places where all the punks hang out 
All those same old places that I don't give a shit about 
There's so many people just following a trend 
No honesty or sincerity, it's the same old shit again This is a warning. No, this is a threat 
As long as we're alive then punk's not dead yet 
Consider this a challenge, there's problems unresolved 
Forget about your fashion show and start to get involved Yeah we can make this happen, we're fighting for a cause 
Without your approval, so fuck your damned applause 
Yeah, we can make this real. Engage a solemn vow 
So let's get off our asses and start right fucking now This is a warning. No, this is a threat 
As long as we're alive then punk's not dead yet 
Consider this a challenge, there's problems unresolved 
Forget about your fashion show and start to get involved So what about you are you gonna play the role? 
Sit back and let someone else take control? 
Can we burn our bridges? Can we start something new? 
Exactly what is your independence worth to you? The price of freedom is eternal vigilance 
Complacency is cowardice, theres no room for obedience 
Let anger be our fuel, our power from within 
Our vehicle is action, and the will to not give in
