Oh the stars are out, and the moon is high 
Over your shoulder 
Shinin' like a neon halo in your hair 
Dancin' in slow motion 
To music only you and I can hear 
And I've fallen again, like I always do 
That's what happens when I hold you 
That's what happens when I hold you I lose my breath and I can't speak 
I never tasted love this sweet 
And every time it feels brand new 
That's what happens when I hold you 
That's what happens when I hold you Now I'm wide awake, and I'm dreamin' still 
Lost in the moment, all I can do is simply ride the tide 
Oh, sweet surrender, 
I couldn't stop this goin' under if I tried 
And I've fallen again, like I always do 
That's what happens when I hold you 
That's what happens when I hold you I lose my breath and I can't speak 
I never tasted love this sweet 
And every time it feels brand new 
That's what happens when I hold you 
That's what happens when I hold 
That's what happens when I hold you
