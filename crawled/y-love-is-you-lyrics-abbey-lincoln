In a world of changes 
Haunted melodies 
Comes this funny feeling 
When I'm close to you 
Out of the blue, a thrill Sigh for all the sadness 
Cry the broken dream 
Still my heart remembers 
When I think of you 
So close to you I feel Love, the sweet emotion 
Sends the clouds away 
Lightens up the sadness 
Brings a brighter day So my love, I find you 
In the morning mist 
High above the shadows 
A tender awfulness, a warm caress 
A happiness, my love, is you Love, the sweet emotion 
Sends the clouds away 
Lightens up the sadness 
Brings a brighter day So my love, I find you 
In the morning mist 
High above the shadows 
Tender awfulness, a warm caress 
A happiness, my love, is you
