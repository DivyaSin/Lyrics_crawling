Why do you hate him 
Why did you make him leave 
Theres nothing wrong with him Why do you hate him 
You want him crucified 
Is it the way he looks 
Or the way he speaks his mind Never hear this song playing on the radio O Theres nothing wrong with him 
But its you and your friends Never hear this song playing on the radio All you ever did was talk about her 
Shes done what she had to do 
Having to raise two kids without a father You just stood by idly watched her suffer 
You think youre something special 
Boy you blew it! This conversations over Never hear this song playing on the radio Theres nothing wrong with her 
But its you and your friends 
Fuck you and your friends Never hear this song playing on the radio
