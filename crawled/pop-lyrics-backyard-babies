Oh yeah alright okay c'mon 
we're in the backseat of my car 
friday night just a bit uptight 
I never thought it would go this far Hook me up with some Tennessee 
let's make a toast to my friends 
we're losin' all our sense 
I might not sympathize 
with your pathetic way of life Don't think about tomorrow baby 
when you're dreamin' 'bout yesterday 
you can not have life to go 
just blew your chance today There's always someone 
who's gonna feed my Frankenstein Oh yeah alright okay c'mon 
let's get billion dollar action 
It's alright to love and fight 
you need total satisfaction Look me up with your feeble mind 
you're in a chemical dream 
pissin' out popularity 
your can kiss your ass goodbye
