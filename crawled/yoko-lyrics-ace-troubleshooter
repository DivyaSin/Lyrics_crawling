You know who she is, you know what she does 
Only I know what that girl is doing to you 
You know who she is, you know what she does 
Only I know what that girl is going to do to you There's one for every band 
Almost one for every man 
If you're not careful, she'll eat you up 
So please be careful You know who she is, you know what she does 
Only I know what that girl is doing to you 
You know who she is, you know what she does 
Only I know what that girl is going to do to you Yoko, Yoko, nagging all the time 
Wasting all his time, Yoko, Yoko 
Be careful with that, boy 
Better be careful with that, boy She'll win you with composure 
And perfect nonchalance 
She'll lure you in and snag you 
Make you think you're the Fonz She'll get you in her clutches 
Make you her confidant 
She'll nag you and she'll drag you 
Man you've gotta get rid of that debutante She'll nag you to death 
And by inches will suck all the life 
That you somehow have left 
Yeah, it will only be nag, nag, nag, nag
