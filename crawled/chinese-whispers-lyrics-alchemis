Speaking my mind 
Single trail of thought 
Difference in the way we perceive 
Your ability to receive 
I know you listen, faults lie between us. 
You hear my speaking, something changes my words. Hordes of inconsistencies and fiction swarm the paths of your thoughts. 
Your interpretation of my actions, convenient to your cause. 
I'll say again another way. Splintered slithers of truth, rumored tales, my proof. 
Tolerance prevents and outcome. Hordes of inconsistencies and fiction swarm the paths of your thoughts. 
Your interpretation of my actions, convenient to your cause. 
I'll say again another way. Words a mouldable form of matter, 
Interpretation, your point is shattered, 
Lies a manifestation of truth 
Changes arise because of a difference, 
Words a mouldable form of matter, 
Interpretation, your point is shattered, 
Lies a manifestation of truth 
Don't accuse me because of a difference 
I know you hear my words, 
But somehow there's faults that lie between us. Speaking my mind 
Single trail of thought 
I know you're listening 
But some faults lie between us, 
I know you hear my words. Hordes of inconsistencies and fiction swarm the paths of your thoughts. 
Your interpretation of my actions, convenient to your cause. 
I'll say again another way.
