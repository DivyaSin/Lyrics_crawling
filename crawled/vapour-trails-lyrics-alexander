Can you see the look that is in my eyes, what I'm feeling like 
As the clock ticks by, I can only try 
When hope moves in and mornings thin you can the fire 
It can take us higher, It can take us higher And I hope that I will see this place again 
And I hope that nothing will have changed tomorrow 
And I hope that this is all for the best 
Another day without the rest that I need And now you see my face on the other side 
Oh why, why should I even try? 
I don't know, I don't really know what's going on 
So I'll take the next best seat 
Yes I'll take the next best seat back home And I hope that I will see this place again 
And I hope that nothing will have changed tomorrow 
And I hope that this is all for the best 
Another day without the rest that I need So I need to find a place, a place where I can see 
A place where I can feel at home when I'ts only me Feel at home
