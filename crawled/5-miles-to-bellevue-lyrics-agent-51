Sixteen and waitin' on the corner 
Watchin' all the people go by 
Thinkin' of how directed that they all must be 
As a tear rolls from his eye 
Stuck down in another rut 
He swears that he's forever fucked 
Livin' on the streets ain't fun 
Wishin' he had a place to stay 
To keep him dry on rainy days 
Now there's nowhere he can run 
And nobody's gonna change his mind or his broken heart 
Waitin' down in Bellevue park in position 
Waitin' for another real friend 
To keep him warm inside the next home of delusion 
You freeze, melt, live, die, panic, run 
Then break and bend 
The pain he feels inside is endless 
Lives a life alone and friendless 
All there's left to do is start 
Countin' the days, now it's the years 
Building up these pointless fears 
The both of them are torn apart 
And nobody's gonna change his mind or his broken heart
