I'm a hard working man, yeah I'm down on my luck 
With a broom and a dustpan, just tryin' to raise a buck 
It's not the fact that I don't wanna work 
I'm just not gonna take it anymore 
Spillin' my guts out every night 
For a bunch of blank stares just looking for a fight 
It's not that the fact that I don't wanna work 
But we're screamin' for change once again. 
Voices cry out deep in the night 
The streets are empty again 
But what's the explanation for just putting up a fight 
When San Diego's burning within. 
Yeah, nobody here wants to do it 
Unless somebody else does it first 
Take a look around, watch it burn into the ground 
The condition's gone from bad to worse 
Time is running out, and the future's full of doubt 
Are the good times really over? We can make the good times now 
A neurotic, self conscious, superficial wasteland 
Is what I would call my town 
I try to think back to other times 
I try to remember when 
What's the explanation for just putting up a fight 
When everybody's trying to win 
Burn it down to the ground
