There's not enough time for our love 
But I'll make another infinity for you Infinitum aeternum (infinitum) 
Aut viam inveniam aut faciam To a foreign land I went 
in search but not alone 
Kind hearts and cheers they made 
to welcome me into their sacred home 
Well this foreign land was turned into familiar ways 
Then one night all that I felt once was real Started to change me 
I know you saw me 
Cause time just froze us 
Right there before the lights We had a blast but time was not on our side 
But somehow we kept dreaming night after night What happened right there between us was pure 
My world and struggles all was made for you 
No matter how much we will be together forever 
It will never satisfy There's not enough time for our love 
But I'll make another infinity for you Twinfinity So things have changed, my love 
But I still call you love 
Sometimes we're far apart 
But here our future starts Away from you is hurting my soul 
I'm bleeding stars 
Mind is twisting inside out day and night 
But I cant lose the fight What happened right there between us was pure 
My world and struggles all was made for you 
No matter how much we will be together for eternity 
All we need is to be patient What happened right there between us was pure 
My world and struggles all was made for you So lets climb the top together 
No thing nor time can hold us back for long 
Let all your heart just go into the deep bliss of the truth 
That love is timeless (we are endless) 
Just keeps on growing (reaching higher) 
But still we are in need of more There's not enough time for our love 
But I'll make another infinity for you Twinfinity
