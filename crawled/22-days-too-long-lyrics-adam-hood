Birmingham to Jackson 
Vicksburg to Ruston 
Girl, you know I miss you when I'm gone 
The sunshine on your bare feet 
Your toenails painted hot pink 
And running through the sprinkler 
In mama's front lawn You know, the radio's playing 
The song you're always singing 
And the dawn is breaking 
The old yellow moon is sinking 
I run the truck up in the yard 
And leave the keys swinging 
Because 21 days has got me thinking 
That 21 days is 22 days too long Fayetteville to Little Rock 
Shreveport to Beaumont 
Girl, you know that I miss you when I'm gone 
Labor Day was a fine mess 
You got cake on your sundress 
We just laughed it off when you kept it on You know, the radio's playing 
The song you're always singing 
And the dawn is breaking 
The old yellow moon is sinking 
I run the truck up in the yard 
And leave the keys swinging 
Because 21 days has got me thinking 
That 21 days is 22 days too long
