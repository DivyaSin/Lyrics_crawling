Say you love me 
But what kind of love are we talking about 
And that you want me 
But will there come a day 
When one of us, wants to kick us, out 
How, do I make you feel, inside 
Would you 
Would you get down on one knee 
Would you beg for me 
Do you feel, feel me 
Can you feel, feel me 
Do you feel, feel me 
Can you feel, feel me I'm almost longing 
Longing just to be 
Where ever you wanna take me 
Only belonging 
Belonging to ourselves 
And to you 
If only you'd make me 
Shine, like the sun, all for you 
I would run 
A million miles next to never 
I wanna hold you forever 
Do you feel, feel me 
Can you feel, feel me 
Do you feel, feel me 
Can you feel, feel me Do I tell you the words 
You're wanting to hear 
Tell me sweet darlin' 
How do I, how do I, how do I 
Do I make you feel
