Sleepwalker Run baby run and don't look back 
Run to the moon and the stars 
Lose all your fears 
All that keeps you down 
And be all you can 
And all you wanted to But you can't control it anymore 
It's got a hold on you 
Your life just seems to slip away 
But you're gonna be ok Step out of the darkness 
And out from where you use to hide 
Run towards the light 
And reach for all you hear 
And all you see
