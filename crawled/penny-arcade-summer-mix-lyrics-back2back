(INTRO) 
It's good crack its back2back 
Knocking out the flavours 
Of the penny arcade 
Back2back style (VERSE 1) 
A light shown in the night some way ahead, thenblue turned into green then it was red 
And light shone in the night as loud music played, the light that shone in the night was a penny arcade (CHORUS) 
Step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round the penny arcade 
(Chitty bang chitty chitty bang bang) 
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle that'll make all the colored lights cascade 
And music played in the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all the time 
Roll up and spend your last dime At first I thought it was a dream that I was in, lost, lost in a sea of glass and tin 
But no that was not to be, dipped my hand in my jeans. I grabbed a handful of coins to feed the machines (CHORUS) (REPEAT CHORUS X2) Roll up and spend your last, roll up and spend your last, 
Roll up and spend your last dime You've just been pimped back2back style
