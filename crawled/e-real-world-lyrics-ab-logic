Is it reality or not. We don't .................. in the bad times 
In the real world the sun don't shine and so they say 
Just maybe another madman going crazy 
I'm trying to walk, I'm trying to ........... 
Mama said that real life is hard 
But I will make it to the dark 
It's the sorrow for tomorrow 
Cause you're gonna break my heart again 
I'm gonna borrow some of the sorrow 
Gonna break my heart again Is this the real world or is it a dream 
Or just the way you make me feel 
Is this the real world or just a dream 
That I will never see Another day brings a day to survive 
Open your eyes, realize. 
Escape the darkness, see the light 
Yeah, you gotta do what's right 
If you live for tomorrow then put your hands up 
Don't .................. we're gonna make it together forever 
Through stormy weather in the real world 
It's the sorrow for tomorrow... Come to the real world, step to the real world Finally I made three wishes 
I can't stop this crazy feelings 
The sorrow put me in the bad moods 
Another man with the broken heart 
Now I'm left oh hopeless 
If I slipped then my feet is gone 
Hold up, I'm back on my two feet. 
Snap ! It was a dream
