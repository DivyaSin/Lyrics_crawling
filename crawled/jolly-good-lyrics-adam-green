Holidays, Hollywood 
Jolly good sir but I never met you 
In your grey Cadillac car 
Never gonna see the outline of a star And the windows creek, on an elbow squeek 
That will be for him comin' round the mountain 
In his grey Cadillac car 
Never gonna see the outline of a star Oh my little lady lies awake in the pines 
Some seem to think that I'm awake all the time 
Try to get me groovin' on a blue collar crime 
But a maid in the backroom leaves my clothes behind Bye diddle-eye-dye 
Never gonna chew the outline of a pie 
Pie that I owe, and I owe 
And god knows, I owe them to you so
