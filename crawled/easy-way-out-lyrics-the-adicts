We've all been born 
To live our lives in security 
How do we know if we'll die 
Or if we will recover 
From day to day 
We live our lives the same way 
No money to hold in our hands 
And no to spend it. So I chose the easy way out 
To do my body some harm 
Cut my throat and slashed my wrist 
I even tried electricity 
Cut my throat 
Slashed my wrist 
It was the easy way out.
