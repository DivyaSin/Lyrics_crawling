I lay in darkness 
I anguish I dwell 
my soul is in torment 
I'm living in hell My mind is afflicted 
with agonizing pain 
scourging my soul 
can I be sane? Must do I so? 
Must I do what they say 
their orders their commandments 
I have to obey The future for me 
the future I see 
is clouded 
by obscurity "The kitchen, the kitchen" 
system haunts me 
I must burn 
and then I'll be free But how can I burn 
without severe imjuries 
to be consumed in flames 
is that my destiny? Now I am coming 
there is no return 
not in the gas flame 
but in pure fire I'll burn Oh no, never comes sister 
to prevent me 
from my holy task 
I am saved, I am free Yeah... baby... alright... come on...
