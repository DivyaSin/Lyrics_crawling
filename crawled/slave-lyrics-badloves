Slave 
To an early grave 
To that bed you made 
Now you've got to lay down in it 
Slave 
Slave 
See now what you've done 
See what you've become 
You know that I see right through it 
Slave 
They branded you 
Too much of a good thing 
Black and blue 
You wear it like some ball and chain 
Slave 
Slave 
Dig your lovers tomb 
What you trying to do now 
Come on, let's get down to it 
Slave 
Yeah they branded you 
Too much of a good thing 
Black and blue 
You wear it like some ball and chain 
Slave 
(Whose shoes are you trying to fill? 
Who's driving you up that hill?) 
When I was young 
And I must have been naive 
For every word of every lie I would believe 
I would still belong 
To a love that's strong 
And I'd be free 
When I was young 
And I know I was naive 
For every word of every lie I would believe 
I could still belong 
To a love that's strong 
And I'd be free 
(Whose shoes are you trying to fill? 
Who's driving you up that hill?)
