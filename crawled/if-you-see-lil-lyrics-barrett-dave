She's a little ballerina 
Who can dance without s sound 
In an old burned out building 
In a part of old town 
And there in sunlit terrace 
Where her shadow almost fades 
She dances to the music of a 
Morning parade. 
And though some see her 
They don't care that much 
She's a little girl who dances 
With the angels touch. 
Lil used ta twirl for me 
Oh, many years on back 
We'd stand upon the fire escape 
And she danced upon the tracks 
And there in a moonlit garden 
I would talk about my scenes 
Lil would do her dance'n 
And I would talk about my dreams 
And, oh with these old heals 
Under me now if I ever get back 
I'll tell her this right now. 
If you see Lil in the moonlight 
Tell her I'm doing fine, 
I'm all right and O.K. 
If you see Lil in the moonlight 
Tell her I am fine and I'm O.K. 
When it came time for me to go 
I lit another cigarette 
Has Lil put on a show 
And there I'd sit in her stairwell 
And look between the blinds 
And I'd go and pull her covers up 
Just one last time 
And oh as I walked out 
Into the city streets 
I'd look back through the window 
And see Lil upon her feet 
Well, they say that she is dancing 
In a midnight hourglass 
With an only rose that's there 
Has her supporting cast 
And they say that she pours tea 
For a crowd that isn't there 
Lil will go on dance'n 
'cause she just don't care 
And if I ever get back 
It won't be the same 
'cause she'll know I've been out there, 
Play n' sane.
