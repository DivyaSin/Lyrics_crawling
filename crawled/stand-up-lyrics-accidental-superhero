I need a sedative 
But I don't need what you give 
I don't see how you're so divine 
I don't see how you live 
Reform you sanity before you come to me 
Or I'll just say goodbye 
There is no guarantee of what you mean to me 
Stop, stop asking me why stand up with it to throw it down 
Stand up willing for the sake of sound 
Stand up with it to throw it down 
Stand up willing for the sake of sound it's all so relative 
But it's all that I can give 
I don't seem to ever mind but it comes time after time 
So long to sanity, ever since you came to me 
But you always come to mind 
If we will ever be what we used to be 
You'll have to take what you find stand up with it to throw it down 
Stand up willing for the sake of sound 
Stand up with it to throw it down 
Stand up willing for the sake of sound better believe what you see 
I gave you ground on me 
Better that you try to prove 
You only get what you give stand up with it to throw it down 
Stand up willing for the sake of sound 
Stand up with it to throw it down 
Stand up willing for the sake of sound
