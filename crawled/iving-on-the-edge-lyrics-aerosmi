There's something wrong with the world today 
I don't know what it is 
Something's wrong with our eyes We're seeing things in a different way 
And god knows it ain't his 
It sure ain't no surprise Livin' on the edge 
Livin' on the edge 
Livin' on the edge 
Livin' on the edge There's something wrong with the world today 
The lightbulb's gettin' dimmed 
There's meltdown in the sky If you can judge a wise man 
By the color of his skin 
Then mister, you're a better man than I Livin' on the edge

Livin' on the edge Tell me what you think about our situation 
Complication, aggravation 
Is getting to you If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin' 
Even if it wasn't would you still come crawling 
Back again, I bet you would my friend 
Again and again and again and again Tell me what you think about our situation 
Complication, aggravation 
Is getting to you If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin' 
Even if it wasn't would you still come crawling 
Back again I bet you would my friend

Or we could let it go
