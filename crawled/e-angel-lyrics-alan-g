In my fairy tales 
An angel would come 
To heal and repair 
These broken wings But look at this mess 
My soul bit the dust 
Is this debris what 
Remains of my dreams Tumbling from the world you promised me 
Broken by the lies I found 
Banished to the halls of misery 
And now you kick me to the ground Save me angel 
Or leave me to my fate 
Are you my savior or my destruction 
Save me now before it's too late I was so sure 
That I'd seize the day 
That if I was strong 
I'd soar through the pain Now I'm shot down in flight 
But your music still plays 
Can hope collapse 
Under its own weight How dare you tell me to live faithfully 
When all I know is pain and grief 
Then show me proof that there's a plan for me 
Too disillusioned to believe Save me angel 
Or tell me to my face 
Are you my heaven or my damnation 
Save me now before it's too late Are you life, are you death or distraction? 
Heaven-sent or from hell - corpse or king? 
You said I, I could fly if I just tried 
Look what I have to show, not a thing 
Cuz it's all just lies So save me angel 
Or leave me to my fate 
Are you my savior or my destruction 
Angel, save me now before it's too late So save me angel 
Or tell me to my face 
Are you my heaven or my damnation 
Angel, save me now before it's too late You can't save me 
It's too late
