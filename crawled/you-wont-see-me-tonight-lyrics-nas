[Nas (Timbaland)] 
(What?) Ever been in love? (C'mon) 
Yeah, are you ready? (uh) For something real? 
(Say what?) Cause it can't be fake 
This ain't no game (C'mon) 
You gotta be wit me, for real (uh-huh) 
Cause it's real out here (uh-huh) 
So make up your mind, cause I ain't got no time 
Y'know? (C'mon) [Nas] 
I'm the most wanted baby father, save the drama 
We toast when I wine and dine ya, all you need is me 
I won't stress you but bless you 
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual 
Can't forget how I met you; 
You thought I was a boxer, Prince Nasim 
But I'm the mobster, Nas from Queens 
And when I gotcha, you riding with me 
You keep asking, "When do you have time for me?" 
I'm never free always on the move, bidness oriented 
Lifestyle expensive, attract women 
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild 
Say I hurt your hear, ask how could I smile? 
Wanna call back all my numbers, star 6-9 me 
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying 
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying 
You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying [Aaliyah (Timbaland) {Nas}] 
You won't see me tonight {Yeah right} (Say what? Say what?) 
You won't see me tomorrow {uh-huh} (uh-huh) 
I'll be gone by daylight {Doubt that} (What?) 
And you'll be so full of sorrow {Yeah right} 
You'll go tell all your friends {That's right} (Say what?) 
How you called and I follow {They know it} 
But you won't see me tonight {You don't believe that} 
No you won't see me tomorrow [Nas] 
Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister 
I feel no guilt when I twist ya 
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak with ya 
You got your name on his lease, copy his key 
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig peice 
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady 
You page me, when you got the day free 
But I be out with my peeps in them system jeeps 
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites 
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami 
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thing? 
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up 
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump 
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them 
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely 
But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby [Nas (Aaliyah)] 
(Call you on a Monday) 
[Nas] I'll call you back baby 
(Call you on a Tuesday)

(Call you on a Wednesday) 
[Nas] My cell is off baby 
(You won't be back til Thursday)

You won't see me tonight (Say what?) 
You won't see me tomorrow (Say what?) 
I'll be gone by daylight 
And you'll be so full of sorrow 
You'll go tell all your friends (What what?) 
How you called and I follow (Say what?) 
But you won't see me tonight 
No you won't see me tomorrow [Nas] 
Thinking of me you gettin the chills 
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels 
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy 
Tell your friends you in love with Nas not his money 
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs 
Iceberg - everything on this planet Earth a woman desires 
You make a good wife to most men 
I know I got you open; but, you just my close friend 
Get it baby? [Aaliyah (Timbaland) {Nas}] 
You won't see me tonight (uh-huh) 
You won't see me tomorrow (Say what?) 
I'll be gone by daylight {Daylight} 
And you'll be so full of sorrow {Word?} 
You'll go tell all your friends {Tell your friends what?} (Say what?) 
How you called and I follow {Uh, uh} 
But you won't see me tonight {Not tonight baby} 
No you won't see me tomorrow [Nas (Aaliyah)] 
The God, The God, The God, Nasir (You won't see me tonight) 
The Queen, The Queen, The Queen, Aaliyah (You won't see me tomorrow) 
Nah nah (I'll be gone by daylight) 
(And you'll be so full of sorrow) 
Uhh uhh (You'll go tell all your friends) 
Tell your friends (how you called and I followed) 
How you followed me (But you won't see me tonight) 
Not tonight baby (No you won't see me tomorrow) 
C'mon, c'mon c'mon

Daylight, ghost [Timbaland (Aaliyah)] 
Say what, say what? Yo (You won't see me tonight)
