Fly to the moon 
(Akuna Art) I go and come back after some time 
And she knows I might get caught in the crossfire 
Just find something else to feel better in my mind May I draw her attention in my sky 
Take a plane without knowing where I go tonight 
I gotta tell her to get ready for a long sigh And it's true that sometimes 
When I look up to the sky 
Chasing after the passing of time I'm shouting 
Gimme your love 
But it's true that sometimes 
When she's dancing on the edge of my nights 
I drop all my sweet dreams in my doubts 
And I fly to the moon I made up my mind to find her way 
I pack my luggage and take off across her sky 
She made up the whole story again without looking back Feel throughout my whole body some fire 
And tears were running down the side of my face 
But I know God is gonna take me out of there And it's true that sometimes 
When I look up to the sky 
Chasing after the passing of time I'm shouting 
Gimme your love 
But it's true that sometimes 
When she's dancing on the edge of my nights 
I drop all my sweet dreams in my doubts 
And I fly to the moon And it's true that sometimes 
When I look up to the sky 
Chasing after the passing of time I'm shouting 
Gimme your love 
But it's true that sometimes 
When she's dancing on the edge of my nights 
I drop all my sweet dreams in my doubts 
And I fly to the moon
