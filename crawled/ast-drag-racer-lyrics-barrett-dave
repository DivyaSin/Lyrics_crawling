He's often quiet 
When it comes to meeting strangers. 
And some laugh at his nickname "Midnight Ranger". 
'cause he sits on the hood all alone. 
He rest his foot upon the chrome 
'cause to him this ride 
Has been his only home. 
Now the Ranger's pride 
Has always been his honor. 
It's been challenged from North Cook 
To Benton Harbor. 
And tonight the words down the line 
He'll blow his engine one last time 
In the one place that he can ever be 
'cause he is the last drag racer ever seen. 
Well the flag Queen, drag Queen 
Drops her silk laced panties. 
And the challenger flips ranger off 
And he just raised the anti. 
He takes the throttle down to the floor 
And blankets smoke upon the roar 
In the one place that he can ever be 
'cause he is the last drag racer ever seen. 
It's late at night 
And the Ranger wonders 
And down a darken strip 
His mind ponders. 
Is this the alone home he'll know 
Will there be any other place to go. 
In this one place that he can ever be 
'cause he is the last drag racer ever seen.
