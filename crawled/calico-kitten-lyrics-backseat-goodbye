If my life had a soundtrack it would be acoustic 
With songs about the way I laugh 
At my ability to love things that I can't have If my life were a movie, it would be black and white 
With still-frames in color and hue 
The credits would say a simple phrase like 
"You aren't what you say or what you do 
So don't worry so much 
Just get on with a life that you love" I had a good day since I didn't die or have to wait 
In any really long lines at the store 
Me, I like to make music, you like to make war There's a Calico kitten prancing across a rooftop 
Smiling at the gray withered sky 
He's watching all the cars as they pass by 
Their blinkers go click, click, click This new height makes him homesick 
He misses his mother the most 
And his long days by the window 
They're long, long gone If my life had a soundtrack it would be acoustic 
With songs about the way I laugh 
At my ability to lose everything that I have 
Everything I have Yeah, if my life were a movie, it would be black and white 
With still-frames in color and hue 
The credits would say a simple phrase like 
"You aren't what you say or what you do 
So don't worry so much 
Just get on with a life that you love, a life that you love" If you're alright then I'm alright 
If you're alright then I'm alright 
If you're alright then I'm alright 
If you're alright then I'm alright 
(It feels good to be alive again) If you're alright then I'm alright 
If you're alright then I'm alright 
(I can finally see the sky again) 
If you're alright then I'm alright 
If you're alright then I'm alright 
(It feels good to be alive again) If you're alright then I'm alright 
If you're alright then I'm alright 
(I'm finally alright again) 
If you're alright then I'm alright
