Something's wrong with the world 
Something's wrong with the view from here 
It's so hard to explain 
The visions I see are rarely clear 
Just below the lie I am sure of hides the real 
Reality, we feed machines, with minds in need of worth Contact made with the truth 
Through lines of code on my computer screen 
Binary diamonds of proof 
Shining stars unlock doors made of dreams 
Beyond required imagination hides the hive 
Born from AI, we live the lie cocooned in lieu of life With dreams we feed reality 
Your fantasy a fallacy? 
Imprisoned by your memory, a memory? There's no promise of peace 
There's no comfort and no guarantees 
Once the system's been killed 
We'll have no choice; we'll have to rebuild 
And life won't be the pretty picture you recall 
But it will be reality and you'll be free
