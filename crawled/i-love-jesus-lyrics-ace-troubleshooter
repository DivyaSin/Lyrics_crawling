He's just, He's fair, I know He cares 
About me and about you 
And I know that He is true 
He's awesome and totally rad 
He's good, and not bad! 
And I know He loves me, too Yeah I love Jesus 
And He loves me, too He was a man who had a plan 
And for that man I'm in this band 
I gave my heart to Him 
He gave His life upon that tree 
He died to set you and me free 
Will you give your heart to Him?
