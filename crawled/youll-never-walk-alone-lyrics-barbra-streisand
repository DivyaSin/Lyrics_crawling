When you walk through a storm 
Hold your head up high 
And don't be afraid of the dark At the end of the storm 
There's a golden sky 
And the sweet silver song of a lark Walk on 
Through the wind 
Walk on 
Through the rain 
Though your dreams be tossed and blown Walk on (walk on) 
Oh, walk on (walk on, hold you head up) When you walk 
Through a storm 
Hold your head up high 
And don't be afraid 
Of the dark (walk, walk on up) At the end of that storm 
There's a golden sky 
And the sweet silver song of a lark Walk on (walk on) 
Through the wind (walk on) 
Walk on (walk on) 
Through the rain (walk on) 
Though your dreams be tossed and blown Walk on (walk on) 
Walk on (walk on up) 
With hope (walk on) 
Hope in your heart (walk on up) 
And you'll never walk alone 
You'll never walk alone (walk through the wind, walk through the wind) You'll never walk alone
