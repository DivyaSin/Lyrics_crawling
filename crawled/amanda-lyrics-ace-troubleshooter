Amanda talks about herself 
Forever and a day she'll have her way 
Amanda talks about nothing 
But she'll make you think it's poetry 
And it's too bad, she's only seventeen years old She's too young, yeah 
She's too young Amanda talks about herself 
But when she sings it's gold 
And it's too bad, she's only seventeen years old Amanda thinks about herself 
Forever and a day she'll get her way 
Amanda thinks about nothing 
But she'll make you think it's poetry 
And it's too bad, she's only seventeen years old She's too young, yeah 
She's too young Amanda talks about herself 
But when she sings it's gold 
And it's too bad, she's only seventeen years old Old enough to know that she's too young 
To just come knocking on my door 
Can't take the girl no more
