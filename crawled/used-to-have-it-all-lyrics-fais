[Verse 1] 
You're looking at me 
I'm looking back at you 
Looking for answers 
What are we 'spossed to do? [Pre-Chorus] 
Stuck in a moment 
And we can find our way out 
Lost in a far memory 
What this is about 
[Chorus] 
We used to have it all 
The late nights on the beach 
Running wild in the streets 
Remember how we used to have it all 
The whole world at our feet 
The music through the beat 
It's crazy how we used to have it all 
The late nights on the beach 
Running wild in the streets 
Remember how we used to have it all [Post-Chorus: Instrumental] 
It's crazy how we used to have it all [Verse 2] 
You know I feel it 
I know you feel it too 
You've got my love 
What are we waiting for? [Pre-Chorus] 
Stuck in a moment 
And we can find our way out 
Lost in a far memory 
What this is about [Chorus] 
We used to have it all 
The late nights on the beach 
Running wild in the streets 
Remember how we used to have it all 
The whole world at our feet 
The music through the beat 
It's crazy how we used to have it all 
The late nights on the beach 
Running wild in the streets 
Remember how we used to have it all [Post-Chorus: Instrumental] 
It's crazy how we used to have it all [Bridge] 
We used to have it all 
Remember how we used to have it all 
It all, it all, it all, it all... [Chorus] 
It's crazy how we used to have it all 
The late nights on the beach 
Running wild in the streets 
Remember how we used to have it all 
The whole world at our feet 
The music through the beat 
It's crazy how we used to have it all [Post-Chorus: Instrumental] 
It's crazy how we used to have it all
