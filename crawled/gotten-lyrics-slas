So nice to see your face again 
Tell me how long has it been 
Since you've been here 
(since you've been here) 
You look so different than before 
But still the person I adore 
Frozen with fear 
I'm out of love but I'll take it from the past 
I'll let out words cause I'm sure It'll never last And I've been saving 
These last words for one last miracle 
But now I'm not sure 
I can't save you if 
You don't let me 
You just get me like I never 
Been gotten before Maybe it's the bitter wind 
A chill from the Pacific rim 
That brought you this way 
(that brought you my way) 
Do not make me think of him 
The way he touch your fragile skin 
That hunts me everyday 
I'm out of love but I can't forget the past 
I'm out of words but I'm sure it'll never last And I've been saving 
These last words for one last miracle 
But now I'm not sure 
I can't save you if 
You don't let me 
You just get me like I never 
Been gotten before 
Like I never been gotten before So nice to see you face again 
But tell me will this ever end? 
Don't disappear And I've been saving 
These last words for one last miracle 
But now I'm not sure 
I can't save you if 
You don't let me 
You just get me like I never 
Been gotten before 
Like I never been gotten before
