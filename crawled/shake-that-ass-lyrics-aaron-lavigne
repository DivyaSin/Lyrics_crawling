Don't know what you're getting into tonight but you're looking alright to me 
Don't know what you're getting into tonight but you're looking mighty fine to me 
Don't be surprised by this look in my eyes as I'm tracking you down when you make my heart go Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. 
You make it go 
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. If you want it, come and find it 
'cause I'm looking for it too 
If you need it, I'll provide it 
I'm gonna ask the same of you I said "Hey girl. what's your life without regrets?" 
I said it. "Hey girl. Pardon me for these Tourette's" but 
Go ahead, leave your bags at the door and just shake that ass for me 
Please. Go ahead, leave them all at the door and shake that fine ass for me 
It's cheesy, but it's true. 
I'll be grating my cheese for you 
Show me how you move Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. 
Oh, You make it go 
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. If you want it, come and find it

If you need it, I'll provide it 
I'm gonna ask the same of you And you make it go boom... I said, let yourself go 
Let yourself go 
Let yourself go 
Let yourself go 
Let yourself go like there's nobody watching 
Just lose control 
Shake it and roll that ass with me If you want it, come and find it 
'cause I'm looking for it too 
If you need it, I'll provide it 
I'm gonna ask the same of you And you make it go 
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. 
Oh, boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
