when I met you you were just sixteen 
pulling the wings off flies 
when an old lady got hit by a truck 
I saw the wicked gleam in your eyes 
your sadistic suits my masochistic 
and theres a whip in may valise on yeah who taught you to torture? 
who taught ya? 
who taught ya? 
who taught ya? 
who taught ya? describe the special punishment room 
over my garage, theres a 
whipping post, a vertical beam 
you have to be in charge 
I payed a packet 
for a new straight jacket 
and theres a whip in my valise oh yeah you put my head into the stocks 
and then you went to choose a cane 
but hey your cat has got nine tails 
you like to leave me lame 
I can't thank her, my Sunday Spanker 
there's a whip in my valise oh yeah
