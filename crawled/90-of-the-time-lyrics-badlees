(Naydock) Ten times I stopped by 
'Cause she said to stop by 
Nine times we flowed 
Like good rhythm and rhyme 
I was a good ear 
A welcome companion 
90% of the time She was from Baltimore 
Recent divorce 
From a man who found fortune 
In pool installation 
And you could get close 
In a way she could manage 
But never encounter the breadth of her station 'Cause she couldn't ever 
Betray independence 
Her independence was a personal sign 
This is for someone who let me inside 
90% of the time She worked the counter 
Down at second street video 
She'd rent releases 
She could empathize watching 
Woman would triumph 
Assimilation 
That she felt good was the thing Yeah, no time for sympathy 
Or mock conventions 
No chance to leave personal items behind 
I was a witness 
She let scratch the surface 
90% of the time 'Cause she couldn't ever 
Betray independence 
Her independence was a personal sign 
This is for someone who let me inside 
90% of the time Tenth time around 
It came unexpected 
Though I'd play scenarios 
For a week till that day 
I had felt something 
She said she felt the same thing 
And we knew that that wouldn't play Well, maybe she lied 
And maybe she had to 
'Cause maybe I'd found 
What I hadn't yet seen 
But there in the doorway 
The moment had brought us 
To a place she rarely had been 'Cause she couldn't ever 
Betray independence 
Her independence was a personal sign 
This is for someone who let me inside 
90% of the time
