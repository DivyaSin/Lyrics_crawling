This thing pounding inside my chest 
It's taking a beating lately 
The blood that it's been pumping yet 
Feels colder than the words that you speak 
I'm a broken kid 
I'm so irrelevant 
And my confidence is wearing thin 
They say to not look back 
But I'm climbing a mountain of disappointment Take me back 
Take me back to when I was naive 
So I can feel that glimpse of hope one more time I did this all for me, oh 
I did this all for me Ha! Whoa-oh-oo-whoa-oh-oh 
Closed my heart but didn't lock it 
You're such a bore 
Waste my time and drain my pockets 
I lost everything you gave to me 
I want this all to change 
I want my life to change 
This is a war and I'm weak 
But I'm in it to win it 
This is 
This is war And every day 
This crippling belief in myself 
And every night 
My tears are all I have to hide behind 
And every day 
This knot in my neck takes over 
And every night 
Success gets redefined And I'm on my own tonight 
And I'm barely gettin' by 
In this war we're fightin' on 
Wanna give myself to my bed sheets Sleep is only a temporary escape 
But life's not going anywhere 
Myself, is who I recreate And that so called "heart" 
Just take it off your sleeve 
Because you haven't earned 
Your fucking right to bleed I hope you choke Choke, fall 
Gasp for air 
Suffer like me 
For you I was there This is war Whoa-oh-oo-whoa-oh-oh 
Closed my heart but didn't lock it 
You're such a bore 
Waste my time and drain my pockets 
I lost everything you gave to me 
I want this all to change 
I want my life to change 
This is a war 
And I'm weak (I'm weak) 
But I'm in it to win it 
This is 
This is war Fight
