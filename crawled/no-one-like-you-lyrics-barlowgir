You are more beautiful 
Then anyone ever 
Everyday you are the same 
You never change no never You are more beautiful 
Then anyone ever 
Everyday you are the same 
You never change no never And how can I ever deny 
The love of my savior You are to me everything 
All I need forever 
How could you be so good? There is no on like you 
There has never ever been anyone like you Everywhere you were there 
Earth or air surrounding 
I'm not alone the heavens sing along 
My god you're so astounding 
How could you be so good to me 
Eternally I believe that There is no on like you 
There has never ever been anyone like you How could you be so good to me 
Were not alone so sing along 
Sing along. Sing along
