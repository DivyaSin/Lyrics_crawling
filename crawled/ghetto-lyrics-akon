Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto we livin' These streets remind me of quicksand (quicksand) 
When your on it you'll keep goin' down (goin' down) 
And there's no one to hold on too 
And there's no one to pull you out You keep on falling (falling) 
And no one can here you calling 
So you end up self destructing 
On the corner with the tuli on the waist tight just got outta the bing doin' stay time Teeth marks on my back from the canine 
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine 
Cause they said that I wouldn't make it 
(I remember like yesterday) 
Holding on to what god gave me Cause that's the life when you're 
Living in the (ghetto)and 
Eating in the (ghetto)or 
Sleeping in the (ghetto) (ghetto) 
Cause that's the life when you're 
Living in the (ghetto)and 
Eating in the (ghetto)or 
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto) No need to cherish luxuries ('cause everythin' come and go) 
Even the life that you have is borrowed 
(cause your not promised tomorrow) 
So live your life as if everyday's gon be your last Once you move forward can't go back 
Best prepare to remove your past Cause ya gotta be willing to pray 
Yea there gotta be (there gotta be) a better way oh 
Yea ya gotta be willing to pray 
Cause there gotta be (there gotta be) a better day (ay) Whoever said that this suffering would stop today 
A lot of niggas dead or locked away 
Teenage women growing up with aids Cause that's the life when you're 
Living in the (ghetto)and 
Eating in the (ghetto)or 
Sleeping in the (ghetto) (ghetto)

Living in the (ghetto)and 
Eating in the (ghetto)or 
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto) Gun shots every night in the (ghetto) 
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto) 
Every day is a fight in the (ghetto)

Selling coke and weed in the (ghetto) 
Every day somebody bleed in the (ghetto)
