Sunday afternoon church potluck 
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck 
Granny's fried chicken and her sweet tea 
Now that's a bittersweet memory The old tire swing where my little boys play 
Well, that was me only yesterday 
Doing double back flips off the branch in the tank 
Kissing on you and fishing from the bank We've had some good times, got through the bad times 
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times 
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory 
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree Passed down from my granny and my grandpa 
Mom and daddy kept it safe, kept it sturdy and tall 
Summers were hot, winters were long 
But our roots were deep and our faith was strong Now some are gone, and some are all grown 
You and me, baby, branched out on our own 
With every sunset comes another sunrise 
I can see my daddy in our little boys' eyes We've had some good times, got through the bad times 
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times 
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory 
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree Lost love once throughout the years 
Remember their smiles and dry those tears 
'Cause they'll live on in your heart and mine 
So let love grow like a country vine We've had some good times, got through the bad times 
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times 
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory 
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree 
Made in the shade of our family tree Sunday afternoon church potluck 
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck A family that prays together 
Is a family that stays together 
Love the Lord thy God and Savior 
With all your heart and love thy neighbor A family that prays together 
Is a family that stays together 
Love the Lord thy God and Savior 
With all your heart and love thy neighbor
