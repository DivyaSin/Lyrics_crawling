You can go, go , go 
'Cause I know, know, know 
I have found another love 
To take your place Down down down came the tears 
Since you went away and left me here 
But up, up, up went my love, love, love 
I have found another love 
To take your place Fast, fast, fast went the train 
That took you to the arms of another man 
But you can go, go, go 
'Cause I know, know, know 
I have found another love 
To take your place I thought that I could live without you 
I thought that I would never love again 
Someone came along with a love so strong 
I forgot about you and once again 
I feel like a man
