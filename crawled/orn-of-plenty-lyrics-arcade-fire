Oh Horn of Plenty 
One Horn of Plenty for us all! 
And when you raise the cry 
The brave shall heed the call 
And we shall never falter 
One Horn of Plenty for us all! Oh Horn of Plenty 
One Horn of Plenty for us all! 
And when we raise the cry 
The brave shall heed the call 
And we shall never fall Oh Horn of Plenty 
One Horn of Plenty for us all! 
And when we raise the cry 
The brave shall heed the call 
And we shall never falter 
One Horn of Plenty for us all! Though dark may fall 
Through darkness light will shine 
As they believe 
The darkness is the light 
One Horn of Plenty for us all!
