I heard the hype about your band, I've seen your video playing on the TV 
Publicity photos in magazines; oh, none of it makes me feel anything 
I would be lying to you if I did not say something that would make me feel like a politician 
A middle-of-the-road opinion no one finds offensive or challenging I'm not interested; the stage is not a pedestal 
I don't think you're bad people, I just think that your aesthetic is horrible 
Please treat me with the same respect and candor; I would appreciate the honesty 
Yeah, a little less professional, a little more upfront and confrontational Whoa, whoa, whoa, just say what you're thinking 
Say what you're really thinking Whoa, whoa, whoa, just say what you're thinking 
Say what you're really thinking 
Say what you're thinking!
