You know what to do now; 
Holla! Holla! 
We got the rhythm, 
We got the most fun. Like this, we gonna drop the beat 
Rock the house, get you up on your feet 
Get away from the rat race 
It's a party Like that, we gonna raise the roof 
Let the music do it's thing to you 
Play ahead and get it started 
Move your body Come on now take you for a ride 
Drop the top and dance all night 
Life is good so let me hear you holler [Chorus: x 2] Jump back, a-brush side to side 
Roll your booty 'round from left to right 
Look at you, here we go now 
I think you got it That's right, where you take it though 
Up, up, up is where you want to go 
The kick box, feel the bass talk 
Now baby work it now That's exactly how we do 
Bringing the party to you 
Life is good so let me hear you holler [Chorus: x 2] Time flies on, don't waste it frowning 
Come go with me and let your hea-head down 
Ride your groove and let it out 
Don't stop! Keep it hot (keep it hot, keep it hot, keep it hot, keep it hot)

If you want to jump and dance

Jump up and HOLLA! [Chorus: x 4]
