Hate is what I feel for you I punch the clock wish it was you You're always telling me what to do Don't you talk down to me You've got me under your authority Against authority You motherfucker Against the grain I stand Paybacks a bitch Just you fuckin' wait and see I'm on the clock your on my ass I'm sick of workin' and sick of you You've got me under your authority I see through you like broken glass I'd rather be home smoking grass So full of shit you know its true I hate this job I hate you too I nod and smile you talk your shit In your face I wanna fuckin' bust your lip I'm gonna spit Your stupid fuckin' rules We're not gonna obey Workin' everyday It's time for me to stand and fight Another one of society's tools A smile on my face as I take your life Feel my hate and feel my knife
