I was holding my breath 
When the tightrope walker 
Slipped into the moonglow 
Saying all my children follow me, 
Maybe it's time to go 
You can be chrome when you're wise 
Can be wise when you're blue 
And baby if I have, then I have for you Bribing the jury to keep me in jail 
Singing "Tea for the Tillerman" 
And although I lie fantastically 
I swore an oath on my history 
It's a miracle I can see 
You can be wrong when you're right 
Even when you're right on cue 
And if I die tonight, then I die for you Calling on those that call me son, 
Great-grandson, or grandson 
Great uncles, aunts and relatives 
To judge what I have done 
Gonna make right by you 
Even if it's all I do 
And if it's all I do, then I do for you People will raise a whole lot of hell about 
The water and the wind-mill 
And although I stab chaotically 
It hurts no one but me 
Even the darkness has arms 
But they ain't got you 
Baby, I have it, and I have you too And a light in the window 
To pass the night through 
May be so uncertain but what can I do 
Keeping it on, keeping it on 
And I know I like it but what does that prove 
Sometimes I worry I don't know 
How to love you I bring to you with reverend hands 
All the books that my love abides 
Kind woman that my passion wore 
Like the shoreline wears the tides 
Maybe the water went dry 
Keeping an eye on you 
And with an eye on you, it could drown me too People will raise a whole lot of hell about 
The water and the wind-mill 
And although I stab quixotically 
I swore an oath on my history 
It's a miracle I can see 
Even the darkness has arms 
But they ain't got you 
Baby, I have it, and I have you too And a light in the window 
To pass the night through 
May be so uncertain but what can I do 
Keeping it on, keeping it on 
And I know I like it but what does that prove 
Sometimes I worry I don't know 
How to love you
