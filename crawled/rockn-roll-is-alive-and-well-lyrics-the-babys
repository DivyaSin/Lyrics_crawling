I wrote the president 
But I got no reply 
He claims he tells the truth 
He writes it in the sky 
The taxman's at the door 
Though he never seems polite 
They've got me cornered 
Cornered in the light 
We could change that overnight 
So goodnight to all the world 
Sleep tight all you boys and girls 
I spent some time at school 
Livin' by the rules 
They didn't like me much 
Hypocrites and fools 
Old men teach young men 
To surrender to the law 
The straight and narrow path 
Leads to the same old door 
Gonne kick it in like before 
So goodnight to all the world 
Sleep tight all you boys and girls 
Heaven walks hand in hand with hell 
Rock 'n roll is alive and well 
Too many heroes looking dead upon their feet 
It's time to raise the roof 
And shout it in the street 
It's time to take command 
It's time to make a stand 
Yeah 
Don't need a uniform 
To know which side I'm on 
Don't need a set of rules 
To know what's right or wrong 
I've been an outcast 
In your eyes and to the law 
The right hand takes away 
The left hand asks for more 
But we all know the score 
So goodnight to all the world 
Sleep tight all you boys and girls 
Heaven walks hand in hand with hell 
Rock 'n roll is alive 
Is alive and well 
So goodnight to all the world 
Sleep tight all the boys and girls 
Heaven walks hand in hand with hell 
Rock 'n roll is alive 
Is alive and well 
Goodnight 
Goodnight 
Goodnight 
Goodnight 
Goodnight 
Goodnight 
Goodnight 
Goodnight 
Gonna have some fun tonight 
Everything's alright 
Goodnight 
Goodnight 
Goodnight 
Sleep tight
