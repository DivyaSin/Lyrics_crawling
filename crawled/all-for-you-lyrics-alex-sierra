Here I go 
Now that I've found myself losing all control 
You won't believe what I've been thinking Got a plan 
Got you everything you could ever need 
Steal a plane and fly you everywhere you want We never know when to stop 
It's the way you keep me twisted 
It's just how I like it to be We never know when to stop 
And if you wake up and see me on the news 
I did it all for you I did it all for you There you go 
Your love caused trouble now I'm thinking of 
Just how close I'd been to doing the same When you see your favorite car 
Driving every mile, 'til the they call the cops 
No jail bars are ever keeping us apart We never know when to stop 
It's the way you keep me twisted 
It's just how I like it to be We never know when to stop 
And if you wake up and see me on the news 
I did it all for you I did it all for you They're coming to get us so you better run 
How are we gonna pay for the things that we've done 
They're coming to get us so you better run They're coming to get us so you better run 
How are we gonna pay for the things that we've done 
They're coming to get us so you better run I did it all for you 
I did it all for you 
I did it all for you 
I did it all for you 
For you, for you, for you I did it all for you 
I did it all for you
