We look to the sun as it's going down 
We turning up 
We do it for fun, together we crawl 
Together we run I put my first finger up 
Followed by the middle one 
Life's too short 
Let's have a little fun 
Live high and don't be afraid tonight Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Nothing better better better 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Nothing better better better It's a hell of a night 
We're feeling higher than the stars 
We don't need a DJ 
Just give me some violin and guitar 
We don't need no money this is how life is 
Living the moment, the moment entices us 
Being here, nothing better than being here I put my first finger up 
Followed by the middle one 
Life's too short 
Let's have a little fun 
Live high and don't be afraid tonight Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Nothing better better better 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Nothing better better better I put my first finger up 
Followed by the middle one 
Life's too short 
Let's have a little fun 
Say Oh Oh Oh 
Say Oh Oh Oh Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Nothing better 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Nothing better better better
