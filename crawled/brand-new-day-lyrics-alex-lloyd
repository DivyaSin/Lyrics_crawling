When you feel as though your falling 
Every fear you can confide 
When the night time is your dawning 
Hard to see through troubled eyes What you wanted so 
Had to let it go Brand new day is coming round the bend 
Troubles reaching for the end 
If you stray from the path my friend 
I will pick you up again Hard to wake up in the morning 
Hard to see through so much light 
With every dream you've had gone calling 
Makes it harder to believe What you wanted so 
Had to let it go Brand new day is coming round the bend 
Troubles reaching for the end 
If you stray from the path my friend 
I will pick you up again 
I will pick you up again 
Troubles reaching for the end Everything that starts must end 
Reaching for a new beginning 
Everything that starts must end 
Reaching for a new beginning Brand new day is coming round the bend 
Troubles reaching for the end 
If you stray from the path my friend 
I will pick you up again 
I will pick you up again 
Troubles reaching for the end Said I'm lonely won't you let me in 
I'm longing for the day... Lyrics Written By: A. Wasiliev
