It's so late now 
Where's that spark? 
Help us out we're in the dark 
Institute of correction 
Point us in the right direction 
I lost in a foreign land 
Burning on the desert sand 
We hitched a lift 
On a camel train 
Now we're heading for the rain 
Wherever you go 
We go a stray 
Won't somebody show us the way 
When the right road has been found 
We will be homeward bound
