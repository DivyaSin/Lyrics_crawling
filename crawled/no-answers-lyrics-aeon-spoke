Up and away your words 
And see an empty page in my book 
But how much have I lost 
When I've got nothing saved in my book I think about how as a child 
I used to sit beneath the tree 
Avoiding the sun and look at the ground 
As if I had no needs I'll find it 
I'll find my way 
Into another sun 
I'm dreaming of someone else 
That's found a way to love I've hidden behind a wall 
And yet I stand right beside you 
The universe will make you full 
If you state your claims I don't want anything 
I don't need anything more 
I don't need anything more I'll find it 
I'll find my way 
Into another sun 
I'm dreaming of someone else 
That's found found a way to love I have no answers 
There are no answers no I never really want to know 
I have no answers Just when I'm think I'm over I know 
It feels all right I never really want to know 
And it feels all right Just when I think I'm over I know 
It feels all right And it feels all right 
And it feels all right 
And it feels all right 
And it feels all right
