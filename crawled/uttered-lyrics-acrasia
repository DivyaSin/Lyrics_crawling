Now hear this, 
Oh foolish and senseless people, 
Who have eyes but do not see; 
Who have ears but do not hear. Even the darkness is not dark to you, 
The Darkness and light are alike to you. 
You are of your father the devil, 
And the lusts of your father you will do. I will bring distress on you, 
So you will walk like the blind. 
I will laugh at your calamity. 
I will mock you when your dread comes. When your fear comes as desolation, 
When grief and anguish come upon you, 
Who will have pity on you? 
Or who will mourn for you? I will bring distress on you, 
So you will walk like the blind. 
I will laugh at your calamity. 
I will mock you when your dread comes. A day of wrath will come, 
A day of trouble and suffering, 
A day of destruction and emptiness, 
A day of darkness and gloom. I will bring distress on you, 
So you will walk like the blind. 
I will laugh at your calamity. 
I will mock you when your dread comes. note:words taken from the holy bible
