Every time I saw you 
Trying to pretend 
Now I think you're caught in 
A spin 
Said that I could trust 
You'd be my everything 
Falling from the shadows 
Now I see 
All those times were wasted 
When you tried to hide it from me [Chorus] 
I don't care what you're sayin' 
I don't care what you're doin' 
Never really had me 
I'm over it 
So why is it so hard to see 
All the lies you tell me 
I'm getting out, I'm moving on 
I'm over it 
I'm over it 
I'm over it Tried to walk away 
But my heart was sayin' no 
Can't believe it took so 
Long to go 
Now the past is fading 
I hardly know your name 
Don't know what you're doin' 
Ya lost the game 
All those times were wasted 
When you tried to hide it from me [Chorus x 3]
