When your world is cold and lonely 
And time feels like it's standing still 
If when in your heart you find troubles only 
Then remember it won't always be a pill. 
Change will come for you 
Change will come for you When your hope is gone or tainted, 
And your breath is slowly running out 
If the picture perfect life you made is over painted 
Then remember it will always come right back around! 
Change will come for you 
Change will come for you 
Change will come for you 
Change will come for you Change will come for you 
Change will come for you 
Change will come for you 
Change will come for you
