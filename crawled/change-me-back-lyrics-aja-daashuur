Have I regressed to something I detest 
Cause of the way you make me feel 
Have I lied and closed my eyes 
To all that you are and say is real 
Am I wrong? Am I strong? I was mature and pure 
But now Im younger than I was yesterday 
Have I changed so much that Im cold to the touch 
Or is it you who have made me this way? (Chorus) 
Change me back to what I was 
No ones worth more than myself 
Change me back to what I was 
Or else I may lose myself All of the time I thought they were blind 
Cause they couldnt see the good in your soul 
But now it seems the goodness was a dream 
Because Im loosing more of myself than anything else 
Could it be you deceived me? 
While I defended you to all who cut you in two 
Oh well if theres a hell youll have your own cell 
I wish you love and I wish you well (Chorus) 
Change me back to what I was 
No ones worth more than myself 
Change me back to what I was 
Or else I may lose myself I dont hate cause you are you 
Call it fate dont call me blue 
I was wearing my glasses that night 
Cause you totally distorted all my sight Have I regressed to something I detest 
Cause of the way you make me feel 
Have I lied and closed my eyes 
To all that you are and say is real 
Am I wrong? Am I strong? I was mature and pure 
But now Im younger than I was yesterday 
Have I changed so much that Im cold to the touch 
Or is it you who have made me this way? (Chorus) 
Change me back to what I was 
No ones worth more than myself 
Change me back to what I was 
Or else I may lose myself
