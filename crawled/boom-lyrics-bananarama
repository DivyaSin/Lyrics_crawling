You're too shy 
'Cause baby I 
Need to see a little more attitude 
So if you want to fly 
Across my sky 
You'd better buy a one-way ticket to the moon You're too shy 
'Cause baby I 
Need to see a little more attitude 
So if you want to fly 
Across my sky 
You'd better buy a one-way ticket to the moon Do you like the way I feel 
Do you want to hold me 
Tell me if I let you in 
Will you try and control me [Chorus] 
Boom! Boom! 
Gonna take you out 
Bang! Bang! 
Gonna knock you down 
Boom! Boom! 
Gonna turn you 'round 
And show you where you started from 
Boom! Boom! 
Gonna dress you up 
Bang! 
Gonna tie you down 
Boom! Boom! 
Gonna lay you out 
And start this ride all over again So think twice 
And roll the dice 
Lucky number seven's there for you 
Come on, spin that wheel 
And take that thrill 
It's gonna be the best thing that you ever do Do you like the way I feel 
Do you want to hold me 
Tell me if I let you in 
Will you try and control me [Chorus] I said Boom! 
Boom! 
Boom! I said Boom! 
Boom! 
Boom! Na Na Na Na Na Yeah 
Show you where you started from 
Na Na Na Na Na Yeah 
Boom! Boom! Boom! Na Na Na Na Na Yeah 
Show you where you started from 
Na Na Na Na Na Yeah 
Boom! Boom! Boom! [Chorus]
