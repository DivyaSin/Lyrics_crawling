We're laughing till we cry 
to ourselves we lie 
dance in the moonlight 
I'm satisfied 
Wake up to the sun 
burning while we're young 
set fire to our lungs 
till what's left is none We're the wild ones 
curious fools 
trapped in flume 
We're the wild ones 
raised by the wolves 
we howl to the moon oooooooohh 
oooooooohh War inside my mind 
drowning in the tides 
fighting for my life 
I'm satisfied 
Intoxicate my veins 
make me misbehave 
be my great escape 
till we fade away We're the wild ones 
curious fools 
trapped in the flume 
We're the wild ones 
raised by the wolves 
we howl to the moon 
We howl to the moon oooooooohh 
oooooooohh We're the wild ones 
curious fools 
trapped in the flume 
We're the wild ones 
raised by the wolves 
we howl to the moon ooooooooooohh
