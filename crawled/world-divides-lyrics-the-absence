There is an aftertaste to celebrate 
In the swings of my suicide 
Or the lines I will draw by myself 
Within the grasp, fictitious pasts and all my doubts How can you see through the shadows 
With the blinding light burning in your eyes 
So where will all of you be 
When the killing fields are cleared and the world divides? How can you see through the shadows 
With the blinding light burning in your eyes 
So where will you be 
When the killing fields are cleared and this world divides? 
World divides The loss of love becomes unbearable 
And a vanishing point becomes intact 
So when a six foot drop is my best 
I will expect nothing less than a soldier's death How can you see through the shadows 
With the blinding light burning in your eyes 
So where will all of you be 
When the killing fields are cleared and the world divides? How can you see through the shadows 
With the blinding light burning in your eyes 
So where will you be 
When the killing fields are cleared and the world divides? There is an aftertaste to celebrate 
In the swings of suicide or the lines I've drawn 
At last for redemption and finally for my forgiveness 
In the end this bitterness bends, simply encased in my withered hands How can you see through the shadows 
With the blinding light burning in your eyes 
So where will all of you be 
When the killing fields are cleared and the world divides? How can you see through the shadows 
With the blinding light burning in your eyes 
So where will you be 
When the killing fields are cleared and this world divides? 
World divides
