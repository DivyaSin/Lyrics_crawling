Together, forever, we belong together forever. 
We belong. We belong together 
I remember when we were in school. 
I remember sweet September, 
We remember sweet September, 
Sweet September I'll remember. We belong together, 
I remember when we were in school. 
We belong together, 
Baby, I'm yours, baby, I'm yours. We belong, we belong, 
We belong.
