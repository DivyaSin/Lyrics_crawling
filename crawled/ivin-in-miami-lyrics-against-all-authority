He didnt fit in, he always felt rejected. 
His father him him and made him feel infected. 
He got a bottle it seemed to take the pain away. 
Only 15, but he didnt know any other way. 
Always searchin, never felt like he belonged. 
Always hurtin, always told that he was wrong. 
He left home, the streets looked safer. 
All alone, except a court of Schaffer. 
All alone, with no where to go. 
He feels at home at the punk rock show. 
And when hes hangin out with his crew. 
Livin on the streets of Miami. 
Hed rather die than go home to his family. 
Thats what he'll do. 
He doesnt want you pity. 
Miami can be a cruel city. 
Hes always ready for a fight. 
He doesnt want you sorrow. 
Dont wanna think about tomorrow. 
He only wants to make it through the night.
