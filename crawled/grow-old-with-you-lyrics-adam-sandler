[Billy Idol (Speaking):] Good afternoon everyone. 
We're flying at 26, 000 feet, moving 
Up to thirty thousand feet, and then we've got clear skies 
All the way to Las Vegas, and right now we're bringing you some in-flight 
Entertainment. One of our first-class passengers would like to sing you a song 
Inspired by one of our coach passengers, and since we let our first-class 
Passengers do pretty much whatever they want, here he is. [Robbie Hart (Singing):] 
I wanna make you smile whenever you're sad 
Carry you around when your arthritis is bad 
Oh all I wanna do is grow old with you I'll get your medicine when your tummy aches 
Build you a fire if the furnace breaks 
Oh it could be so nice, growing old with you I'll miss you 
Kiss you 
Give you my coat when you are cold Need you 
Feed you 
Even let you hold the remote control So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink 
Put you to bed when you've had too much to drink 
I could be the man who grows old with you 
I wanna grow old with you
