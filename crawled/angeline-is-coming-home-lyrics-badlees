Her parents house exudes a reborn air 
The bathtub virgins in the midnight air 
Seem to smile in celebration 
What an intercession 
All inertia washed away 
(Chorus) 
Resplendent in dignity 
Angeline is coming home 
I'd fantasize her clean and home again 
The quintessential reverie free of pain 
Just to keep from going crazy 
While the cracks had claimed her 
And how that fantasy sustained 
(Chorus) 
The beautiful acquaintance 
I desired has inspired me 
To levels unforeseen 
True admiration for someone who's 
Made it back from the hell she was in 
When do I see her? 
What say when I do? 
Do I let fantasized ideals come through? 
To hear her laugh at my hyperbole would send me..... 
It's nice to have her home and whole 
(Chorus)
