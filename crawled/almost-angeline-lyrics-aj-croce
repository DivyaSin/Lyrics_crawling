You remind me of someone that I used to know 
Who reminds me of places that I used to go 
Which reminds me there's something that I want to say 
Oh, never mind it doesn't matter anyway Underneath that girlish smile 
Underneath that Paris style 
Even though it?s been a while 
You're almost Angeline On the other hand, she wasn't like the other girls 
On the other hand, she never wore her hair in curls 
On the other hand, she didn't have a wedding ring 
On the other hand, I guess that don't mean anything Underneath that girlish smile 
Underneath that Paris style 
Even though it?s been a while 
You're almost Angeline Then she said, you don't remember me 
Though you're not the girl you used to be 
Either way the girl I see is almost Angeline You remind me of someone that I used to know 
Who reminds me of places that I used to go 
Which reminds me there's someone that I gotta be 
I remember now how she slipped away from me Underneath that girlish smile 
Underneath that Paris style 
Even though it?s been a while 
You're almost Angeline Almost Angeline 
Almost Angeline 
Almost Angeline
