What's wrong with the world mama 
People livin' like ain't got no mamas 
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama 
Only attracted to the things that'll bring the trauma 
Over seas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism 
But we still got terrorist here livin' 
In the USA, the big CIA 
The Bloods, and the Crips and the KKK But if you only have love for you own race 
Then you only leave space to discriminate 
And to discriminate only generates hate 
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate 
Madness is what you demonstrate 
And that's exactly how this angle works and operates 
Man, you got to have love just to set it straight 
Take control of your mind and meditate 
Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all People killing, people dying 
Children hurt and you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Or would you turn the other cheek 
Father father father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
These people got me, got me questioning 
Where is the love 
Where is the love 
Where is the love 
Where is the love, the love, the love It just ain't the same 
All ways of change 
New days are strange 
Is the world insane 
If love and peace is so strong 
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong 
Nations dropping bombs 
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones 
With ongoing suffering as the youth die young 
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone 
So I can ask myself really what is going wrong 
In this world that we live in 
People keep on giving in 
Making wrong decisions only visions of the dividend 
Not respecting each other 
Deny thy brother 
A war's going on, but the reasons undercover 
The truth is kept secret 
It's swept under the rug 
If you never know truth then you never know love 
Where's the love y'all, c'mon, I don't know 
Where's the truth y'all, c'mon, I don't know 
Where's the love y'all People killing, people dying 
Children hurt and you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Or would you turn the other cheek 
Father father father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
These people got me, got me questioning 
Where is the love 
Where is the love 
Where is the love 
Where is the love, the love, the love I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder 
As I'm getting' older 
Y'all people gets colder 
Most of us only care about money makin' 
Selfishness got us following the wrong direction 
Wrong information always shown by the media 
Negative images is the main criteria 
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria 
Kids want to act like what they see in the cinemas 
Yo 
Whatever happened to the values of humanity 
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality 
Instead of spreading love 
We spreading animosity 
Lack of understanding 
Leading us away from unity 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down 
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under 
Got to keep my faith alive 'til love is found People killing, people dying 
Children hurt and you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach 
Or would you turn the other cheek 
Father father father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
These people got me, got me questioning 
Where is the love 
Where is the love 
Where is the love 
Where is the love, the love, the love
