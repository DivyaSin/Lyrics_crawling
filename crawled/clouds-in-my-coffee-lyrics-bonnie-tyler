Oh do you remember the moment 
When the sky turned to a sad shade of grey 
As darkness crept over the ocean 
Then you turned to walk away I looked to the place at the table 
Your face no longer I'd see 
The reflection I saw in your coffee 
Was a bitter reflection of me [Chorus] 
Clouds in my coffee 
And tears in my heart 
That's what I'm feeling 
You've torn me apart 
Clouds in my coffee 
It could be a dream 
But as you walk away 
It's all I can see I still remember the feeling 
As the night woke up to the dawn 
To awake and realize the meaning 
What my eyes had focused upon These rooms so cold and so empty 
Just spaces where photographs were 
The echoing silence assured me 
That you really were no longer here [Chorus]
