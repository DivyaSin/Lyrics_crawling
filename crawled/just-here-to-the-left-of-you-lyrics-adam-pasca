Hit back, it won't hurt you 
Lean in, no inertia 
Bold is the love that I fight to save 
Head on, no collision 
Confusion, indecision 
I don't believe I'm too far to be saved Twist and turn me, bait and burn me 
Smile and send me to oblivion 
Breathe and bathe me, just be and save me 
Know I'm just here to the left of you 
And when there's only the dark 
I can still see the light in your eyes Dream on, fill me up now 
I bet you know just how loud I can scream, don't you let me go 
Feed on infatuation 
Swallow, just one taste of all that I am, all I have to show Twist and turn me, bait and burn me 
Smile and send me to oblivion 
Breathe and bathe me, just be and save me 
Know I'm just here to the left of you 
And when there's only he dark I can still see the light 
When there's only the dark you are always the light
