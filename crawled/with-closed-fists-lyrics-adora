The cheap politician got his way, and there's nothing you can do 
His appealing nature wants to play, and he's ready to pursue So take a step back 'cause you want nothing to do with this 
Single-handedly proving, and constantly moving with closed fists This is nothing new the second time around, 'cause he's said it all before 
Ever changing, nothing new this time around 
His lies swept up on the bedroom floor So take a step back 'cause you want nothing to do with this 
Single-handedly proving, and constantly moving with closed fists 
Single-handedly proving, and constantly moving with closed fists His bags are packed full of broken pride, and it's just another day 
It's just another day 
So take a step back, take a step back away from me Shot down from the watch tower, longing for new-found power 
'Cause that politician got his way, and there's nothing you can do So take a step back 'cause you want nothing to do with this 
Single-handedly proving, and constantly moving with closed fists His bags are packed full of broken pride, and it's just another day 
He said, it's just another day
