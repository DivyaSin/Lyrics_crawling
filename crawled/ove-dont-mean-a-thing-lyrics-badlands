Oh, fuck me When evening calls 
And the black night's down on me You give your love 
For which I take Blinded by the time I know 
This lonely old boy's spinnin' `round 
Time don't wait for me no more 
Love don't mean a thing without you girl, yeah This love I know, yeah 
She's tearin' me down inside 
This babe I know, I know, I know 
And don't make no mistake Blinded by the time I know 
This lonely old boy's spinnin' `round 
Time don't wait for me no more 
Love don't mean a thing without you girl, yeah My touch is in your eyes 
Your fire burns inside me 
Your healing hands can turn me around 
Gonna turn I know (Solo) My touch is in your eyes 
Your fire burns inside me 
Your healing hands can turn me around 
Gonna turn I know Love don't mean a thing without you girl 
Love don't mean a thing without ya by my side 
Love don't mean a thing without you girl, yeah Love don't mean a thing without you, yeah
