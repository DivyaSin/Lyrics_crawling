It was pouring rain on a Saturday 
And kid brother ran through the door 
Hed just turned five years old and he wore his own 
Mini-football outfit from the toy store Hed been watchin TV - but his favorite team 
Had taken a loss on the football field 
Saw his heroes fall, started crying and all 
I couldnt figure out the big deal 
But I said Hey Little Man 
Dont cry little man 
You dont have to worry about these things 
Your world wont be lost cuz of your sad feelings 
Hey Little Man 
Its all in the plan 
And tears will not bring any harm 
But for now youll be safe in my arms 
My Little Man It was Friday night, and I saw a light 
From kid brothers room up ahead 
Hed just turned ten years old - and he wore his own 
Pee-wee football outfit even to bed He was down on his knees and he prayed for his team 
And maybe just once he would carry the ball 
He started to cry, left me wondering why 
I didnt understand it at all 
I whispered Hey Little Man 
Dont cry Little Man 
You dont have to worry about these things 
The game wont be lost cuz youve got these feelings 
Hey Little Man 
Its all in the plan 
Let your prayrs and dreams fill your head 
Til then youll be safe in this bed 
My Little Man It was pouring rain on a Saturday 
And kid brother came round to me 
Hed just turned eighteen years old and he wore his own 
High school football outfit from the town league He was recruited and seen by his favorite team 
Im sure they could see the fire in his eyes 
But he started to cry when he told me goodbye 
I didnt even understand why 
And I thought Hey Little Man 
Dont cry Little Man 
You dont have to worry about these things 
The world can be yours if you keep believin 
Hey Little Man 
Just follow His Plan 
And pray for the life of your dreams 
Little brother you always will be 
My Little Man It was pouring rain on a Saturday 
And kid brother was there on TV 
Hed just turned twenty years old and he wore his own 
Real football outfit from the big leagues Hes now living the dream - with his favorite team 
And Dad and I cheer when he runs with the ball 
When he scores with a smile - he looks up to the sky 
Im finally understanding it all 
And I say Hey Little Man 
Youre now a big man 
You no longer worry about these things 
The world now is yours cuz you lived believin 
Hey Little Man 
Your prayer will stand 
And your fifteen-year dream is at hand 
Now a boy has the life that he planned 
My Little Man Now a boy has the life that he planned 
My Little Man
