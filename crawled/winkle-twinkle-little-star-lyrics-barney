Twinkle twinkle little star 
How I wonder what you are 
Up above the world so high 
Like a diamond in the sky 
Star light 
Star bright 
The first star I see tonight 
I wish I may, I wish I might 
Have the wish I wish tonight Twinkle twinkle little star 
How I wonder what you are 
I have so many wishes to make 
But most of all is what I state 
So just wonder 
That I've been dreaming of 
I wish that I can have owe her enough 
I wish I may, I wish I might 
Have the dream I dream tonight Ooo baby Twinkle twinkle little star 
How I wonder what you are 
I want a girl who'll be all mine 
And wants to say that I'm her guy 
Someones sweet that's for sure 
I want to be the one she's looking for 
I wish I may, I wish I might 
Have the girl I wish tonight Ooo baby Twinkle twinkle little star 
How I wonder what you are 
Up above the world so high 
Like a diamond in the sky 
Star light 
Star bright 
The first star I see tonight 
I wish I may, I wish I might 
Have the wish I wish tonight
