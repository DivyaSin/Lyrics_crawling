[First Verse] 
Mrs. Ramil 
She is in love 
With the receptionist 
Looking fine and acting tough 
She's got a crush 
But she keeps it way too hushed 
Yes, she will blush 
But her silence is not enough [Pre-Chorus] 
She's a Balkan speaking Serbian 
And I know she knows English too 
So I wish she'd just tell him 
God please tell him 
Give him a good talkin' to 
But she won't budge 
She will not break 
Missing out on love is her mistake 
It's a piece of cake 
Just go on take it 
If it's love you've got to make it [Chorus] [Second Verse] 
Mrs. Ramil 
She is so shy 
By lighted charcoal 
There's a sparkle in her eye 
Lights up the sky 
At three a.m. at night 
The nights are white 
I think it is a sign [Pre-Chorus] 
But she's a Balkan speaking Serbian 
And I know she knows English too 
So I wish she'd just tell him 
God please tell him 
Give him a good talkin' to 
But she won't budge 
She will not break 
Missing out on love is her mistake 
It's a piece of cake 
Just go on take it 
If it's love you've got to make it [Chorus] [Outro] 
And if you really want love 
You've got to chase it from the start 
But you cannot be greedy 
You've got to take it part by part 
Cause it's a gradual process 
It's a flick of your wrist 
It's a ring on your finger 
Or it's your first kiss 
It's what you want only if you will 
Mrs. Ramil 
It's what you want only if you will 
Mrs. Ramil 
It's what you want only if you will 
Mrs. Ramil
