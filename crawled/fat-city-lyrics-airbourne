Midnight bite at the Cherry 
So sweet is the juice 
I'm free from the chains 
And all the dogs are runnin' loose Well, I'm chasin' my tail and I'm losin' my head 
Yeah, I'm fallin' down 
I can't feel my legs 
I'm on my way to a better place Fat City, juiced up and ready 
Fat City, I'm already gone 
Fat City, juiced up and ready 
Battered and bruised, I keep a rollin' on, rollin' on Saddle sore at the pony 
From the black rockin' chair 
Ooh, I get what I need 
I'm already there, ooh yeah I've been ridin' so hard, I drank all the dregs 
Yeah, she's fallin' down 
She can't feel her legs, ooh yeah 
We're on our way to a better place, look out Fat City, juiced up and ready 
Fat City, I'm already gone 
Fat City, juiced up and ready 
Battered and bruised, I keep a rollin' on 
Rollin' on, a rollin' on 
I keep a rollin' on, I keep a rollin' on, oh yeah Fat City, juiced up and ready 
Fat City, I'm already gone 
Fat City, juiced up and ready 
Battered and bruised, I keep a rollin' on
