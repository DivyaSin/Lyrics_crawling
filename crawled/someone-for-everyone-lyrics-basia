There is always someone there for everyone 
You might not believe it now, but give it time 
Then say it clearly, say it straight 
Forget you know this language well 
You cannot hide away from love 
Though you can run this could be a revolution 
This could be love's resurrection one door shuts, another opens there is someone there for you who doesn't mind 
One who knows - the past is better left behind 
Dreams enormous dreams 
And one who dares enough to live again 
?cause trying hard and falling down is not a crime this could be revolution 
This could be love's resurrection one door shuts, another opens
