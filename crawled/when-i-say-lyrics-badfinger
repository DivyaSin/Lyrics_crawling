What you are is what I see 
What I see is what I want it to be 
When I say I love you 
What I mean is I really do [Chorus] 
I'm not the one who'll give you everything you need 
But what I mean is that I'll try 
I can't deny that I've been burning inside 
For all the things I'll never see So come on, be yourself, nothing else 
Who could ask for any more 
And you know, they all love you 
What is more, I really do [Chorus]
