The maps have been burned. 
The north star has gone to sleep 
we cannot return. 
Hunting us down 
are the fallen beasts. 
As the sun starts slowly rising in the east. Lost in the shroud of the trees. 
An efforts made for help, 
only formalities. As the paths carry on 
and the hunters keep seeking. 
They'll never find us as 
the daylight is leaking. 
Lifting the darkness off the ground. 
Picking their feet right off the ground. 
Mmm. A sunrise is flaming in the air. 
Sparking a light and 
dancing in our hair. 
the rangers do their best to 
track us down. 
But those who enter here, 
are never found. Caught in a day dreamy-mist. 
A fairytale like and eternal bliss. As the paths carry on 
and the hunters keep seeking. 
They'll never find us as 
the daylight is leaking. 
Lifting the darkness off the ground. 
Picking their feet right off the ground. 
Mmm. I don't care if we make it out. 
I'll stay here with you 
under a spell. 
We can hide here as well. 
Make a life. 
A silent life. As the paths carry on 
and the hunters keep seeking. 
They'll never find us as 
the daylight is leaking. 
Lifting the darkness off the ground. 
Picking their feet right off the ground. 
Mmm.
