Why should I wait until tomorrow 
It's already been, I've already seen all the sorrow that's in store 
I will beg or steal or borrow 
Hold on tighter to all that sorrow tries to choir Oh and if I change my tune 
Maybe I won't be bound to do 
And I won't be bound to do 
And I won't be bound to If you must beg, steal or borrow 
To hold on tighter to all that sorrow tries to choir And if I change my tune 
They think she'll be fine by June 
In a world where ice turns into stars 
What a life on Mars I can't wait until tomorrow 
No I've already been, already seen all the sorrow that's in store They'll tell you anything 
(They'll tell you anything) 
They'll tell you anything 
(They'll tell you anything) 
Just to get you in the car 
(Get you in the car) 
She'll tell them anything 
(Anything) 
You've told them everything 
(Everything) 
You've taken it too far 
(Taken it too far) What a life on Mars
