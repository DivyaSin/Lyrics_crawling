Since I can remember 
I've been dreaming 
Dreams have been 
Loved by everyone 
I was a girl 
In my own world 
The only friends I had 
Then were my family 
I've heard people's 
Eyes were never gleaming 
Laughter is the first step to success 
Never the less 
I couldn't waste 
And told them one day 
You'll be idolizing me Number one, number one 
I am gonna touch the sun as 
Number one 
I'm gonna be a star Number one, Number one 
Top of and below all the chances 
Number one 
I'm gonna raise your heart I dance and loose maybe illusion 
You don't have loose 
If you don't win 
I'll have a song 
A beautiful song 
Before the bird will 
Sing it with me 
Won't be long Number one, number one 
I am gonna touch the sun as 
Number one 
I'm gonna be a star Number one, number one 
Top of and below all the chances 
Number one 
I'm gonna raise your heart Number one, number one 
I am gonna touch the sun as 
Number one 
I'm gonna be a star
