I'm walking wounded again 
I'm walking wounded again 
I've got gravel in my pockets from the places I've been 
And the soles in my shoes, they are paper-thin 
I'm walking wounded 
like a fox in a snare 
I feel respected, caught up in your plan Now I'm walking wounded again 
Don't know how much longer this can maintain 
Let me go into the darkness 
Just let me learn from all the things there Because I'm walking wounded again 
I'm walking wounded again 
It's been forty days and forty nights of bad road 
If the bible is right: the world will explode 
I crossed Obama, Osama and Saddam Hussein 
I took some cars, some busses, even hopped the train And now I'm walking wounded again 
Don't know how much longer this can maintain 
Let me go into the darkness 
Just let me learn from all the things there 
Don't stop, don't stop living in the red 
I said: Don't stop, don't stop living in the red 
Because I'm crawling to target 
Because I'm walking wounded Gravel in my pockets from the places I've been 
And the soles in my shoes they are paper-thin 
I'm walking wounded 
Like a fox in a snare 
I feel respected, caught up in your plan Now I'm walking wounded again 
Don't know how much longer this can maintain 
Let me go into the darkness 
Just let me learn from all the things there 
Don't stop, don't stop living in the red 
I said: Don't stop don't stop living in the red 
Because I'm crawling to target 
Because I'm walking wounded
