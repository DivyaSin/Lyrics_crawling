I must be brave 
Come, come what may 
Can I be saved? 
Is there a way at the opera tonight? I've made my peace 
No chance for peace 
I hold no grudge 
I'll end this grudge I'm gonna sing 
I'll stain the streets 
My final song 
At the opera tonight They'll run with blood 
At the opera tonight 
One more hit for the show 
Make it fast Take it slow 
One more hit of the glow 
Go get cut 
For tonight's show Tonight I set the stage 
Tonight we set the stage 
My greatest play 
My greatest face All plans are laid 
My greatest rage 
Pavi gets laid 
All debts are paid At the opera tonight 
Repo man, repo man 
At the opera tonight 
Repo man, repo man Repo man, come take my eyes 
At the opera tonight 
Repo man, repo man 
Repo man, my eyes 
At the opera tonight
