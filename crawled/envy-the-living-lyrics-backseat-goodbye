Well, it's Friday night, what the fuck are we doing here? 
If I didn't have this song stuck in my head 
I'm sure my thoughts would be a little more clear No excuses this time, gonna keep it in drive 
So don't fuss or fight, we're gonna live like our buried souls 
Have been brought back to life And I know I've said it at least a thousand times before 
But please just keep your mouth shut 
Let's live for once, oh, let's live for once Well, the streetlights are in line 
And they're not moving for anybody anywhere 
So I guess we'll take our business elsewhere for now And when they go out we'll pour like rain through the streets 
And light this town up like a goddamn miracle 
They'll wish they had never seen, yeah And I know I said it at least a thousand times before 
But please just keep your mouth shut 
Let's live for once Well, they took everything and told you that you couldn't go 
They took everything and told you that you couldn't care 
(It can't hurt if you don't know) 
Told you that you couldn't go 
(It won't hurt if you don't know) 
Told you that you couldn't go (It can't hurt if you don't know) 
Told you that you couldn't go 
(It won't hurt if you don't know) 
They took everything and told you that you couldn't go Let's live again, let's live again 
Let's live again like we used to 
Let's live again like we used to
