So let the frozen sands crumble, crumble and fall 
Yeah that's all right, I don't mind at all 
Well let it all tumble right into the sea 
Yeah that's all right, that's fine with me 
Since you came down the line 
I don't sleep at night 
I got one thing on my mind 
And so every day, every night 
I wanna be with you 
I wanna be with you 
That's what I wanna do 
'cause you're so out of sight 
I wanna be with you 
I wanna be with you 
That's what I wanna do Well I lost my job at the texaco station 
Instead of pumpin' gas I dreamed of you 
I got thrown out of my house 
I got such a bad reputation 
'cause all I wanna do is be seen with you They gave me my pay and said walk 
I don't care what they say 
Go ahead and let 'em all talk 
Until the world falls apart 
I wanna be with you 
I wanna be with you 
That's what I wanna do 
Until they rip out my heart 
I wanna be with you 
I wanna be with you 
That's what I wanna do Bedtime, hold tight, love me just a little bit 
All night, a little bit more 
Tonight, tonight ... 
Oh I don't know, I don't know 
I don't understand ityou ain't pretty at all 
But I come when you whisper 
I run when you call 
And baby I can't stand it 
And baby that's all 
Ridin' by your side in my car 
Oh, oh I wanna be with you 
I wanna be with you 
Darlin' don't you know 
Oh, oh I wanna be with you 
I wanna be with you 
Because I love you so
