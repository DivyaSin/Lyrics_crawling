Headin' for the islands 
We're ready man and packed to go 
When we hit those islands 
There's gonna be a big hello 
Diggin' all the sunshine 
It's easy not to say goodbye 
Bye bye bye Headin' for the islands 
Hey yeah, we're really flyin' high Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home Walkin' down the beaches 
Tomorrow mornin' we'll be there 
Golden sandy beaches 
Say, I can smell the breezy air 
One more celebration 
And then we're ready for goodbyes 
Bye, bye, bye Walkin' down the beaches 
Hey yeah, we're really flyin' high Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home Go back home, go back home 
Go back home, go back home 
Go back home, go back home 
Go back home, go back home Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home 
Gotta go home, home, home
