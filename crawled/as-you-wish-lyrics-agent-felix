cant close my eyes 
ashamed I let you down tonight 
I couldn't find the words to say 
so I guess I'll have to wait 
until your sound asleep and then I'll say 
that I'm sorry you should never have to be 
disappointed with me in any way 
not when you deserve everything a fallen star 
fell in my arms tonight 
I'm afraid I wont get it right 
cause your beautiful 
and all I have to give 
are the pathetic words I wrote in this song please understand you do everything for me 
there's not a second that goes by that I don't think 
I love you more than anything 
so close your eyes 
I hope you sleep ok tonight 
just know that I'd bleed if you asked me to 
I swear anything for you
