please wait 
you have been the only light 
have you ever felt like you could not continue without someone? this feeling of wishing to be in his arms 
to be kissed in the moon light this can go on forever 
where you stop is where i stop 
i am waiting for you i am scared not of being alone 
i am scared of being without you 
i am scared of not hearing your voice
