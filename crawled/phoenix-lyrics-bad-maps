Change, it comes and goes 
Its something that youve always known 
a place to call your home 
Its something youve lost all your own The boats on the water 
Envy planes in the sky 
But from the bottom of the ocean 
Boats seem to fly 
So dont lose all your hope 
Know that youre not alone Your journey met its end 
You learned what you needed 
The same place it began Its never too late to crawl from your ashes 
Its never too late to relapse from relapses 
But when those liars gave you up, we still hadnt 
We were the ones who passed your cup 
Because we know that youre gonna fly You consummated treason 
With a love for your lies 
When reflected by the season 
You begged for reprise 
But God has let you go 
His indifference marked by rainbows But I wont let you go 
I wont let you go Its never too late to crawl from your ashes 
Its never too late to relapse from relapses 
But when those liars gave you up, we still hadnt 
We were the ones who passed your cup 
Because we know that youre gonna fly One by one, we counted up our losses 
Made the choice to count them all forgotten 
Relapse tends to justify another chance to learn to fly But youre never too great to fall back to ashes
