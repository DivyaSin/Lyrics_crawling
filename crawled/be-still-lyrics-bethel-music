Stop thinking stop thinking so much 
and just let go Be still my soul and rest

in my weakness your strength is perfect For You alone are God, there will be no other 
And You have won my heart more than any other 
So I will give it all 'cause you gave it all for me x2 Gave it all for me yeah Bless the Lord oh my soul cries out
