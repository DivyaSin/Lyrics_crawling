I like it when you're watching me 
You grind your teeth 
I like it when we're up against the wall 
I like it when you look at me 
You still say please 
And the way you can't say no It's late at night she's at my window 
(I'm a fool) 
She's drunk again and wants to take it out on me 
(You know you do) 
She never says goodbye 
But what we did plays in my mind 
All over you I like it when you're watching me 
You grind your teeth 
I like it when we're up against the wall 
I like it when you talk to me 
You still say please 
And the way you can't say no 
You take me places I've never been 
When I keep on falling 
You show me things that I've never seen 
My dirty little thing The sun is up she's out my window 
(now you're gone) 
The sky will fall and I know she'll be back again 
(I know you will) 
She takes control of me 
And always gives me what I need 
Again and again I like it when you're watching me 
You grind your teeth 
I like it when we're up against the wall 
I like it when you talk to me 
You still say please 
And the way you can't say no 
You take me places I've never been 
When I keep on falling 
You show me things that I've never seen 
My dirty little thing Tie me up and take control 
I know you like what's going on 
I wanna see how far you'll go 
I like when you strip me down 
You wear me out 
You take me to another place like no one else I like it when you're watching me 
You grind your teeth 
I like it when we're up against the wall 
I like it when you talk to me 
You still say please 
And the way you can't say no 
You take me places I've never been 
When I keep on falling 
You take me places I've never been 
When I keep on falling 
You show me things I've never seen 
My dirty little thing 
Dirty little thing
