TELL YOUR STORY Another Saturday night 
Alone with no one to kiss 
You're there crying and speechless from the pain 
A story's there in your eyes 
But not yet there on your lips 
Aren't you weary of playing games? Hey! I was once just like you 
Wondrin' what was my choice 
Never thought I could say what's in my heart 
I had just found my truth 
But still was missing my voice 
Thought the secrets were just a part of the Fear, but the world should hear that 
You know who you are... so... Tell the world who you are 
Don't be silent now 
Say it loud, say it proud 
Tell your story Don't deny what's inside 
It's alright now 
Bring it into the light 
It's your story Truth will guide the words you speak 
Let it set you free 
Tell your story now 
Tell your story now So many people around 
But they don't know who you are 
They don't understand what you're fightin' for 
It's time to stand up and shout 
Time to open your mouth 
Dontcha hide whatcha feel no more Cuz it's fear, that keeps you runnin' 
Runnin' from the truth Shout as loud as you can 
Don't be quiet now 
Say "I can be who I am" 
Tell your story And if you're scared and alone 
Dontcha worry now 
There's only one thing you own 
It's your story You got just one life to live 
Don't live it in fear 
Tell your story now 
Tell your story now 
Tell your story now Hey, will you keep your voice from finally bein' heard 
Just say what you know in your heart 
And you will find the words Tell the world who you are 
Don't be silent now 
Say it loud, say it proud 
Tell your story Don't deny what's inside 
It's alright now 
Bring it into the light 
It's your story Shout as loud as you can 
Don't be quiet now 
Say "I can be who I am"
