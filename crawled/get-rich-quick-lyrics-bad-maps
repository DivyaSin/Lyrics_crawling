Heart invested with little bouts of time vested 
I was looking for returns on investment 
But its hard to get rich quick Oh, and I hastened to beat the clock 
I tried to race it 
Swooning words were copied and pasted 
But you cant fabricate it Heart hollowed 
A tasteless pill of pride swallowed 
The pasts the hardest act you can follow 
But its because I spent life quick Oh and I tested the theory that a hearts arrested 
Scrumptious bits of passion ingested 
That felt like shit when digested Did you think it would be easier 
To live your life behind a window? 
Did you think it would be easier 
To risk heartbreak as a widow? I always thought it would be easier 
To search for better weather Did you think it would be easier 
To live your life behind a window? 
Did you think it would be easier 
To risk heartbreak as a widow? 
(I couldve gone back but I wanted more 
I dont need to be who I was before 
Lifes at its best when you brave the storms 
You dont need to be who you were before) I always thought it would be easier 
To search for better weather
