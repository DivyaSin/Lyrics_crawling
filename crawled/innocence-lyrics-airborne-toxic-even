Well, I lost my innocence today 
I could feel her in my bones 
My bones, my bones, my bones 
My blood, my blood, my blood, my blood And I woke up, tired, scared and sad 
Soaked, drained, I felt so bad 
Today, today, today 
What you still, you still, you still, you still 
Won't you say, you say, you say, you say 
What you feel, you feel, you feel, you feel 
Which is nothing but hollow feelings, yeah 
I can, done, I just don't care And forget happiness, I'm fine 
I'll forget everything in time 
I swear I didn't know, 
You know me, how I can't let go 
And we're not guts, we're just hacks 
All that life amongst the cracks 
The scars, the siege that breaks 
The ugliest scene, the worst mistakes 
And everywhere I see her face 
Such a beautiful child, such an awful waste 
And there's no innocence like hers 
Just emptiness and nerves And this light from the window of my car 
She'll never see it, oh my God 
I was so surprised, it blew up in my face 
Lord, I lost my nerve, oh my God... 
Oh my God, oh my... God
