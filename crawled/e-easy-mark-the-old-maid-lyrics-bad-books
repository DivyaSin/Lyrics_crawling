Some men collapse at the racetrack 
Their wrong and beat up, their eyes black 
Others wilt in casinos 
Roll dice and piss away speedboats 
Some dissolve into bar stools 
Scratched off in boxes and playoff pools 
I spent myself on a psychic 
I lost my way and a friend said she would find it 
Man, we were wrong. 
Man, we were wrong. 
I asked for the future, 
She only sang me a song. Some men they go make their own luck 
Grow fat from feeding on lame ducks 
The easy mark and the old maid 
The invalid and the ingrate 
Others wait for that high sign 
Some holy hoax in the tree-line 
Me, I'm counting my canned food 
Bunkered down waiting out our slingshot moods 
But what if I'm wrong? 
What if I'm wrong? 
I'll open my doors up 
People, come sweep me along. Eyes are fixed and my palms are spread 
Dissonance floats my shipwrecked head 
God sleeps in the Gaza strip 
And man alone's left alone to live with it 
The coin-flip faith of the optimist 
It's beginners luck in a sewing kit 
What's to do when there is no fix 
On the unflinching ambivalence? But you say that's wrong 
Hopeless and wrong 
We re-thread your needle, 
You say, "God, play along."
