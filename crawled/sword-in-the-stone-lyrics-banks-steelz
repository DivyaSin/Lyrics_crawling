The stars are bright 
So let the wine flow 
We'll still cover the clouds 
With drinks and [?] 
So dance all night 
Show your lover the world 
With the sunrise, it's ready to go 
Ready to go 
Ready to go 
Ready to go 
Hey yo (ready to go) 
Hey yo 
Hey yo Gangsta still supremacy 
Take it to extremities 
Always got our remedy 
Microphone is [?] 
Rapper's skills legendary 
Bust a nut on these sluts only cause it's necessary 
Polo-wearing,never sharing, pots with bitches I be bagging 
Undefeated , quite conceited, many times y'all catch be bragging 
Can a motherfuckers walk with our pants sagging? 
Pilotin' this plane, y'all up on my bandwagon 
Fire breathing dragon, disast'rous, microphone abusin' 
Mix my point the lyrics with beat, life, hip-hop, and music 
Cruising in a lamborghini 
Sipping on the dry martini 
Real niggas slow when they thought they saw a lamborghini 
My lover got caught inside your limestone 
My mind has gone off course five time zones 
Bobby snake took the quake of a drum track 
Make no mistake, after this you gonna jump back 
Jump back, jump back 
Nigga, jump back 
Got enough funk and skunk to fill a dump truck 
Pump up your fists to this or you get lumped up 
Immaculate conception 
You thought you had a life but that was just my reflection 
I'm circumcised, thoughts I pray through protection 
Sterilized mind, I'm immune to infections 
So make a u-turn 
Before you burn 
You germ 
I don't give a fuck what you earn 
This is hip hop 
Su-su-super sperm 
Get 'em out, get 'em out, get 'em outta here (banks & steelz) 
Take 'em back, take 'em back, take 'em outta here (banks & steelz) 
Put your motherfucking hands up in the air 
I said put your fucking hands in the air 
(Sword, stone) 
(Sword, stone) 
(Sword, stone) Samurai sword spitter 
Bigger altenator - detonator orchestrator 
The heats on the microwave, dark raiders take a shade Parked up in the valley, the phantom put in town's way get out with valleys 
I'll take your girl inside, checkers in the valley, nick says she a stallion 
The half pump with 40 gallons 
They see me are 2 parked up in park view 
Nin drummin out, work out, I can't slouch 
Women see the muscles, reflection on the couch 
I'm billy rayon 
Toyota squat, no key gas station and gas 
[?] (Sword, stone) 
(Sword, stone) [?] The bitches I be bangin 
Let the music play, slow down the gunplay 
Let you move the 6k, [?] you one day 
With just words 
[?] 
I love myself, how can I [?] 
I face everyday calamities 
It's calm at the swarm [?] on a pond 
For forty-eight straight without a yawn 
[?], That's checkmate 
[?] 
Bobby steelz got a seat or swing on the lawn 
And a pool in the back 
[?] 
I was good at flipping packs 
Things kept coming back 
[?] 
[?] 
[?] 
I [?] then I outrose my classmen 
Hip hop music, I love it with a passion 
It ain't nothing like hip hop music 
We like it cause we choose it 
[?] 
I got you in puzzle cube like a rubik's 
Then after way when you've retired 
Hot and records you've inspired 
Bank & steelz, banks and steelz 
Then after way when you've retired 
Hot and records you've inspired 
Bank & steelz, banks and steelz Get 'em out, get 'em out, get 'em outta here 
(Banks & steelz) 
Take 'em back, take 'em back, take 'em outta here 
(Banks & steelz) 
Put your motherfucking hands up in the air 
I said put your fucking hands in the air Banks & steelz 
(Sword, stone) 
Banks & steelz 
(Sword, stone) 
(Sword, stone)
