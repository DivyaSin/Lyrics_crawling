Ran away from home when I was seventeen 
To be with you on the California coast 
Drinking margaritas all night in the old cantina 
Out on, out on the California coast Don't think that I'm ungrateful 
And don't look so morose 
Adios, adios We never really made it baby 
But we came pretty close 
Adios, adios Going up north where the hills are winter green 
I got to leave you on the California coast 
Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner 
Than, than the California Coast Our dreams of endless summer 
Were just too grandiose 
Adios, adios And I miss the blood red sunset 
But I miss you the most 
Adios, adios 
Adios, adios 
Adios, adios
