In the morning when the moon is out to trust You will see me at the time I love the best. 
Watching rainbows play on sunlights Pools of water 
ice stream cold nights. 
In the morning 
it is the morning of my life. In the daytime I will meet you as before You will find me waiting by the ocean floor. 
Building castles in the shifting sands In a world that no-one understands. 
In the morning 
it is the morning of my life. In the morning of my life The minutes takes so long to drift away. 
Please be patient with your life It's only morning and you've still to live your day. In the evening I will fly to the moon To the topright hand corner of the ceiling in my room. 
Where we'll stay until the sun shines Another day to swing on the clothes lines. 
May I be yawning 
it is the morning of my life It is the morning of my life. 
In the morning 
in the morning 
in the morning.
