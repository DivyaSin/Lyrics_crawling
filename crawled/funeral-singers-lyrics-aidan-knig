Late at night in the basement 
singing along, hoping for some magic 
who knows what power's left in the words we sing to each other 
who knows 
stretch it out the invisible like parking tickets on the dash of the car 
leave them one by one The flags waving up on the vane 
desperate measures, different minds 
If we fall together they see me cry 
Nothing can hold them, at least not tonight. I know there's power left in the way we sing to each other 
becalm the darkened room for I'm the funeral singer 
fold back the visual like lenses focused on the light at the end 
leave them one by one The flags waving up on the vane 
desperate measures, different plans 
If we fall together they see me cry 
Nothing can hold them, at least not tonight.
