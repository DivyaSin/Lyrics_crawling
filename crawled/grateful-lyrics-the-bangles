I carry you up in my arms 
I hear you sing yourself to sleep 
The sky opens up over your room 
You sail into your moonlight dreams 
So much more than we can see 
So much more than we can see. All we are and all we need is 
All we are and all we need is 
All we are is all we need to be 
Grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Oh, grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Oh, grateful (all we are and all we need). This guitar can sing these songs 
Changes me instantly 
Love is too simple a word 
For here comes the sun in the morning 
Suddenly happiness 
Comes rollin' up from inside me. All we are and all we need is 
All we are and all we need is 
All we are is all we need to be 
Grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Oh, grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Oh, grateful (all we are and all we need). Carry you up in my arms 
I hear you sing yourself to sleep 
The sky opens up over your room 
You sail into your moonlight dreams 
So much more than we can see 
There's so much more than we can see. All we are and all we need is 
All we are and all we need is 
All we are is all we need to be 
Grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Oh, grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Grateful (all we are is all we need to be) 
Oh, grateful. All we are and all we need is 
All we are and all we need is 
All we are is all we need to be 
Grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Oh, grateful (all we are and all we need is) 
Grateful (all we are is all we need to be) 
Oh, grateful. All we are and all we need is 
All we are and all we need is 
All we are is all we need to be 
All we are and all we need is 
All we are and all we need is 
All we are is all we need to be.
