[Verse 1: Bashy] 
Look, I don't smoke the reefa 
Back in the day, Aliz was a creeper 
I used to rock Patrick Cox and Ben Sherman like a geezer 
I was a little man, chocolate boy and the girls knew the sugar was sweeter 
See everybody like "Pow!", I was like "oi!", and that'll be my summer of love 
Fly by like I had a love bug 
I was some sort of Romeo, she said you're no good for me, but I'm never gonna let you go 
It was doolally, and that's straight from the heart 
Back in the day the raves were so cold, you would have thought it was an eskimo dance [Hook: Jareth] 
Before there was grime, the only songs we would find were taped from the radio to memorise 
Recalling all these memories 
I can recall all those memories 
DJ playing the songs we're feeling 
And we won't stop until he's finished 
Although I sound a little off-key 
These are the songs we used to sing 
So let the DJ play all the songs we're feeling 
Cause we won't stop until he's finished 
Although I sound a little off-key 
These are the songs we used to sing [Verse 2: Bashy] 
Re-re-wind, when the crowd said bo-- 
We used to celebrate life 
Now you need a little bit of luck to make it through the night 
I see a man get -- ooah, ooah -- right before my eyes 
Tales of the hood, back the raves were twice as nice 
Bought History, Moschino jeans, those were good times 
No CD, tape the music in a queue for a rave, like I've gotta get through this 
No BBs, just a Nokia phone, pay as you go 
No cab fare, we had to catch the bus home 
I used to roll with a heartless crew, but we were so solid 
When I was at college, those were the best days, just being honest [Hook: Jareth]
