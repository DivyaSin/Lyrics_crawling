Pour me, little rivers from my hands 
Pool at the bottom of the stairs 
My face, all the cities in my eyes 
Doves in the skies Oooh the Crackagen The rain, water came from fathers eyes 
He was made of stone 
Glorious, and watch as the curtain came down and wet the hungry rabbits 
Flooding the land My heart, oh the twist of cruel cokeglen(?), to bring me free 
Dry eyes by the sun the waters rise 
Dirt will crack again 
Dirt will crack again
