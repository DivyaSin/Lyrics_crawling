I never knew that I was standing in the rain 
My mind was wandering back to you again 
There's a thousand miles between us 
Though it feels a thousand more 'cause tonight I sleep alone I never realized how time could drag on 
I never thought about how long the days are 
And I never heard my heart beat 
Till the first night you were gone then I knew I was alone When I close my eyes and I think of you 
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so blue 
When I need you here, all I do 
I close my eyes and I'm with you I could see miracles, they wouldn't mean a thing 
I don't want memories, if you're not part of them 
Any photograph without you would never grace my wall 
I don't wanna stand alone When I close my eyes and I think of you 
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so blue 
When I need you here, all I do 
I close my eyes and I'm with you, oh, yeah Then I see you there and I visualize 
Both of us touching, both of us searching 
Then I hold you here, I can feel you now 
I'm lost in the moment, lost in the moment And I can't let go 'cause I won't let go 
I will keep holding, I will keep holding 
When I clear my eyes to wipe away my tears 
Everything shatters, everything's gone When I close my eyes and I think of you 
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so blue 
When I need you here, all I do 
I close my eyes and I'm with you
