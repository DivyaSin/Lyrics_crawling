I am the ever-forsaken bastard child of your disease 
Your dead and abandoned 
Strung up for all of you to see 
Naked and screaming 
So beautiful profane 
The essence of bleeding 
The scars that bare my name 
I am the hatred incarnate 
I am the choked and dying screams 
I am the sickness inside you 
Longing for This is the hate that surrounds you 
Pray for the endless touch of death 
Now burning inside you 
I am the scars of your disease I am eternal damnation 
The bastard child of your disease 
The slow suffocation 
Strung up for everyone to see Sever the feeling 
The mirror of your shame 
The darkest temptation 
Your scars that bear my name 
I am the endless procession 
I am the poison for the weak 
I am your loveless desire, longing for This is the hate that surrounds you 
Pray for the endless touch of death 
Now burning inside you 
I am the scars of your disease I am the ever-forsaken bastard child of your disease 
Your dead and abandoned 
Strung up for all to view This is the hate that surrounds you 
Pray for the endless touch of death 
Now burning inside you 
I am the scars of your disease
