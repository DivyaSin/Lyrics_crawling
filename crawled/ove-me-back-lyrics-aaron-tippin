Baby, you and me underneath the steeple 
Two I do's and a half a dozen people 
I can see it all plain as day, come on baby, don't be afraid 
You can make a dream come true just like that 
All you gotta do is love me back All you gotta do is love me back 
And I'll hand you the world on a string 
I'll throw in the moon and the stars and for that 
I'll only ask one thing, love me back No baby, you might think I'm jumping to conclusions 
And to tell you the truth that's exactly what I'm doing 
I can't afford to waste no time, I've got forever on my mind 
You've already got my heart and that's a fact 
Now all you gotta do is love me back All you gotta do is love me back 
And I'll hand you the world on a string 
I'll throw in the moon and the stars and for that 
I'll only ask one thing, love me back, girl Fate's already set the wheels in motion
