Finally I have had enough 
Just one last journey to your island 
Where there's no peace 
And some kind of useless love 
Wrapped in a whistle 
That I'll never know 
One last chance to hide upstairs 
To watch gentle lights from the window 
Maybe I'm wrong 
Maybe I've always been 
Stronger to question 
All I hold as true You've seen more than this 
Seen more than this 
Seen more than this 
Black eye 
Black eye above 
Black eye above 
Black eye above me Better free than saved 
Better free than saved 
But I'm always afraid to kill 
But I'm always afraid to kill
