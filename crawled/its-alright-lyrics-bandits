We are here for you 
just to tell you the truth 
Yeah, we know it's not new 
But we're here from the start 
And that'll break you apart - uuuhhh... You've got to light a candle to be with me 
'cause you know I am so high above you, I can't see 
But if you put a fire in your window 
I can show you where the wind blows It's allright ... Let's go, the wind has changed, it blows so wild 
Now hit the fear and sing a song, yeah, sing it like a child 
Don't you see, we are flying like batman 
We are going to the promised land It's allright ... We're on the way to somewhere, we don't know 
but the time will show us where we stand, where we can go 
Don't you see we are burning like the sunball 
Yeah, we like it when the rain falls It's allright ...
