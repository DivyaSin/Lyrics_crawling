She's got her nose in the mirror 
She's got her mind in a cloud 
I want so much to be near her 
But I'm gonna have to wait [Chorus:] 
'Til she comes - Down! 
'Til she comes down! 
'Til she comes - Down! 
'Til she comes down! She's a classy, sassy, flashy lady 
She hides her heart in a shroud 
I'd take a nod or a maybe 
But I'm gonna have to wait [Chorus] No need to talk, she won't listen 
Not 'til she come down 
She's unaware of her condition 
Not 'til she come down I think the world of her 
She makes my world go 'round 
I only wanted to love her 
But I guess I'll have to wait [Chorus] No need to talk, she won't listen 
Not 'til she come down 
She's unaware of her condition 
Not 'til she come down 
'Til she come down! 
'Til she come down! 
'Til she come down! 
'Til she come down! Down! Down! Down! Down! 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
