Maybe this was meant to be 
Maybe now it should be me 
Been dreaming of this forever 
But I'm feeling so confused 
Between you and I 
And I don't know what to do Oh, we'll stay together always 
That's the promise we made 
But suddenly it's not so clear 
And I'm being pulled both ways And it's breaking my heart, tearing me apart 
It's impossible to choose 
What if I don't try? What if I do? Everything that I've dreamed right in front of me 
If I win what would I lose 
How can I learn to live one day with what if? Oh, oh, things will never be the same 
No, no, maybe that's the price of fame 
Been waiting for this forever It's close enough for me to touch 
But if I don't go for it, I might always regret 
But is it worth us breaking up Oh, we'll stay together always 
Is the promise we made 
But suddenly it's not so clear 
And I'm being pulled both ways And it's breaking my heart, tearing me apart 
It's impossible to choose 
What if I don't try, what if I do Everything that I've dreamed right in front of me 
If I win what would I lose 
How can I learn to live wondering What if I would have tried, I could shine even fly 
I don't want to realize after it's too late no ooh 
And see it all pass me by If I could, if I don't, will I ever really know 
What the future could hold, before it slips away 
Could be the chance of a lifetime And it's breaking my heart, tearing me apart 
It's impossible to choose 
What if I don't try? What if I do? Every dream that I dream, right in front of me 
If I win, what would I lose 
How could I learn to, live wondering what if 
I'm never going to say, what if
