Don't expect too much from my poor old heart 
You can blame the unforgiving for my scars 
You might just be the best that I can find 
But I can't seem to forget the tears I've cried I don't know that I will ever trust again 
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins 
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt 
And my heart may be lost, never to be found Once upon a time I did believe 
In my true love that swept me off my feet 
Then the wind of change, swept in the rain 
And left me drowning, in my pain I don't know that I will ever love again 
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins 
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt 
And my heart may be lost, never to be found I don't know that I will ever love again 
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins 
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt I don't know that I will ever trust again 
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins 
Time has changed me, and left me full of doubt 
And my heart may be lost, never to be found
