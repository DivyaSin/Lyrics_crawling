Some girls like their animals on their bed 
But I prefer them in the wild instead 
When times get dark I'm on my hunt again 
To calm the beast that's raging in my head We're all a bit wounded, 
With a broken heart 
We're all a bit sad 
We're so lonely, lonely, lonely 
We're all a bit wounded, 
With a broken heart 
We're all a bit sad 
We're so lonely, lonely, lonely Let's get together 
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town 
That's how I get down 
That's how I get down 
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town 
That's how I get down 
That's how I get down Ooooh, oooooh, oooh ooooh Some say all things heal just give it time 
But I prefer to heal in a different style 
A nameless face that won't remember mine 
I'll open up my heart for a little while We're all a bit wounded, 
With a broken heart 
We're all a bit sad 
We're so lonely, lonely, lonely 
We're all a bit wounded, 
With a broken heart 
We're all a bit sad 
We're so lonely, lonely, lonely Let's get together 
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town 
That's how I get down 
That's how I get down 
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town 
That's how I get down 
That's how I get down So lonely, lonely lonely 
Ooooooh ooh 
So lonely, lonely lonely 
Ooooooh ooh It's a heart for rent, 
Let's get together 
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town 
That's how I get down 
That's how I get down 
It's a heart for rent in the shittiest place in town 
That's how I get down 
That's how I get down How I get down 
How I get down 
With my heart fort rent 
My heart for rent
