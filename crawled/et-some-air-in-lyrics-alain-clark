Hey there girl, here's a little song for ya 
Keep in mind that it's only my words 
I want to tell you a little bit about me I was once lost, gone from the centre 
couldn't tell what direction I was going in 
Followed the signs of another man's promise (Yeah another man's promise) Oh I turned to the outside for answers, that I knew I could only find within 
And the question grew like a cancer, making my mind and my body limp 
I wish there was a back way out 
I wish there was a back way out I turn to the mirror to find me and closed my eyes again 
then I opened a window behind me, and let some air in Held my breath as I swam to the surface 
higher I got the stronger the current 
I was so afraid that I'd drown, as I was slowly sinking back down I looked to the sky for the answers that I knew I could only find within 
And I put all my hopes in tomorrow, cause I didn't know where to begin 
I wish there was a back way out 
Wish there was a back way out I turned to the mirror to find me and closed my eyes again 
then I opened a window behind me, and let some air in Oh let some air in, let some air in (7x) I turned to the outside for answers that I knew I could only find within 
and the question grew like a cancer, making my mind and my body limp 
I wish there was a back way out 
Wish there was a back way out I turned to the mirror to find me, and closed my eyes again 
then I opened the window behind me to let some air in And I turned to the mirror to find me and closed my eyes again 
then I opened the window behind me to let some air in 
Let some air in (4x)
