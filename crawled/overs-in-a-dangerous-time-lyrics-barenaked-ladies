Don't the hours grow shorter as the days go by 
We never get to stop and open our eyes 
One minute you're waiting for the sky to fall 
The next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all 
Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time These fragile bodies of touch and taste 
This fragrant skin, this hair like lace 
Spirits open to the thrust of grace 
Never a breath you can afford to waste Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time When you're lovers in a dangerous time 
Sometimes you're made to feel as if your love's a crime 
Nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight 
Got to kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers in a dangerous time We were lovers in a dangerous time 
We were lovers in a dangerous time 
Lovers, lovers, lovers 
Oh 
Lovers in a dangerous time
