Everybody needs a place to live, 
Everybody needs a friend, 
I've been trying to find a place where maybe we could find some friends, 
You know, I know, since we're together we've been moving in similar lines, 
Conversation is a killer and maybe it's a friend sometimes, 
Sha la la la la la la 
Sha la la la la la la 
Sha la la la la la la 
La la Now I don't really need to be decided, 
I can bide my time, 
Slick sugar sweet candy beats and then some words that rhyme 
We seek to keep together, by keeping loving, living apart, 
With no mention of a future, hell you could be getting my leap ins? 
Sha la la la la la la 
Sha la la la la la la 
Sha la la la la la la 
La la Everybody needs a place to live, 
Everybody needs a home and a friend, 
So I've been trying to find a place where maybe we could find some friends, 
You know, I know, since we're together we've been moving in similar lines, 
A conversation is a killer and maybe it's a friend, 
Sha la la la la la la 
Sha la la la la la la 
Sha la la la la la la 
La la
