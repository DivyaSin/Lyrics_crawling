We gotta talk there's a rumor I heard 
It's legitimate I found out from her 
After all I've done is it what I deserve? 
Stupid me I thought our love was for sure If you did it then admit it 
Cause it's written all over you two 
Called your bluff, had enough 
I'm so over it ... You'll be sorry, but don't worry 
Cause I already found somebody new 
Tough luck, you suck 
That was such a waste... [Chorus:] 
Whatcha waiting for? 
Come over and give it to me 
Whatcha waiting for? 
I already know what you did 
Whatcha waiting for? 
Whatcha running from? 
Baby, baby, babe... 
Why ya cheating on me? Whatcha waiting for? 
I'm everything you'll never be 
I'm walking out the door 
Go ahead and crawl on your knees 
Whatcha waiting for? 
Whatcha running from? 
Baby, baby, babe... 
How could you do this to me? Don't get it twisted I need nothing from you 
So pack your bags and your Guitar Hero too 
They say that breaking up is a hard thing to do 
But oh so easy when you're dumping a fool If you did it then admit it 
Cause it's written all over your face 
Called your bluff, had enough 
I'm so over it... You'll be sorry but don't worry 
Cause you're really not that hard to replace 
Tough luck, you suck 
That was such a waste... [Chorus] La la la la la la 
That don't work anymore 
Shut your mouth, I don't care 
Game is over, over La la la la la la 
Heard it all before 
No way back, you're so whack 
You're a loner, loner Whatcha waiting for? 
You messing with my head 
I can't take this no more 
And all the things you said [Chorus] Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Why ya cheating on me? Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
How could you do this to me?
