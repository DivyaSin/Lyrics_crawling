Your broken dreams, 
Your crazy schemes, 
They always let you down. 
The things we chase, 
A hopeless race, 
You're breathless, off the ground. 
From soaring highs to crash-and-dies, 
A peace yet to be found. 
But you could spend a lifetime running. 
You could spend a lifetime running. And do you feel the fire when the flame gets hot? 
Are you living every day like it's the last you got? 
Will you step aside when it all falls down, 
And watch it burn away? 
Have a little faith when the walls cave in, 
Pray for strength to fly against the wind. 
Will you walk away when the fire gets hot, 
Or fight another 
Another day, yeah. 
Another day, yeah. Your fractured heart, 
Your disregard, 
It leaves you frozen still. A slow withdrawal 
From it all 
That keeps you unfulfilled. 
Will you spend a lifetime running? 
'Cause you could spend a lifetime running! And do you feel the fire when the flame gets hot? 
Are you living every day like it's the last you got? 
Will you step aside when it all falls down, 
And watch it burn away? 
Have a little faith when the walls cave in, 
Pray for strength to fly against the wind. 
Will you walk away when the fire gets hot, 
Or fight another 
Another day, yeah. 
Another day, yeah. Even when your heart's been broken, 
He'll be there with arms wide open. 
Be strong and his love will lead you to fight another day! 
Keep your head to the sun cause its shining
