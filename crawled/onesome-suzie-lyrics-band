Lonesome Suzie never got the breaks 
She's always losing and so she sits and cries and shakes 
It's hard just to watch her and if I touch her 
Oh, poor Suzie, I'm wonderin' what to do She just sits there, hoping for a friend 
I don't fit here but I may have a friend to lend 
Maybe I mistook her but I can't overlook her 
Must be someone who can pull her through Anyone who's felt that bad could tell me what to say 
Even if she'd just get mad 
She might be better off that way And where is all the understanding 
Her problems can't be that demanding 
Why is it she looks my way 
Every time she starts to cry?
