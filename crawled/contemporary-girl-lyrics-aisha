Intro: Contemporary Girl 
Living in this world Verse 1: The world today 
Has come a long way 
From radio to TV 
From fire to electricity 
Airplanes and jets 
Computers and the Internet 
What an entry 
Into the 21st century 
This is the world 
Of the contemporary girl 
But modernization 
Isn't for every situation 
Like in love 
What are we thinking of 
Some women take control 
Playing the dominant role 
But he's a person 
God gave him a mind 
So stop trying 
To make it up for him all the time Chorus: Contemporary Girl 
Living in this world 
Modern society 
Gave you the right to be in control 
But don't turn your back on love 
God gave you a heart and soul Verse 2: Living in this world 
Can be tough when you're a girl 
But you think you've got it under control 
And no man will take a hold 
Of you or your heart 
And that's the way 
You wanted it from the start 
You run your life 
And that of your man 
Everything is going according to plan 
But on your list of things to remember 
Love isn't on your daily agenda 
No matter what your friends say 
You shouldn't treat him that way 
Do unto others 
As you'd have done to you 
You wouldn't like it 
If he did the same to you 
Repeat chorus 
Chorus: 
Contemporary Girl 
Living in this world 
In a modern society 
That gave you the right to be in control 
Don't turn your back on love 
God gave you a heart and soul 
Rap: 
You put the con in contemporary 
With the life that you're selling 
And how long you've been trippin' 
There's no telling 
If you wanna be a feminist 
Do it on your own 
And you'll be like that movie 
Home Alone 
Why ya wanna trip 
Trying to wear the pants in the relationship 
I'd rather wear the skirt 
You can have a family and still work 
You treat him like the gum under your shoe 
And then you try to get rid of him like the flu 
When you're mad 
You know your tempers never far 
You make the guy break down like your car 
He shakes in the dust 
Like you're San Andreas 
Then you bring out his faults 
Like diamonds from a vault 
Which ironically you want him to buy 
And yet still you try 
To give him more orders than a waiter 
And it divides you like the equator 
You're more domineering 
Than power steering 
But you must realize 
Both of you can't drive 
How can he not hear what you say 
When your nickname is forte 
You ever been in a checkout line 
Trying to save time 
And stand behind 
A couple that's out of their minds 
She picks a fight 
And she knows she's not right 
And he apologizes for something he didn't do 
And you stare at the ceiling 
Cause you don't have a clue 
So embarrassed for the guy 
You can't look him in the eye 
all you can do is ask yourself why 
Contemporary girl in the corporate world 
You're kicking butt and taking names 
And to you it's all a game 
Designer clothed 
Hard nosed 
Battle-ax with a fax 
The business brunch 
The power lunch 
Net and gross 
Who makes the most 
Spreadsheets and requisitions 
Mergers and acquisitions 
Real time and the bottom line 
Corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts 
A private jet for you to fly out 
Just having your fun 
Ms. hard as nails 
But cry when you break one 
You only care about how much you earn 
But when will you ever learn 
In this world 
You can't be the man 
When you're a girl 
What an extraordinary mask 
But I've got just one question to ask 
You say you know what's best 
But how are you gonna rule the world with P.M.S. Bridge: Contemporary 
Now you're so very sure 
With success in your life 
You think you don't need him anymore 
I guess love isn't a fad 
Being an old fashioned girl 
Isn't so bad 
You don't have to be sad 
I know that's not how you want to be 
So ladies, sing it with me
