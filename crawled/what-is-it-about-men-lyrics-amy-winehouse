Understand once he was a family man 
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand 
Emulate all the shit my mother hated 
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate 
My alibi for taking your guy 
History repeats itself, it fails to die 
And animal agression is my downfall 
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed 
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? 
My destructive side has grown a mile wide 
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed 
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? 
My destructive side has grown a mile wide 
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
