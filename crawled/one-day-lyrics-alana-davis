Looking to the sky, wishing for a sun. 
Lowering the high, before the trip's begun. 
Passing time, acting blind, taking the easy way out. 
Every day you spend wasting away. 
You don't care what life's about, 
But you will one day. 
You will one day, you'll be hurting some day, you will one day. 
Said you'd be the one, 
Said you'd always be there. 
But you're caring for none, 
And your promises they drift into the air. 
Every night you want to start a fight; 
Trouble's what you're made of. 
You can't be tied, you can't look inside. 
Don't want anyone to love. 
But you will one day, 
You will one day, you'll be hurting some day, you will one day. 
Passing time and acting blind, 
Taking the easy way out. 
Everyday you're wasting away and don't care what life's about, 
But you will one day. 
You will one day...
