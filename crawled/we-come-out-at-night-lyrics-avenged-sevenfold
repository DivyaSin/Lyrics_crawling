Black and gray clouds willow in the balance as the sun falls 
Rain plays a heart warming tune, on the pavement emotions stir 
A feeling of warmness, compassion, fullness, I feel at home 
Disguised by surroundings As the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance on their mistreated lives 
As the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance on mistreated lives 
A silhouette stands still 
A cactus on a warm summer night But the rain falls cold and the moon shines bright 
Black as night, cold as ice, warm as home, ready to live 
Stars they shoot in a clear across the sky as does my time 
Waiting, wanting, feeling, emotion, crying, breaking, loving, nothing Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone 
Thinking good times, and why'd they go? Falling down, breaking down parts of me 
Falling down, breaking down parts of me 
Fuck, I need this place to get away from you Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone 
Thinking good times, and why'd they go? 
Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone 
Thinking good times, and why'd they go? 
Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone 
Thinking good times, and why'd they go?
