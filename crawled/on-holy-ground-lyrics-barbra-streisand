When I walked through the doors I sensed His presence 
And I knew this was a place where love abounds 
For this is a temple, the God we love abides here 
Oh, we are standing in His presence on holy ground We are standing on holy ground 
And I know, I know there are angels all around 
Let us praise, praise Him now 
For we are standing in His presence on holy ground In His presence I know there is joy beyond all measure 
And at His feet, sweet peace of mind can still be found 
For when we have a need He is still the answer 
Oh, reach out and claim it for we are standing on holy ground We are standing on holy ground 
And I know there are angels all around 
Let us praise, praise Him now 
For we are standing in His presence on holy ground
