It's like you're moving in slow motion 
That's how I see you in my mind 
I'd give a lifetime of devotion 
A love like yours is hard to find And I would drive all through the night 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you 
And I would fight a samurai 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you 
And would run 500 miles 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you 
And I'd jump in the car right now 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you tonight Where would I be without your love? 
There is no me without your love 
Where would I be without your love? 
There is no me without your love 
Where would I be without your love? 
There is no me without your love And I would drive all through the night 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you 
And I would fight a samurai 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you 
And would run 500 miles 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you 
And I'd jump in the car right now 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you tonight 
And would run 500 miles 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you 
And I'd jump in the car right now 
Just to be with you 
Just to be with you tonight
