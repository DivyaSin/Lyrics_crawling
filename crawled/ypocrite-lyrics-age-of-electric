Don't give a damn, I don't care 
Don't give a fuck, Unaware 
Got no remorse, Got no concern for no one 
You watch my conscience fading, Sharp is my tongue Ignore my words, Words can hurt, My Freudian slip 
Look in my eyes, You'll read my lies 
I'm the hypocrite All fears dissolve, Problem solved 
Not my concern, My words burn 
Mine to regard, Shades of regret they linger 
Got no regard for no one, Lash out in anger Ignore my words, Words can hurt, I'm so full of shit 
Look in my eyes, You'll eat my lies 
I'm the hypocrite, I'm the hypocrite 
I mean no harm
