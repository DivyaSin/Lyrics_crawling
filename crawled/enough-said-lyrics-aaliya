[Verse 3 - Drake] 
Went from my nigga serving it by the tele to venues in Manchester 
Just swerving with Balotelli the fuck are you trying to tell me 
Bothers me when you got to play therapist 
That shit's embarrassing 
They even bring up these niggas make a comparison 
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150 
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy 
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney 
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding 
Is this even still a discussion? 
Don't you ever wake up disgusted 
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin 
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something 
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies 
And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy 
And I don't know if speaking on it helps 
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself 
You know

Sometimes you are, all alone 
Need your love x3
