There's a scar on my right elbow 
From a barbed wire fence when I was eight years old 
I must have ran a mile just crying in my torn shirt 
'Till I heard the words tell me where it hurts. If there was a scratch or a bruise on my skin 
Mama would put me back together again 
All it took was her prayers and her kisses 
It would heel me just like stitches. I took Sherry Johnson to the high school dance 
But she left early with my best friend 
I must of drove ten miles to get my mind off her 
But it didn't work 'till I heard the words tell me where it hurts She could mend a broken heart, fix a bicycle wreck, 
Funny now but back then it seemed life or death 
I've seen her sew rags into riches 
It would heel me just like stitches.
