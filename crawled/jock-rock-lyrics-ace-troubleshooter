I would like to call myself gifted 
But for me they use a completely different word 
Bright, intelligent, studious, or learned? 
Oh no! They call me Nerd In vain I wish I could make fun of their white hats 
Bullroar! I know, that would be absurd 
So I'm just stuck with getting shoved in lockers 
Oh no! Here they come after the Nerd Oh I wish I were a jock 
'cause then I'd get all the girls 
Oh I wish I were a jock 
'cause then I'd be the king of the world Getting stomped on leaves quite an impression 
I always leave shaken, feeling like a tird 
In my periforal vision a troop of bouncing white hats 
Oh no! Here they come after the Nerd
