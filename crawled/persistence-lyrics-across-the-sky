I always felt like there was someone guiding me 
Through the twisted maze of my reality 
You never gave up when my hope would fade 
You showed me signs, so many times 
As the days went by I sensed Your touch 
A steady stream that slowly turned into a flood 
With all the evidence I'll ever need 
There's no question of the way You prove Your love [Chorus] 
Over and over I was turned back around 
Whenever I wandered somehow You would find me 
You've taken me into Your heart to my home 
And closed the distance with Your persistence Like an island I have landed on many times 
Your love has been the only place I could survive 
When I'm all alone I hear Your voice 
Constantly, You are there for me [Chorus]
