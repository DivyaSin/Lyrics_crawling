My love is alive and you know it is 
You can't deny what's so obvious 
I'm spelling it out here for all to see 
If you don't get it now then whatever will be 
Will be, will be, will be, will be 
Then whatever will be 
Will be, will be, will be, will be Oooh 
Light me up 
Again Once I felt love and I knew it was 
Something so sure it would take it's course 
How can one doubt what is plain to see 
How can you not wanna be with me? 
With me, with me, with me, with me 
How can you not wanna be with me? 
Me, me, me, me Oooh 
Light me up 
Again You light me up again [Solo] You light me up Oooh 
Light me up 
Again
