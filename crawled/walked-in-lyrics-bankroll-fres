The man has got something special 
You know my friends 
They're killin' 
All these hoes are killin' 
And I might kill a different feeling 
Take it and flip it 
Take it and remix it 
You know exactly how it goes 
I bet you can't do it like this 
Fully loaded diamond on both of my wrists 
Scream my name 
You got a hundred to see 
I ain't coming in 
I hit hard like Shorty you live Came all in 
And turned you both 
I stay with their kid 
I am a____ 
I'm moving the bed 
Play with the money 
We put on the man 
No,no limit, we're bustin' your ass The man has got something special 
You know my friends 
They're killin' 
All these hoes are killin' Lookin' like a motherfuckin' goddess 
They poppin' 
Rose ain't poppin' 
You all ain't got it I got 2 bitches they wanna get wild 
These bitches want doggie style 
I got one black and one_____ 
Smokin' this shit I made her a clown 
You can't wait to growl 
So free bitch you gonna ball down 
I'm fresh here I'll be whining out The man has got something special 
You know my friends 
They're killin' 
All these hoes are killin' All of these hoes be style 
All my shit be exclusive 
They don't want me cause I'm coolin' 
Lookin' like God damn Juno 
I might fly to Bermude Me and my god damn shooters 
Click like a god damn ruler 
All that she wants was a bag of money 
Get on molly she actin' ____ The man has got something special 
You know my friends 
They're killin' 
All these hoes are killin'
