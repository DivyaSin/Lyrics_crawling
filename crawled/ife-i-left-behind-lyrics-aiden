I remember when I used to wake up 
I remember what I used to be 
I remember how I used to wake up so wrong now 
I remember this life I left behind 
On empty shelves 
In empty rooms 
In lifeless skys 
In lifeless skys 
In empty shells 
I remember when I used to 
Be my own self 
I remember when 
We were so young 
I remember when I used to 
Wake up so lost now 
I remember when 
We were so 
My friend 
My own 
My end Break 
Watch me break She won't have to stand and walk alone now 
To stand and walk alone 
Don't have to stand and walk between us now 
Forever wanting This life has never made me question 
Is it wrong to think 
How empty is the answers 
This life has never made me question 
Is it wrong to think 
How empty is the answers
