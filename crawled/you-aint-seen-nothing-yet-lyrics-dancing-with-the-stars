I met a devil woman 
She took my heart away 
She said, "I had it coming to me 
But I wanted it that way" I think that any love is good lovin' 
So I took what I could get 
She looked at me with big brown eyes 
And said "You ain't seen nothing yet 
B-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothing yet 
Here's something that you are never gonna forget 
B-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothing yet" 
"Nothing yet, you ain't been around" 
That what she told me And now I'm feeling better 
'Cause I found out for sure 
She took me to a doctor 
And he told me of a cure He said that any love is good love 
So I took what I could get 
Yes, I took what I could get 
And then she looked at me with those big brown eyes 
And said "You ain't seen nothing yet 
B-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothing yet 
Here's something, here's something you will never forget, baby 
You know, you know, you know, you just ain't seen nothing yet 
You need education, you gotta go school" Any love is good lovin' 
So I took what I could get 
Yes, I took what I could get 
And then, and then, and then 
She looked at me with those big brown eyes 
And said "You ain't seen nothing yet 
Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothing yet 
Here's something, here's something 
Here's something you will never forget 
Baby baby baby baby baby, you ain't seen n-n-nothing yet" 
"You ain't been around, you ain't seen nothing yet" 
That what she told me She said I needed education, go to school 
I know I ain't seen nothing yet 
I know I ain't seen nothing yet 
[Incomprehensible] better be good 
[Incomprehensible] everywhere 
But I ain't seen nothing yet 
[Incomprehensible] ain't seen nothing yet 
I ain't seen nothing yet 
Ain't seen nothing yet 
Wait, wait, [Incomprehensible]
