BLAME IT ON THE SUMMER 
Basia?It?s That Girl Again (2009) Day by day and night by night 
Love?s a dream heaven sent 
I am yours and you?re mine 
What more can I pray for 
But every minute, every hour 
I play a waiting game 
?Cause once again the spring is all around I know so well your smiling face 
That greets me every day 
You stand by me I stand by you 
All?s good and well, so 
Day by day and night by night 
I play a waiting game 
?Cause my world will soon be turning upside down 
In summer CHORUS: 
Blame it on the summer 
I can?t help how summer makes me feel 
Blame it on the summer 
I don?t care if what I feel is real 
Blame it on the summer 
I can?t explain what summer makes me do 
I want to break away and fly away 
?Cause summer makes me run away from you Years go by a playful time 
Resign come what may 
You keep on loving me 
And I still keep on wishing 
?Cause every hour here in silence 
The game remains the same 
And the summer makes my world turn upside down 
Oh, summer CHORUS I want to break away and fly away 
Summer makes me run away 
Summer makes me run away 
Summer makes me run away 
Summer makes me run away from you CHORUS Blame it on the summer 
Blame it on the summer 
Blame it on the summer 
Blame it on the summer 
Blame it on the summer 
I want to break away and fly away 
Blame it on the summer 
?Cause summer makes me run away from you 
Blame it on the summer 
From you
