When did life get this sudden rush of adrenaline? 
21 but I'm goin' on 27 JuJu fresh out the trama ward Hopeton in heaven 
Now we on the block sippin henny bumpin that many men 
3 pisyols, 2 niggas, 1 minivan, 0 chances I see my little brother again 
when we find the one who did it its off with his head 
yesterday we smoke tomorrow your gone with the wind 
it's a sad situation back and forth pacing 
I'm prayin for more than patience 
Pour a lil out for my nigga before we take sips 
rest in the real Paradise the hills ain't shit 
compared to where your headed 
the realest left the building y'all give my nigga his credit 
but life is what you make it until the day that I'm a dead man 
I scream smoke and i smoke scream with that headband 
Bitches speak on your name when they're so irrelevant 
grey gang we shoulda got you a Letterman 
a short story one that im wishin never would end 
forever and ever again let me drown in these pills and promethazine this shit is wild they killed you at 17 now in a better place seeing things that you never seen but karma still comes around like a wedding ring 
please pray for my niggas mom but don't pray for me pray for the person that did it we on his fitted and if detectives get to this dumbie before we done him its a win win cos half my homies in prision 
lil homie wit a heart of gold, shine on us it'll help us with the darkest roads
