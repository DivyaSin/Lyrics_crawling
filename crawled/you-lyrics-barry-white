You, still awake my desire 
And you make my love perspire 
You, your passion makes me weak 
I shiver down to my bare feet I'm so glad we found each other 
I'm so glad that we're together 
We got something very special 
I will always be so faithful For you, you're so incomparable 
Yeah, you're so sensual 
You, so suave and debonair 
Ain't no other guy in my eye 
Who can compare You, I'm never gonna leave you 
You, I'll never deceive you 
You, I never wanna lose you 
You, I'll never misuse you I'm so much in love with you 
You're so in love with me 
This is the way it will always be 
Just you, just me You make me scream your name 
You light fire in my veins 
You captivate my mind so 
And when you're loving me I swear 
I just lose control I'm so much in love with you 
You're so in love with me 
This is the way it will always be 
Just you, just me You and me 
You, help us, please 
Who? You
