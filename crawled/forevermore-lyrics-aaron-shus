Long before the earth 
Before there was light 
Lord You were 
Endless are You God 
No time can contain all you are There's no other God before You 
There is no other one to replace you 
You are forevermore 
And there's no other God I call to 
You are the One I cling to 
You are forevermore Faithful are You God 
You never change 
Lord You are 
Only You are God 
Forever You reign above it all There's no other God before You 
There is no other one to replace You 
You are forevermore 
And there's no other God I call to 
You are the One I cling to 
You are forevermore There's no other 
No on Greater 
There is none like You 
There's no other 
No on Geater 
There is none like You There's no other God before You 
There is no other one to replace you 
You are forevermore 
And there's no other god I call to 
You are the one I cling to 
You are forevermore There's no other God before You 
There is no other one to replace you 
You are forevermore 
And there's no other god I call to 
You are the one I cling to 
You are forevermore You are forevermore
