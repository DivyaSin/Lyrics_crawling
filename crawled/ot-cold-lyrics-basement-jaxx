Don't nobody speak to me no more 
I wanna hear but can't hear you when you call 
Do you really mean it or have I just seemed to miss the point 
Whatever it is it's bringing me to boiling point [Chorus] 
Hot and cold 
Wet and warm 
Hot and cold 
Lets just make one thing we can all have when it all crumbles down Now I hear you talking some nonsense 
And I know it's peripheral and completely missable but 
Nicer than silence and the odd siren that would otherwise be all I hear Hot and cold 
Wet and warm 
Hot and cold 
I want to hear you hear you when you call [Chorus] It makes no sense at all to me 
It makes no sense at all to me Reach out try and slither under my skin 
Slide under me take my veins and go straight to the black hole within Now I hear you talking some nonsense 
And I know it's periphral and completely missable but 
Nicer than silence and the odd siren that would otherwise be all I hear Hot and cold 
Wet and warm 
Hot and cold 
I want to hear you hear you when you call [Chorus]
