Her face is blistering from these arguments 
Your dirty words said without any given thought 
Time and time again don't you think it's getting old 
Open your eyes and see is that a move maybe to bold Open your checkbook 
Write another "I'm sorry sweetheart" 
Cover one hole while digging another 
I'm cashing in on reality, go 15 years going on too many to count 
Wasted all these care to save the rest? 
It's going to take more than the occasional "I love you" 
Bills for apologies never passed the test No longer 
Bite your tongue
