This is the end of your life We all live in hostels that mirror our fear 
Each face a portal to nothing or everything 
Depending on resting on circumstance 
The chances of knowing Just what standard of silence you can expect to receive? 
No discontentment will be voiced or rendered 
When we all bleed in the night, bleed in the night 
Bleed in the night by ourselves Spring is such a painfully deceptive time 
Everyone's got some problems to hide in the lives they lead 
Spring is a Christmas time away 
It seems we've all got hands to beg, we are spinning lies April is dripping a spawn soaked in mucous 
As May accelerates here 
Yes, April is dripping and standards are slipping 
In the land of the devoted This is a standard of silence that you can expect to receive 
True discontentment will blur with our leisure 
When we all bleed in the night, bleed in the night 
Bleed in the night through ourselves As God turns away, as God turns away 
We are becoming devoted children 
We are set in our ways 
Yes, as God turns away, as God turns away We are becoming devoted children 
And I am becoming like all good children 
Yes, we are becoming devoted children 
We are set in our ways as God turns away Then this is a standard of silence that you can expect to receive 
All discontentment reduced and surrendered 
Sub-parity, they are bleeding the night, bleeding the night 
Bleeding the night for themselves
