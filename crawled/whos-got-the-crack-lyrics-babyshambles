There's no such thing as a harmless joke 
There's no such thing as a gentle toke 
There's no such thing as Panama Jack 
Who's got the crack, who's got the crack 
Who's got the crack, who's got the crack 
I am a goat 
In a moat 
With a boat 
Who's got the crack, who's got the crack 
Who's got the crack, who's got the crack I like it when my hair is poofy 
I like you when you slip me a roofy 
I like it when you've got the crack 
Who's got the crack, who's got the crack 
Who's got the crack, who's got the crack I wanna be a hippie 
But I forgot how to love 
It's hard to be a garbage man 
When a sailor stole my gloves 
I wanna be reckless 
But I'm feeling so uptight 
Put your mama in a headlock baby 
And do it right 
Who's got the crack, who's got the crack 
Who's got the crack, who's got the crack
