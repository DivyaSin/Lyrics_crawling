I was a troubled teen 
Who put adverts in a magazine 
To the annoyance of my imaginary lover 
Well she questioned my integrity 
And this is what she said to me She said oh, you, you're green 
You don't know what love means 
Oh let me tell you 
She said it tickles you pink, oh yeah 
But it likes to hear you scream 
Fire and damnation, lamentations 
For the likes of you When she goes, just let her go 
If she says she's going 
Just make sure she goes 
Make sure she goes I was a troubled teen 
Untroubled only in my daydreams 
To the annoyance of somebody or other 
Oh well, they doubted my philosophy 
And this is what they said to me Oh, you, you'll soon be up where you belong 
But it's only blood from broken hearts that writes the words to every song 
Oh a beatific smile 
For the fawners and the servants 
Oh but I, only I, only I I can see the serpents 
Oh, you, you're green 
You don't know what love means 
Well let me tell you 
It tickles you pink, oh yeah 
But it likes to hear you scream 
Fire and damnation, lamentations 
For the likes of you When she goes, just let her go 
If she says she's going 
Just make sure she goes, make sure she goes When she goes 
You just let her go 
If she says she's going 
Make sure she goes, make sure she goes
