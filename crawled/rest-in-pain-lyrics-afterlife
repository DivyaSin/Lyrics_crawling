Pain is Rising, the Age of Fuse 
Sustain Horizon, no need of use 
BURN All is falling 
Heaven's calling 
Call me up, I'm next in line 
Free forever 
All together 
A beginning, of the Afterlife Crash course in the eternal love 
Begin on earth, finish above 
RISE All is falling 
Heaven's calling 
Calling up, I'm next in line 
Free forever 
Now we're together 
Our beginning of the Afterlife
