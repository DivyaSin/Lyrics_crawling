this is a song from my heart. this is a secret by the arts. 
you can never understand. 
my song,my secret 
my life,my hatred 
all burnin in a flame. i can here you calling my name needing help. 
so i put my brave face on. don't care if I'm scared. don't care if I'm not. right now i just care about you and me being happy. let my sing my song after dawn cause i need to wake up. let me confuse you with my twisted song. i go from sad to brave happy to crazy. and theres nothin you can do baby. tell me I'm number 1 or just smile and say... go put your brave face on and sing your song cause its dawn. ima wake now happy now. but I'm still bring in you down with every glare and i can't help but stare... anyways this is my twisted song welcome to the end of it. i no its not the best but it is the worst.
