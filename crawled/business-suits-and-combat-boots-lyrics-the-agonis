Does history guide you, or do you set out to change it? Breach not broken. X2 Fuck your 
Skinned-alive designer wear, 
Fashion shades and salon hair. 
Heels to help where nature failed. 
Artificial teeth and nails. No! 
The wasp's nest expands. So clap your hands! It's her! 
The one black woman who's success you don't credit to Affirmative Action. 
The way of the future is: Corporate sponsors raising your kids. 
Maternal love is nothing compared to what $7 gives! 
Put in, suck out plastic body parts. 
It's the ever-growing industry of cosmetic arts! 
Bombarded with idealized shots, dysmorphic, self-destructive plots. Physical flaws are a mental blank. X2 So pay your surgeons - 
It's your parents who you should thank. These eyes are blind to several hundred left behind 
(Lest we forget again) 
But the border is breached, but not broken. 
Who tries to find the several hundred left behind, 
When the border is breached, but not broken? Go-existing in a twisted society, 
Where youth is a crime and wasteful sweat-shops expenditures are how luxury is defined. 
Now the KKK has found a new masquerade. 
Fuck your self-proclaimed supremacy; 
You hide your face and your shame! Identify right and wrong, when all fact is merely opinion. 
You cannot know the sweetness of victory; without first dwelling in the agony of defeat. These eyes are blind to several hundred left behind. 
(Lest we forget again) 
But the border is breached, but not broken 
Who tries to find the several hundred left behind, 
When the border is breached, but not broken?
