Satanic screaming satanic... 
Horrorwood looms before me 
Trembling in horrorwood 
My shadow darker than the night 
I give to you my sinful heart 
To make my shadow turn bright 
Satanic screaming satanic 
Horrorwood looms before me Black, green, brown sand color 
Before you start to scream out 
Black, green, brown wave color 
Before you start to cry out Why'd you take me to horrorwood? 
Phantom on your back's getting you down 
My shadow engulfs horrorwood 
Drown the phantom in our midnight lake...
