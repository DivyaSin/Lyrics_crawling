Fade away just like our love had died 
And there is nowhere in this universe to hide...from you tonight 
I've wrestled with angels...all my life 
It's always the halos and the wings that keep you blind 
And if I fall with all the strength I held inside I wouldn't be out here alone tonight 
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight 
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight 
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight 
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight Whoo Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking. 
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking 
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking. 
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking Fade away just like our love had died 
And there is nowhere in this universe to hide...from you tonight 
I've wrestled with angels...all my life 
It's always the halos and the wings that keep you blind 
And if I fall with all the strength I held inside 
I wouldn't be out here alone tonight Whoo Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking. 
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking 
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking. 
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking Whoo And if I fall with all the strength I held inside 
I wouldn't be out here alone tonight
