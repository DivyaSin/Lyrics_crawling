Sit and wait and count my hate 
I'll be adding up for days Feelings come and go, I will let you know x2 
1 and 1 is never fun 
Pull the thread and I come undone See the numbers as they fade away 
And the letters that you wrote I saved 
I won't read them for I'm not that brave 
But I keep them so that I can say 
That I cared 
I cared Feelings come and go, I will let you know x2 
1 and 1 is never fun 
Pull the thread
