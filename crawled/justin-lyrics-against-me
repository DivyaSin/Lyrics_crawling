They're advertising on the TV 
Become a soldier 
It's still high school politics, you know 
Nothing's changed ? 
Still don't know shit about aesthetic 
I think I smell a rat 
We sold our avenge 
Now we're working for them 
Where's the divide? You know Justin, well Justin's dead 
And yahoo won't let his family 
Have access to his email account 
I feel so bad for you and so awkward 
There's really nothing I can say 
Merry Christmas, happy holidays 
From networking its affiliates 
So where's the divide? Where's the divide? 
Where's the divide? 
Where's the divide? 
Where's the divide?
