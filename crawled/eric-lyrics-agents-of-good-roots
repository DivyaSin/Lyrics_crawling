Lyrics: jones & winn 
Music: jones & winn Appears on where'd you get that vibe? . Lyrics: I got a friend named eric 
Used to play that mean guitar 
Played that guitar 
While he was laying beneath the stars 
Looking up to the wind he'd say 
"my girlfriend it's for you" 
Philosophy is all grand 
But all good is not the truth 
We can make a movie 
In it, you can be the star 
Bobby, bobby could be your brother 
He could play guitar 
We can say we'll lose the beat 
And I'll get the rhythm list 
My friend eric turned into such a fine mess 
He used to take medicine 
It used to make him sick 
He would have to leave his place 
And make a big trip 
A road trip to bahama beach 
With palm babies in the sun 
He'd just go tasting all those juices 
Licking some of that fun 
He says now 
"brother lets go down under the board walk 
You bring the cocoa oil 
I'll bring the soda pop 
I'll fall in love that girl- 
She's dancing in the sun" 
His name is e-r-i-c 
He's so high he's so fly 
He says come on 
Oh, eric used to play guitar 
On wednesday nights 
And the gypsy blues would sing 
Well he made me think 
It made me want to play 
Yeah, my friend eric 
Was a damn good player on the guitar 
Why his guitar would sing 
And the gypsy blues, they would reign 
He says now 
"bobby I must get back to see my pa 
He's sad and lonely 
Tells me 'boy you're my only star' 
Don't sweat it 
I'll be back in three weeks time or less 
My name is e-r-i-c 
I must happily confess, yes"
