If you saw the way she walked away, you would know. 
If you heard my name fall from her lips, you would know. 
I never stood a chance. then you would know 
I never stood a chance. Sing me to sleep like an angel. 
A sword, a kiss and a blue guitar. I watched the sun kiss her morning face like a glow. 
If you watch her glide like a mystery, you wouldl know 
I never stood a chance, then you would know 
I never stood a chance. Sing me to sleep like an angel. 
A sword, a kiss and a blue guitar. 
The world's a big and crazy lover. 
So let's just dance here where we are. Something inside you 
Shows me who you are. 
The world is a joke, love. 
Laugh for the sad ones, my shining star. I never stood a chance 
I never stood a chance 
I never stood a chance, then you would know 
I never stood a chance Sing me to sleep like an angel. 
A sword, a kiss and a blue guitar. 
The world's a big and crazy lover. 
So let's just dance here where we are. 
Where we are.
