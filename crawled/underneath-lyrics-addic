Last night I saw the face of god 
But waking I forgot who she was 
Now I understand the power of love 
Now I know nothing is all I've understood 
I want to know the truth 
But then again what's the use 
I'm so confused 
I've all the answers just too much to lose 
And I need to know what I believe 
I feel a child underneath 
Underneath
