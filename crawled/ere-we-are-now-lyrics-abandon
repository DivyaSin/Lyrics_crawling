I ask myself what can I offer You 
Can you use someone who already feels used 
Have all my mistakes let you down 
Can you turn my failures around Here we are now in this moment 
Here we are 
You are my hope when I'm broken 
I am at the end of myself 
Here we are 
this is the start of a new life 
Like a child breathing this air for the first time 
I am made new, I am made new Create in me a heart as pure as gold 
The beauty of your love within my soul, Ohhh 
You've never felt so near 
And the view has never been so clear Here we are now in this moment 
Here we are 
You are my hope when I'm broken 
I am at the end of myself 
Here we are 
this is the start of a new life 
Like a child breathing this air for the first time 
I am made new in you, in you, in you 
I am made new in you, in you, in you Here we are now in this moment 
Here we are 
You are my hope when I'm broken 
I am at the end of myself 
this is the start of a new life 
Like a child breathing this air for the first time 
I am made new Here we are now in this moment 
You are my hope when I'm broken 
I am at the end of myself 
Here we are 
This is the start of a new life 
I'm breathing this air for the first time 
I am made new 
I am made new 
I am made new
