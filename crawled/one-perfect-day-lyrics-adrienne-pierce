I dont know you, not sure I want to 
You're far away, so far, so far 
My resistance, it's the distance 
I am far away, so far, so far Just one day, it's o-o-over One, one perfect day 
Let's keep, keep it that way 
It probably wouldn't, wouldn't have worked out 
Anyway One, one perfect day 
Let's keep, keep it that way 
We probably wouldnt have got along, anyway 
Anyway Stand on a star, close eyes, close 
Turn around, turn around till you fall down 
Stand on a star, close your eyes 
Are we getting closer to the ground Just one day, it's o-o-over One, one perfect day 
Let's keep, keep it that way 
It probably wouldn't have worked out 
Anyway One, one perfect day 
Let's keep, keep it that way 
We probably wouldnt have got along, anyway I'll keep you still, still I will 
I'll keep you still 
Like a photograph, like a photograph I will 
I will keep you, yeah, I'll keep you still We talked and on and wondering why 
Long until dawn, staring up at the sky 
And our mouths they were moving, our minds they were kissing 
You smiled and said it is what you had been missing Oh, oh, over, I'll close my eyes, tell me pretty lies 
Oh, I wouldn't speak, no, I won't to say a word 
I'll close my eyes, tell me pretty lies 
'Cause when I speak the lines, the lines get blurred One, one perfect day 
Let's keep, keep it that way 
It probably wouldn't, wouldn't have worked out 
Anyway One, one perfect day 
Let's keep, keep it that way 
We probably wouldnt have got along, anyway I'll close my eyes, tell me pretty lies 
Oh, I wouldn't speak, no, I won't to say a word 
I'll close my eyes, tell me pretty lies 
'Cause when I speak the lines, the lines get blurred
