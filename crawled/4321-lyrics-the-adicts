Over the hill, into the sun 
There's a man shouting about things to come 
We need a change, don't be afraid 
Don't be afraid to follow fashion 4321, here we all come Now make a move, now make a stance 
Join the crusade, hear the romance 
Another voice says, says, "Come with me 
Come with me and I'll make you happy"
