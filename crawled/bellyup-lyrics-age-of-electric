Love, life, should be mine to give you 
Love, life, should be mine to take 
Seal the windows turn on the gas 
And empty my wrists in the bath 
Jump to see if I can fly 
I'll be with you my love, I'll be with you my child 
I'm chokin' on my pride a belly full of suicide 
Life, Death, I'm not frightened of you 
Life, Death, I bid my welcome to you 
Take a swim in two ton shoes 
Watch my swing from the noose 
Down a handful of sleep 
I'll be with you my love, I'll be with you my child 
I'm gaggin' on my pride, A belly full of suicide 
For love or life 
You could be my cosmic bride
