Just as I've learned your ways you've gone and changed again 
A constant evolution I don't know where to begin 
I invest my time but it's no use 
Twenty years gone by and I'm still confused 
I spend the hours lost 
Trying to find you in a nameless crowd 
Pistol whipped by this quest for perfection 
Robbed of my joy 
It's hard to continue on 
But it's harder to stop right now 
Myself - a sacrifice to you and all your parts 
Till death do us part
