If I were to say to you 
"Can you keep a secret?" 
Would you know just what to do 
Or where to keep it? 
Then I say "I love you" 
And foul the situation 
"Hey girl I thought we were 
the right combination" 
Who broke my heart? 
You did you did 
Bow to the target, 
Blame cupid, cupid 
You think you're smart 
Stupid, stupid 
Shoot that poison arrow though to my heart 
Shoot that poison arrow 
No rhythm in cymbals 
No tempo in drums 
Love on arrival 
She comes when she comes 
Right on the target 
But wide of the mark 
What I thought was the fire 
Was only the spark 
The sweetest melody 
Is an unheard refrain 
So lower your sights, yeah but raise your aim, 
raise your aim 
I thought you loved me but it seems you don't care 
I care enough to know I can never love you 
Who broke my heart? 
You did you did 
Bow to the target, 
Blame cupid, cupid 
You think you're smart 
Stupid, stupid 
Right from the start 
When you knew we would part 
Shoot that poison arrow though to my heart 
Shoot that poison arrow
