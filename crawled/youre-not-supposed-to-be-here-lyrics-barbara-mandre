(Kent Robbins) How in the world did you get my number 
How did you know he's out of town 
I thought we were over long ago 
You shouldn't be here hangin' round And we shouldn't meet here in this restaurant 
You shouldn't be holdin' my hand 
I shouldn't be wantin' what I want 
When I belong to another man Chorus 
You're not supposed to be here 
You're not supposed to want me 
You're not supposed to make me want you 
You're not supposed to be here 
You're not supposed to tempt me 
I'm not supposed to care, but I do How did we ever let this happen 
We're just supposed to be old friends 
I prayed I wouldn't fall back in love with you 
But now I pray that it won't end Chorus You're not supposed to be so close to me 
You're just supposed to be a memory Chorus We shouldn't meet here at this restaurant 
You shouldn't be holding my hand 
I shouldn't be wanting what I want 
When I belong to another man Chorus How in the world did we let this happen 
We're just supposed to be old friends 
I prayed I wouldn't fall in love with you 
Now I pray that it won't end
