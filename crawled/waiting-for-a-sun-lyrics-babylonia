I'm sitting here 
I stare at the sea 
Waiting for a sun 
To shine for me I'm sitting here 
I face the rain 
Waiting for a sun 
To warm me again I belong to fears 
I'm fragile, full of need 
Inspired, but I feel old 
How many lives have I lived? My tingle of youth 
Has gone away, gone away forever 
Although I tried so hard 
It's a mood that lingers
