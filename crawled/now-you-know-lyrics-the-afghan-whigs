Since you're aware of the consequences 
I can pimp what's left of this wreck on you 
Bit into a rotten one, now didn't you? 
Now I can watch you chew 
Did you have blinders on my dear 
Or were you just willing? 
Or was I unaware of the damage a lie can do? 
I thought you knew 
Listen up 
Drive it off 
Punctuate it with a smoker's cough 
Light it up 
Stick around 
I told you somebody's going down now 
Spit it up 
Get it out 
Let me kiss that beautiful mouth 
Tell me is it the same? 
My sweetness, my everything 
And is this condescending a comfort at all to you? 
We bit into a rotten one 
Now didn't we? 
Well, baby now it's through
