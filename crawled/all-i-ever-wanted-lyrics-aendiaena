all I've ever wantedis that there comes a day 
in who we will live 
without any sorrow all I've ever needed 
to reach this very day 
join our harmony 
'till we'll rest in peace and though we pretend 
we got all that we need 
will you still see our faces 
froun from hatred and greed 
and after a while 
will the most rigeous man 
fail in keeping his faith 
when there ain't no faith left all I've ever wanted
