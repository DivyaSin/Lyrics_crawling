I feel I'm losing control of my heart and my soul 
It's rolling over me now, from my head to my toes 
The temptation I fight is taking over my mind 
I've never been so impressed and never obsessed 
When you're holding me tight, I am shaking inside 
I can't resist the power of your lips 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
What a feeling when we love 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
I will never get enough 
Everything that you do, it convinces me more 
You're such a magical thing, you opened up heaven's door 
I know we'll get the things right for this will be our night 
A night so sweet and divine, we all want you or mine 
When you're holding me tight, I am shaking inside 
I can't resist the power of your lips 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
What a feeling when we love 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
I will never get enough 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
What a feeling when we love 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
I will never get enough 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling 
What a feeling, oh what a feeling...
