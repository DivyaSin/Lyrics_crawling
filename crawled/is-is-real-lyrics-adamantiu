Torn at the seams 
A victime brought to his knees 
I tried to change it around 
No 
To make it fit to make it work 
Torn 
But nothing gonna give 
No 
Please help me 
I'm fucking torn at the seams 
A victim brought to his knees 
Is this real? 
And you'll never get it back 
What was taken away 
As you look thyough my life 
This is real 
Where are you now 
As I waste away 
As I watch my life fade away 
I'll never give into you 
I'll never see you're side 
You'll never know just what's inside of me.
