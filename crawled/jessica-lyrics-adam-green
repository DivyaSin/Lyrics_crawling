Jessica Simpson, where has your love gone, 
It's not in your music, no. 
You need a vacation to wake up the cavemen 
And take them to Mexico. 
Jessica, Jessica Simpson, you've got it all wrong. your fraudulent smile, the way that you faked it the day that you died. 
My body's in shambles INCRUSTED with brambles that sharpen the air I breathe. 
What's ON the menu, Jessica can you, take down my order please. Jessica, Jessica Simpson, you've got it all wrong. your fraudulent smile, the way that you faked it the day that you died. 
Tomorrow gets closer a purple bulldozer is calling you on the phone. 
Your love life precedes you, your son in law feeds you, injections of cortisone. 
Jessica, Jessica Simpson, you've got it all wrong. your fraudulent smile, the way that you faked it the day that you died. 
Jessica Simpson where has your love gone, its not in your music, so where has it gone? then, Jessica
