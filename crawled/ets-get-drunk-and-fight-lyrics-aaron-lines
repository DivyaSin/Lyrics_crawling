Let me pour you a tall one, 
Come sit down next to me. 
Baby you look so good, 
In those faded jeans. I've been stoned cold sober, 
You've been cold as ice. 
I got a good idea, 
Let's get drunk and fight! [Chorus] 
Let's get drunk and fight, 
Keep the neighbors up all night. 
You can scream at me, 
And I'll make you cry. 
And when the morning comes, 
We'll make some make-up love, 
While we apologize. 
But tonight, let's get drunk and fight! Have another pina colada 
And get good and torqued down 
If you need a pinata 
You can kick me around! 
You can insult my mother 
And I'll question your past. 
It turns me on when you're pissed off 
'Cause, you look hot when you're mad. [Chorus: x2] Baby tonight, 
Let's get drunk and fight!
