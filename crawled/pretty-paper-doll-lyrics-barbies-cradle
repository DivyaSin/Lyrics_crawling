Have you heard the story so colorful and untrue? 
A clever concoction so they could make some money off you 
suckers of the world 
don't stay too close to the tv screen 
you might hurt your eyes 
and realize too late you were a flower just in bloom 
but you wanted too much too soon 
you'll built away before the day you should come feel the sun and take your time 
smell the air and hear the sound 
it is wonder so profound but why do you listen to a pretty paper doll? 
you are missing your whole life 
run to the mountain and feel the ground on your feet 
and you can say you are alive i thank the one who taught me well 
maybe you can learn from this 
cause she flies so high 
to an amazing state of bliss despite all this time 
three is so much space to fill up there 
you know as well as i that we can change
