Long face lines trace the time 
Memories that you hold dear 
Swear you've been blessed by years 
Routine that's kept you here 
So long, so long Strong, how much stronger, stronger than me 
Pull a little harder until you pull free Caned young to stop the bend 
Up before the world awakes 
Won't leave your home behind 
Bones like leviathans of pride inside, inside Strong, how much stronger you always were 
Pull a little harder, you're almost there 
We all harbor prejudice 
We all want more than we have But when it all fades away 
Underneath we are the same Strong, how much stronger, stronger than me 
Pull a little harder until you pull free 
Strong, how much stronger, you always were 
Pull a little harder, you're almost there 
You're almost there
