I've been looking at people 
And how they change with the times 
And lately all I've been seeing are people 
Throwing love away and losing their minds Or maybe it's me that's gone crazy 
'Cause I can't understand why 
All these people keep hurting each other 
When good love is so hard to come by So what's the glory in living 
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore 
And if love never lasts forever 
Tell me what's forever for I've been listening to people 
And they say love is the key 
It's not my way to let them lead me astray 
It's only that I want to believe But I see love-hungry people 
Trying their best to survive 
While in their hands is a dying romance 
And they're not even trying to keep it alive So what's the glory in living 
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore 
And if love never lasts forever 
Tell me what's forever for 
And if love never lasts forever 
Tell me what's forever for
