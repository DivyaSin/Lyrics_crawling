When you're feeling lonely, lost and let down 
Seems like those dark skies are following you around 
And life's just one big shade of gray 
You wonder if you'll see the light of day Behind the clouds, the sun is shining 
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out 
You may not see the silver lining 
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds I've heard it said that this too shall pass 
Good times or bad times, neither one lasts 
But thinking that your luck won't ever change 
Is like thinking it won't ever stop once it starts to rain Behind the clouds, the sun is shining 
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out 
You may not see the silver lining 
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds 
Yeah, there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds
