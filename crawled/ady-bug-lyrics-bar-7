Hey, what you doin' over there? 
Now, don't it feel like you should be somewhere else? 
Like anywhere but where you are 
You know you make it hard to tell 
Just how you feel 
You know you make it hard as Hell 
I cannot tell when you won't talk to me 
I never get it right 
If that's the way you feel 
I won't ever get it right 
Now that you made up your mind 
How could I get it right? 
Not in a million years will I ever get it right Spread your wings it's time to take flight 
Lady bug, lady bug 
You better fly away home 
Your house is on fire 
And your babies all are gone 
Lady bug, lady bug 
I thought ya might wanna know 
You baby's getting tired 
Sittin' home alone Was only yesterday 
I told you I was down 
Only I didn't know today 
You wouldn't be around 
Lovin' something, that's your plan 
It's somethin' that you feel 
You feel it day after day 
Again and again and again 
Do you know it's here? 
I will never get it right 
You'll never get it right 
No, we'll never get it right Spread your wings it's time to take flight 
Lady bug, lady bug 
You better fly away home 
Your house is on fire 
And your babies all are gone 
Lady bug, lady bug 
I thought ya might wanna know 
You baby's getting tired 
Sittin' home alone How can it be? 
How can it be? 
I just don't believe it 
So easily 
And I believe 
So easily 
Spread your wings, it's time to fly How can it be? 
How can it be? 
I just don't believe it 
So easily 
And I believe 
So easily 
Spread your wings, it's time to fly Lady bug, lady bug 
You better fly away home 
Your house is on fire 
And your baby's sittin' all alone 
Lady bug, lady bug 
I thought ya might wanna know 
You baby's getting tired 
Getting' tired sittin' home alone Lady bug, lady bug 
You better fly away home 
Your house is on fire 
And your baby's sittin' all alone 
Lady bug, lady bug 
I thought ya might wanna know 
You baby's getting tired
