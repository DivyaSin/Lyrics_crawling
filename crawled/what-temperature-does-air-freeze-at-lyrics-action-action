And we'll float to the end 
Where the oceans do bend 
And we'll fly away And we'll shine on through 
Through the summer sky so blue 
And we'll drift away And we'll stare at the sun 
While the sound 
And shapes run up the chimney We will drive in the clouds 
Trampoline up and down 
To our symphony And we'll float to the end 
Where the oceans do bend 
And we'll fly away and we'll fly away We'll shine on through 
Through the summer sky so blue 
And we'll drift away and we'll drift away We wake at ten 
And start out lives again 
It's another day, it's another day Together in a room 
Where the wall flowers bloom 
It's a marigold way And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back And we'll float to the end 
Where the oceans do bend 
And we'll fly away And we'll shine on through 
Through the summer sky so blue 
And we'll drift away And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back 
And we'll never go back Go back, go back 
Go back, go back, go back
