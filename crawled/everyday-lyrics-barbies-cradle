You've come so far 
Just to say that you love me 
Oh I know, Yes I know 
But I'd like to hear you say it 
Everyday, everyday 
Everyday, everyday When I brush my teeth 
Oh and you drive the car 
Sweep me off my feet 
Take me very far away 
Far away 
Everyday, everyday Please take me high on 
Your mighty wings 
You know I'd really like to fly 
I'm a leaf in the sky 
Your love is the only 
Love I'd like, love I'd like 
Love I'd like, love I'd like Everyday 
Everyday 
Everyday When you're going up 
And I'm sinking down 
Save me everytime 
Never let me drown 
When I go to sleep 
Would you drive the car 
Sweep me off my feet 
Take me very far away 
Far away 
Everyday, everyday Every Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 
Of every June or January, October 
Love me like it's my birthday Everyday 
Everyday 
Everyday 
Everyday 
Everyday
