Have your self a merry little Christmas 
Let your heart be light 
From now on our troubles 
Will be out of sight Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
Make the yule tide gay 
From now on our troubles will be miles away 
Here we are as in olden days 
Happy golden day of yours 
Faithful friends who are dear to us 
Gather near to us once more 
Through the years we all will be together 
If the faiths allow 
Hang a shinning star 
Upon the highest bow And have your self a merry little Christmas now 
They'll be near to us once more 
Through the years we all will be together 
If the faiths allow 
Hang a shinning star 
Upon the highest bow And have your self a merry little Christmas now 
A merry little Christmas now
