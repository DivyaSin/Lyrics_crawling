Yea 
You a nigga don't really wanna take his cool off, ugh 
(Big Sean) Boi, Do It 
Let's go Early in the mornin' (mornin') 
When she's all alone (when she's all alone) 
I'm a take my time (yeah) 
Do it how we want it (do it how we want) 
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
Yeaaah She love the way I'm doin' it 
So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it 
Bottom line is, you the finest 
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that, what's that?) 
My bitch 
Hold up, hol' up, woah there 
Let's capture this moment if I hit it then I own it 
Marijuanin every mornin' 
And Patronin', girl, we groanin' 
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on 
Street lights on, on? 
Cause' ya know I got it goin' til' it's... Early in the mornin' (mornin') 
When she's all alone (when she's all alone) 
I'm a take my time 
Do it how we want it (do it how we want) 
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
So just let the song play 
The long way 
The strong way 
It's our day 
It's our way 
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
Talk to the, talk to the, hand 
Bitch, you talkin' to a grown ass man 
It's, like way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak 
(There goes the bed sheets) 
Err'ybody rip the swag off 
'Fore I rip the tag off 
Why my pants sag off, cause I'm rappin' my ass off 
Flow so ugly, money so handsome 
This the fuckin' anthem, get it, the fuckin' anthem Early in the mornin' (mornin') 
When she's all alone (when she's all alone) 
I'm a take my time 
Do it how we want it (do it how we want) 
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
So just let the song play 
The long way 
The strong way 
It's our day 
It's our way 
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay I don't really wanna uhh... talk too much shit 
But you love it when I talk like I lost it 
And I love how you look when ya blazin' 
And I swear you turn at least half asian 
And we 'bout to have a liason 
She's so cool, give head with her shades on 
You should just go and throw a cape on 
And it's just so amazing 
So amazin' 
So amazin' Take it to the car, (bloop, bloop), that shit look like I'm speed racin' 
Leave em with me, it'll boost your reputation 
Westside is where I'm stationed 
Spend all night, just champagne tasting 
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it til it's Early in the mornin' (mornin') 
When she's all alone (when she's all alone) 
I'm a take my time 
Do it how we want it (do it how we want) 
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
So just let the song play 
The long way
