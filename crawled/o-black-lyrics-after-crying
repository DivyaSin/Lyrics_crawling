Tonight the moon is absent 
But blind neons attack 
The aimless, winding tram in the dark 
My streets have gone to Black 
It's very Pepsi-poster 
At one she held me back 
Remember every motion of her 
As ran away to Black 
She went astray to Black 
In strait canal a boat nears 
Can see from paper made 
In leaden cloak with ebony face 
A tin-doll keeps to Black 
A tin-soldier to Black 
Tonight my wish is absent 
A gnome stays in my mack 
And cries inside by purple grimace 
My Blackself goes to Black 
I'm going into Black
