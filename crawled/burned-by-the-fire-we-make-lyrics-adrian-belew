And when Man gained dominion 
over land and the oceans 
he began to harm the planet 
with his asphalt and his toxins 
and to lay the forest bare 
and to poison even the air 
and he killed every beast 
and taught the seas how to bleed 
Burned by the fire we make, 
what a shame 
Then the winds gave in 
and the rain knew no season 
and the sun came to beat 
on a land of sand and diseases 
and when God looked down 
on the earth and saw it was broken 
then the tears of God fell down 
through a hole in the ozone 
Burned by the fire we make 
what a shame 
This is the nature of the human race 
to kill off anything that gets in our way 
poor Mother Earth we disfigured her face 
Man is the maker of his own disgrace 
Burned by the fire we make 
what a shame
