shiney shiney 
shiney shiney 
shiney shiney 
being girls being molls 
rock and roll rocking horse 
kicking round the killer course 
party politics erotic egos 
getting kicks shiney shiney 
gasoline gasoline sucking 
honey turpentine 
broken backs fixed with nails 
a dieing banshee wails 
kanine kenny's kennel 
is a sickly shade of fennel 
shiney shiney tick tock tock i dont' know what i'm talking about 
i am sick of myself 
i don't know what i'm talking about 
wanna be someone else shiney shiney 
saccharin summertime 
in winters lonely line 
get me out get me in 
let this fucking life begin 
petty politics erotic egos 
getting kicks shiney shiney i dont' know what i'm talking about 
i am sick of myself 
i don't know what i'm talking about 
wanna be someone else
