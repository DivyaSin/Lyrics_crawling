Fall down on my face, I trip toward my retreat 
Seeking Your embrace 
Blindly I find that I need only You 
More, more, more for me, me, me 
Bought into their mentality 
Eyes opened wide 
I'll be transformed by the renewing of my mind over time Discomfort comes clearly when I lose my gaze 
Brought back into righteousness suddenly Take a dip in the pool of grace 
A refreshing touch that lifts my face 
Then rest easy in Your arms 
Laugh in the face of any harm Sit and watch the world go by 
Wonder at the reason why 
And how they can ignore the One 
Who gives us life when all is said and done
