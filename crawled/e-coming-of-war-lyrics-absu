Evil summoned to war 
Eternal conquest for power 
Gathering armies of death 
To fight and kill at will Sinister weapons of war 
Piercing metal and man 
Warriors mounted on steeds 
Ride out into the mist Awaiting the signal to attack 
Swords clash and men fall to their death 
Aimless pawn only to die by my hand 
Battle cry blood stains upon his chest Endless, eternal pain 
Thousands die for a king 
Wretched, weary souls 
Raging battle never ends Hatred inflicting death 
Destroying the weak at heart 
Eternity becomes less 
War has drawn to an end Overthrown the emperor falls in defeat 
Great halls crack and decay with neglect 
Dethroned he cries out in vengeance 
Impaler mark is words of death Shadows crusades of the past 
Triumph through the fog 
Sunsets drip into dusk 
Flows like blood on my blade Massacre the feckless breed 
Dismiss all empty thrones 
Riding, beyond the clouds 
Damnation ends in despair Awaiting the signal to attack 
Swords clash and men fall to their death 
Aimless pawn only to die by my hand 
Battle cry blood stains upon his chest
