Hey, no, we don't know why 
Know your leader, who's the feeder 
To design your new figure 
Go and be the dumb gold digger 
To make your leader richer 
I had enough of them 
The only winners in this game 
Cuz u did what u could 
And they are up and leading on again 
Come and be the new beginner Got no bow, his mind is not narrow 
Cuz there's no border that will be in a freedom of a man 
No more soldier on the border 
To make a new world order 
No more higher on the lower 
Don't just hide behind your lawyer 
Why you want to be the dumb gold digger 
And make your leader richer? 
Hey, no, we don't know why
