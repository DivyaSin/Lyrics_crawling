Yeah, I can hear you even now 
Telling me - here's what makes this world go 'round 
And again, I can see that you believe 
Isn't that what it means to be nieve? Think ahead, and watch your step 
Do your best, to make the most 
Of every chance, that you can get 
It's in your thoughts, it's on your mind 
It's in your head Hey you! this is not your lucky day 
Would I lie? no! I'm behind you all the way 
What will you do, when this thing hits you like a bomb? 
You will laugh (Ha!), and you'll know that I was wrong [Chorus] 
I don't know - sometimes I just can't believe my eyes 
The things I see, things that really 
Mean the world to me - just falling down 
And I wonder, how long will it last? 
I don't know, all I know is we have got to do our best
