A letter to my future self, am I still happy, I begin 
Have I grown up pretty? Is daddy still a good man? 
Am I still friends with Colleen? I'm sure that I'm still laughing 
Aren't I, aren't I...? Hey there to my future-self, if you forget how to smile 
I have this to tell you, remember it once in a while 
Ten years ago, your past-self prayed for your happiness 
Please don't lose hope... Oh, oh what a pair me and you, put here to feel joy not be blue 
Sad times and bad times see them through 
Soon we will know if it's for real 
What we both feel (Speaking/Whisper) 
Though I can't know for sure, how things worked out for us 
No matter how hard it gets, you have to realize 
We weren't put on this earth to suffer and cry 
We were made for being happy, so be happy 
For me, for you, please... Oh, oh what a pair me and you, put here to feel joy not be blue 
Sad times and bad times see them through 
Soon we will know if it's for real 
What we both feel We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy 
We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy 
We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy (Whisper) 
We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy...
