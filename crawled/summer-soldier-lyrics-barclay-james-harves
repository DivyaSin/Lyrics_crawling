I feel sorry for the soldier who is shot and stoned in anger 
I feel sorry for his wife and child at home 
I feel sorry for the bomber who all life and limb dishonours 
For the people that he's maimed and left alone The Lord God said, "Love thy neighbour 
Though in human life he trades, he's still a man" I feel sorry for the children who with open minds are willing 
To fight for ideals aging past their time 
I feel sorry for the children who will join the vicious circle 
Of instinct fear bred from their parents' minds The Lord God said, "Love thy neighbour 
Break the circle, free the hater, call him a friend 
Call him a friend, call him a friend" Wake up, wake up, there's a man by your side 
With a knife and a gun in each hand 
Wake up, wake up, you're one and the same It's time to stop and decide 
Is it love or hate? Is it peace or war? 
It's for sure there's no one in between Politicians point views 
But they're pointing for you 
The solution has to be seen 
Has to be seen, has to be seen I thought I saw a summer soldier 
Helmet on his brow 
His silver rifle clutched 
Beneath his armour-plated shroud "I fire in hate" , he cried aloud 
"To protect myself from defeat 
My shield's my cause, my cause is war 
And from war I'll make no retreat I dreamt, I saw an angel bright 
A halo on his brow 
His golden sword lay in its sheath 
Beneath his silver shroud" "I cry thee not" , he cried aloud 
"Though your deeds like spears strike my soul 
My shield's my love, my cause is peace 
Faith be sure I shall not retreat"
