Good morning sunshine 
From this dead letter day 
I suppose I should have seen this 
But blindness prevails An easy game, girl 
Just a simple plan 
You said you plan to hurt 
But that just means I'll hurt you I'll ask you that age-old question 
Who am I to blame this all upon? 
Maybe we'll see each other in our next life 
Maybe we'll choke on it or maybe we'll just be friends And I do, for you Alone again in this room 
Until the 15th of June 
Adding over all the arguments 
We had in vain If you would ask, girl 
I would give it my touch 
We're playing tag across the United States 
Halfway undone I'll ask you that age-old question 
Who am I to blame this all upon? 
Maybe we'll see each other in our next life 
Maybe we'll choke on it or maybe we'll just be friends Just take this feeling 
I've asked you a question 
And if you see me 
Forever a question
