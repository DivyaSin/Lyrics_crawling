Thenardier: 
What to do? What to say? 
Shall you carry our treasure away? 
What a gem, what a pearl, 
A bee on rubies is our little girl! 
How can we speak of debt? 
Let's not haggle for darling Cosette! (sobs) 
Dear Fantine gone to rest! 
Have we done for her child what's best? 
Shared our bread, shared each bone 
Treated her like she's one of our own! 
Like our own, Monsieur! Valjean: 
Your feelings do you credit, sir 
And I will ease the parting blow. 
Let us not talk of bargains or bones 
Or greed, now may I say we are agreed! Mme. Thenardier: 
That would quite fit the bill, 
If she hadn't so often been ill. 
Little dear cost us dear, 
Medicines are expensive, Monsieur. 
Not that we agrudge to sue, 
It's no more than us Christians must do! Both Thenardiers: 
One thing more, one small doubt, 
There are treacherous people about! 
No offense, please reflect. 
Your intentions may not be correct!
