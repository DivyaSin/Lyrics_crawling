Countdown to midnight 
Mindless machines gave the order 
To murder the innocent 
Wake up, the dream is over 
And now it's up to me All of my life 
I have raced against the clock 
But now I feel time staring back at me 
This is greater than who I am 
The event that will change the course of history Countdown to midnight 
One millions lives at stake 
The encasement is a shrine 
And the wires intertwine 
To worship destruction 
And the death of every line Written by heroes 
To save us from the day 
We lose all our faith 
And the world is set on fire 
Burns so bright 
It's seen across the world
