I'd push you away but you are the only thing I know I can't help believing in you... the idea of beauty leaves me enslaved 
Say you'll stay for tonight and I promise you this will be the last I'd push you away but you are the only thing I know 
At your feet I now lay for you are the only thing I know I stare blindly into my reflection 
A piece of me lost... I am terrified that I cannot breathe without you 
I am nothing in my eyes if not lost 
I can't see past your eyes, without them I would die 
Shackles cut my wrists as I fight the chains 
None can hold me I'd push you away but you are the only thing I know 
At your feet I now lay for you are the only thing I know in a room where I once told you everything, I am alone 
Once beholden to nothing and no one 
How is it that I am slave to these eyes which glisten with untold secrets 
That I crave so wildly to understand? 
I must steel my heart to your warm gaze 
I'll claw out my eyes and see you no more 
Its because of you I sometimes wish that I would die 
Sometimes I wish I would die leaving you behind 
Enraptured by my ignorance, I now deserve sympathy
