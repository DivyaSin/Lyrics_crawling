I love the way you look at me 
with every passing stare 
you energize my happiness 
when others didn't care You make my heart beat 
and we've only just begun You lift me up 
to the sky 
make me smile 
don't know why 
you give me butterflies inside 
Oh baby I can't believe 
you were sent down for me 
can't you see 
you give me butterflies inside I dream of you 
when I'm wide awake 
you're always on my mind 
every second every breath I take 
you penetrate my soul You make my heart beat 
and we've only just begun You lift me up 
to the sky 
make me smile 
don't know why 
you give me butterflies inside 
Oh baby I can't believe 
you were sent down for me 
can't you see 
you give me butterflies inside you are my soul 
and the air I breathe 
you make my life 
a reality 
you give me everything 
that I need 
you make my heart beat 
eternally You lift me up 
to the sky 
make me smile 
don't know why 
you give me butterflies inside 
Oh baby I can't believe 
you were sent down for me 
can't you see 
you give me butterflies inside you give me butterflies 
butterflies 
butterflies 
butterflies
