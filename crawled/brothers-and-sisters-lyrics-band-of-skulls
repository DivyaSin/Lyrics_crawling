I was born and raised 
With a dozen other countries 
You were better raised 
By the morals of your tensions 
You're living just to please 
Dying to offend But, however, much the time 
We're our brothers and sisters in the end I remember when 
We were just little children 
Started make it up 
Little sparrows of a soul then 
Keep your enemies closer than your friends But, however, much the time 
We're our brothers and sisters in the end What's it doing to me? 
Don't you understand? 
Separated from the pack you ain't never going back Now we all grew up 
Some a little more than others 
Have your father's sons 
Have the daughters of your mothers 
You think you're so special 
If only to pretend But, however, much the time 
We're our brothers and sisters in the end But, however, much the time 
We're our brothers and sisters in the end What's it doing to me? 
Don't you understand? 
Separated from the pack you ain't never going back 
You ain't never going What's it doing to me? 
Don't you understand? 
Separated from the pack you ain't never going back We're our brothers and sisters in the end 
We're our brothers and sisters in the end 
We're our brothers and sisters in the end But, however, much the time 
We're our brothers and sisters in the end
