(Marlon C.) 
Hate you (hate you), hate me (hate me), 
Fuck you (fuck you), pay me (pay me) 
That's the way it goes down round here 
But I guess it's all good wit me 
Been hated since I touched this earth 
I'm the reason hate was given birth 
I'ma give this game what I know I'm worth, 
bust your sack like after-birth, 
ahead of your league, 
ahead of your stars, so far out we way past mars, 
so damn good you so sub-par, lyrical content more than yalls, 
you gotta talk about more than you ball, 
a couple of years you just gone fall, 
the rap game changed and it passed on yall, 
whatever happened to all them boys, 
the fire put out, the some dun cleared, 
Ab-So-Lute damn sure standin' right here, 
permanent fixture in the game right here, 
swag rap gone be gone be gone next year, 
I bust my ass to be the best, for my team I can't give less, 
you can hate me 'cause I can't be stressed, 
apply that pressure like a full court press, 
I breaks it down, like king James, 
always at the end we win these games, 
so damn good we can't be lame, 
some of yall boys can't say the same, 
some of yall boys think this a game, 
goin' for the top make it simple and plain, 
told yall boys before now man, 
them Ab-So-Lute boys they off the chain. Hook: 
(2x)I got them haters on my left, I to got them haters on my right

I'ma keep rollin' keep rollin' keep goin' 'cause it's alright 
I'ma keep goin' keep goin' just knowin' that it's alright [repeated simultaneously with hook]

(Ciddyboy South) 
Let me get this straight, 
they don't like Ciddyboy South go figure 
My name comin' out they mouth, 
don't make me none kinda like a rerun, 
but I guess it's the way of the world that we from, 
these niggaz they see my road to fame (then hate), 
they say these ho's to blame (then hate), 
that nigga talk too much shit, 
ride his own dick 
I'm in they way (that's hate), 
but I ain't got a mill in the bank and, (no) 
I never try to do it big when I cain't but, (yes) 
I do what I can when I got it 
so I guess a nigga mad 'cause I don't live fake so, (yes) 
you can hate 'cause I'm on my grind 
while I rise to the top you wasting time, 
you can hate 'cause you over the hill in this shit 
and I still be in my prime, 
that sneak dissin' don't phase me, 
I'm sure you already know, 
you can bitch from a distance 
but round me better keep that under control, 
they call us Ab-So-Lute 'cause ain't nobody fuckin' with us, 
they say we put on a show 
but when it comin' to lyrical content we be gorillas, 
beating on my chest, putting on my best 
you know I show my ass, 
I just got another hater and I'm sure it won't be my last, 
you always gone have somebody mad that ain't doing what you do, 
and that nigga right there (That nigga right where?) 
that nigga right there is see through. Hook:

I'ma keep rollin' keep rollin' keep goin' 'cause it's alright 
I'ma keep goin' keep goin' just knowin' that it's alright [repeated simultaneously with hook]
