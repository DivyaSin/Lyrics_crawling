(Still thuggin') 
You know the Outlawz in this bitch 
(Ha, hah, it's on) Once again another fat nigga fried 
Do a drive by if you wanna fuck with mine 
'Cause we swallowed inside 
My feet stuck to the ground And ain't shit that move me 
Dog, I'm heavy bound 
And I done seen niggaz get touched by the pair 
Runnin' they mouth with only one to the ground I blow my shit 'cause I can back it up 
Fuck poppin' the trunk 
Let's throw some hands up 
Now how many real niggaz gonna stand up? I thought so, niggaz better shut up 
I'm five, six, heart's bigger than me 
But I'll fuck you up so destructively 
Thoughtfully, my mack ten pop for me Got my glocks with me, come ride my block with me 
Intoxively, I bought that Hennessey 
Come ride with me or homicide with me 
Outlawz nigga Shit a nigga still breathin' hard from the last song 
'Cause out here it's either mash or get mashed on 
Rest in peace to all those who done passed away 
(R.I.P) 
'Cause with the beat that's in the streets life don't last long All in between you need to eat, you need some wheat 
You needs to heat, the beat 
'Cause you's a condone savage street to shit 
You got to mash to sleep a week or snooze 
Stay on my feet, I'm tryin' to keep 'em in some shoes Stay outta jail, this nigga fucks hard and twos again 
Let's get this money like we ain't never got it again 
Let's keep shootin' 'em like we ain't never shot it again 
You got your life but you promised to die Life is death at the end, you put the rest inside 
Life is death at the end, you put the rest inside 
(Come on) Life's short young nigga, get your mash on 
Hustle on little nigga, get your cash on 
If you see death around the corner, get your blast on 
You gonna die anyway, life don't last long We still feelin' pain from the last song 
Shit, we still feelin' rain from the last storm 
Homie either mash or get mashed on 
Little nigga either blast or get blast on I see how you got to play it now, you got to lay it down 
And clown for your crown, have respect now 
That's a test just to see if you gonna bring it to 'em 
Then come a whole lot of please when you bring it to 'em We keep it movin', motivation is the money 
Ability to feed niggaz hungry is so lovely 
But that ain't it, we got some soldiers locked down 
It's been perfect for what we doin' when they drop down It's hot now and we right up in the thick of it 
Picture this, all of us, eatin' chips 
Sittin' on the porch by our house, leavin' something in a stash 
How do we outlast? Always keep cash Sittin' on the scene with the nine 
Never would of thought I'd be gettin' mine 
Bossilini, straight murder dog 
Plotted my magazine, master cream Disintegrate niggaz who blast me 
He didn't know I was trapped 
He didn't know I was ready 
Plug a hole in his chest And check out with the niggaz vetti 
Do a dirty shit, smokin' bomb on the dock 
Cut your ass up in pieces, throw your meat to the sharks 
I got that, hold up Got a glock and I be puttin' niggaz in comas 
You's a mother fuckin' fool 
'Cause you dyin' for runnin' up on me You want beef bitch nigga, see me face to face 
After the case, my niggaz travel state to state 
I'm on a mash with case so I can't procrastinate 
There's so many lives in state, lord, I'm always gonna take My fate keep guessin', Smith and Wesson stressin' 
The lesser the charge, the shorter the yard, I'm dodgin' bullets 
Rest in peace to those who couldn't, I'm not gonna run 
Keep on mashin' and keep on blastin' I'm lastin' my time here 
Nigga I'm a be a legend in my own time 'fore a die here 
You wanna smoke, I'm a note to keep my mind clear 
And every nigga that I know mash with no fear

Homie either mash or get mashed on 
Little nigga either blast or get blast on A yo, I takes no, no slope, that slope 
Livin' with no breath, who wanna go next? 
No stretch when it's time to sprint 
Time limited, they want my life but I ain't givin' it Outlaw, Low Lives, taking your life 
We blow mics and I'm breakin' in with soap dice 
I'm baitin' now, the nigga you hate now 
Full steam ahead, my beam is red Niggaz wanna fight dirty 
I'm clean as them 
Stay hurtin' in the part 
You wanna bleed instead? I'm Mister Shorty to the K, the K, f-fantastic 
And I'm out here mashin' like a nation wide assassin 
I'm kickin' ass and takin' names later 
Better yet, call me Shorty, the motivator dominator Great rhymes sayer, whole cappa drug dealer
