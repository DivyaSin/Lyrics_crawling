When I lay down, my weary head 
And I recall all my actions 
And the careless words I've said I'm gonna make a vow 
That when it's day 
I'm not gonna make the mistakes 
That I got wrong yesterday If I think good, it's gonna be good 
And I'll only say the words 
That I know I'll probably should If I think good, it's gonna be good 
And I'll only say the words 
That I know a person should 
'Cause it ain't no secret 
No it ain't no secret 
'Cause it ain't no, no, no, no Heavy hands, gotta carry them lightly 
Carry them lightly, oh 
Heavy heart, so you better tread softly 
Better tread softly, oh You might trip 
You might fall If I'm beat down, feeling small 
I remember even giants have the tendency to fall 
If the actions of a man can change the entire universe 
I wanna change it for the better, 
I don't wanna make it worse If I do good, it has to be good 
And I'm gonna be much stronger 
Than I ever thought I could 
If I do good, it has to be good 
And I'm gonna be much stronger 
Than I ever thought I could 'Cause it ain't no secret 
No it ain't no secret 
'Cause it ain't no, no, no, no 
You know, know, know, know Heavy hands, gotta carry them lightly 
Carry them lightly, oh Heavy hands, gotta carry them lightly 
Carry them lightly, oh (no no no no no no no) 
Heavy heart, so you better tread softly 
Better thread softly, oh Heavy hands, gotta carry them lightly 
Carry them lightly, oh (no no no no no no no) 
Heavy heart, so you better tread softly 
Better thread softly, oh You might trip 
You might fall 
You might trip 
You might fall 
You might trip 
You might fall 
You might trip 
You might fall 
You might trip You might fall, you might fall
