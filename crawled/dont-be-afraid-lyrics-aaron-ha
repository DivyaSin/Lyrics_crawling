There's no need to be afraid, my baby 
I'm as gentle as a kitten Oh, baby, don't you be afraid 
I promise I won't hurt you, no way, no way 
And through the good times and the bad 
I said I will be right there hand in hand and side by side I'm always near to catch your teardrops 
From falling down your face and shield your lovely body 
Shield your lovely body from the cold 
Times when I am far away and I can't see the light of day 
I know that we can make it if we only pray Baby, don't be afraid 
Ain't no need, ain't no need, ain't no need 
Baby, don't be afraid, baby, baby, baby 
Baby, don't be afraid, baby 
Baby, don't be afraid, don't be afraid of me, baby I want to hold you tight tonight 
And so, please, girl, listen to me, I love you, lady 
No woman in this world can ever take your place 
So, baby, baby, don't you 
Baby, don't throw this relationship away Baby, don't be afraid, ain't no need, ain't no need 
Baby, don't be afraid, there's no need, there's no need to be afraid 
Baby, don't be afraid, don't you dare be afraid 
Baby, don't be afraid, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby [Incomprehensible] 
It sounds real good Baby, take my love you need 
I'm scared as you'll ever be 
Honey, just give me one more chance, don't be, don't be afraid 
I know what I did was wrong 
I couldn't sleep all night long Sweetheart, I love you 
Can't you see 
Don't be afraid 
Don't be afraid of me Can't be without your love, baby 
One day without you would drive me crazy 
All I think about is holding you all night long 
Don't be afraid of me You were sent from Heaven above 
You bring to me, so much love 
All I'm asking from you is don't be afraid 
Don't be afraid of me Baby, I love you, I'll never hurt you again 
Oh, come back to me, never leave me 
Oh, don't be afraid of me
