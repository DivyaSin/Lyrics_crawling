Your search for truth was all in vain 
A rude cerebral hurricane 
All you know is all you knew 
Has been turned around upside down Experimenting with your mind 
Will only leave you flaccid, fragmented inside 
And the things you think are so profound 
Are upside down, upside down Youth is squandered climbing trees 
And scraping skin off of our knees 
But the one thing we learn from falling down 
Is that it's no disgrace 
So won't you turn that frown upside down?
