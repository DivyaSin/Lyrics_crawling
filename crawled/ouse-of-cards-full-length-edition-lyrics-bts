Insecure again, Dangerous again 
So bad (why) us, Yeah... 
Enduring More, Holding out 
So Hard (Hard), We can't Even if you already knew 
We couldn't stop 
No way, No way, No way, Falling 
As Time passes by 
We only mess it up even more 
No way, No way, Its collapsing again A house made of cards, And us inside 
Even if you say you see the end 
Even if you say It'll collapse soon 
A house made of cards, And stupidly us 
Even if you say its a useless dream 
Just stay a little longer like this Like there's no tomorrow 
Like there's no next time 
Everything that you've done in front of my eyes 
Its complete darkness 
Say it like you mean it 
In the end, We can't make it 
Even so I keep hoping 
Even at the end, If you're with me, I'm okay Even if you already knew 
We couldn't stop 
No way, No way, No way, Falling 
As Time passes by 
We only mess it up even more 
No way, No way, Its collapsing again A house made of cards, And us inside 
Even if you say you see the end 
Even if you say It'll collapse soon 
A house made of cards, And stupidly us 
Even if you say its a useless dream 
Just stay a little longer like this Slow down the time 
Please stay for a little more oh Please Baby. Calm down 
Just a Little More Insecure again, Dangerous again 
So bad (why) us 
Enduring More, Holding out 
So Hard 
It's collapsing again A house made of cards, And us inside 
Even if you say you see the end 
Even if you say It'll collapse soon 
A house made of cards, And stupidly us 
Even if you say its a useless dream 
Just stay a little longer like this Oh
