One foot in front of the other 
Is hard as hell these days 
It's my choice, a case of any color 
What makes me walk away' One thought after another 
Round and round they go 
I've got to sit still, try to recover 
Breathe into what I know I know there's one god above us 
And that god made everything 
And it don't matter how you worship 
How you see the clothes he wore It's all the same 
It's all the same One truth over another 
My pride your misery 
Wrought this land from the hand of a brother 
In the name of Liberty Granddaddy fought, fought in the big war 
While they went without at home 
We sacrifice driving in our big cars 
Chariots of modern Rome I know there's one god above us 
And that god made everything 
And it don't matter how you worship 
How you see the clothes he wore It's all the same 
It's all the same One war after another 
Blind to history 
Those to come, will they forgive us' 
For this waste of life and energy One day after another 
Waiting for the Son 
We stake it all on the coming of a savior 
Who'll right all the wrong we've done I know there's one god above us 
And that god made everything 
And it don't matter how you worship 
How you see the clothes he wore It's all the same 
It's all the same
