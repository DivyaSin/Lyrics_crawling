Drinkin' was forbidden in my christian country home 
I learned to play the flattop on them good ol' gospel songs 
Then I heard about the barrooms just across the Georgia line 
Where a boy could make a livin' playin' guitar late at night Had to learn about the ladies; too young to understand 
Why the young girls fall in love with the boys in the band 
When the boys turn to music, the girls just turn away 
To some other guitar picker in some other late night place Yeah, I held on to my music; I let the ladies walk away 
Took my songs and dreams to nashville and then on to l.a. 
Up to new york city, all across the usa 
I lost so much of me but there's enough of me to say (that my) Chorus: 
..home's in alabama, no matter where I lay my head 
My home's in alabama, southern born and southern bred What keeps me goin'? I don't really know. 
Can't be the money the lord knows I'm always broke 
Could it be the satisfaction of bein' understood 
When the people really love ya and let you know when it's good Well I'll speak my southern english just as natural as I please 
I'm in the heart of dixie, dixie's in the heart of me 
And someday when I make it, when love finds a way 
Somewhere high on lookout mountain I'll just smile with pride and say that my Chorus
