Writing the lines as they come to me 
Scratching them out almost immediately 
Don't know what it's done to me It's cold and it's wet it's been raining all night 
And there's a letter I've been trying to write 
Something better waiting somewhere for me One of them is sitting on the wrong coast 
One awaits an answer by return post 
Waiting, waiting Try to remember how long it's been 
There was more to us than paper and pen 
Think how easy it is to conceal And I know when we're together again 
We'll be strangers for an hour and then 
We'll have to figure out if this thing is real One of them is sitting on the East coast 
One awaits an answer by return post 
Waiting, waiting Take a drink and staring out the window 
Wondering how long this can continue 
Waiting, waiting
