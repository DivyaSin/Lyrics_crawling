The big man ain't so big no more 
He's curled up on the basement floor 
His worldly goods around his feet 
He's lost his mind trying to keep 
The more you gain, the more you pray 
Nobody comes to take it all away But you're up there and I'm down here 
With just the stairs between our fears 
And walls made of foolish pride 
Don't let me hide Once I walked a troubled road 
Crusading for a ransom owed 
But any source of real joy contains 
An initiation of pain 
The more you build, the more you stay 
Behind to tend what you have made But you're up there and I'm down here 
With just the stairs between our tears 
And walls we can't see behind 
Don't let me hide The more you live, the more you're sure 
Some things are worth losing for But you're up there and I'm down here 
With just the stairs between our fears 
And walls we can live inside 
Don't let me hide
