[Intro] 
Clams Casino, ASAP (Wassup) 
See me in the hood the gangsters saying wassup (Wassup) [Verse 1] 
Back once again, sipping Henn, mixed with juice and gin 
Bitches in, couple lady friends countin Benjamins 
Spinners spin, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz 
Dividends made a change of plans well that all depends 
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG 
Kush mother fuck the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth 
So hood and we so street, sippin on that codeine 
We hustle hard no sleep, your bitch loose that's no leash 
I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars 
Talking 'bout no diamonds cause that shit is a facade 
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads 
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are [Hook] 
I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping 
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second 
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping 
Tell 'em quit the bitchin we gon' make it in a second 
See me in the hood the gangsters saying wassup (Wassup) [Verse 2] 
Pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of 
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror 
Yeah, clothes getting weirder 
Money get longer, pretty nigga pin your hair up 
The nerve of this dude but im cool as a fan 
40 ounce full of brew
