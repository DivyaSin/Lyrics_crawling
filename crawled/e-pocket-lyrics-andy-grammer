Do you want to be my love, my sight, my heart and my eyes 
My world, my pride, my stars in my skies 
I'm looking for a queen who's more than gorgeous on a movie screen 
I'm looking for the cover girl of dignified beauty magazine I want dimples, and simple symbols that she's sweet 
Wrinkles her nose, expose what I mean 
I'm looking for a four-course meal that isn't based in base desire 
I'm looking for a lady that knows the soul is more than an appetizer Just one more thing 
Just one more thing Do we fit in the pocket, 
Can we fix it back in the pocket 
When the dreams and the drums start rocking 
Can we dance with our knees not knocking knocking oh 
See I, I want a lady I can put stock in 
I want a bass and back beat to lock in 
I want to know real love's not forgotten I want a teacher who's eager to speak her mind 
Delicate features, sweet with her tongue so kind 
I'm looking for the markers that say "permanent" so we can share 
I'm looking for a love still alive and well in rocking chairs 
I want faithful, and stable, and able 
Beauty that moves me and improves my soul I'm looking for a shining light that likes to fight and persevere 
I'm looking for a lady that wants to make me part of her atmosphere Just one more thing 
Just one more thing Do we fit in the pocket, 
Can we fix it back in the pocket 
When the dreams and the drums start rocking 
Can we dance with our knees not knocking, knocking 
See I, I want a lady I can put stock in 
I want a bass and back beat to lock in 
I want to know real love's not forgotten All I need to know is 
All I need to know is 
All I need to know is Are you clear on who you are 
Do you love it? 
When this world starts getting hard 
Rise above it, rise above it In the pocket 
Can we fix it back in the pocket 
When the dreams and the drums start rocking, rocking 
Can we dance with our knees not knocking 
See I, I want a lady I can put stock in 
I want a base and backbeat to lock in 
I want to know real love's not forgotten not forgotten I said the pocket 
Can we fix it back in the pocket 
When the dreams and the drums start rocking, rocking 
Can we dance with our knees not knocking 
See I, I want a lady I can put stock in 
I want a base and back beat to lock in 
I want to know real love's not forgotten not forgotten 
Say oh
