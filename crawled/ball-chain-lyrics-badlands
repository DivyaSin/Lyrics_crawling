Alright 
Hey now won't ya listen 
About a tale of a heartbreak queen 
The kind of girl that makes Bogie fall 
On a late night movie screen She wraps a look around ya 
Turns a wise man to the fool 
Lord, save my soul 
`Cause I feel like I'm fallin' through 
I said yeah, alright Gimme that ball and chain now I hear the sound of sweet and rumble 
Every time that she walks on by 
Your song keeps burnin' in my ears 
Makes me wanna crawl deep inside Sweet jesus, it gives me trouble 
Something I don't understand 
The girl has got a chain around my heart 
Help me, Jesus, to the promise land 
Alright, alright Gimme that ball and chain now 
Oh, oh, shine 
Oh, oh, oh, fall Angelica, oh 
Oh, oh, oh Before too long I know 
You'll be back in my arms before too long 
Lord, save me now (Solo) Sweet sound of mercy 
Such a hard woman to know 
Her freedom flies like a golden bird 
It's makin' me lose control 
All I know is that I love her 
Sweet jesus, hear my plea 
All I know is that the heartbreak queen 
Is taking a piece of me, of me, of me 
Alright, alright Gimme that ball and chain now Gimme that ball and chain now 
Alright 
Well, gimme that ball and chain, yeah 
Ooh, oh, yeah
