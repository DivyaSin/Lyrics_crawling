Drank in a pub on a saturday night 
Me and the boys were feelin` alright 
Then we walked the streets feelin` loads of pride 
Proud with our roots and our way of lives... Stood some geezers tried to steal the night 
Stared at us, tried to pick a fight 
Me and the boys were waiting for the start 
As we prepared for an aggro, oh! what a night.... That`s the story of how our lives go 
We have been treated like a bunch of snucked up fools 
Scorned by many, understood by few 
There`s not much things left for us to do 
Don`t wanna go back to dark days of mine 
Where i`ve gone too far, i could`ve killed someone 
But i don`t wanna sit down behaving like a cunt 
While watching my mates doing the best they can In the streets of uptown 
Streets of uptown 
It is our ups and our downs..... 
And it goes around and around....
