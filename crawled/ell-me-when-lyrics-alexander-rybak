Shes at home 
I hope that she is sleeping 
And thus I fall asleep, well meet in dreams 
Christmas-time is magic after all 
Tell me when 
I am loosing my mind 
Cause I am in love Tonight Im all alone, but still Im happy 
Cause soon, so very soon, tomorrow comes 
But I cant wait to hold her in my arms 
Tell me when 
I am loosing my mind 
Cause I am in love Merry Christmas 
I am loosing my mind 
Cause I am in love
