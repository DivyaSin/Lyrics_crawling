Islands from the first time we saw 
We could wait for this moment, 
Like rocks on the shore 
We can never be closer somehow 
For the moments that lasts, 
Is this moment now [Chorus:] 
When the nights's on fire will you keep 
The Candlelight Burning 
Hold on to your hearts desire 
When you see one bird 
Into the wind another one's turning 
And the two can fly much higher We are Islands but never too far, 
We are Islands 
And I need your light tonight, 
And I need your light tonight, 
We are Islands but never too far, 
We are Islands 
And I need your light tonight, 
And I need your light tonight Islands never been to before 
And we climb so high 
To where the wild birds soar, 
There's a new path that we found just today 
I was lost in the forest 
And you showed me the way [Chorus] [Chorus]
