I can hear her heartbeat from a thousand miles 
Hear the heavens open every time she smiles 
And when I come to her that's where I belong 
Yet, I'm run into to her like a river strong She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love She got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down 
And when I come home to her when the sun goes down 
Takes my troubles all away, take away my grief 
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love Yes I need, yes I need her in the daytime 
And oh I need, yes I need her in the night 
I want to throw my arms all around her 
To kiss and hug and kiss and hug her tight 
And oh And when I'm returning from so far away 
She gives me sweet sweet lovin', brighten up my day 
It make me righteous and it makes me whole 
Makes me mellow, down into my soul She, she gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, crazy love 
One more time, she gives love, la la la love (crazy love) 
When I wake up in the morning 
She gives me love, love, love, 
Crazy Love
