Blood runs black 
As the demon engulfs time 
Brainwashed into your mind 
Try to fight your way to hell 
Try to find a soul to sell 
To appease this place of death 
Lose your mind with every breath 
Suffocate yourself to be free 
Life falls short to the demon sea 
Can you feel yourself die? 
Can you feel his hand descend? 
Can you feel yourself die? 
You are forgotten.
