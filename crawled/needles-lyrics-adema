To Live, Do you want to... Live! 
Do you want to live? 
Do you want to live? 
Do you want to live? I know this girl with a needle in her eye 
The red dragons fucking circles through her skull 
16 dragons to appease the tracks upon her soul 
Grip the shit twice a day, to shut out all the pain I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it anymore. 
Take this needle from my vein 
Take it from my vein 
All I feel is pain 
All I feel is pain 
Distantly live 
My blood stains The traps around me tell a tale, of what you heal and what you feel 
Do you want to live? Do you want to live? 
Take that needle, fly away, remove it from your eyes 
Do you want to live? Well, do you want to live? I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it anymore. 
Take this needle from my vein 
Take it from my vein 
All I feel is pain 
All I feel is pain 
Distantly live 
My blood stains When it all comes down, your the one thing in your life 
And you make the world that we hate inside 
Everything, is crying on me, it's gone, I've been gone, your gone I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it anymore. 
Take this needle from my vein 
Take it from my vein 
All I feel is pain 
All I feel is pain 
Distantly live 
My blood stains Why does everyone have answers, (problems) 
Everybody has answers (problems) Problems
