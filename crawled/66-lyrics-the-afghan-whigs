You walked in 
Just like smoke 
With a little come on, come on, come on 
In your walk 
Well, come on 
I've been waitin' 
Are you waitin? 
For my move, well I'm makin' it 
So tell me baby, can you shake it? 
If I can move it with ya 
Will you let me take it? 
I'll be down on my knees 
Screamin' take me, take me, take me, take me 
I'm yours 
I've never felt so out of control 
You don't even know what you're doin' to me 
Come on and do it to me 
Don'tcha stop 
Come on, come on 
Come on little rabbit 
Show me where you got it 
Cause I know you got a habit
