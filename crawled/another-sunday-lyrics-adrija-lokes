Verse 1 See the eyes of your lover 
telling lies of new age am I losing patience ? 
you're holding me like misery you say wait till tomorrow 
today's no good for the music you found another pass time 
is it so fucking amusing chorus it's another sunday,bring down your bloody walls, 
let the music roll,end the dirty war a beautiful sunday,hate the crazy steam 
tell your heart enough,free yourself from love verse 2 counting hours of freedom 
you earned from this cheating melting hearts are over, 
just fire and slow dreaming this is the last call lover 
come back to me baby i'll be living in denial 
and fast forward this meaness chorus it's another sunday,bring down your bloody walls, 
let the music roll,end the dirty war a beautiful sunday,hate the crazy steam 
tell your heart enough,free yourself from love verse 3 welcome to the jungle 
I missed you and your free ways (three ways :P) this is the life I choose now 
regret is a bitch and now you know it night after night 
it's a different babe i'm pleasing Now what makes you beg ? 
baby you are a mistake i'm not repeating
