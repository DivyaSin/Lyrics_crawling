Roller coaster 
I see you thinking twice 
Wish I could read your mind 
Move up or out of line 
Too late for praying 
I know we might lose our breath 
We might be scared to death 
This chance is like a step 
Just got to take it 
Whoa oh Countdown to here we go 
Oh oh oh 
Hold on tight, slide a little closer 
Up so high stars are on our shoulders 
Time fly's by, don't close your eyes 
Kiss by kiss love is a thrill ride 
What goes up might take us upside down 
Life ain't a merry go round It's a roller coaster 
It's a roller coaster Can't lie and won't pretend 
I know what's round the band 
Too late to start again 
Won't take it slower 
Let's slip right off these tracks 
We'll fly or we might crash 
Don't look down, don't look back 
'Cause it ain't over Hold on tight, slide a little closer 
Up so high stars are on our shoulders 
Time fly's by, don't close your eyes 
Kiss by kiss love is a like a thrill ride 
What goes up might take us upside down 
Life ain't a merry go round It's a roller coaster 
It's a roller coaster Whoa oh 
Countdown to here we go 
Oh oh 
Hold on tight, slide a bit closer 
Up so high the stars are on our shoulders 
It's a roller coaster 
Kiss by kiss love is like a thrill ride 
What goes up might take us upside down 
Life ain't a merry go round It's a roller coaster 
It's a roller coaster 
Roller coaster 
It's a roller coaster
