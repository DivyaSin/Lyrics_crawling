Two thousand years ago, there came a man 
A man who was hated and loved, worshiped and killed 
But what was this man all about and what did he do 
What made him different and why 
Did his name live on too [Chorus] 
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain 
There's no other name by which I'm saved 
I've got the power it's in my sights 
Because with him I'm not afraid to die Now I will disclose his name, it's Jesus Christ 
Why did he come just to die and how did he rise 
Why is our system of dating based on one man's death? 
And why is the world upside-down 
Cause of one man's life [Chorus] Now I must warn you they'll tell you don't need god 
They are the foolish and they are the ones who will burn, burn in hell 
But if you accept him you'll be born again 
Do it now! You will live! 
Feel the power of god like lead, 
Feel the metal from inside my head 
Feel the steel, take his flight 
For when it leaves, heaven will be in sight If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord 
And if you believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead, 
Then you will be saved and forgiven, you just have to ask 
He 'll never leave or forsake you, his promise is fact [Chorus]
