Some days are diamonds 
Some days are rocks 
Some doors are open 
Some roads are blocked 
Sundowns are golden 
And then fade away 
And if I never do nothing 
I'll get you back someday You got a heart so big 
It could crush this town 
And I can't hold out forever 
Even walls fall down All around your island 
There's a barricade 
It keeps out the dangers 
It holds in the pain 
Sometimes you're happy 
Sometimes you cry 
Half of me is ocean 
Half of me is sky 'Cause you got a heart so big 
It could crush this town 
I can't hold out forever 
Even walls fall down Somethings are over 
Somethings go on 
Part of me you carry 
And part of me is gone 'Cause you got a heart so big 
It could crush this town 
And I can't hold out forever 
Even walls fall down 'Cause you got a heart so big 
It could crush this town 
And I can't hold out forever 
Even walls fall down
