Oh, I come from a land, from a faraway place 
Where the caravan camels roam 
Where it's flat and immense 
And the heat is intense 
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home Oh, I come from a land, from a faraway place 
Where the caravan camels roam 
Where they cut off your ear 
If they don't like your face 
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home When the wind's from the east and the sun's from the west 
And the sand in the glass is right 
Come on down stop on by 
Hop a carpet and fly 
To another Arabian night Arabian nights, like Arabian days 
More often than not 
Are hotter than hot 
In a lot of good ways
