You can make the day seem right 
And make the darkness bright 
That's what you do 
Girl, don't hide your love away 
You'll want it back some day 
That's what they say And, my friend 
We're gonna make it right 
And play to the world tonight 
We'll play to the world Time, what's to become of me? 
What will the future see? 
What will they say? Life is like a passing dream 
It's never what it seems to be 
From day to day
