Friends is a word we use every day 
But most of the time we use it in the wrong way 
Some people say that they got your back 
But you can tell a true friend by the way they act And if you ask me now I can't be much help 
'Cause a friend's somebody you judge for yourself 
Doesn't matter what I think, I see 
Because a friend to you might not be a friend to me Some are mellow and they act cool 
Others treat you like you're a fool 
Some are always on your side 
And others just want to take you for a ride And this list goes on again and again 
But these are the people that we call friends Friends, how many of us have them? 
Friends, ones we can depend on 
Friends, how many of us have them? 
Friends, before we go any further let's be friends When we first hooked up, we barely knew each other 
I never thought you would be my lover 
Talking on the phone for hours at a time 
Or I was at your house or you were at mine And then came all the fights and all the problems 
Turned out that was all we had in common 
And even though we started out strong 
I guess, we went about the whole thing wrong And I should've known it would come to an end 
'Cause we became lovers before we were friends The list goes on and on, again and again and again and again 
True friends show you more than you can see 
But some people leave you on your knees 
With friends like that you don't need enemies
