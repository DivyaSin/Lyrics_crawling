I run, I fall, what ripped away, check my body out 
Was it body or soul 
The darkness fades, fades to the light 
Disappearing now, disappears from the night And all these nightmares I once had as a child 
The morning always came, it came too late 
What did my mind forget, forget to hide 
Could the nightmare be awake, I don't know In or out, up or down, never know its an illusion 
Round and round, on and on, every day spins my confusion Not again, not again, not again, this dream I can't awake 
What is real, what is real, what is real, it's getting hard for me to take 
What I need, what I need, what I need, a little somethin' I rely 
And the white sugar gently hides me Oh the sweet sugar saves me, it's the room that confines me 
Confines me...sweet sugar Yesterday back and forth, broken door no longer opens 
Breaking down, need it now, mother's sugar always loves me Not again, not again, not again, this dream I can't awake 
What is real, what is real, what is real, it's getting hard for me to take 
What I need, what I need, what I need, a little somethin' I rely 
And the white sugar gently hides me Oh the sweet sugar saves me, it's the room that confines me
