I'm a man who bites hard on the bullet of silence 
If only you could feel the pain I hide 
Know me, like I know you Still water running deep in the cavern of my soul 
So many roads lead nowhere 
Know me, like I know you Like a rock, waves clash over me 
Standing silent, waiting to be set free The rock, the rock, the rock 
Will never let you down 
The rock will never fall 
Or tumble to the ground 
The rock, the rock, the rock 
Will never let you down 
The rock will never fall 
Or tumble to the ground 
Like a rock I've been accused of being many things 
None of them ever hit the mark 
Know me, like I know you Like a rock, waves clash over me 
Standing silent, waiting to be set free The rock, the rock, the rock 
Will never let you down 
The rock will never fall 
Or tumble to the ground 
The rock, the rock, the rock 
Will never let you down 
The rock will never fall 
Or tumble to the ground 
Like a rock The rock, the rock, the rock 
Will never let you down 
The rock will never fall 
Or tumble to the ground 
The rock, the rock, the rock 
Will never let you down 
The rock will never fall 
Or tumble to the ground 
Like a rock Hiraeth, hiraeth, hiraeth, hiraeth
