Zombies walk and they do talk 
But they don't pronounce well. 
They don't comb their hair in mirrors 
And they really smell. 
Sometime, they come over 
To my house now late at night. 
They sit there and they cry to me 
That the world don't treat'm right. 
So we took them to the door 
'cause they couldn't see anymore. 
They were looking in the outdoor 
For the things that they have missed. 
And the only thing we knew 
As we started to look through 
Is we think we like this world 
And there is nothing, we might have missed. 
Zombies they can't tie their shoes 
And they don't run real well. 
They love to play hide 'n seek 
It was cool until they fell. 
Zombies aren't the worst thing man 
That I have ever seen. 
They can not just figure out 
Why the world thinks their so mean. 
Zombies aren't the worst thing 
That could happen to this world. 
I just wish they wouldn't drink so much 
'cause they get all the girls. 
Sometimes they come over to my house 
Now late at night. 
They sit there and they cry to me 
That the world don't treat them right.
