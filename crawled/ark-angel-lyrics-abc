Red ribbon rainbow 
A garland of gold for your hair 
Wherever you go 
I see faith crush despair 
In chaos find courage 
The answer to my prayer Lipstick... liner... perfume... soap 
Won't scrub this city or give it hope 
You're the antidote... you're an... Ark-Angel 
Do you dream about me too 
Ark-Angel 
When I dream I dream of you 
Ark-Angel 
But could I change this world for you? 
Ark-Angel 
You do... you do Whisper it softly 
Or scream your name out loud 
God built an angel 
In sun and sky and cloud 
Then heaven sent vengeance 
To a world that once stood proud Lipstick... liner... perfume... soap 
Won't scrub this city or give it hope 
You're the antidote... you're an... Ark-Angel 
Do you dream about me too 
Ark-Angel 
When I dream I dream of you 
Ark-Angel 
But could I change this world for you? 
Ark-Angel 
You do... you do... you do Icarus rising - flies too close to the sun 
Icarus falling - a moral for everyone 
You're the only one... You're an... Ark-Angel 
Do you dream about me too 
Ark-Angel 
When I dream I dream of you 
Ark-Angel 
But could I change this world for you? 
Ark-Angel 
Then fly... then fly... fly...
