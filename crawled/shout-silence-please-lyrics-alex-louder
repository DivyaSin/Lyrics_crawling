It's so hard to live in anthill 
Every deepest wish are common 
Carrying dreams instead of sticks and stones 
Similar one by one Silent waters of a dreamlake 
Turned to boiling lava ocean 
I want to have a place for myself and my dreams 
Place for myself and my dreams Shout silence please... Now it's rain in outerworld 
Wash away all angry faces 
Galleries of pictures on sand now destroyed 
Now I have place for my own. Draw on sand. Draw on sand. 
At last! At last! At last! 
I hold world in hand 
At last! At last! At last! 
Draw on sand. Draw on sand. 
At last! At last! At last! 
I hold world in my hand 
(At last! At last! At last!) 
World in hand. Shout silence please...
