She needed shelter from the rain 
She saw it on the sign 
It said 'We're open till midnight' 
(Open till midnight) I'm sorry by the way 
I came here just the other day 
And you look so familiar 
(Look so familiar) And maybe you and I can have a drink 
And start the night with a friendly conversation 
(You know) Can you and I be truthful now? 
What you runnin' away from? 
And then you numb the pain 
To make it through somehow 
What you runnin' away from? 
What you runnin' away from? She woke up at 4 A.M. 
To smoke a cigarette again 
And she stood in the doorway 
(Stood in the doorway) She said I love to watch you sleep 
Then hear the secrets that you keep 
And remember what my father told me 
(Told me) He said stay strong and don't forget to call 
But don't ever come back at all Can you and I be truthful now? 
What you runnin' away from? 
And then you numb the pain 
To make it through somehow 
What you runnin' away from? 
What you runnin' away from? Things don't turn out quite the way we planned, didn't you even try 
When you knew something steered you wrong again? When did you decide 
You don't belong here, you don't belong? 
(No) Can you and I be truthful now? 
What you runnin' away from? 
And then you numb the pain 
To make it through somehow 
What you runnin' away from? 
(What you runnin' away from?) Can you and I be truthful now? 
What you runnin' away from? 
(What you runnin' away from?) 
And then you numb the pain 
To make it through somehow 
What you runnin' away from? 
(What you runnin' away from?) I'm just a runaway, I seek the end you follow 
I cannot think today 
(What you runnin' away from?) I'm just a runaway, I seek the end you follow 
I cannot think today 
I'm just a empty shell
