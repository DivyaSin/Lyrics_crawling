Bind me, gag me take me to the bunnyranch. 
People dying kill me in the packing house. 
Even you have to win sometimes dear. 
Poison needle smoker, 
Break a broken window mind you. 
One kiss, two kiss I can make it look like that. 
Do me dolly, rape me in the parking lot. Even you have to win sometimes dear. 
Poison needle smoker, break a broken window mind you. 
Bind me, gag me take me to the bunnyranch. 
Bind me gag me take me to the bunnyranch. 
Those are the only songs from friends of mine that I have heard so far, 
Considering I don't live in the UK. 
I hope these lyrics helped you some
