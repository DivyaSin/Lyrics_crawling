I had a dream 
Of the wide open praire 
I had a dream 
Of pale morning sky 
I had a dream 
That we flew on golden wings 
And we were the same, just the same 
You and I Follow your heart 
Little child of the west wind 
Follow the voice 
That's calling you home 
Follow your dreams 
But always remember me 
I am your brother 
And under the sun We are like birds of a feather 
We are two hearts thrown together 
We will be forever as one 
My brother under the sun Whenever you hear 
The wind in the canyon 
If ever you see 
The buffalo run 
Where ever you go 
I'll be there beside you 
'Cause you are my brother 
My brother under the sun
