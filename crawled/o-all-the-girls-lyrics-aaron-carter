Nana nanana Nana nanana 
Nana nanana 
Lemme break it down I remember sunny days 
Chillin' on the beach 
And catchin' rays 
Shell toed shoes the girls would wear 
Pink bikinis everywhere 
Listenin' to CDs after dark 
Outkast blastin Rosa Parks 
There's so much that we've been through 
There's still so much more to do Growing up can be so strange 
But some things will never change 
To all the girls that had my back 
I'm with you when it's like that To all the girls that sang along with me 
To all the girls where I wanna be 
To all the girls from here across the sea 
I wanna thank you for being good to me To all the girls that I can't wait to see 
To all the girls that held it down with me 
To all the girls that gave me memories 
I wanna thank you for being good to me Nana nanana 
Nana nanana 
Being good to me 
Nana nanana 
I wanna thank you for being good to me Sometimes I sit and reminisce 
Of all the hot girls that I miss 
Tank tops with the low cut jeans 
All the guys know what I mean 
Hip hop style to retro rock 
All the girls that's on my block 
You've been down with me since one 
And we've only just begun Growing up can be so strange 
But some things will never change 
To all the girls that had my back 
I'm with you when it's like that To all the girls that sang along with me 
To all the girls where I wanna be 
To all the girls from here across the sea 
I wanna thank you for being good to me To all the girls that I can't wait to see 
To all the girls that held it down with me 
To all the girls that gave me memories 
I wanna thank you for being good to me Nana nanana 
Nana nanana 
Being good to me 
Nana nanana 
I wanna thank you for being good to me Come on, jump jump 
Come on, jump jump So let me hit you with one more 
Maybe I'll see you out on tour 
And we can do it all again, until then To all the girls that sang along with me 
To all the girls where I wanna be 
To all the girls from here across the sea 
I wanna thank you for being good to me To all the girls that I can't wait to see 
To all the girls that held it down with me 
To all the girls that gave me memories 
I wanna thank you for being good to me To all the girls that sang along with me 
To all the girls where I wanna be 
To all the girls from here across the sea 
I wanna thank you for being good to me To all the girls that sang along with me 
To all the girls where I wanna be 
To all the girls from here across the sea 
I wanna thank you for being good to me
