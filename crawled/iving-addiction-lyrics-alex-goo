Only a fool would change himself 
For a girl that lets him down, oh 
Only a fool would take a chance 
A love that could never last And now I sit here on my own 
And dream of a girl that I used to know 
I can't take her off my eyes again 
'Cause she's my living addiction I know I'll do it again but I don't know why 
(Every day she's my living addiction) 
I wanna know why this feeling feels so right 
(Every day she's my living addiction) Oh she's the one that you know you're waiting on 
(Every day she's my living addiction) 
I know I'll do it again but I don't know why 
(Every day she's my living addiction) Every day she's my living addiction, yeah 
And if I ever get the chance 
I'm gonna face it like a man, oh 
I need to take my own advice 
I can finally realize And now I sit here on my own 
And dream of a girl that I used to know 
I can't take her off my eyes again 
'Cause she's my living addiction I know I'll do it again but I don't know why 
(Every day she's my living addiction) 
I wanna know why this feeling feels so right 
(Every day she's my living addiction) Oh she's the one that you know you're waiting on 
(Every day she's my living addiction) 
I know I'll do it again but I don't know why 
(Every day she's my living addiction) I was stuck in this rut so long 
I've been thinking it's time to save my life 
I'm convinced it's just a phase 
But every day I lose my mind 
If I never came back and I lost my head 
Would I be better off tonight 
Just one way to find... out I would do it again but I don't know why 
(Every day) 
I wanna know why this feeling feels so right, yeah I know I'll do it again but I don't know why 
(Every day she's my living addiction) 
I wanna know why this feeling feels so right 
(Every day she's my living addiction) Oh she's the one that you know you're waiting on 
(Every day she's my living addiction) 
I know I'll do it again but I don't know why 
(Every day she's my living addiction)
