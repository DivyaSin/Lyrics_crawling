Oh, oh yeah I miss all, all your love. 
Oh, yeah yeah. I miss all, all this now. 
I think that I found the truth, I think that love is no more 
Without explaining love it made its move 
Said goodbye and walk through my door 
Chorus 
I miss pain, I miss hope, I miss change now you're gone 
I miss all, all your love. 
I miss days, I miss nights, making up when we fight 
I miss all, all this now. 
On the sky, I've never seen so grey 
It's been grey for so long 
So god forgive me, I never used to pray 
I've been praying every night, girl, since you've been gone. 
(Chorus) 
All you said and all you did, It's all your loving that I miss 
All, all your love 
All your love and all your hate, but give it up this mistake 
All, all this now, yeah. 
Without explaining love it made its move 
Said goodbye and walked through my door 
(Chorus)
