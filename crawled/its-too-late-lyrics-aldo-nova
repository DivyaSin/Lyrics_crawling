You call me on the telephone 
And you say you'll never do it again 
But you've hurt me once too often dear 
And it's just a little late to repent All your beggin' and pleadin' won't help you 
And your lying' and cheatin', I'll take no more 
'Cause I told you before and I'll tell you again Chorus: 
You liar, liar 
It's too late, it's too late 
It's too late, it's too late I know, that I never wanna see you again 
And now don't you go, tellin' lies about me to your friends 
'Cause I've heard them before and you know it 
That's I've waited this long just to show it 
So take all of your heartaches and leave me alone 
'Cause I know, you know, they know It's too late - I've walked out the door 
It's too late - To tell me you're sorry 
It's too late - To go any higher 
You liar, liar, liar So you call me on the telephone 
Sayin' that you'll never do it again 
But you've hurt me once too many times 
And now I'm afraid it's the end. All your beggin' and pleadin' won't help you 
And you're lying' and cheatin' I'll take no more 
'Cause I told you before and I'll tell you again 
That I know, you know, and they know Chorus: (A) 
It's too late - I've walked out the door 
It's too late - To tell me you're sorry 
It's too late - To go any higher 
You liar, liar, liar (Repeat (A) till end)
