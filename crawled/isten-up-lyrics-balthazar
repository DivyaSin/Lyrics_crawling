There is no one to say: "I can't get in your head" 
But I, well, I can see the night which you wed You're trying so many notes and joining with the quo 
But know mine is the one that will clear your throat Hold your sigh before I get tired of your ways to turn a blind eye 
Hold your sigh before I get tired of your ways to turn a blind eye Now listen up, now listen once again 
before we start this, before we begin 
This isn't mine to win, it was never mine to say anything. 
But listen up, yes listen once again, 
I know you're looking for the truth within, another poet's sin, for all concern I ask stop listening Hold your sigh before I get tired of your ways to turn a blind eye 
Hold your sigh before I get tired of your ways to turn a blind eye Now listen up, now listen once again 
before we start this, before we begin 
This isn't mine to win, it was never mine to say anything. 
But listen up, yes listen once again, 
I know you're looking for the truth within,another poet's sin, for all concern I ask stop listening Now listen up, now listen once again 
before we start this, before we begin 
This isn't mine to win, it was never mine to say anything. 
But listen up, now listen once again, 
I know you're looking for the truth within,another poet's sin, for all concern I ask stop listening Now listen up, now listen once again 
before we start this, before we begin 
This isn't mine to win, it was never mine to say anything. 
But listen up, now listen once again, 
I know you're looking for the truth within,another poet's sin, for all concern I ask stop listening
