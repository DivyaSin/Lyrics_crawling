(Verse 1 - A$AP Rocky) 
My attire, you require 
It's imperial 
So fire, devour anything, I mean I've been 
Close to power, just realize and devour 
I'm riding Mario Kart, I think I might pick Bowser 
I need mothaf**king housing 
I need s**t that's off the yowzer 
But tell that bi**h to come through, f**k a ni**a, man 
Hell to club (Verse 2 - Tyler, the Creator) 
Young T came through with the new whip 
I ain't even got a new bi**h, I'm with my old one 
Got a ni**a named Scooty, got an old gun 
And if you want some, you don't want that, ni**a 
Got the green hat cause it match the pockets 
Get cats, cats, dogs, frogs and all 
F**k that, ni**a, got a problem? 
Ni**a gotta solve em, ni**a know your mama 
Know where his family lives (Verse 3 - A$AP Rocky) 
Come through this s**t applying dirt 
My ni**a Tyler got Hawaiian shirt 
Got the Dior bomber, I ain't no farmer 
I'll tell your papa I'll pop the llama 
F**k you talking bout? Don't want no drama 
Ain't know, they better show you, boy 
Stole you, boy, I thought I told you, boy 
I'll f**k your girl, ho on the Polaroid (Verse 4 - Tyler, the Creator) 
Shout my ni**a J, shout my ni**a Trav 
Shout my ni**a Dom, should my ex-girlfriend's moms 
Cause I f**ked her too 
And I'll f**k you in the mouth if you've got a problem 
F**k your crew and everybody that you know 
I don't got a problem, ni**a, woah 
Rolling down Slauson in all red, woah 
I don't really play the thugger but I know (Verse 5 - A$AP Rocky) 
Tell that bi**h to see me good 
Told that bi**h to hit me good 
And your man won't beat me good 
See it on Golf Media 
F**k you mean? I'm high as s**t 
F**k you mean you fly as this? 
Why you talking lies and s**t? 
Tell that bi**h to slide my d**k (Outro - Tyler, the Creator) 
I got a fat ass 
I got a fat ass 
I got a fat ass 
And I hit it 
I got a fat ass
