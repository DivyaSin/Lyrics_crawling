Oooh, ooh, ooh, Reach inside your mind, 
'Cuz we don't ask for much. 
Dream, it's a beautiful sleep, 
and we don't ask for much at all. It's heavy on my heart, 
when you gonna start, it's another world. 
Caught in between all the lies, 
you run, you're spun around. {Chorus} 
Why did you wait so long? 
(When were you planning on saying) 
Fear that I might be wrong 
(That you were after it all along) 
Who says you need to plan it all? 
You had it all, we had it all. Caught inside getting real, 
coincide with the fear, 
Step outside before the dawn, 
before you're gone. Somebody's road to roam is another man's home. 
I'll take you home, you hold too close, 
too close for comfort. {Chorus} 
Why did you wait so long? 
(When were you planning on saying) 
Fear that I might be wrong 
(That you were after it all along) 
Who says you need to plan it all? 
You had it all, we had it all. Caught inside getting real, 
coincide with the fear, 
Step outside before the dawn, 
before you're gone. Why make it all bigger? 
Why make it up? 
Why make it all bigger? 
Why make it up? Caught inside getting real, 
coincide with the fear, 
Step outside before the dawn, 
before you're gone. Caught inside getting real, 
coincide with the fear, 
Step outside before the dawn, 
before you're gone.
