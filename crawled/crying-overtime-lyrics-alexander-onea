It's another sleepless night without you there 
Things didn't turn out right, time to move on 
Every night the tears fall from my eyes 
To wash away the loneliness 
Long after you're tears are dried 
I'll be crying overtime Life just ain't so cold with a lonely heart 
But it's so hard to let go of this love I feel for you 
For every night the tears fall from my eyes 
To wash away the loneliness 
Until I get you off my mind 
I'll be crying overtime And every night the tears fall from my eyes 
To wash away the loneliness 
Until I get you off my mind 
I'll be crying See that I'm crying 
Yes, yes I'm crying baby, yeah 
Can't you see that, can't you see that I need 
I need you woman, I need you girl, oh baby 
Come inside with me 
Oh, overtime, overtime, overtime
