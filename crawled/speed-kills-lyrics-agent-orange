they can't make things worse for me, 
sometimes id rather die 
they can tell me lots of things, 
but i cant see eye to eye 
i know they know the way i think, 
know they always will 
someday im gunna change my mind, 
sometimes id rather kill blood stains, speed kills 
fast cars, cheap thrills 
rich girls, fine wine 
ive lost my sense, ive lost control, ive lost my mind things seem so much different now, the scene has die away 
i havent got a steady job and ive got no place to stay 
well its a, futuristic modern word, 
things arent what they seem, 
someday youd better wake up 
from this stupid fantasy blood stains, speed kills 
fast cars, cheap thrills 
rich girls, fine wine 
ive lost my sense, ive lost control, ive lost my mind (solo) blood stains, speed kills 
fast cars, cheap thrills 
rich girls, fine wine 
ive lost my sense, ive lost control, ive lost my mind
