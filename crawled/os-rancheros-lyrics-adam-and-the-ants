a few dollars more 
they'll hang me high 
but still me spirit 
will survive there's money over there 
but not for long 
soon my worries 
will be gone rancheros (Clint) 
rancheros (Eastwood) 
rancheros (Clint) 
rancheros and there's a bullet with my name on it times-a-coming 
when a new breed say 
welcome tomorrow 
instead of yesterday my times-a-coming 
when those despised 
take shelter in the power 
of my Kiowa eyes
