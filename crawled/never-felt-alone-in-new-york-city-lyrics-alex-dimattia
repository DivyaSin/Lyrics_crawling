I never felt alone in New York City 
I never felt alive till I met you 
I never felt alone in New York City 
Some how New York always knew I sit down on that subway Seat 
And a man lies next to me 
I'm dreaming about that Princess Grace 
She's got a smile I can't escape 
He says boy get out what's in that case 
And fill the air with something sweet 
I said I only have this broken heart 
And he said that's all right with me So I never felt alone in New York City 
I never felt alive till I met you 
I never felt alone in New York City 
Some how New York always knew So I carry on singing my sad song 
Beneath the City Streets 
If you listen very close to dawn 
You can hear the city speak 
And though it might just sound like noise to some 
It's beautiful to me 
As it accompanies the rising sun 
Like an urban symphony They say the city never sleeps 
So grab a dream then hit the streets 
You may be out there on your own 
But you'll never be alone in New York No you'll never be alone 
No you'll never be alone So I jump off at 34th street 
And drag my feet because I know 
That the only time I start feeling alone 
Is when I catch that train back home 
Home But I never felt alone in New York City 
I never felt alive till I met you 
I never felt alone in New York City (Never felt alone) 
Some how New York Some how New York 
Some how New York always knew
