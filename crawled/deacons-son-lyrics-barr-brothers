Im a deacons son 
Lazy as the day is long 
Could be anyone, 
But Im a deacons son 
Have a one eyed dog 
Scaring up the hens and hogs 
Scaring up the hens and hogs 
Have a one-eyed dog 
Found a little friend 
Buried in the rocks and sands 
Buried in the rocks and sand 
Found a little friend 
Im a deacons son 
Lazy as the day is long 
Lazy as the day is long Im a deacons son 
Gonna see if you wanna 
Go look at the fauna 
Walking in the moonlight 
Somethings has really chilled ya 
I just wanna thrill ya 
And nothing more 
Have a one eyed dog 
Scaring up the hens and hogs 
Scaring up the hens and hogs Have a one-eyed dog 
Im a deacons son 
Lazy as the day is long 
As the day is long 
Im a deacons son 
Gonna see if you wanna 
Go look at the fauna 
Walking in the moonlight 
Somethings has really chilled ya 
I just wanna thrill ya 
And nothing more 
Funny we really thought is 
To be so hypnotic 
With the lights on the water
