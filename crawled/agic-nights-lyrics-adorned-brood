Exhausted and near death 
Tyrael perceives a light in the dark 
A few steps in front of a little house 
He drowns in deep unconsciousness Dagaz, a nice young demigoddess 
Owner of this house 
Picks him up and cares for him 
Until he arouses When he looked into her eyes 
Both fell in deep love 
It's clear, they'll spend some magic nights 
And hope they'll stay together so long Attracted by her smile 
Tyrael knows that he found the one 
The one to stay near by 
The one to live with side by side Dagaz is now sad and worried 
She knows that she'll get a child 
But it's not the baby, it's not Tyrael 
It's the premonition of war that makes her wild When they looked into their eyes 
Both fell in deep love 
Now as they spent some magic nights 
Their luck is over
