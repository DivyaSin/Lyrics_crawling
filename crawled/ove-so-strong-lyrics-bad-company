Yeah, alright now, alright, alright, alright 
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright 
Listen It took me some time to believe my eyes 
Well, thinking back now I must have been blind 
Just sixteen years old and I'm coming on strong 
When she said, "Yes", my resistance was gone So come with me hold on tight 
Make it together, light up the night 'Cause it's love so strong 
And her legs are too long 
I don't care if it's wrong 
If it's right no, no, right now You might think that I'm just having my fun 
It's so much more than just a hit and run 
You've got to find the stick, yeah and my head it'll spin, yeah 
If loving is wrong I'm guilty as sin So come with me hold on tight 
Make it together, light up the night 'Cause it's love so strong 
And her legs are too long 
I don't care if it's wrong 
If it's right no, no, right now, come on Your vision never fades away 
I keep on thinking 'bout you night and day 
Hold my hand and let me hold you tight 
You know, babe, gonna love you tonight You know baby, I wanted to ooh you 
I wanted to lick you down So come with me hold on tight 
Make it together, light up the night 'Cause it's love so strong 
And her legs are too long 
I don't care if it's wrong 
If it's right no, no, right now Ooh well, it's love so strong 
And her legs are too long 
I don't care if it's wrong 
If it's right no, no, right now 'Cause our loves so strong 
And her legs, legs are too long 
I don't care if it's wrong 
If it's right no, no, right now Oh right now, oh love's so strong 
What an absolute bugger?
