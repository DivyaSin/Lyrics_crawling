Do you know Fred? I know I should have learned to speak properly in order to form a rock group in England, sorry for that, after all you have dumped the runes for people like the Normans and me. 
You know, things like Beowulf, Chaucer or even Shakespeare. But here I am 
just a homey who knows some Smiths lyrics, a grotesque amalgamation pleading for something else than baby talk, looking for my FOXP2. Let me tell you about Fred. The FT hypothesis describes us all attempting to simplify lives by language. 
And a 6ft Fortean Times reader could be a nurse too. 
Our lives, mate 
Crossed by case But I keep going, code-switching 
lacking grammar and vocabulary 
just trying not to become a pigeon Yeah, amalgamation, amalgamation 
It's a pidgin living, this outsider jargon Barins let off, 
All Calque lyrics, creole rock, such a pidgin life 
It's a pidgin living, slightly a living language A bar in my head
