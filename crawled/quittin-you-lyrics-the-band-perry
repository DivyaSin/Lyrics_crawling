I'd rather sit alone at home that one more round of, Oh man I'm quitting, (quitting), quitting,(quitting) quitting, I'm quitting you 
Like a gambler leaving Vegas, boy, you know that I'll miss you 
But I'm quitting, (quitting), quitting, (quitting) 
Quitting, I'm not kidding I'm kicking you, 
'Cause you're my bad habit and I'm quitting Cold turkey, giving you the cold shoulder,
