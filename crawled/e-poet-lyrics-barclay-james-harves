Here I sit watching the day out 
No one beside me who may doubt 
All of the words that I could chose to say 
So listen, believe, or be gone from this day I need a friend to walk with me 
And sit in the shade of an old tree 
To think nothing much, just agree with my thoughts 
To say nothing much, never tell what I ought Watching the people pass by now 
They just don't know why or know how 
They don't seem to care about all that I've seen 
They just walk on by never knowing I've been 
Sitting up here where I'm wind blown 
Only to ask and to be shown 
Things that would make you believe what I say 
I'll tell you myself and I'll show you some day
