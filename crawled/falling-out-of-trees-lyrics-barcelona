Fall, fall out of trees into the street on my own 
I finally found out how long I can hang on 
Oh, I got this all wrong, my heart is scared, my heart is gone 
Now looking around, there's no one here to hear my fall White, white as a sheet, I saw a ghost, I think it was me 
I've got to get out, out of this town, it's scary 
Sometimes when I sleep I miss my home, I miss my tree 
But now it's up to them to carry me back up to the top I've got this now, my legs are steady now 
The angels warned me never to fall down I've got this now, my legs are steady now 
The angels warned me never to fall down
