[Chorus] 
I'm down with the way that you want me to be 
And I would do anything for you baby 
I'm down with the way that you want me to be 
And I would do anything for you Boy there's no need to look no further 
Cause everything you want is right here 
And I don't mind giving you what you want 
Just as long as you stay near me [Bridge] 
Put a message in a bottle baby 
And send it to me, I'll come runnin' to you 
because baby I'm down [Chorus] I have no doubt in my mind you are the one for me 
So there is no need to be insecure see 
I'm so glad to know we got a street thing going on 
So here I am baby, just bring your loving on, on, on [Bridge] 
Put a message in a bottle baby 
And send it to me, I'll come runnin' to you 
because baby I'm down [Chorus] I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down 
Everything's gonna be alright [Repeat: x4] [Chorus: Repeats]
