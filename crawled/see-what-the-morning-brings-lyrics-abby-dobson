Whys it always such a big surprise 
When you let me know whats going on inside 
A secret truth 
Everywhere 
But now youre standing so bare I dreamed of love 
With an open palm 
But now your fingers start to curl 
I lay my head against the stone 
Am I, am I, not your girl I know 
That love comes and it goes 
I want it 
To stick around this time I touched the bottom of the cake 
And now I dont know what to say 
It feels like we 
Are worlds apart 
But you are just a room away Are you a memory or are you a dream 
I seem to conjure you from both 
Are your pools blue? 
Or grey-green? 
Is my love deep enough? I know 
Love comes and it goes 
I want it to 
Stick around this time 
This time, this time 
This time Will we see what the morning brings? 
See what the morning brings 
See what the morning brings 
See what the morning brings Can I trust the man 
Who loves another? 
Or do I want a man 
Who can only love me? Is this the middle? 
Is this the end? 
Lets walk a little 
We shall See what the morning brings 
See what the morning brings 
See what the morning brings 
See what the morning brings 
See what the morning brings 
See what the morning brings 
See what the morning brings 
See what the morning brings Natures taking over
