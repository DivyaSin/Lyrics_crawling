Every time I try to make it, make it happen 
I just fake it, I think it's over and I blink, it's over 
Every time I screw up, I never let up 
And I keep forgetting to think it over 'cuz I blink, it's over Every time I close my eyes 
And every time I close my eyes 
Every time I close my eyes 
And every time I sit there hoping 
You go on holding my hand in yours 
So stay, yeah stay forever Every day it's getting colder 
And I find I'm getting older 
Need warmer climes 
Need warmer climes now Need a land with warming sun 
And a heart whose every beat is one 
That keeps your time 
Keeps your time somehow Every time I close my eyes 
And every time I close my eyes 
Every time I close my eyes 
And every time I sit there hoping 
You go on holding my hand in yours 
So stay, yeah stay forever Hoping 
You go on holding my hand in yours 
So stay, yeah stay forever Every time I close my eyes 
And every time I close my eyes 
Every time I close my eyes 
And every time I sit there hoping 
You go on holding my hand in yours 
So stay, yeah stay forever Hoping 
You go on holding my hand in yours 
So stay, yeah stay forever Hoping 
You go on holding my hand in yours 
So stay, yeah stay forever
