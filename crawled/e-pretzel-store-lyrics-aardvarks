Music & Lyrics By:Laurie Berkner So I went down to the pretzel store 
'Cause I wanted to buy one or two more 
Let me tell you all about those crazy shapes 
Twisty, curvy, holey, and straight 
But I don't want to eat pretzels today 
'Cause these tricky pretzels turned into birds 
And flew away 
Everyday 
They flew away 
Oh, those tricky pretzels So I went back to the pretzel store 
'Cause I wanted to buy one or two more 
Let me tell you all about that yummy flavory 
Salty, sweet, and a little bit savory 
But I don't want to eat pretzels today 
'Cause these tricky pretzels turned into rainbow fish 
And swam away 
Everyday 
They swam away 
Oh, those tricky pretzels So I went back to the pretzel store 
'Cause I wanted to buy one or two more 
Let me tell you all about those favorite toppings 
Chocolate dipped and honey whipped 
But I don't want to eat pretzels today 
'Cause these tricky pretzels turned into horses 
And galloped away 
Everyday 
They galloped away 
Oh, those tricky pretzels 
"Neigh!"
