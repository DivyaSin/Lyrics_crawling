No reason to feel that way 
But closed minds won't always change their ways 
No hard feellings, but this I must say 
Start a fire, and we'll make it pay We're gonna follow you 
Follow you up 
We're gonna be there too Another critic, the oldest profession 
One more "expert", an endless procession 
No hard feelings, but this you must know 
You need a lesson in rock and roll Judge not, lest you be judged yourself 
Curse not, you may be cursed as well 
If the music doesn't move you, then leave it alone 
You'll understand when we all get home 
And when you stand before the Father's throne 
Robed in glory, you won't be alone 
Rock and roll is just a job we do 
When its time to go, we'll be right behind you
