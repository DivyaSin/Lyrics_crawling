I saw you the very first time 
Built so pretty 
You looked just right 
It was love at first sight 
I looked real close 
I touched your arm 
My heart went off like a fire alarm 
I was amplified Something happens 
When I hold you in my hands 
I'm a different man 
Something happens 
And I lose all sense of time 
I can almost fly Everytime I go to pick you up 
I feel a little spark in my fingertips 
I'm electrified 
The magic touch 
You feel so good 
The way you respond to everything I do 
I'm magnetized Something happens 
When I hold you in my hands 
I'm a different man 
Something happens 
And I lose all sense of time 
I can almost fly
