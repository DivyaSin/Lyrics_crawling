Shadows of the night 
Moving on the ground 
Like silent clouds 
They follow me around 
As I wander through the dark 
Through the midnight mist 
Remembering our last kiss 
Do you know how much you're missed Tonight I stand in this lonely place 
I search the heavens 
For some saving grace 
And I cry 
Dying without you 
I know you're somewhere 
Looking up there too 
Right now that's all two distant 
Hearts can do 
At least we're underneath 
Underneath the same moon Picturing your face 
Flowers in your hair 
Like you always wear 
I can see you there 
Longing to be touched 
But you're out of reach 
Hold on please 
Won't you wait for me Tonight I stand in this lonely place 
I search the heavens 
For some saving grace 
And I cry 
Dying without you 
I know you're somewhere 
Looking up there too 
Right now that's all two distant 
Hearts can do 
At least we're underneath 
Underneath the same moon At least we're underneath 
Underneath the same moon Shadows of the night 
Moving on the ground 
Like silent clouds 
They follow me around
