Jump the Broom 
Adrienne Young / Will Kimbrough "Join two hands, this broom step over 
take a sweet kiss from your own true lover Diamond birthright Painted Flower 
Seventeen years and sixteen hours 
Out the window stares a girl 
Kentucky wonder head full of curls 
She aint my mama this aint my world 
Too much swine for just one Pearl Jump the broom, jump the broom 
Fly me away from this dark room 
Cant go too far cant leave too soon 
Love take my hand lets jump the broom Broken bottle on the floor 
Whiskey drippin down through the boards 
Old man shoutin come back and fight 
Young man run into the night Was late ast summer down by the creek 
Two young lovers fell warm and sweet 
Kindred spirits kindred scars 
Jordans Banks didnt seem so far Jump the broom, jump the broom 
Fly me away from this dark room 
Cant go too far cant leave too soon 
Love take my hand lets jump the broom New moon risin dark and still 
Pearls a droppin from her windowsill 
Tears burn and gather in brown eyes 
Little sister waves goodbye Now young Coreys waitin down by the gate 
Cant call the preacher 
Its much too late 
But that dont stop his bended knee no no Pretty Pearl girl marry me! Jump the broom, jump the broom 
Fly me away from this dark room 
Cant go too far cant leave too soon 
Love take my hand lets jump the broom
