I keep waiting for the moment to arrive 
When the words I say get through to you 
I need to keep this little dream of mine alive 
But I need you too I am One of Two 
One of everything I thought I held true 
And theres always room for another point of view 
We are one all together 
We are two, me and you You wont see me you dont know me anymore 
A million cracks and I keep falling through 
Im a step away from walking out the door 
But you need me too I am One of Two 
One of everything I thought I held true 
And theres always room for another point of view 
We are one all together 
We are two, me and you
