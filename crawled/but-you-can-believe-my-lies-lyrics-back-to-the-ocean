You're right that maybe 
We've forgotten our cracks to be mended 
Tears on your face I've got my baby 
She's away not to be heard 
But I've heard her 
She was calling my name... You're so beautiful 
How I need you 
I've got no words for this 
I need you, I want you, I feel 
I have got no fucking words for this 
But I don't love you But you can believe my lies 
And you can believe your dreams 
And you can confess this time in your whispers 
But we could never be 
Together never be What am I supposed to do now? 
Who I am what I am who I'll be 
after we do it who I'll be? I need you I want you I feel 
I have got no fucking words for this 
But I don't love you 
But I don't love you So you can believe my lies 
And you can believe your dreams 
And you can confess this time in your whispers 
But we could never be 
Together never be So you can believe my lies 
In all your darkest hours 
you can believe your dreams 
And you can confess this time in your whispers 
But we could never be 
Together never be
