In the beginning, I believed every word that you said 
Now that you're gone my world is in shreds 
Oh you loved me and left me 
You took all the things that I needed so bad 
I'm standing here wondering where is the love that I had oh CHORUS: 
Give me silver, blue and gold 
The color of the sky I'm told 
My rainbow is overdue In the beginning, there was something of love that was mine 
Now that it's gone, whoa I'm crying 
Oh the time that it takes for a love to grow cold 
is a wonder to me 
I'm walking around with my head hanging down 
tell me where is she CHORUS 
Don't forsake me cause I love you 
Don't forsake me cause I love you CHORUS 
CHORUS 
Now CHORUS Oh Don't forsake me cause I love you 
Don't forsake me cause I love you
