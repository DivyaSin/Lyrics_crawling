Music has made my life worth living 
Music is all about loving and giving 
Now that I say goodbye to my friends 
I go singing to heaven, singing to heaven High on a mountain I'm learning to fly 
Spreading my wings and rising up high 
Crossing the oceans, go through the motions 
Music is all about love and devotion I'm a believer, highest degree 
Music has always set the world free 
Best of intentions, higher dimensions 
Rice to the sky on my day of ascension Music has made my life worth living 
Music has made my life worth living Take on a challenge, go for a ride 
Angels of heaven will stand by my side 
Sonic invention, life in extension 
Rice to the sky on my day of ascension Music has made my life worth living 
Music has made my life worth living 
Singing to heaven, singing to heaven 
Music has made my life worth living 
Music has made my life worth living
