I see the happy family tree 
It sways so easily 
We're smiling all the time 
This world just isn't mine We watch it burn and we never learn 
This can't be what you're waiting for 
Staring into the sun, we eat our young 
This can't be what you're waiting for Just take it easy on yourself 
Forget all the stupid things we say 
I know you beat up on yourself 
I know, I know it's in your blood You say what no one understands 
The seeds are in your hands 
The branches break your bones 
I can't just leave you alone and watch you squirm
