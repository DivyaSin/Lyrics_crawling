[refrain] 
Just wanna get close to you and love you, say I do 
Just wanna get close to you, to your heart 
Wanna wake up and see your face and love you day by day 
I wanna get close to you, or nothing at all 
[verse] 
You'll never know how much I think about you all day long 
When I'm with you a new existence starts, it shines from up above 
Don't be afraid, it's okay slowly we can take it 
And cherish every little moment, like lovers do 
Now I understand I only wanna make it work with you 
Give me your hand, I'll take you in my world with a love so true 
No second chance I promise I'm gonna take you higher 
Serenade you with love songs that you want me to 
[repeat refrain] 
[verse] 
And every night I'm craving for your love, I want you next to me 
And everyday I want to know you're home just waiting patiently 
Talk to me and tell me all your heart's desires 
I'm gonna make you happy, give sweet love to you 
So be with me, you won't look back, lets light the fire 
And let it burn until we both get hotter & hotter & hotter 
Now can't you see there's no pretending all I want is you 
Realize my loving, baby make your move 
[repeat refrain] 
[bridge] 
Just wanna be loved by you 
I wanna give my soul, my everything 
So please, baby, let me in 
I just want to get with you 
[repeat refrain]
