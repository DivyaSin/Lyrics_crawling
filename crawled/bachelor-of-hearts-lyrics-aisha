Intro: He's the bachelor of hearts 
Don't even start He's got a degree 
in being a single man 
and breaking hearts is his only plan 
He's out everyday 
Searching for his prey 
Chasing anyone that passes his way 
If you know like me 
You will be 
On your best behavior 
Because he is a player 
He can sense insecurity a mile away 
Like a shark and its prey 
When he zeros in 
You'll think a hero's in the room 
Then he's gone real soon 
He knows no love 
Only lust 
He knows no fidelity 
Only mistrust 
He's always smiling and winking 
Laughing and blinking 
Girl what are you thinking Chorus: Bachelor of hearts 
Don't even start 
His pedigree 
Is of a Labrador Retriever 
He'll pick up any bird 
Then leave her 
He's got a degree in misogyny 
That's not a catch 
There is a catch Verse 2: Stop going in the wrong direction 
Every woman you meet 
You add to your collection 
You play with emotions 
Like it's a notion 
Broken hearts 
Like sands to the ocean 
You give good men a bad name 
Playing this game 
You have the potential to be a good man 
I don't understand 
Why do you feel the necessity to act this way 
What a game you play Repeat Chorus Rap: The bachelor of hearts 
Always playing his part 
Always at the party 
Looking fool hardy 
Always at the club 
Looking for love 
Be real for a change 
Stop playing games 
Do you even remember their names? 
Or have you lost count 
At the sheer amount 
You'll flirt with anything in a skirt 
It doesn't matter who ends up getting hurt 
Then he set his sights on me 
Thinking I would fall for that easily 
But you're out of your league 
And I think you should know it 
You're out of your league 
And you just don't know it 
If you don't want to reap it 
Then don't sow it Repeat chorus
