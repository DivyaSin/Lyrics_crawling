I don't mind 
Don't mind if everybody's far behind 
Don't care if they can't understand the way 
That you and I just want to be next to each other every day 
You and I 
We're just like magnets, baby 
Hypnotized, we've been addicted to your 
Broken ? I know exactly just how many kisses you been ? eyes I'd run away, I'd run away 
If you would join with me 
Oh I could be a little grumpy, but hold on 
Just wanna tell you that I see you, baby, do you see me? 
Cause this is special, baby 
Fuck 'em only we know Did I say 
You're all that matters to me anyway 
I'd give up everything to see your face 
So come on, let's pretend 
That no one else is watching while we play 
By your side 
That's where I have to be now we won't hide 
I preyed your kisses just to stay alive 
I see exactly what you think 
And I can feel you with my eyes Only we know 
Only we know 
Only we know 
Oh I'd run away, I'd run away 
If you would join with me 
Oh I could be a little grumpy, but hold on 
Just wanna tell you that I see you, baby, do you see me? 
Cause this is special, baby 
Fuck em only we know I'd run away, I'd run away 
If you would join with me 
Oh I could be a little grumpy, but hold on 
Just wanna tell you that I see you, baby, do you see me? 
Cause this is special, baby 
Fuck em only we know
