[Pablo:] 
I'm out in front 
I've got the speed 
I love it wnen I'm in the lead 
I gotta go, go, go, go, go 
I gotta go 
Because you can't go fast if you go too slow 
So go, go, go, go, go [Tyrone and Uniqua:] 
We're not in front 
We're close behind 
But we'll catch up, just give us time 
We gotta go, go, go, go, go 
We gotta go 
Because you can't go fast if you go too slow 
So go, go, go, go, go [Austin:] 
I'm in the back 
I'm in the rear 
I don't give up, I never fear 
I gotta go, go, go, go, go 
I gotta go 
Because you can't go fast if you go too slow 
So go, go, go, go, go [Uniqua:] 
I'm out in front 
I've got the speed 
I love it wnen I'm in the lead 
I gotta go, go, go, go, go 
I gotta go 
Because you can't go fast if you go too slow 
So go, go, go, go, go
