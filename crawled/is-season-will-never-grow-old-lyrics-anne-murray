Christmas is coming, I can tell by the smiles 
I remember the snowflakes that fell from the sky 
And covered the village that lay sleeping below 
Thank goodness this season will never grow old I look through my window well into the night 
Watching and waiting and hoping I might 
See one little reindeer fly through the snow 
Thank goodness this season will never grow old Christmas is coming, may joy fill your home 
And the spirit be with you wherever you go 
Christmas is coming, may joy fill your home 
And the spirit be with you wherever you go Trees with full branches were the first ones to go 
I remember the children who came to the door 
And sang out the carols we all used to know 
Thank goodness this season will never grow old All round the fire, the warmth of the flame 
Tip-toeing softly trying not to awake 
The ones who lie waiting for good things you know 
Thank goodness this season will never grow old Christmas is coming, may joy fill your home 
And the spirit be with you wherever you go 
Christmas is coming, may joy fill your home 
And the spirit be with you wherever you go
