You're a 60's girl gonna stay that way 
Today's the day you're gonna drift away 
Vision in a frock on a summer's day 
Today's the day you're gonna drift away 
60's girls wear their hair that way 
Today's the day you're gonna drift away 
Vision in a frock on a summer's day 
Chorus 
No-one's gonna take this 60's girl away 
No-one's gonna take this 60's girl away 
You're a factory girl lost in another time 
Today's the day you're gonna drift away 
Penny for the boy that is on your mind 
Today's the day you're gonna drift away 
Asleep all alone for a thousand years 
Today's the day you're gonna drift away 
Poor wretched soul cried a million tears 
Today's the day you're gonna drift away 
Chorus 
No-one's gonna take this 60's girl away 
No-one's gonna take this 60's girl away 
No-one's gonna take this 60's girl away 
No-one's gonna take this 60's girl away
