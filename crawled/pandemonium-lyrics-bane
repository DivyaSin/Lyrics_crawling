Caused is the sin, 
And all evil shall win, 
Bleeding from within, 
Deeply sinking in The bottomless depths of pain 
Where the hate becomes insane 
My path is the one I choose to follow, 
Which will bring me to my grave. No one shall give - only greed is real 
No one shall stand - only falling is real 
No one shall love - only hate is real 
No one shall live - only death is real Everything that was ever meant 
Is now worthless and forsaken 
Helpless and abandoned, 
Is how you will forever remain LET THY CHAOS FOREVER REIGN UPON US!!! Nothingness is what I feel, 
And is everything I ever crave for...
