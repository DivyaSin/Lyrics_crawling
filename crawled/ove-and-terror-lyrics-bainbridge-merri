Tonight we leave the world outside 
Just you and I 
This one desire we cannot hide 
Tonight Tonight 
We stopped the seasons turning 
We suspended time 
Now all my wounds are burning 
With the salt you grind 
(You're always) 
There where love and terror flare 
In the water in the air 
And in everything you do 
(You're always) 
There where love and terror flare 
In a whirl you take me there 
Down deep into you 
And breathing out you take me in 
So complete 
Into the soul beneath the skin 
You take me in 
He crashed again 
Now cupid flies 
An aeroplane 
High above me now 
He's found his mark 
And sets his sights 
Upon my heart 
(You're always) 
There where love and terror flare 
In the water in the air 
And in everything you do 
(You're always) 
There where love and terror flare 
In a whirl you take me there 
Down deep into you
