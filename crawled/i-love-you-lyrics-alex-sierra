I fell in love with a beautiful girl 
She still takes my breath away 
I fell in love in the morning sun 
While the hours slipped away Sometimes when I hear your name 
A smile creeps on my face 
And for reason I can't explain 
It's never out of place 'Cause I love you 
More than you think I do 
And I love you 
Now you don't want me to 
'Cause I love you 
More than you think I do 
And I love you 
Now you don't want me to You ran your finger down my back 
And you spelled out your name 
While we laid down on the soft warm ground 
For a week and thirteen days And I know that it's all so wrong 
And you heard all this before 
I didn't call back and I wasn't there 
I won't trouble you no more 'Cause I love you 
More than you think I do 
And I love you 
Now you don't want me to 
'Cause I love you 
More than you think I do 
And I love you 
Now you don't want me to Everytime I try to fight it 
Everything just turns out alone 
Maybe if I got my time 
I wouldn't end up alone I fell in love with a beautiful boy 
And he still takes my breath away 
When you left, it was the end of my world 
'Cause I'm never proud to say That I love you 
More than you think I do 
And I love you 
Now you don't want me to 
'Cause I love you 
More than you think I do 
And I love you 
Now you don't want me to 'Cause I love you 
And I love you 
'Cause I love you 
And I love you 
Now you don't want me to
