You sat there screaming, but I couldn't understand. 
It flowed from your mouth like a bad dream, and it made me sick. 
The air is thinning, drowning, in a sea of black. 
You sat there screaming, and I can't ignore it. 
Words coated in shit, I still get trapped. 
And now im not returning, cover my ears and close my eyes. 
There was no connection, i've broken the connection. 
And now im not returning. 
Cover my ears and close my eyes.
