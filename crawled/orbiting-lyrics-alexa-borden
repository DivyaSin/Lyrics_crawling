The black skyand the stars above 
the city lights collided 
and you brought the life back to the night. The street lamps that flickered on 
illuminate your eyesin a slow dance. 
And then moved along with the fireflies. And even the birds can see it. 
Seismically shifting back and forth. 
I'm falling in, I'm falling into love. A bird cries softly in the distance 
as we close our minds. 
And the stars begin to drift away. A sun rose gently against the 
orange light in tight bows 
of clouds that now had come alive. And even the birds can see it. 
Seismically shifting back and forth. 
I'm falling in, I'm falling into love. Don't wait til the moon is near, 
just tell me I'm yours my dear. 
I'm falling in, I'm falling into love. Taking, taking all our time. 
Taking, taking in the sky. 
Watching through the night. And even the birds can see it. 
Seismically shifting back and forth. 
I'm falling in, I'm falling into love. Don't wait til the moon is near, 
just tell me I'm yours my dear. 
I'm falling in, I'm falling into love.
