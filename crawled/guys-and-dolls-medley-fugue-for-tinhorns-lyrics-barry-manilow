I got the horse right here 
His name is Paul Revere 
And here's a guy who says if the weather's clear 
Can do, can do 
This guy says the horse can do 
If he says the horse can do, can do, can do 
I'm picking Valentine 
Cause on the morning line 
The guy has got him figured at 5 to 9 
Has chance, has chance 
This guy says the horse has chance 
If he says the horse has chance 
Has chance, has chance 
No way 
for Paul Revere I'll bite 
I hear his foot's all right 
Of course it all depends 
If it rained last night 
I know it's Valentine 
The morning works look fine 
Besides the jockey's brother's a friend of mine 
Needs race, needs race 
This guy says the horse needs BRAKES 
He says that the horse needs BRAKES 
Needs raceBRAKES, needs BRAKES 
Likes mud, likes mud, this "x" means the horse likes mud, likes mud 
If that means the horse likes mud, like mud, likes mud 
He likes mud, this horse likes mud 
Mud, he likes mud 
Hey wait a minute fellows 
Have you considered this 
Well, anyway, it's my turn to sing 
So shut up 
Really? 
But look at Epitaph 
He wins it by a half 
According to this here in the "Telegraph" 
Big threat, big threat 
This guy calls the horse big threat 
If he calls the horse big threat 
Big threat, big threat 
I'll tell you Paul Revere 
Now this is no bum steer 
It's from a handicapper that's real sincere 
Can do, can do 
This guy says the horse can do 
I go for Valentine 
Cause on the morning line 
The guy has got him figured 5 to 9 
Has chance, has chance 
The guy says the horse has chance 
So make it Epitaph, he wins it by a half 
According to this here in the "Telegraph" 
Paul Revere 
Valentine 
Epitaph
