Oh yeah, hoo Mr.Bigstuff, who do u think u are? 
Mr.Bigstuff, you're never gonna get my love Not because you wear 
All those fancy clothes (oh yeah) 
And have a big fine car 
Oh yes you do now 
Do you think I can't afford 
To give you my love (oh yeah) 
You think you're higher, 
Than every star above Mr.Bigstuff, who do you think you are? 
Mr.Bigstuff, you're never gonna get my love Now I know all the girls 
I've seen you with 
I know you broke their hearts 
And ate them up bit by bit 
You made them cry, 
Many poor girls cry 
When they trying to keep you happy, 
They just trying ta keep you satisfied Mr. Bigstuff,(tell me tell me), who do you think you are? 
Mr.Bigstuff, you're never gonna get my love I'd rather give my love 
To a poor guy that has a love that is true 
(Oh yeah) 
Then to be fooled by, 
And get hurt by you Cause when I give my love, 
I want love in return (oh yeah) 
Now I know this is a lesson 
Mr.Bigstuff you haven't learned Mr.Bigstuff, tell me, who do you think you are? 
Mr.Bigstuff, you're never gonna get my love 
Mr.Bigstuff, you're never gonna break my heart 
Mr.Bigstuff, you're never gonna make me cry
