The shallow voice of the wind 
Cries between these ebony wings 
The shallow cries of the wind 
Sing a swan song for mankind Shine on morning sky fire 
Ablaze this final day 
The autumnal end, the dawn of man 
The centuries fade below my feet I soared above them as they worthlessly poured 
Thought from a chalice 
As wisdom did flow twilight would come to pass 
Drink, oh, hallowed cup of life Shine on evening sky fire 
Paint the sky with the blood of a raven 
Bereavement, oh, garment of ebony 
As embers dress the dusk of man
