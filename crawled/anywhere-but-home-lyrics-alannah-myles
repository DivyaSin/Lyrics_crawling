Anywhere but home 
Thats where youre going 
It sucks to be alone 
Its safer not knowing 
When everything feels wrong 
You dont know your left from right 
When passions running strong 
And you cant see the light 
Its cold out there alone 
As youre filling up your belly with doubt 
You keep running home 
Everytime weve, fallen out 
You aint goin anywhere baby, You aint goin anywhere but home You aint goin anywhere baby, You aint goin anywhere but home 
With me or without me 
It doesnt matter 
Truth hurts like hell 
There aint nobody sadder 
Its cold out there alone 
You wont feel it til the bottle runs dry 
Until your, blind and running home 
Asking yourself, why... 
You aint goin anywhere baby, You aint goin anywhere but home 
You aint goin anywhere baby, You aint goin anywhere but home...
