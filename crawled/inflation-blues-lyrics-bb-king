Hey, Mr. President 
All your congressmen too 
You got me frustrated 
And I dont know what to do Im trying to make a living 
I cant save a cent 
It takes all of my money 
Just to eat and pay my rent I got the blues 
Got those inflation blues You know, Im not one of those high brows 
Im average Joe to you 
I came up eating cornbread 
Candied yams and chicken stew Now you take that paper dollar 
Its only that in name 
The way that buck has shrunk 
Its a lowdown dirty shame Thats why I got the blues 
Got those inflation blues 
'Cause I have Mr. President, please cut the price of sugar 
I wanna make my coffee sweet 
I wanna smear some butter on my bread 
And I just got to have my meat When you start rationing 
You really played the game 
And things are going up and up and up and up 
And my check remains the same Thats why I got the blues 
Got those inflation blues
