I was born by the river in a little tent 
Just like the river I've been running ever since 
It's been a long, a long time coming 
But I know change is gonna come, ooh yes it will It's been too hard living but I'm afraid to die 
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky 
It's been a long, a long, long time coming 
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes And I go to the movies and I go downtown 
Everybody they keep telling me don't you come around 
It's been a long, oh it's been a long time coming 
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yeah Then I go, go to my brother, I say brother help me please 
He just winds up knocking me down, back down on my knees
