I don't care if I ? 
(I've never changed!) 
You're having hard times although they'll pass 
(You never hide at all!) 
You can cross over the mountain 
(To get to the beautiful sea!) 
It don't matter too, the world will end 
In 1999 I don't care! I don't care! 
In 1999 Many lives in darkness exist 
(??????????)

(Changed this gentle heart)
