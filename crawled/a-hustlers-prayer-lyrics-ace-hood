I rebuke the devil away from me 
No weapon formed against me shall prosper 
Pray for me mama 
Live, Starvation 
If I should die before I wait 
I'm prayin' next to lord for my soul to take 
Niggas dyin' everyday so I keep that Glock on me 
I'm just thankful I woke up to see another day hey ey [x2] 
Man I'm tired of this bullshit 
And I lost my dog and I felt like this the worst that it could get 
Till I lost my daughter, felt like emptyin' out that full clip 
And I put it on my mind feel for the hand, I'm just gonna slow sip 
Cause I'm way to stressed and again I'm blessed cause I'm still here 
Lookin' in that mirror I can see a man with no fear 
Oh lord, oh lord this world is hell although we livin' in it 
Gotta keep my vibe. Oh why? Oh why must I just keep on sinnin'? 
Tryin' to keep it real in a world so fake, now can I get a witness? 
Got niggers killing over Jordan's, getting life in prison 
I'm tryin' to tell you man 
Watch the ones who you hang around 
The enemy approaching any second now 
If I should die before I wait 
I'm prayin' next to lord for my soul to take 
Niggas dyin' everyday so I keep that Glock on me 
I'm just thankful I woke up to see another day hey ey [x2] 
Woke up early in the morning, said I gotta get it 
Loadin' up my pistol, I just pray that all my sins forgiven 
And I know I'm livin' wrong but mama, you just pray for me 
Gotta make this money so my family forever eager 
That Jesus piece around my neck keep the devil away from me 
In an old school cut let's keep that problem with me on the secret 
Just hopin' right but the man above before I go to sleepin' 
In nothing lesser than a G, that's how they bury me 
Have mercy on 'em 
If I should die before I wait 
Pull me out some liquor when you're at the wake 
And I'll be good as long as I know daughter's straight 
Realest shit I ever wrote, this has a hostile spread 
If I should die before I wait 
I'm prayin' next to lord for my soul to take 
Niggas dyin' everyday so I keep that Glock on me 
I'm just thankful I woke up to see another day hey ey [x2]
