I was alone with you on my mind 
Look at me now you've left me behind 
You're all that matters you are my life 
You are the one that should be here by my side 
You are my lover you should be my friend 
Don't you think we've got some talking to do? 
Only love depends on you Don't tell me it's over cause it's not over yet 
Don't tell me you love me 
When you're trying to throw this love away 
Don't say that I've changed girl 
Because change is not enough 
Don't say that it's over 
When you know that we can fight it 
You know we've got to lay down for love 
We've got to lay down for love So where is your kiss where is your touch 
The taste of your lips I miss them so much 
You said you'd be back soon you said you'd be here 
You seem to run every time love comes near 
Remember when we were lovers 
Remember when we were friends 
Don't you think we've got some talking to do? 
In the end it's up to you No 
When you're trying to throw this love away 
Don't you say 
Oh 
Don't tell me it's over 
When you know that we can fight it 
You know we've got to lay down for love Lay down for me 
Lay down for you 
Lay down for everything you do 
Cause you know it's rush you know it's time 
To love me for the rest of your life 
When you got good love 
It ain't right To please me 
I want you baby 
Don't throw this love away
