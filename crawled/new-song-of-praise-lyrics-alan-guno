Sing to the Lord a new song of praise 
Let all the people cry out with joy 
His hand will guide each hour of our day 
Trumpets and harps will declare the way 
Shout out a new song to give Him praise Let the children now approach him 
Let the lamb and lion play 
Let us gather all together here 
To praise Him and to pray We will draw our hands together 
And our lips will speak His Word 
And in this communion we will find 
New voices will be heard Sing to the Lord a new song of praise 
Let all the people cry out with joy 
His hand will guide each hour of our day 
Trumpets and harps will declare the way 
Shout out a new song to give Him praise We have come to give Him worship 
We have come to seek His cross 
And together we will leave behind 
The sadness of our loss For the world will see His glory 
And we all will feel His love 
And the dawn will bring the glorious Son 
His rising up above Sing to the Lord a new song of praise 
Let all the people cry out with joy 
His hand will guide each hour of our day 
Trumpets and harps will declare the way 
Shout out a new song to give Him praise Come to the Lord with your arms open wide 
Rise from the shadows no longer hide 
Sing with the words that the Spirit inspires 
Sing with a heart on fire Sing to the Lord a new song of praise 
Let all the people cry out with joy 
His hand will guide each hour of our day 
Trumpets and harps will declare the way Sing to the Lord a new song of praise 
Let all the people cry out with joy 
His hand will guide each hour of our day 
Trumpets and harps will declare the way Sing to the Lord a new song of praise 
Let all the people cry out with joy 
His hand will guide each hour of our day 
Trumpets and harps will declare the way
