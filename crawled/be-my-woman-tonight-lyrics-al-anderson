I'm not tryin' to own you 
And I'm not tryin' to make you part of me 
I don't want to impose you 
And I don't want you hangin' around on me But I'm not tryin' to wonder 
I'm not tryin' to find you out 
Be my woman tonight Let's not fall in that hole again 
We never really made it any way 
But you were always unhappy 
And I kept actin' like a child at ten So, I'm not tryin' to wonder 
I'm not tryin' to find you out 
Be my woman tonight, yeah Lately I've been quite lonely 
And I thought maybe you'd be home tonight 
Maybe we could just talk some 
And maybe I could even stay the night But I'm not tryin' to wonder 
I'm not tryin' to find you out 
Be my woman tonight 
Be my woman tonight
