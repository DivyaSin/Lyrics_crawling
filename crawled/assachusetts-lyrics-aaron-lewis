Sit here on the stairs and listen to 
The nighttime as the daylight fades away 
It's such a haunting and familiar tune, 
When I hear it in the distance I can say that I'm home In Massachusetts 
Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me, all alone 
But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be 
Because I am home The north shore is where my father lives, 
I wear my Red Sox hat around the world with pride 
But the Berkshires are where my heart is 
And when I see them in the distance I could cry 
Because I'm home In Massachusetts 
Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me, all alone 
But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be Nyla started pre-school 
Indie just turned two 
And Zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you 
They keep getting older 
Time keeps going by 
To think about it makes your daddy wanna cry So I just passed the sign that welcomes me to Worthington 
Established long before this country came to be 
A place that at hasn't really changed with time 
The way this country that I love it, used to be Because I'm home 
In Massachusetts 
Where my daughters and my wife, they wait for me, all alone 
But the truth is it's where I always am, it's where I long to be 
Because I am home 
Where my hero teaches classes everyday 
And where my friends they don't treat me different 
It's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay 
Because I'm home
