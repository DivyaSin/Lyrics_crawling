The room has suddenly grown cold 
And outside in the street it's raining 
You packed your bags and said good-bye 
You took my heart without explaining. 
How could you go 
How could you go 
We had a love most people never know. 
Stop 
Before you break my heart. [Chorus] 
I want you back 
Don't care what I have to do 
I want you back I want you back 
Gotta get it through to you 
I want you back If I can make you see only you can fill the need in me If you walk away you'll regret it someday 
Please 
Stay! This room is full of memories 
And shadows of the past remind me 
Of all the love I gave in vain 
And all the hurt I feel inside me. 
I want you back 
I want you back 
We had a love most people never know. 
Stop 
Before you break my heart. [Chorus] I want you back 
I 
I want you back I want you back 
I 
I want you 
I want you back! 
We had a love most people never know 
Stop 
Before you break my heart. [Chorus]
