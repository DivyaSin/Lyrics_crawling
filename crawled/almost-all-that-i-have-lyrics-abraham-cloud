One plus One 
Hardly ever equals one 
These Days, it seems 
One plue One it equalled three 
with you and me 
And You pretending I was 
someone else in your dream. 
I guess you'll never know 
just what it means to me To have you here 
I'd give you anything 
But you're almost all that I have 
Youre almost all that I have You took my time 
I never told you 
what was on my mind 
I gave you rides to work 
cigarettes and smiles 
my precious tape of songs 
you left out in the sun 
I wrote them all for you 
you'll never understand To have you here 
I'd give you anything 
But you're almost all that I have 
Youre almost all that I have Said to me, you liked 
the way the breezes blew 
so free and easy 
over the water by the sea 
so I took your advice 
and I walked away 
down the shore I guess you'll never know 
just what it means to me To have you here 
I'd give you anything 
But you're almost all that I have 
Youre almost all that I have
