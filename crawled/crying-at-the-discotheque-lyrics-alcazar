Downtown's been caught by the hysteria 
People scream and shout 
A generation's on the move 
When disco spreads like a bacteria 
These lonely days are out 
Welcome the passion of the groove The golden years 
The silver tears 
You wore a tie like Richard Gere 
I wanna get down 
You spin me around 
I stand on the borderline Cryin' at the discotheque 
Cryin' at the discotheque 
I saw you cryin' 
I saw you cryin' at the discotheque 
I saw you cryin' 
I saw you cryin' at the discotheque Tonight's the night at the danceteria 
The joinin' of the tribe 
The speakers blasting clear and loud 
The way you dance is our criteria 
The D.J. takes you high 
Let tears of joy baptise the crowd The golden years 
The silver tears 
You wore a tie like Richard Gere 
I wanna get down 
You spin me around 
I stand on the borderline Cryin' at the discotheque 
Cryin' at the discotheque 
I saw you cryin' 
I saw you cryin' at the discotheque 
I saw you cryin' 
I saw you cryin' at the discotheque The passion of the groove 
Generation on the move 
Joinin' of the disco tribe 
Let the music take you high The golden years 
The silver tears 
You wore a tie like Richard Gere 
I wanna get down 
You spin me around 
I stand on the borderline Cryin' at the discotheque 
Cryin' at the discotheque 
Cryin' at the discotheque
