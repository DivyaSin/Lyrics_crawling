Is it hope that lays down beside me 
Heaven spent it's last dime to remind me 
But the tears still fall under umbrellas 
Tore the sky apart to make God jealous 
But still afraid that the day never ends 
And I don't really know what to do to pretend 
Is it all so simply overstated 
It's the child in me that wants me jaded 
Behind the furthest door I sit there waiting 
Footsteps and a knock that stops the fading 
But still afraid that the day never ends 
And I don't really know what to do to pretend 
So I walk in place just to wait for myself 
And the truth disappears 
'Cause it hates being chased
