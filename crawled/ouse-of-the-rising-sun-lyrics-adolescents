There is a house in New Orleans 
They call, 'The Rising Sun' 
And it's been a ruin of many a poor boy 
And God I know, I'm one My mother was a tailor 
She sewed my new bluejeans 
My father was a gamblin' man 
Down in New Orleans Now the only thing a gambler needs 
Is a suitcase and trunk 
And the only time that he's satisfied 
Is when he's on a drunk Oh, mother tell your children 
Not to do what I have done 
Spend your lives in sin and misery 
In the house of 'The Rising Sun'
