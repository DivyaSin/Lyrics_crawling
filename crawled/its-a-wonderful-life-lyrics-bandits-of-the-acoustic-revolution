Once again I wake up alone on the wrong side of my bed. And once again you begin your dancing nakedly on the right side of my head. It's for a lack of better words that I can hardly speak my soul. And I'm feeling what I'm feeling when I'm feeling when it's time to lose control, my love. And once again we're off to war. But i can't agree with what we're fighting for. And that's not all, because every time she smiles I see her soul,when I smile what a wonderful life. It's true I used to try, but then I gave up. I learned it doesn't really matter, what I do ain't enough to appease or to please, all my well meaning deeds seem to all go up in smoke. And every time I look into these smoke filled skies I wonder what she's doing, why I volunteered to die. But tonight I will fight for my life so I might see my wife again. 
I explained to her that I'd be back.when I gave my word that the fighting wouldn't last. But despite my pact, I know that every breath I draw might be my last, and I smile: It's been a wonderful life. God damn, another summer in the city and I never seen a girl look so pretty as you when you smile oh you're wild for a while, I was hoping I might see you again. And I know that everybody is willing to go and I find I'll turn it all and leave on a dime. If I leave tonight (screw what's right) I can make it home by dawn.
