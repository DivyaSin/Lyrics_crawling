I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, they gon' ride, we all gon' ride, 
(yea) 
I come from the heart of southside (yea) 
Holdin' it down for my niggas that died (yea) 
I gotta busy bird on my side (yea) 
Pop shit and get yo whole mouth wide (yea) Baby had tried to steal off the payroll 
Ill have niggas scrappin' the skin off the ya face with the same 
Shit they peal a potato (whoo) 
I thank the lord for my blessings and I'm glad he gave us the 
Will power and reflexes of Larry Davis (ohh) 
You don't wanna see my block formin' (uh huh) 
That's a 101 doggs and I don't mean the ones with the spots on 'em 
Were respected highly 
'cause you don't need to practice gymnastics to catch a body 
(oh) 
Me and moneys like Whitney, next to Bobby (uh huh) 
If I bring all my niggas I'll need an extra lobby (uh huh) 
As soon as you ain't around Jake (Jake) 
You getcha ass whipped for chips 
Now that's the real definition of pound cake 
I got the crown snake 
And you can tell when I'm shoppin' 'cause when the mall stampedin' 
You'll feel the ground shake 
I got a car I only drive on Thursdays (ha ha) 
I'm a stunna', banks blows more cake then birthdays [Chorus] Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared (uh uh) 
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there 
Oh yeah this shiny shit right here 
Ill work magic and make you niggas disappear Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared 
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there 
Oh yeah this shiny shit right here 
Ill work magic and make you niggas disappear You know how I gets down 
This pound hold six rounds 
I told you I'd be back bitch 
Talk that shit now 
You hear that fo fif .45 sound 
Duck when I spit rounds 
'cause this ain't Beverly hills 
You in the bricks now 
We ain't got shit down here but dope and guns for sell 
You get yo head cracked and niggas don't run and tell 
Its like we sell crack get caught head back to jail 
We on that fuck the police shit 
We livin' in hell 
You betta' guard yo grill homey 
And stand yo ground 
These bullets burn 
They hit who evers standin' around 
I never learn even after I took a couple shots 
I just got me some band-aids and bought a couple glocks 
Had to go on a rampage and hit a couple blocks 
Once they hear that 12-gauge that's when the trouble stops 
(boom) 
If its beef then I'm ready to ride 
Just come to casheville you can find me on the south side 
(motherfucka') [Chorus] Now I ain't from Michigan but I'm in the Fab 5 
You know, Yayo and 50, Buck and Game, You know my fuckin' name 
Whether the truck or train 
My minds stuck on the grind 
'cause somewhere down the line, a lot of suckas came 
Yeah ain't talkin' shit 
But we can all tell he ass 
Jags are black his eyes like the are-Kelly mask (ah) 
You gotta blast me yo (yo) 
'cause the Louisville will have yo head lookin' like the top of a 
Pistachio 
The young gunner with a raspy flow 
Got every boyfriend thinkin' they girlfriends a nasty hoe 
My heart laughin' a small 
Maybe its 'cause my grandpop dropped right after the ball 
Banks hops out bulletproof this, bulletproof that, bulletproofs 
Snorkle when you hot they hawk you 
I got the hood on my shoulda 
Chain big as a boulder 
The 357 tucka 
Motherfucka' [Chorus] Yeah 
Motherfucka' 
I'm here, yeah
