Good morning 
The night is over and gone 
I thought once 
This dark would last for so long Feel the sunlight 
On my face 
You have brought me 
Through this place Jesus, Jesus You found me 
Through the long night you led me 
You set me free Do you see 
Just what you've done in my life? 
You gave me 
More then I hoped for; now I Feel the sunlight 
On my face 
You have brought me 
Through this place Feel your sunlight 
On my face 
You have brought me 
Through this place Jesus, Jesus You found me 
Through the long night you led me 
You set me free Feel the sunlight 
On my face 
You have brought me 
Through this place Jesus, Jesus You found me 
Through the long night you led me 
You set me free
