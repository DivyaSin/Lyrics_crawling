O Death, O Death, rock me asleep, 
(In water...) Toll on, thou passing bell; 
Ring out my doleful knell; 
For I must... 
There is no remedy. My pains, my pains, who can express? 
Alas, they are so strong! My dolours will not suffer strength 
My life for to prolong. Toll on, thou passing bell; 
Ring out my doleful knell; 
For I must... 
There is no remedy. Farewell, farewell, my pleasures past! 
Welcome, my present pain! I feel my torment so increase 
That life cannot remain. (My Lord, my Lord) 
(...)(hear me...) [Lyrics by an anonymous author (ca. 1576)]
