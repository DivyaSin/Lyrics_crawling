In the puddle by the trail it flips it's tiny tail 
Just like a great big whale but smaller than a snail It's a pollywog in a bog 
Swims under soggy logs 
One day he'll be a frog 
Pollywog in a bog Overhead a cedar tree gives the shade he needs 
Munching while he feeds on lily pads and weeds Knows not where he's from 
Or how his life had begun 
He's not the only one 
And soon he'll breathe through lungs It's hard to believe 
With the arms you'll receive 
You'll life your head above the water and breathe 
Gills shrink away and may there come a day 
When you reach the shore with a whole world to explore Ribbit ribbit a tadpole exhibit 
It's a transformation no one can inhibit 
Amphibian change may seem strange 
Take them gills and the tail and they all rearrange Out come the legs for the jump! jump! 
Hope to the top of the stump! stump! 
Out come the legs for the jump! jump! 
Hope to the top of the stump! stump! Where the mud is deep frost will soon creep 
And without a peep a frog is fast asleep [Repeat x2] 
It was a pollywog in a bog 
Swam under soggy logs 
In the morning fog 
Pollywog in a bog.
