Violence has no charm still 
I waiting for your arm 
someone said goodbye and 
now no one misses you and 
they might see you around 
in this quiet little town 
talking of islands and 
the knife you have still 
in your back and they might 
see you there saying no one 
ever cared I still remember 
I still remember how soon you forget
