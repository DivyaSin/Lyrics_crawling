When i go strolling through the crowd 
I hear them laughing oh so loud 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! they're laughing 
My feelings sometimes better me 
Those things i sometimes have to hear 
Whoa-ooh-oh whoa-ooh whoa-ooh 
I'll cry then! You're all fools 
Can't you see, times are changing 
You're so cruel 
I know one day you will change, too I can't get served in cafes or bars 
My customs not as good as yours 
Hey come on! why don't you serve me! Sometimes i get so depressed 
'cause i don't want to look 
Like the rest of you 
Woo woo hoo You're all fools 
Can't you see, times are changing 
You're so cruel 
I know one day, you will change, too When i go strolling through the crowd 
I hear them laughing oh so loud 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! they're laughing 
My feelings sometimes bother me 
Those things i sometimes have to hear 
Whoa-ooh whoa-ooh whoa-ooh 
I'll cry then! You're all fools 
Can't you see, times are changing 
You're so cruel 
I know one day you will change, too You're gonna change You're all fools 
Can't you see, times are changing 
You're so cruel, so cruel so cruel 
I know one day you will change, too You're all fools, you're all fools 
Can't you see, times are changing, times are changing 
You're so cruel, so cruel, so cruel, so cruel 
I know one day you will change, too, i know you'll change
