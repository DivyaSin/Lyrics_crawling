stop me on the way down 
stop me on the way down can't stand my ground with you 
reach up or drown for you 
would have liked to known what to do 
feel like i've blown it with you stop me on the way down 
stop me on the way down can't stop to lie for you 
won't stand this strife from you 
could have loved the things that i do 
can't spend my time waiting for you stop me on the way down 
stop me on the way down back up give up or funk the fight 
lock the door give up and hit the lights stop me on the way down 
stop me on the way down
