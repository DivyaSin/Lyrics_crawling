I wanna find what others rarely find 
conscience clean and peace of mind 
life like a book i'm proud to sign 
written on hearts i leave behind I wanna roll on a road of my own design 
you're fear and faith they're intertwined 
hoping there's a finish line 
within the hearts I leave behind [Chorus} 
If god lets me choose where I go when I die 
i'll lay my head down where love resides 
and i'll never have to say goodbye 
i'll live in the hearts i'll leave behind i wanna leave a mark a permanent kind 
and i was here that don't fade with time 
a sacred place that's only mine 
within the hearts i leave behind [chorus] safe in the hearts i leave behind
