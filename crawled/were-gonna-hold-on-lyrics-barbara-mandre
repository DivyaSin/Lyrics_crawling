[Chorus] 
We're gonna hold on 
We're gonna hold on 
We're gonna hold on to each other Life can be rough sometimes 
It's kind a real good love is hard to find 
But the best love is the one we know and 
Faith we have between us makes it grow [Chorus] Some love lives and some love 
Don't we've got the kind of love we want 
It brings us happiness all through the day 
And nothing can ever make it go away
