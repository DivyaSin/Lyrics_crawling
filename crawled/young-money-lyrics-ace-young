I can make your bed rock 
Haters in the building nigga 
I can make your bed rock (girl) 
I can make your bed rock

(Lil Wayne) 
She got the good good 
She Michael Jackson bad 
I'm attracted to her 
But her attractive ass 
But now were murders 
Cause we kill time 
I knock her lights out 
But she still shine 
I hate to see her go 
But I love to watch her leave 
But I keep her running back and forth 
Like a soccer team 
Cold as a winter's day 
Hot as a summers eve 
Young money thieves 
Steal your heart with ease 
(Gudda Gudda) 
I like the way you walk it 
And if your walkin my way 
I'm that red bull 
And lets fly away 
Lets find a place 
With all kinds of space 
I'll let you be the judge 
And I'm the the case 
I'm gudda gudda

No stevie wonder 
She wont ever wonder 
Cause she knows she bad 
And I gotta nigga

Ricky bobby 
I'm at the W 
But I can meet you in the lobby 
Girl I gotta watch my back 
Cause I'm not just anybody 
I've seen them standing in line 
Just to get beside her 
I let her see that aston 
And let the rest suprise her 
That's when we disappear 
You need GPS to find her 
O that was your girl? 
I thought I recognized her 
(Young Lloyd)

(Tyga) 
She like cannon 
I like stan and 
She like romance and 
I like rollin with friends 
She said I'm caged in 
I think her conscience is 
She's watchin that oxygen 
I'm watching ESPN 
But when that show ends 
She all over my skin 
Lotions 
Double emotions 
Rollarcoasten 
Like 
Back 
Forth 
Hold it (hold it X5) 
She poses like it's for posters 
And I poke like I'm suppose to 
Take this photo if you are for me 
She said don't you ever show this 
I'm to loyal and to focused 
To be losing and be hopeless 
When I spoke this she rejoiced it 
She said your words give me open 
So I closed it 
When it closes 
I'm only lovin for the moment 
(Jae Millz) 
She aint gotta man 
But she's not alone 
Miss. Independent 
Here she got her own 
Hey gorgeous 
Um, I mean flawless 
Well, that's what your are 
How I see it is how I call it 
Yeah 
Look it how she walk 
Mhmm she know she bad 
Do (do) your thing baby 
I aint even mad 
And I aint even fast 
I'm gonna stay a while 
Hole your hair crisp 
I'm gonna take a gander 
(Young Lloyd)
