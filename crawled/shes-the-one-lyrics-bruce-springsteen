With her killer graces and her secret places that no boy can fill 
With her hands on her hips, oh, and that smile on her lips because she knows that it kills me 
With her soft French cream, standing in that doorway like a dream, I wish she'd just leave me alone 
Because French cream won't soften them boots and French kisses will not break that heart of stone 
With her long hair falling and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun 
Whoa-oh, she's the one 
She's the one That thunder in your heart at night when you're kneeling in the dark, 
it say's you're never gonna leave her 
But there's this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies 
and all you want to do is believe her 
And tonight you'll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through 
Oh, she can take you, but if she wants to break you, 
she's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do 
And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run 
Whoa-oh, she's the one 
She's the one Oh oh, and just one kiss, she's fill them long summer nights with her tenderness 
That secret pact you made, back when her love could save you from the bitterness 
Oh, she's the one 
Oh, she's the one 
Oh, she's the one 
Oh, she's the one 
Oh, she's the one 
Oh, she's the one
