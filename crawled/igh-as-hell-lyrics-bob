I woke up in the mornin 
I woke up in the morning high 
I woke up in the morning 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
Still faded, but nigga can't you tell 
Can't you tell, nigga can't you tell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
Can't you tell, nigga can't you tell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell I woke up this morning so high 
I probably never get low 
R. Kelly, I think I can fly 
But this is as it go 
I can't recall being sober 
'Cause that was a trillion hours ago 
You say you want to get higher than me 
Well you got a billion mile to go 
Nigga this stone age, roll up and put it in rotation 
My dro potent and make show faces 
Till I'm po' baby like an old lady 
So faded like some old navy in an old basement 
With my OG that's fresh off of probation 
I bang, bang, you be ho saving 
Ran in yo ho like home invasion 
When I hit up my dealer I'm so impatient 
I be hightailing and ain't no debating 
I know the answer to the whole equation 
Always baking like a local bakery 
We pass it around like a roller skating rink 
I go to the club, it stay open late for me 
Just rolled up a blunt and it's motivating me I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
Still faded, but nigga can't you tell 
Can't you tell, nigga can't you tell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
Can't you tell, nigga can't you tell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell Woke up in the morning, grab some weed, a joint and rolled it 
Put some cheese eggs on my stomach, I don't need it bitch I want it 
Crib in California, got a villa in the trump 
I put some converse on my feet and told my bitch, "let's get this money" 
One joint, fourteen grams, that's a half 
Blow torch on the nail, that's a dab 
Space cakes, M2O, I'm getting blow 
Butter in a g pin, man I'm stoned 
One hit of this wax, got him high, he don't wanna say it 
Try to call my phone, but I'm gone, me and Bobby Ray 
I'm smoking Kush today, tomorrow, I'm a straight shatter 
Hardcore butter, lookin' like some cake batter 
It make me think better, fucking up you're dead wrong 
Rasta told me "fat rips make the dread long" 
I took a dab, past out fly as hell I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
Still faded, but nigga can't you tell 
Can't you tell, nigga can't you tell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
Can't you tell, nigga can't you tell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell High, in the sky, Superman 
Am I high, yes I am 
I done lost my mind 
I done lost my mind 
I done lost my mind 
I done lost my mind In the sky, ceiling fan 
Purple haze, Afghanistan 
I done lost my mind 
I done lost my mind 
I done lost my mind 
I done lost my mind I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
Still faded, but nigga can't you tell 
Can't you tell, nigga can't you tell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell 
Can't you tell, nigga can't you tell 
I woke up in the morning high as hell
