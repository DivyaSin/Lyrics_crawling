It was early for a summer 
All the people and the noise from the bar 
You in your grey dress, your arm on the window 
You said, what's the difference, what's the difference? Just say it to me 
Just say it to me 
And let's not make it a thing 
It will be okay, babe And that was love, when we were sober 
And you're so nervous and all 
And the air is getting colder OK everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything Do you really want to hear that? 
Why is everyone staring? 
Were you happy? 
Were you honest? 
Did you ever believe that any of this was real? We can't just slow down now 
This road's not safe for driving out this town 
I've wanted just one thing from you Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Just say it to me 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Just say it to me 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
I don't care if you mean it 
Everything, everything, it's everything 
Everything We can't just slow down now 
This road's not safe for driving out this town 
I've wanted just one thing from you 
And mean it So you got out of the car 
You left your bag in the backseat 
And walked inside 
And that was love
