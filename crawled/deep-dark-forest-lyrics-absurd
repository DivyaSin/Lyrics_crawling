Sky is clear and the moon shines bright 
The stars ?? through the trees 
The night is black and the snow is white 
All things seem to have defeat The glowing eyes of animals around staring at me 
The cold wind blows into my face 
Like ?? does it see Full moon shines ?? down 
The day shall never come 
My tears are running from my eyes 
My blood spills from my arms I am immortal I can't die but I will feel deep pain 
My eyes are red, my hair is black 
Like ?? Eternal is dark forest 
Eternal is the night 
Deep dark forest eternally The sun rise up I clear believed 
The forest sight in me 
But winter is. The days are short 
And dark are all the trees The sun goes down, the twilight comes followed by the night 
Silent stands the deep dark forest and the moon shines bright Eternal is dark forest 
Eternal is the night 
Deep dark forest eternally
