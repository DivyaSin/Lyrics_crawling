I guess I was hoping for too much 
I guess I was wrong to see us part 
Of something like a dream 
Just like the night is falling 
Over the young hearts and the stars 
Are because of my love You were my baby, you were the only one for me 
'Cuz nothing compares this, to the miracle of love I need your love, I need the miracle of love 
I need your love, 'cuz baby, you're my only one I need your love, I need the miracle of love 
'Cuz baby, you're my only one, I need your love Everynight I'm thinking about you 
I was afraid of this moment without you 
It was so good, it was a bit untrue, 
With a Hollywood ending too Everynight I'm thinking about you 
I was afraid of this moment without you 
It was so good, it was a bit untrue, 
With a Hollywood ending too I need your love, I need the miracle of love 
I need your love, 'cuz baby, you're my only one I need your love, I need the miracle of love 
'Cuz baby, you're my only one, I need your love, I need the miracle of love 
I need your love, 'cuz baby, you're my only one I need your love, I need the miracle of love 
'Cuz baby, you're my only one, I need your love, I need the miracle of love 
I need your love, 'cuz baby, you're my only one I need your love, I need the miracle of love 
'Cuz baby, you're my only one, I need your love
