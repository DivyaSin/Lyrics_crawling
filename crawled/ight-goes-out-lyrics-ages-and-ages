All I wanna say are the only words with any meaning, yeah 
And I feel that way even though there's some who feel nothing at all 
But we're not like that and you know and you know we got our reasons, yeah 
Never been like that 'cause there ain't no safety where they sink and so All I wanna say are the only words with any meaning, yeah 
And I feel that way even though there's some who feel nothing at all 
But we're not like that and you know and you know we got our reasons, yeah 
Never been like that 'cause there ain't no safety where they sink and so Don't let 'em shake you up so easy, no 
They'll never shake us off so easy, oh 
All I wanna say are the only words with any meaning, yeah 
And I'll be that way till the light goes 
Light goes, light goes So familiar with the abstract 
Ever out of reach and the pattern of it all 
From the colors and the cast-outs to the unknown 
I could never turn it off I kept up with the verses in my head 
Running right along beside 'em all day 
At some point, well I found myself wondering 
If I was even running or just 
running away. I wanna live an honest life 
Wanna make myself right for whatever's gonna come 
I see no purpose in avoiding the struggle inside 
Like it isn't going on Some say that you're probably better off 
So ignore it anytime that you can 
But how it is we'd be better off for it
