Talk of tomorrow 
And you talk of the times that have been 
The wheels keep on turning 
Turning circles we go round again Never ending the time is bending 
These songs all the same 
And we will stand listening 
Looking back on the ones that remain And time hurries on 
We are here, we are gone 
And time passes on 
All the words of your song Turn the pages 
Nothing ages 
That's what you will see 
Turn the pages 
Ring of changes 
Is what it will be The sun when it's rising 
Paints a shadow on where it has been 
And night is surprising 
To the people who stand in between Filling spaces you see their face 
As they wake from their dream 
And we will stand looking 
Taking note of the things we have seen And time hurries on 
We are here, we are gone 
And time passes on 
All the words of your song Turn the pages 
Nothing ages 
That's what you will see 
Turn the pages 
Ring of changes 
Is what it will be
