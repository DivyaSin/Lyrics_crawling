How could You walk when you went down that dusty street? 
How could You speak when all Your friends checked out? 
How could You love after the great betrayal? 
How could You reach out when they nailed You down? True as true can be 
That's what they say You are to me when I'm so fake 
Does Your heart ache? 
If I had been the one I would not have been that strong 
If I had been the one, yeah, I'd have been long gone How could You hang on with Your mama crying? 
How could You keep on breathing in and out? 
How could You watch while Your whole world was dying? 
Did it all happen 'cause we let You down? True as true can be 
That's what they say You are to me when I'm so fake 
Does Your heart ache? 
If I had been the one I would not have been that strong 
If I had been the one, yeah, I'd have been long gone And all the things we think of as eternal would come undone 
So all I have to say is when I'm praying 
Is "Thank God I'm not the one" I'd have been long gone And all the things we think of as eternal would come undone 
So all I have to say is when I'm praying 
Is "Thank God I'm not the one" Is "Thank God I'm not the one" 
Is "Thank God I'm not the one" 
Is "Thank God I'm not the one"
