I was 23 and living in the city 
I met a long-legged blonde on friday night 
It was a head on collision of passion 
We made wild-eyed, loose-lipped love all night 
On saturday we went out dancing 
I could see she wanted to be free 
She said, "darling, I'm sorry to leave you this way..." 
I said, "how can you walk out on me? " (chorus) 
She said, "hey, hey, my, my, what's the story? 
How can you say I broke your heart? 
Someone as old as you should never look for the truth 
In promises made in the dark." Well, I went back to her apartment 
I waited all night in my car 
When she got there I said, "hey you can't take him to bed!" 
She said, "who in the hell do you think you are? " Chorus When her boyfriend pulled out a revolver 
I smiled and I said my farewells 
Love can take you to the sun, love can take you to the moon 
It's not worth getting you killed Chorus
