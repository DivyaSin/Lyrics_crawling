I remember wearing straight-legged Levi's 
Flannel shirts even when they weren't in style 
I remember singing with Roy Rogers at the movies 
When the west was really wild 
I was listening to the Opry when all my friends 
Were diggin' rock & roll and rhythm and blues 
I was country when country wasn't cool I remember circlin' the drive-in 
Pullin' up and turning down George Jones 
I remember when no one was looking 
I was putting peanuts in my Coke 
I took a lot of kiddin' 'cause I never did fit in 
Now look at everybody trying to be what I was then 
I was country when country wasn't cool I was country when country wasn't cool 
I was country from my hat down to my boots 
I still act and look the same 
What you see ain't nothing new 
I was country when country wasn't cool They called us 'country bumpkins' 
For stickin' to our roots 
I'm just glad we're in a country 
Where we're all free to choose 
I was country when country wasn't cool (George Jones) 
I was country when country wasn't cool 
I was country from my hat down to my boots (Both) 
I still act and look the same 
What you see ain't nothing new 
'Cause I was country when country wasn't cool 
Yeah, I was country when country wasn't cool
