You'll hear them breaking bones Silently pacing 
All fear erased here, it's time to face it 
Cold sweats profusely, crowd chanting loudly 
One goal pursuing, one thought consuming Now you're stepping inside 
Where you can't be afraid No excuse will suffice 
Deadly, quick, and precise, trained for this moment 
No one else can own it, keep all eyes on me 
One goal pursuing, one thought consuming Now, you're stepping inside where you can't be afraid 
It's a matter of pride when you enter the cage 
Put your heart on the line, it determines your fate 
It's a matter of pride when you enter the cage Inside this octagon, eight sided nightmare just begun 
Warriors, modern battle ground, can't let him get me down 
No noise, just quiet now 
One goal pursuing, one thought consuming Now, you're stepping inside where you can't be afraid 
It's a matter of pride when you enter the cage 
Put your heart on the line, it determines your fate 
It's a matter of pride when you enter the cage When you enter the cage 
(Get tapped out) 
When you enter the cage 
(Get tapped out) 
When you enter the cage 
(Get tapped out) 
When you enter the cage 
(Get tapped out) 
When you enter the cage 
(Get tapped out) Now, you're stepping inside where you can't be afraid 
It's a matter of pride when you enter the cage 
Put your heart on the line, it determines your fate 
It's a matter of pride when you enter the cage Now, you're stepping inside where you can't be afraid 
It's a matter of pride when you enter the cage 
Put your heart on the line, it determines your fate 
It's a matter of pride when you enter the cage When you enter the cage 
(Get tapped out) 
When you enter the cage 
(Get tapped out) 
When you enter the cage 
(Get tapped out) 
When you enter the cage
