You are my poison ivy 
You are my disease 
You are what I must walk through 
To get to what I need You are my vaccination 
You're my Cheshire cat 
You are my situation 
And I give thanks for that But it seems like we've come a long way 
(Yeah, yeah) seems like we've come a long way You are my irritation 
You're under my skin 
You are my, you are my reminder 
Of where I shouldn't have been But it seems like we've come a long way 
(Yeah, yeah) seems like we've come a long way I know what this is 
I've been here before You are my poison ivy 
You're my fleur de lis 
You are what I must cling to 
To get to what I need
