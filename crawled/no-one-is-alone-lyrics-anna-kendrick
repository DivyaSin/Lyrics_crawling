Mother cannot guide you 
Now you're on your own 
Only me beside you 
Still, you're not alone 
No one is alone 
Truly 
No one is alone I wish... 
I know 
Mother isn't here now 
Wrong things, right things 
Who knows what she'd say? 
Who can say what's true? 
Nothing's quite so clear now 
Do things, fight things 
Feel you've lost your way? 
You decide, but 
You are not alone 
Believe me 
No one is alone (No one is alone) 
Believe me 
Truly People make mistakes 
Fathers 
Mothers 
People make mistakes 
Holding to their own 
Thinking they're alone 
Honor their mistakes 
Fight for their mistakes 
Everybody makes 
One another's terrible mistakes 
Witches can be right, giants can be good 
You decide what's right, you decide what's good Just remember 
Just remember 
Someone is on your side (Our side) 
Our side 
Someone else is not 
While we're seeing our side (Our side) 
Our side 
Maybe we forgot, they are not alone 
No one is alone 
Someone is on your side 
No one is alone
