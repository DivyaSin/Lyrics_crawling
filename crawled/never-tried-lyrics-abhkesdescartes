Old habits 
And the bad ones 
If you wanna mend them 
They-always bounce back 
From the ceiling of the world 
To your life 
And so I've never tried 
And so I've never tried 
.................................................... 
Now you've recognised 
I am the one with such features 
In my yard 
I drink, smoke 
Tell the pain and laugh 
Old love 
And the sad one 
If you wanna make again 
They always bounce back 
From the ceiling of the world 
To your life 
And so I've never tried 
And so I've never tried 
...................................................... 
I loved-broke up 
Clicked with new one 
But the same followed up 
As I've told 
They always bounce back 
From the ceiling of the world 
To your life 
And so I've never tried 
And so I've never tried 
...................................................... 
Sweet days 
And the past ones 
If you wanna feel them 
They always bounce back 
From the ceiling of the world 
To your life 
And so I've never tried 
And so I've never tried 
Now you've recognized 
I am the one with such features 
In my yard 
I am the one with such features 
in my yard 
.....................................................
