Well, I changed my ways to please that woman 
But I could never be good enough 
I gave up drinkin' and took up churchin' 
And for awhile it wasn't tough But barkeep I've made a decision 
After doing the best I could 
That for better or worse 
I'm gonna be bad for good So bring on the whiskey 
Turn up the jukebox loud 
These boots were made for tonkin' 
Warn every woman around I'm gonna wind it up tonight 
A little tighter than I should 
Yeah, for better or worse 
I'm gonna be bad for good I really like my reputation 
And how I'm known all over town 
Of being the first in my generation 
To close every single honky tonk down I'm gonna be a tough act to follow 
Doin' what I said I would 
Yeah, for better or worse 
I'm gonna be bad for good So bring on the whiskey 
Turn up the jukebox loud 
These boots were made for tonkin' 
Warn every woman around I'm gonna wind it up tonight 
A little tighter than I should 
Yeah, for better or worse 
I'm gonna be bad for good 
Oh, somebody be bad I'm gonna wind it up tonight 
A little tighter that I should 
Yeah, for better or worse 
I'm gonna be bad for good 
Yeah, for better or worse 
I'm gonna be bad for good
