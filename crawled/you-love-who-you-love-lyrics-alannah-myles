I 
Can leave you like that 
Just walk out the door 
And never come back I 
Can stay all my life 
With you by my side 
I might call it always I 
Ask you to change 
To be someone else 
One that I dream of I 
Can hope that in time 
Both my love wait at the end of the day loving you love If 
The waves turns storm of the ocean 
If 
The skys grow dark with rain 
We will see it through clear water 
If each of us 
If each of us 
Gives just a little more I 
Can say that we were through and just stay away 
And find someone new 
But 
All my words would be lies 
We both of us know what's true 
At the end of the day love cooh love If 
The waves turn the storm of the ocean 
If 
The skies grow dark with rain 
We will see it through clear water 
If each of us 
If each of us 
Can gives just a little more, 
Oh, just a little more 
Oh yeah, yeah We will see it through clear water 
If each of us 
If each of us 
Can gives just a little more Ooh ooh ooh 
Can gives just a little more
