I try to find a way to get to the other side. 
And I dont know why Im losing my mind. Its hard to 
imagine how it would feel, 
being here without you. Cause every time I find 
myself trying to impress you, 
I realize Im wasting my time. 
And, oh how hard is it to believe? 
That its not me who needs to change. Why do people try to act like you? 
Is it that difficult to be yourself? 
I know, Ive been there too! Its hard to 
imagine how it would feel, 
being here without you. Cause every time I find 
myself trying to impress you, 
I realize Im wasting my time. 
And, oh how hard is it to believe? 
That its not me who needs to change. Why is it so hard to be yourself? 
You know its gonna be fine. 
Ive always told you its alright. 
So just stop losing your mind! [Piano Solo] Cause every time I find 
myself trying to impress you, 
I realize Im wasting my time. 
And, oh how hard is it to believe? 
That its not me who needs to change!
