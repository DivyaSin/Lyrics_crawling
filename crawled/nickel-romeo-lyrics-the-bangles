Hey sugar, I had that dream again 
I saw you in your red crushed velvet suit 
Longin' on my feather bed 
A Cheshire Cat in yellow Beatle boots 
Who's that stranger lying in your arms 
Her fingers running down your tattooed chest 
Valentino's crankin' up the charm 
And it's comin' like a freight train 
These pictures in my head Hey Mister (Mister) Nickel Romeo (Nickel Romeo) 
Everybody knows your name 
Hey, hey Mister (Mister) tell me Mister 
What's the game. Falling, yes, she will fall 
Your latest victim bites her lip and sighs 
She'll do the nasty job for you 
Incriminating kisses on the sly 
All I remember how you get your kicks 
Preying on the innocent at night 
Strange desperation, ya gotta cop that fix 
Makin' every little girl is keepin' you alive Hey Mister (Mister) Nickel Romeo (Nickel Romeo) 
Everybody knows your name 
Hey, hey Mister (Mister) tell me Mister 
What's the game. Oh, Nickel Romeo, you got no shame. 
Hey Mister (Mister) Nickel Romeo (Nickel Romeo) 
Everybody knows your name 
Hey, hey Mister (Mister) tell me Mister 
What's the game. Hey mister (Mister) Nickel Romeo (Nickel Romeo) 
Everybody knows your name 
Hey, hey Mister (yeah!) you're the master 
Of this game. Because you got no shame 
I think I'm goin' insane 
And you're to blame.
