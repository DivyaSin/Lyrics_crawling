Your eyes they have this glowing 
You were more than I deserve 
After all our shame and suffering 
I turned my back to everything I really want 
And put you first Are we really in love, completely in love 
Get mention and make your skin start to crawl 
Started off living in Brooklyn 
It unfolded like a dream 
Dazzled by the very thought of it 
Like the way dreams are supposed to be If I'm not what's to come 
I will sleep with it 
I will carry them on 
And we will lose in the end 
Only start the whole pattern over again 
Over again Are you truly in love, absolutely in love 
You're happy enough 
Are you fully in love 
If I'm not the point in carrying on 
Why spend half the time indifferent 
And the other half lone 
I will live with my regrets 
Learn from mistakes and be done with them 
Start the whole thing 
Start the whole thing over again
