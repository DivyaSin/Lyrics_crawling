I made mistakes that could fill great lakes 
I did things a man should never do 
You were so right to leave me, 
To not believe me when I said I'd make it up to you My world turned black my darlin', 
But now you're beautifully back. 
There's nothin' I lack now that you're beautifully back. 
I can't believe it baby, you're really, beautifully back. I've let you down and I broke your heart 
Said things I wish you never knew 
I want to say "forgive me" 
And ask you to imagine starting something new My world turned bright oh sweet darlin', 
And so did your long blonde hair. 
There's nothin' I lack now that you've taken me back. 
As I help you unpack, I can't believe it, baby, 
You're really, beautifully back.
