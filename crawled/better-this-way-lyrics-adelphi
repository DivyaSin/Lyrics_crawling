You know I'd give up everything 
To spend one more night in your arms 
I'd give up everything 
To listen closely to your heartbeat 
But now your up and gone 
It hurts so bad because I really miss you I wish i'd done it differently 
maybe if i played the right cards 
youd be here with me 
i cant bear this broken heart 
ill take the time to see 
stop playing games, leave me wondering if you could see me now 
would you beg or would you cry? 
would you look me in the eyes and say  if you could see me now 
would you beg or would you cry? 
would you look me in the eyes and say how long has it been? 
ive been missing you so much 
did you miss me or was it better this way?  if you could see me now 
would you beg or would you cry? 
would you look me in the eyes and say 
look me in the eyes and say how long has it been? 
ive been missing you so much 
did you miss me or was it better this way?  or was it better this way? how long has it been? 
ive been missing you so much 
did you miss me or was it better this way?
