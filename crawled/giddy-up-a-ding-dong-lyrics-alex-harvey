Come on folks, and get in the groove, we gotta move...... I went ridin' the other night 
Two colour horse, oh my what a sight! 
The name of my horse was Ding Dong 
While we was ridin' and singin' a song Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong (repeat) We rode and we rode the whole night through 
My horse was tired, I was too 
I had a date with ma girl at eight 
Come on Ding Dong we can't be late I said 
Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong (repeat) Got to her house and I got down 
There was the toughest guy in town 
If I went in, he might use force 
Mounted up again and I said to my horse Giddy up, giddy up a Ding Dong (repeat) Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh You got to giddy up a Ding dong, etc
