So wild, so beautiful and pure 
All elements divine 
The essence of all life 
So vast, extensive and remote 
Unbridled and erratic 
Savage but glorious It bursts, its energy is stirring 
It calls, its drawing power 
Will enchant us with its might 
Its massive spirits bright 
Let it flow Its endless beauty will evoke 
A timeless sequence we all share 
We cannot break through nor control 
But to feel its true soul 
Dare to concede and to connect Emerging waves and brightened skies 
The sun that burns in your eyes 
The wind that blows and pounds It shines, its energy is whirling 
It fights, will not be interfered with people 
Who can't feel, it is all nature's flow 
Let it flow It's endless beauty will evoke 
A timeless sequence we all share 
We cannot break through nor control 
We should cherish it Oh, energy 
Oh, evoke me Let it flow 
Its endless beauty will evoke 
A timeless sequence we all share 
We cannot break through nor control 
It is not at our command, no
