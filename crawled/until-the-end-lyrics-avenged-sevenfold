Weekends on young and angry street 
We'd meet, drink 'til trouble found us there 
Living life as without a care We've had our fights, been black and blue 
It's true, I've even gone to jail for you, my friends 
Bet your life that I'd do it again Until the end Don't change the way you think of me 
We're from the same story 
Life moves on, can't stay the same 
But some of us, some worry While some have gone their separate ways 
There's some still caught up with the past instead 
But move on, you're missing most of your life They say it's hard to stay the same 
When some fail, while other men seem to gain 
But friends, I'll be with you here until the end Until the end Don't change the way you think of me 
We're from the same story 
Life moves on, can't stay the same 
But some of us, some worry We're all falling forward with no signs of slow 
And some moving faster 
But that's all that I wanted, I wanted You know it's hard, it's passing by 
Memories, be out all night 
To reminisce wont bring you back 
Just look ahead and hold on tight We're all falling forward with no signs of slow 
And some moving faster 
But that's all that I wanted, I wanted Don't change the way you think of me, oh yeah Until the end, until the end 
Until the end, until the end
