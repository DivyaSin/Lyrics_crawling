Gonna jump back on this two lane highway 
Set my wheels in motion back to you 
I've been gone so long now girl 
Your memory's all I've got to see me through 
Telephone poles are whizzing by 
But that ain't fast enough 
Peddle down, flying low, the things we do for love. Head on , flat out, wide open 
Like a freight train out of the blue 
Nothin's gonna slow me down 
Wound up so tight I'm smoking 
Baby just a thinking 'bout you 
Nothin's gonna slow me down 
Nothin's gonna slow me down If it rains all night and the creek gets high and the bridge floats by 
I'll find my way to you 
Baby keep that porch light burning 
'Cause we've got lots of catching up to do 
The thought of you is driving me right out of control 
Ain't nothing getting goin' in my way 
'Cause babe I'm coming home 
Telephone poles are whizzing by 
But that ain't fast enough 
Peddle down, flying low, the things we do for love. No cops, stop signs, red lights 
Nothin's gonna slow me down 
Pot Holes, Wide loads, who knows 
Nothin's gonna slow me down
