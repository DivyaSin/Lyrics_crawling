Well, Ill never forget the first time that I heard 
That pretty mouth say that dirty word 
And I cant even remember now what she backed my truck into 
But she covered her mouth and her face got red 
And she just looked so darn cute That I couldnt even act like I was mad 
Yeah, I live for little moments like that Thats like just last year on my birthday 
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake 
And every smoke detector in the house was going off 
She was just about to cry until I took her in my arms And I tried not to let her see, me laugh 
Yeah, I live for little moments like that I know shes not perfect but she tries so hard for me 
And I thank God that she isnt 'cause, how boring would that be? 
Its the little imperfections, its the sudden change in plans 
When she misreads the directions and were lost but holding hands Yeah, I live for little moments like that When shes laying on my shoulder, on the sofa in the dark 
And about the time she falls asleep, so does my right arm 
And I want so bad to move it 'cause it's tingling and it's numb 
But she looks so much like an angel that I dont wanna wake her up Yeah, I live for little moments 
When she steals my heart again and doesnt even know it 
Yeah, I live for little moments like that
