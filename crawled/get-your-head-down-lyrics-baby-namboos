If you are born with it 
It's a gift you won't miss 
It's like breathing 
So if you're offered free new tricks 
Accept it with open arms 
'cause there ain't no four leaf clovers 
Or no gypsy lucky charms Keep knocking on the walls 
And I'll blow off your... Turn in seven hundred hours 
Turn in circles again 
To raise our clan 
Life in the pen 
My brain is mangled,sanity too 
Countin' the days 
I won't do any listenin' Keep knocking on the walls 
And I'll blow off your balls 
Knock on the door 
You're asking for more 
Come in the room 
Gettin' sent your doom As the waves roll in 
My five senses wearin' prim 
Waves of tiny people 
Trapped in a russian tin 
People all over the world are screamin' 
For the love of a young child will be fadin' 
A taste of water and corruption 
While faith and religions all over the world 
Self-destruction 
Many controllin' the place of a dollar 
Or it's a creator on the streets flippin' collars A bomb with a snake 
In both of your fists 
While a hurricane was blowin' 
Breathing,just around the corner from you 
A bomb with a snake 
In both of your fists 
While a hurricane was blowin' 
Breathing,just around the corner from you Party's empty 
While I'm havin' to shave 
It doesn't smell good 
Beginning to fade 
Stimulation I need 
Some positive feed 
It's time to create,don't anticipate 
Put this all behind 
Try to look through 
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do Keep knockin' on the walls 
And I'll blow off your... A bomb with a snake 
In both of your fists 
While a hurricane was blowin' 
Breathing just around the corner from you
