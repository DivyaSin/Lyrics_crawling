It's not what you'd expect 
This time it's for real 
And no one can make the decision for you 
I can't help you now 
Neither can your friends 
It's up to you and only you 
Only You *Chorus* 
Please don't go 
Away 
You've come so far 
I'm asking you to stay 
Please don't go 
You've come too far to walk away 
Please don't go
