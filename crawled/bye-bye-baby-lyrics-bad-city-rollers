If you hate me after what I say 
Can't put if off any longer 
I just gotta tell ya anyway Bye 
bye baby 
baby goodbye 
Bye 
bye baby 
don't make me cry You're the one girl in town I'd marry 
Girl 
I'd marry you now if I were free 
I wish it could be. 
I could love you but why begin it 
'Cos there ain't any future in it She's got me and I'm not free 
so: Bye 
bye baby 
baby goodbye 
. . . Wish I never had known you better 
Wish I knew you before I met her 
Gee 
How good it would be for me. 
Shoulda told her that I can't linger There's a wedding ring on my finger She's got me and I'm not free 
so: Bye 
bye baby 
baby goodbye 
. . .
