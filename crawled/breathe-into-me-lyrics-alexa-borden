In my mind you are here. 
In my mind you are real. 
In my mind, In my mind. To my eyes you draw near. 
To my eyes you appear in my mind. 
In my mind you are mine. 
You are mine. Why should I wallow in my want 
or drown in my need? 
If you were wanting you'd be 
more than a memory. So you're still broken? 
You say you're barely still alive. 
I'll let you go because I want you to survive.
