This dusk as sudden night turns to dawn 
I know you've already been here too long 
Too long too long 
Although you won't see me fall from grace 
You step on my soul as you walk away 
My demons you'll never know 
I'm letting you go [Chorus]

'Cause I spread my wings 
And I glide around town

Find your home I miss you so 
Spread your wings let it flow
