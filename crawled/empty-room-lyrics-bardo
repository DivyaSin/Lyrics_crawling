Empty Room 
I thought I wanted it this way 
I thought I really meant the words I said 
I had so many reasons in my head 
But all I really needed was a little time and space 
But that was just a phase 
Now it's an empty room Without you, without you 
It's an empty room 
To come home, to come home to 
It's an empty room 
Without you, without you 
And this empty room 
Just isn't home, 
it isn't home without you Well I guess I'm out of sorts 
I must have been completely out of my head 
'Cause I feel like a stranger in my own bed 
And all the walls and ornaments they seem to offend me 
won't you forgive me?
