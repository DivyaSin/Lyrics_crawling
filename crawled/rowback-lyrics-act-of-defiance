Stuck, a relic in time. 
Dated, erase from from my mind. 
Your words have have no merit. 
Whisper from the past, grin and bear it. 
Actions, horrid thinks you do. 
Court jester playing the fool. 
Hypocrite in your belief. 
To all you're nothing but a thief! 
But a thief! 
Time has come. 
Penance for things you've done. 
Lies spilling from your teeth. 
Spewing up from beneath. 
You're a throwback! 
Winding back the hands. 
Takking back what is mine. 
Life no longer will i give. 
Another suckerto help you live. 
Your presence makes me sick. 
Spreading lies, think it makes you sick. 
On the table, nothingto offer. 
Morally bankrupt, empty the coffer. 
Casting out the line. 
Friendship torn,we pay the fine. 
put us all on the hook, 
for the lives that you took. 
You're a throwback! 
Nothing but a throwback! 
THROWBACK! THROWBACK! THROWBACK! THROWBACK! 
Bad blood, on the wall. 
Shouts echo through the hall. 
And though, you can't see. 
Your absence I discree. 
Dagger, in the back. 
Cold blood, soul of black. 
Live and learn, we've all heard. 
On your own,the absurd 
SOLO 
Cockroach under my foot. 
Scurrying away with what you took. 
Back from the filth, which you came. 
Stealing ideas for your acclaim. 
Parasite bleeding out my vein. 
Diminishing the soulas you drain. 
Weakened will, you're left with doubt. 
It's at this time I cast you out. 
Talking behind our backs. 
Making allies with false facts. 
The circles that you spin. 
Confusion, chaos, you can't win. 
You're a throwback! 
Nothing but a throwback! 
Vulture picking through the scraps. 
Rummage around your hopes collapes. 
Picked to the bone no more to swallow. 
Retribution soon to follow. 
Virus spreading through the human race, 
disguised as a friend as you try to save face. 
The fever runs its frantic course, 
rooting you out at the source. 
Hour glass of fate. 
Falling sands as you berate. 
Kinship only as it serves. 
Wretched friendship no one deserves. 
You're a throwback! 
Nothing but a throwback! 
CHORUS 
THROWBACK!
