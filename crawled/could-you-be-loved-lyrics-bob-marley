Could you be loved and be loved? 
Could you be loved and be loved? Don't let them fool ya 
Or even try to school ya, oh, no 
We've got a mind of our own 
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right 
Love would never leave us alone 
A-yin the darkness there must come out to light Could you be loved and be loved? 
Could you be loved, wo now, and be loved? (The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too 
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you) 
Love your brotherman 
(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved? 
Could you be, could you be loved? 
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved? 
Could you be, could you be loved?) Don't let them change ya, oh 
Or even rearrange ya, oh, no 
We've got a life to live 
They say, only, only 
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive 
Stay alive, eh Could you be loved and be loved? 
Could you be loved, wo now, and be loved? (You ain't gonna miss your water until your well runs dry 
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied)
