Here I am 
Fighting this war, I stand 
Wearing these scars on my hands 
Everything's going as planned 
'Cause everyone but me understands 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
Just doing what I can 
We've all been there 
Well, do you understand? 
Here I go 
Walking this long winding road 
And I keep walking it all alone 
Well, never really sure of what I know 
Just taking the tide as it flows 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
Just doing what I can 
We've all been there 
Well, do you understand 
The way we rise and fall? 
We're building just to break apart 
All I know is that I have myself 
Here I am 
Fighting this war, I stand 
Wearing these scars on my hands 
Everything's going as planned 
'Cause everyone but me understands 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
Just doing what I can 
We've all been there 
Well, do you understand 
The way we rise and fall? 
We're building just to break apart 
All I know is that I have myself 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
Just doing what I can 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
I'm doing what I can 
We've all been there 
Just doing what I can 
We've all been there 
We've all been there
