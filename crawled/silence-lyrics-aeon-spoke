Draw me a picture of the sun 
so i can hang it in my room 
i can make believe that i am getting warm 
find courage to pursue Well we only hurt to afford the sun 
we stare at the stars that tear us apart 
and we laugh, the mirror speaks out silence, silence So tell me beauty won't decrease 
is to fail to? attain 
my instincts like a life i left 
still linger Well we only hurt to afford the sun 
to stare at the darkness and pray for some stars 
then we cry 
we found a new ark Silence, silence Im still wishing you love 
we stare at the dark 
im still wishing you love 
silence
