She stops for coffee every morning 
Grabs the paper while she's yawning 
Wishing she was still in bed 
And though her cup is always full 
The 8am express is leaving her without 
A choice to stay 
But where does she go 
And who really knows the girl deep inside 
The one she always tries to hide Julie, Julie don't you know 
You're riding on a carousel 
That's going no where round and round 
And round when will it end 
Don't ever be afraid 
To ride upon the biggest pony 
Open up the gates and let it carry you away She works so hard without a break 
But every now and then she dreams 
Of all, the lovely places she could go 
She wonders if she will ever arrive
