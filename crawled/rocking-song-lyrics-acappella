Sing this rocking, sing this rocking, sing this rocking song Gonna hold this child, gonna hold her tight 
Gonna hold my baby till the morning light

I will love this child so small and meek

Gonna let her know that nothing's wrong 
Gonna hold my baby and sing this rocking song Sing this rocking, sing this rocking, sing this rocking song 
Sing this rocking, sing this rocking, sing this rocking song (this child) Gonna hold this child, gonna hold her near 
Gonna hold my baby, wipe away her tears 
I will keep on rocking till she feels all right 
Gonna sing her songs about Jesus Christ (Jesus) 
Gonna hold this child, gonna hold her near
