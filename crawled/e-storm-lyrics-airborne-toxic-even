Before it took you away 
I tried to think of something I could say 
I watched the shadows in the hall 
How they danced with the light and the white on the walls Your face in these pictures looks like a poem 
Your eyes lit up like a river stone 
Your body so much like a blanket thrown 
On a warm bed at night, like a house in a storm Then you walk right through the doorway 
You tell me you're here to stay 
The worst is gone and by God I love 
If you'd been here this way I surprise myself sometimes 
The way the days unfold and this road unwinds 
You tell me you see it too 
And the miles seem like inches when I think of you Its been 25 day since I've been gone 
25 weeks since I've seen my home 
I spent 25 months chasing this song 
and all of this time I've been alone Then you walk right through the doorway 
You tell me your here to stay 
The worst is gone and by God I love 
If you'd been here this way And you knew it all along 
I wasn't happy all along 
and your body all I wanted 
let me to just come home Then you walk right through the doorway 
You tell me you're here to stay 
The worst is gone and by God I love 
If you'd been here this way And I only just learned how to stand like a man 
I've got 25 years of running instead 
How could I see the ground at my feet 
The truth is to me that I was caught in the storm 
That I wasn't alone
