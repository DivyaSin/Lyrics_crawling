There's a bleeder in my kitchen, 
And he's pouring on my floor. 
There's a killer in my hallway, 
And he's scratching at my door. 
I think I might have heard some screaming; 
I might have heard somebody cry. 
Now I wonder am I dreaming, 
Or is my mind telling me a lie? 
Well I can't run any further, 
And I can't hide anymore. 
And I think there's been a murder, 
Up on the ground floor. 
There's a boa in my bathroom, 
And he's coiling in my sink; 
He wants my cats I think. 
Paranoia in my house now, and I'm balanced on the brink. 
Well I can't run any further, 
And I can't hide anymore. 
And I think there's been a murder, 
Up on the ground floor. 
I'm living in a basement flat, in a quiet part of town. 
I bet you wonder where my head is at, when I'm imagining all these sounds. 
I'd check it out but I'm glued to my chair; 
I can't make it to the door. 
I could be bugging, but I'd gladly swear: 
I just heard a body hit the floor, 
And I can't run any further. 
I can't hide, I can't hide anymore, 
And I think there's been a murder, up above me on the ground, 
On the ground floor.
