Ohh yeah...mmmmm I finally found someone, who knocks me off my feet, 
I finally found the one, who makes me feel complete. It started over coffee, 
We started off as friends, 
Its funny how from simple things, 
The best things begin. This time its different, (nah nah nah nah) 
Its all because of you, (nah nah nah nah) 
Its better than its ever been, 
Cause we can talk it through... OHHH My favorite line, 
Was can i call you sometime? 
Its all you had to say, 
To take my breath away. Chorus: This is it, 
Oh i finally found someone, 
Someone to share my life, i finally found the one, 
To be with everynight 
Cause whatever i do, its just got to be you 
My life has just begun, i finally found someone Did i keep you waiting? i didn't mind. 
I apologize. Baby thats fine. 
I will wait forever just to know you were mine. 
You know i love your hair, are you sure it looks right? 
I love what you wear, isnt it too tight? 
Your exceptional, i cant wait for the rest of my life... This is it, 
Oh i finally found someone, 
Someone to share my life, i finally found the one, 
To be with everynight 
Cause whatever i do, its just got to be you 
My life has just begun, i finally found someone Cause whatever i do, its just got to be you 
Oh my life has just begun...i finally found...someone.
