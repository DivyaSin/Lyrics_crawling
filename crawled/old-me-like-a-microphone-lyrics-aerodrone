Hold me like a microphone 
Turn me on and off and make me 
Say it's magic 
Yes it's magic to me Hold me like an air guitar 
Run your fingers up my neck 
And play "It's magic, yes it's magic to me" Hold me like the keyboard notes 
You've been practicing for days 
And hope that someday 
You'll be on your way I always see you in the frontrows 
Your eyes as wide as the television screens 
Telling the stories of my oh so instant fame 
And maybe you'll be on the guestlist 
And I can meet you after the show 
In the parking lot next to the 
Super Eight Motel Hold me like a microphone 
Twist and turn anyway you want 
"It's magic yes it's magic to me" Hold me like a tamborine 
Shake shake shake so everyone can see 
That you're the only one for me Hold me like a crash cymbal 
Pound me 'till you're out of breath 
And now it's over time for someone new I hope I hope I hope I'm turning you on 
I hope I hope you're singing along 
I wish I wish I wish I could just stop 
But this is what it takes to string you along Hold me like a microphone [x4]
