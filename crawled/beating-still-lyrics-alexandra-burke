Love tore me apart, it broke my to my knees 
Some days I cried so hard, till I could hardly breathe 
It felt like my heart would stop, with ever tear I dropped 
But I couldnt have been more wrong, cause the rhythm carries on 
Love tore me apart, but my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart 
Is beating still, beating, still, beating still 
Bringing me back to life 
Beating still, beating still, beating still 
Bringing me back to life 
Love tore me apart, but it also showed the way 
Cause it rose up from thelike a phoenix through the flames 
My heat is the bass tonight, and my beat never felt so right 
And now dancing towards the and the rhythm carries on 
Love tore me apart, but my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart 
Is beating still, beating, still, beating still 
Bringing me back to life 
Beating still, beating still, beating still 
Bringing me back to life 
I got lost on my side, can feel the love here tonight 
I got lost on my side, can feel the love here tonight 
Love tore me apart, so love tore me apart 
Beating still, beating still, beating still 
Bringing me back to life 
Beating still, beating still, beating still 
Bringing me back to life.
