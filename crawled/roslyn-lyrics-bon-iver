Up with your turret 
Aren't we just terrified? 
Shale, screen your worry from what you won't ever find Don't let it fool you 
Don't let it fool you down 
Dancing around, folds in her gown Sea and the rock below 
Cocked to the undertow Bones blood and teeth erode 
They will be crashing low Wings wouldn't help you 
Wings wouldn't help you down 
Down towards the ground, gravity's proud. You barely are blinking 
Wagging your face around 
When'd this just become a mortal home? Won't, won't, won't, won't 
Won't let you talk me 
Won't let you talk me... down 
We'll pull it taut, nothing let out
