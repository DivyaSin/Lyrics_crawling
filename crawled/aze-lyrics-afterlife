No life to follow 
Especially not mine 
Hate feeds on sorrow 
My memory of a crime I know you don't remember 
'Cause you were just a child 
A whole explosion of anger 
Humanity went wild 
No risk was involved 
But the soal of earth was down You and you alone 
And everybody else is gone 
A fallen angel under star of sadness 
I try to reach your hand 
But I fall down in the sand 
A life is lost down under all the madness
