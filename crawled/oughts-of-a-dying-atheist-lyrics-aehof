I know you're coming to find me 
I can feel the sense of dread 
In your books, the Qur'an and the Bible 
And now as I lie in this bed 
I can see the end is nearing 
And the light is coming close 
As I turn to face the black sky 
Becoming covered in the darkness' cloak It's scary, the thoughts of a dying atheist 
Converting, the scenes of a life without 
Reborn, just before the ending 
Out of time to correct 
The life of a dying atheist 
The thoughts of a dying atheist 
The time is left 
To attempt to right 
The wrongs in a life 
That's been without light 
And to change the thoughts 
Of years of woe 
And listen at last 
To the words of hope 
And change the thoughts of a dying atheist The end is nearing, slowly 
I just lie down to rest 
And close my eyes in silence 
Considering the wine and the bread 
As the philosophy of my life 
Falls apart at the seams 
And the worrying about our human lives 
Seems worthless and completely obscene The life of a sinner 
Eternally damned 
Facing corruption 
At Lucifer's hands
