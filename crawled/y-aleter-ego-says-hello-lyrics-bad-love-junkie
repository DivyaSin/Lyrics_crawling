I hear it talking in my head 
& breathing deeply through my nose 
I feel it slip into my skin 
Light up a cigarette then blow My alter ego say's hello 
My alter ego say's hello It's cracking jokes and talking wild 
Collection numbers as it goes 
Debating arbitrary facts 
So watch your girlfriend Romeo When my alter ego says hello 
When my alter ego says hello I think Im losing my grip 
It's riding high I'm laying low 
My troubles grow my egos laughing 
And I'm about to explode I have a monster in my head 
I've fed it well and watched it grow 
But now it's cut off my connection 
One of us has to go My alter egos in control 
My alter egos in control 
My alter ego says hello
