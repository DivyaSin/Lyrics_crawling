My wife has a charge card 
That I got her the other day, 
I owe five hundred dollars 
That's just for yesterday. I said, 
"Honey, here's a present go out and shop around. 
Get a couple of dresses and browse around 
Downtown." 
She did just what I told her, 
Bought one, two or three 
Then came home looking silly 
Making goo-goo eyes at me. [Chorus: x3] 
Master Charge 
Master Charge 
A Bank of America Card I said, "Did you get your dresses?" 
She said, "Yes, one or two, 
But I had to get me some shoes and I needed 
Some jewelry too." She had $200 dresses 
That I could have made and I can't sowe! 
Fifty Dollars pair of shoes 
And I thought you so and so. I said, "What about the jewelry?" 
As calmly as I could. 
She said, "Honey, you'll love them. They're pure African wood." [Chorus: x3] Let's charge it! 
Let's charge it! She said, "They were $200 and I paid 
One and a half!" 
I just didn't believe it, 
I was so mad I had to laugh. I could see it in my mind 
On a horse like Paul Revere 
I check my mail box 
'Cause these bills keep coming here. [Chorus: x3] Charge it! 
Let's charge it! 
Let's charge it!
