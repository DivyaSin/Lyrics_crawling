I've known you for a long time 
But I can't go taking your side 
You can try to play my heartstrings 
You can try just about anything You might not want to see it 
But that won't stop you from being it 
Is this going to be a problem? 
'Cause I'll make it my problem Don't run 
I know it's harder to stay 
There is no easier way 
To face the mess we've made Don't run 
I know it's harder to stay 
There is no easier way 
To face the mess we've made You say you don't like living here 
But your reason's never really clear 
Maybe you don't know what to do. 
I'd be poor as hell if I were you. You might not wanna see it 
But that won't stop you from being it 
Is this gonna be a problem? 
'Cause I'll make it my problem Don't run 
I know it's harder to stay 
There is no easier way 
To face the mess we've made Don't run 
I know it's harder to stay 
There is no easier way 
To face the mess we've made Don't run 
I'm not so sure this city is too big to outgrow 
So when you turn around you know Don't run 
I know it's harder to stay 
There is no easier way 
To face the mess we've made Don't run 
I know it's harder to stay 
There is no easier way 
To face the mess we've made
