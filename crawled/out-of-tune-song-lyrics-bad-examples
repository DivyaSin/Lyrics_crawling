Just an out of tune song for an out of tune day 
I got home from work and I'm not good for anything 
I guess I'll have a beer and play it anyway 
Just an ordinary guy with a tangled up life 
And dreams and emotions that take me by surprise 
I don't know why my life hits me right between the eyes 
(chorus) 
Needless to say, it's been another pointless day 
But I thought I'd call you up and let you know 
There's nothing on my mind but an out of tune song... I'm an amoeba's grandson in a pair of blue jeans 
If the world is a stage I must have got lost between scenes 
I read the script but I've forgotten what it means 
So I sit on my porch with a beat-up guitar 
And I watch the girls as they wander past my yard 
If they could see me barbeque I know I'd be a star Chorus Please don't get me wrong 
I'm in no mood to complain 
I can still feel the sun on my face 
Standing in the rain Just an out of tune song that I should forget 
From one of those days when it's safer just to quit 
Madmen and fools love to dig a bigger pit 
So I sit on my porch and I howl at the moon 
I've got this aching feeling that it's ending much too soon 
If I could just get this song in tune Chorus
