Life was oh so, so erotic 
Somewhere deep inside his eyes 
Share a joke, drink a coke 
Tighten up your favourite clothes 
Lovers always 
Telling lies 
Maybe they're just outta time 
Dig a hole on your own 
satan's crawlin on my soul Turn around, face this way 
Better to avoid the rays 
Plastic hearts ignore the pain 
But oh, oh, oh mean Mr. Terror believe it 
Build me a queen with with your magnetic machine 
Hey Mr. Terror believe it 
Build me a queen with with your magnetic machine 
I want to be my subterranean queen 
Oh no, no, no natives are frightened away 
Oh no, no, no she's gonna blow you away 
Mean Mr. Terror believe it 
Build me a queen with your magnetic machine 
Mean Mr. Terror believe it 
Build me a queen with your bikini machine man 
I want you to be my subterranean queen
