Late afternoon, the sun's going down 
I call on your cell (Why's he in such a hurry?) 
Leaving the room, he's mumbling too 
Asking for his shoes (just leaving out he blue) 
No explanation, no actual location 
Just watching him pacing (wonder who he's stressing) 
Little conversation, leavin' no debating, he left the door swingin' [Chorus] 
You better open your mind 
To read between the lines 
You gotta read between the lines [Repeat: x3] Nine in the morning, up, up, up way before breakfast 
Homeboy gettin' restless 
(The room is full of questions) 
Little replyin', whole lot of denyin' 
You're steady collidin' 
(So why do he keep on trying?) 
I search for the median, now he's a comedian 
That's all the more reason 
(He's changing like the seasons) 
Are you still pleasing? 
Well, soon you'll be leaving 
Which one will be grieving? [Chorus] Your replies are getting old 
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines 
Lies are gettin' told 
Look in his eyes 
You gotta read between the lines Your replies are getting old 
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines 
Lies are gettin' told 
Look in his eyes 
You gotta read between the lines Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me 
'Cause I, I know what's going on 
I hope you ain't making plans on running me 
'Cause that, that ain't what I'm on 
Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me 
'Cause you'll look up, and I'll be gone 
I hope you ain't making plans on running me 
'Cause I read between the lines Who got you thinkin' you ishh ain't been stinkin'? 
My temperature's peakin' 
(Why are you barely speakin'?) 
I'm bustin' his bubble, and he know he in trouble 
He's talkin' in doubles 
(I'm listening but hardly believing) 
Changing the story, or trying to ignore me 
Still reaching out for me 
(But, still, I'm hardly reaching) 
Give me a reason to put you back on line 
You've wasted enough time I had to open my mind 
To read between the lines 
You gotta read between the lines [Repeats] Your replies are getting old 
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines 
Lies are gettin' told 
Look in his eyes 
You gotta read between the lines Your replies are getting old 
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines 
Lies are gettin' told 
Look in his eyes 
You gotta read between the lines
