A symphony of dying sings 
returning patrons to their seats 
dead opera hiss and roar the sky 
push and pulling satellites 
everybody's saying grace 
to tidal waves and empty plates we turn the clocks ahead 
and hope to wake up well nothing feels like anything 
and when it hurts you know it's love 
dead opera hiss and roar the sky 
and when it hurts you know it's love 
we tear at skin until it's gone 
and when it hurts you know it's love we turn the lights down low 
and watch the earth explode
