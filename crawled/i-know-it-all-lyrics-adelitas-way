Walk into the room with your head high 
Never listen 'cause you're busy giving bad advice 
You try to tell me how I should do my thing 
You say you know how it goes 'cause you're big time 
What's going on in your mind in the meantime? 
Insecure, but sure of everything Hey there, you're a know it all a one-upper, a motherfucker 
Hey there, you're a know it all, you're a know it all, you're a know it all 
Hey there, you're a know it all, a one-upper, a motherfucker 
Hey there, you're a know it all, you're a know it all, you're a know it all Every time that you talk it's a big show 
Never heard you say the words I don't know 
You'll feed your ego anything 
Why don't you tell me what to name my first kid? 
Show me how to blow my money like you did 
You can even tell me what song to sing Hey there, you're a know it all a one-upper, a motherfucker 
Hey there, you're a know it all, you're a know it all, you're a know it all 
Hey there, you're a know it all, a one-upper, a motherfucker 
Hey there, you're a know it all, you're a know it all, you're a know it all I don't know what do you want? 
You don't know who I am 
I don't know what do you want? Hey there, you're a know it all a one-upper, a motherfucker 
Hey there, you're a know it all, you're a know it all, you're a know it all 
Hey there, you're a know it all, a one-upper, a motherfucker 
Hey there, you're a know it all, you're a know it all, you're a know it all
