In the ashes of our greatest year 
I forced the point and gave them grief 
As if I find relief to see the worst in everyone 
Still it's hard to be cruel to you 
I wish I could- no that's not it 
See what I mean to say is this 
In this mad world it's hard to see the imperfection in your smile 
And it's hard to be true to you 
Even though I run away from you, I'm sorry 
I wish I had chosen to be true 
I'm sorry, I miss your disposition and your strength 
I'll miss your disposition and your 
Strength to see the best in everyone 
Still it's hard to cruel to you
