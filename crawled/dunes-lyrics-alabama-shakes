Somewhere over the dunes, love 
I walk, I wept 
Enough 
I turn the desert into sea, babe 
I swam from the depths 
I don't know whose problem it is 
I don't know whose love to give 
I'm losing it Somewhere in me, a memory that I cannot gather anymore 
Oh, my word 
Oh, my, my 
Wide and empty Oh, I think I'm losing it 
Oh, I think I'm losing it 
Oh, I don't know what to do about it 
Well, I'm not going to show about it I don't know whose problem it is 
I don't know whose fuck to give 
I'm losing it 
Losing it 
Losing it 
Losing it 
Losing it 
Losing it 
Losing it 
Losing it 
Losing it 
Losing it
