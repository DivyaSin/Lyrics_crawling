Dear sister poet 
dear brother poet too 
These tears that words are make me wanna be with you 
But I need to spend my body I'm a music makin' man 
And no page can release it like this amplifier can. This is my rock and roll love letter to you 
This is my rock and roll love letter to you 
Gonna sign it 
gonna seal it 
gonna mail to away 
Gonna mail it today. God 
I must be crazy to express myself this way 
But there ain't much romance livin' in the USA. 
This guitar is a blessing 
this piano is a muse 
And electricity's a devil with a twenty amp fuse. This is my rock and roll love letter to you 
. . . . Dear Mamma 
Pappa hey your boy is doin' fine 
And this energy you gave him keeps on tryin' to unwind 
'Cause I see an ancient rhythm in a man's genetic code 
Gonna keep on rock and rollin' till my genes explode This is my rock and roll love letter to you 
This is my rock and roll love letter to you 
Gonna rock it gonna reel it gonna shake it away 
Send me back one 
send me back one some day.
