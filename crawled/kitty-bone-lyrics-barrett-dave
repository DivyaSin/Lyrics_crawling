Kittybone's waitin' 
In a back room Mister 
Kittybone's deep with 
The chit chat sisters oh ah. 
Kittybone now where are ya goin' 
Don't ya know we are so misunderstood 
Kittybone I'm try'n to do some good. 
Kittybone's men they 
All have blisters

The ones who resist her oh ah 
Kittybone now where are ya goin' 
don't ya know we are so misunderstood 
Kittybone I'm try'n to do some good 
Kittybone's 
Got her things in gear 
Her high healed shoes, 
they show no fear 
Mister John says 
Come and stand by me 
And Kittybone 
She is beyond the grace 
and with her plastic lips 
She kisses my face 
Kittybone won't you 
Come and smile by me. 
Kittybone wants someone 
Who's gonna miss her 
She'll find herself 
Alone, all tied up, 
Play'n twister oh ah. 
Kittybone

Don't you know we 
Are so misunderstood 
Kittybone I'm try'n 
To do some good 
Kittybone now 
Where are ya goin' 
Kittybone we 
Are so misunderstood 
Kittybone 
I'm try'n to do some good.
