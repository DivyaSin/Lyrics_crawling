I woke up this morning to the hummin' of the engines 
Haulin' nature's finest from the Gulf of Mexico 
Riding this ol' river is peaceful but it's lonesome 
And it makes me wonder how the old folks are at home [Chorus] 
Now the years have blown by me like the wind through the pines 
But the song of the south is ever sweet as homemade wine 
Oh, how I miss those mountains when the laurels are in bloom 
And the southern stars are dancin' 'round a North Carolina moon Just rolled through Memphis, I could hear them guitars playin' 
They had the blues so bad it almost broke my heart 
But it don't sound nothing like a band of tree frogs singin' 
When every now and then they'd get in tune with grandpa's harp [Chorus] 
Now the years have blown by me like the wind through the pines 
But the song of the south is ever sweet as homemade wine 
Oh, how I miss those mountains when the laurels are in bloom 
And the southern stars are dancin' 'round a North Carolina moon Now when I die boys, make me this promise 
You'll send my body back up North Carolina way 
I don't want no tombstone, just lay me next to mama 
And let the honeysuckle grow wild upon my grave [Chorus] 
Now the years have blown by me like the wind through the pines 
But the song of the south is ever sweet as homemade wine 
Oh, how I miss those mountains when the laurels are in bloom 
And the southern stars are dancin' 'round a North Carolina moon Yeah, the southern stars are dancin' 'round a North Carolina moon 
North Carolina moon 
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh 
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
