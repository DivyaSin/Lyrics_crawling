You've got your beauty queen makeup 
and your hair just right 
Anyone who gets to see you 
sure is in for a sight 
I sit here in wonderment 
and in disbelief 
your glance is so uncomfortable 
just like a petty thief.. 
{chorus} 
You are a queen, you are a picture 
Of what a man is supposed to want to love 
You start to get closer 
and then you're sitting next to me.. 
As you walk by i can 
smell your perfume 
I can actually smell it everywhere 
there's a trail across the room 
I listen to your conversation 
I am hypnotized 
If it's got an end like that 
it must be memorized.. 
{chorus} 
Your lips so red and your skin so white 
Your platinum hair gives off a glow 
Your head begins to turn 
and then you're lookin' right at me.. 
To a girl like you I just don't 
know what to say 
It's too bright here in the theater 
perhaps another day 
It's something in the way you move 
it's something I just don't know 
But it's kinda hard to wanna love you 
when I wanna throw you out the window.. 
{chorus} 
Your heart is being broken by someone! 
And someones' heart is being broken, by you, by you!
