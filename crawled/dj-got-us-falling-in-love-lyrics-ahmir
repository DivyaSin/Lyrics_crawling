So we back in the club 
Get that bodies rocking from side to side (side to side) 
Thank God the week is done 
I feel like a zombie gone back to life (back to life) 
Hands up, and suddenly we all got our hands up 
No control of my body 
Aint I seen you before? 
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
So dance, dance, like its the last, last night of your life, life 
Gonna get you right 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again Keep downing drinks like this 
Not tomorrow that just right now, now, now, now, now, now 
Gonna set the roof on fire 
Gonna burn this mother fall down, down, down, down, down, down 
Hands up, when the music drops 
We both put our hands up 
No control on my body 
Ain't I seen you before 
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
So dance, dance, like its the last, last night of your life, life 
Gonna get you right 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
So dance, dance, like its the last, last night of your life, life 
Gonna get you right Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
So dance, dance, like its the last, last night of your life, life
