I gave it all to you 
With no questions asked 
I wanted a future 
Who cares about my past? 
The first argument 
You up and left 
I seen a change in you 
Words I won't except 
I thought I lost you 
When you twist back my arm 
Cause the man I thought I knew 
Wouldn't do me no harm 
And that ran through my mind, over again 
I promised myself you wouldn't put your hands on me again 
Never No More I didn't sleep that night 
I held my pillow tight 
Now trust me when I say 
You have been told 
I'm telling you never to touch me no more 
Never No More I should've left you 
When you called me out my name 
I stooped to your level 
Replied you the same 
Know here we are again 
You at my throat 
Now I see the same old change 
That I did before 
I walk away from you 
At the drop of a dime 
So often this treatment 
Is way out of line 
And that ran through my mind, over and over again 
Promised my self you wouldn't put your hands on my again 
Never No More You know I rather give your space 
Cause I just don't know 
Where to run, what to say 
Stay out your way, or get in your face 
I just know you better not touch me again 
Or I'll walk away 
That is one game I refuse to play
