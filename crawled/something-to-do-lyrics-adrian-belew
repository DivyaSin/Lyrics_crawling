Try to lose your attitude, put it in your boots 
Or stick it where the sun doesn't shine 
Try to have a good time, it's something to do I read a good book, buy a pair of shoes 
Maybe I'm a strange kinda dude 
But, hey, maybe it's you, it's something to do I understand unhappiness 
An excellent plan for a martyr to have 
But what is the sense of having regrets 
It's only just a waste of time I look at the sky, I walk in the yard 
Study little birds with binoculars 
So, call me a nerd, it's something to do
