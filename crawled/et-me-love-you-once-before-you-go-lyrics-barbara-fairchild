It's like looking in the window of a fine boutique 
Knowing there is nothing I could ever buy 
Still I want your love so much that I could die 
But I just can't lead a double life being one man's lover one man's wife 
But you can start a fire raging just by touching me 
Even though I know we're not supposed to touch 
Oh I've never wanted anyone so much 
How I wish that I had found you first don't you see my heart's about to burst 
Let me love you once before you go 
Your eyes keep saying yes to me so don't keep saying no 
Let me love you once and then you'll see 
No one's ever gonna love you more than me Let me lock the door and open all my love to you 
All the love I've longed to give you since we met 
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get 
And I just can't let it disappear oh my darling please come over here 
Let me love you once before you go... 
No one's ever gonna love you more than me
