A new day is drawing near. 
With all it's hope, and all it's fear. 
I know you're scared, so hold my hand and you'll be safe. 
A million questions, no answers are there. 
Uncertainty, not easy to bear. 
I know you're tired, so use my strength and you'll feel strong. It's time to try with all you've got. 
It's time to make a difference. 
Don't give up, you're worth alot. 
Yes, you're worth alot! An emptiness, growing inside. 
There's no sense, no place to hide. 
I know you're scared, so hold my hand and you'll be safe. 
Broken dreams, replaced with a hole. 
Want to feel, you want to know. 
I know you're tired, so use my strength and you'll feel strong. It's time to try with all you've got. 
It's time to make a difference. 
Don't give up, you're worth alot. 
Yes, you're worth alot! Life is hard and it's unfair. 
But it's not over and you still care. 
I know you're scared, so hold my hand and you'll be safe. Oh! 
So many questions, none of them wrong. 
You've got to keep on keeping on. 
I know you're tired, so use my strength and you'll feel strong. It's time to try with all you've got. 
It's time to make a difference. 
Don't give up, you're worth alot. 
Yes, you're worth alot! 
Can't you see, you're NOT alone. 
We have our friendship, and it has grown. 
Don't give up, you're worth alot. 
Yes, you're worth alot! 
Yes... you're worth alot.
