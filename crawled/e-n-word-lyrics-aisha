Chorus: Racist faces 
One who cases 
A person's color 
But calls you brother 
Or bro or however it goes 
Do you even know 
Or are you just going with the flow Then you use the N Word 
Where it can't be heard 
Behind backs 
And it lacks 
Integrity and honesty 
You're not a friend to me Verse 1: The kids are listening 
Watching your example 
And the hate you spew 
Is more than ample 
To create a racist 
Look at their faces 
Looking for clues 
Trying to be like you God made us all the same 
So your excuses are just a game 
To hide your baseless hate 
But you ought to have more faith 
In the One above 
And His love Chorus: Racist faces 
One who cases 
A person's color 
But calls you brother 
Or bro 
Or however it goes 
Do you even know 
Or are you just going with the flow Then you use the N Word 
Where it can't be heard 
Behind backs 
And it lacks 
Integrity and honesty 
You're not a friend to me Rap: His name doesn't start with an N 
It's starts with an A 
And don't think I don't know the things that you say 
I see through you 
Like X ray vision 
If you want to be a racist 
That's your decision 
I don't believe in Achilles 
But you're a heel 
Because you don't know what it's like to be real 
You think you're better than me 
When I'm smarter than you 
And not because I'm black 
But because you lack 
Common sense and are on both sides of the fence 
If you hate black people so much 
Then why do you tan? 
And why are you that black athlete's #1 fan? 
Grinning and smiling right in his face 
When you know you use the N Word inside your place 
Just imagine if he heard 
You use the N Word 
In the privacy of your home 
When you feel you're all alone 
Or at least you think you are 
But God is where you are 
Out of respect for the men and women who died 
And the ones who struggled and tried 
To create a better world 
For every boy and girl 
You shouldn't use that word 
It should not be heard 
You disrespect their blood 
With your speech 
When you go on to tell and teach 
Your kids that it's okay 
To be the same way 
But it's not 
And just in case you forgot 
Martin Luther King 
Let freedom ring 
Lincoln freed the slaves 
Now you're spitting on their graves 
With a slur that you confer 
To black people 
Who in God's Eyes are your equals 
I know everyone doesn't think this way 
And it's only some who say The N word 
Where it can't be heard 
Behind backs 
And it lacks 
Integrity and honesty 
You're not a friend to me 
You're not a friend to me
