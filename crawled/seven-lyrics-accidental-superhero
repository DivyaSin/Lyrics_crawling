In a moment he steps away 
And the grin on her lips fades away 
And the silence to her is golden 
As the plan that she makes out of fear A sixpence of holdings 
Leaves her wallowing 
And her thoughts plead 
Today is the day But the strain on her needs 
Is what's strangling 
Not needed, not wanted, not dear It's not enough, no not enough at all 
Not at all, it's long enough 
She says, to fall, long to fall Travel down her frown 
To find the thoughts of love pondering 
Justifyingly covering the weak 
Her Galahad has just been wandering Perhaps the steel softens his fall 
But we all see his fists rendering 
Against his will and back again 
No longer just a bad day simmering It's not enough, no not enough at all 
Not at all, it's long enough 
She says, to fall, long to fall So she lands and he smiles 
It's over for awhile 
And the grasp of his love 
Leaves her gasping for air, for air
