Silence screams, "you're just so beautiful in blue" 
Breathless stares, escape your undying eyes 
Are you blind to my sorrow and sympathy? 
A piece of me will die with your last breath 
This will all be over soon 
Glazed eyes long for the waves' embrace 
For you are so lost inside 
Drawn to an end so near Far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice 
Why are you trying to run away? 
My love, I can't find the words to tell you Drown all of your fantasies 
Silent angel crashes through sky, 
With your final broken promise 
Having lost sight of the stars Regal me with your tales of lonely, bittersweet loss 
Giving up comes to easy when hope is gone 
I'll walk away so you can choke on your dying breath 
But if you side against me, to hell with you Far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice 
Why are you trying to run away? 
My love, I can't find the words to tell you The fear has stolen her heart as she wakes from her dream 
Treacherous ink finds her lungs, seizing her screams 
Numb hands now reach too late to take back the light Far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice 
Why are you trying to run away? 
My love, I can't find the words to tell you 
Far away are days when you smiled 
Seas cry out butchering this tragic soul without hope 
Their frailty is broken and now fades into the blue
