It's elemental 
When the story opens 
It's elemental 
Come sunset's gone 
And no surprise then 
When someone was delivered 
He's had a long day 
Talk to the living It's not my way, true, to show best side for you 
I fought my way through to the west side for you It's elemental 
Deeper than the daylight 
And like a werewolf 
There's someone on the inside It's not my way, true, to show best side for you 
I fought my way through to the west side for you 
Not because I wanted to 
To 
Nah nah nah nah nah It's elemental 
Watching from the rooftops 
And no surprise then 
Come sunset's gone It's not my way, true, to show best side for you 
I fought my way through to the west side for you 
Not because I wanted to 
To 
Nah nah nah nah
