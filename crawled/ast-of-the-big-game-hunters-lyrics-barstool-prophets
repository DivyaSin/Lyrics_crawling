I have heard dandelions 
Roaring out in my backyard 
A direct approach is dangerous 
Until you're sure they've dropped their guard You'd be better off to wait 
Until the brutes go for the bait 
And when they can't anticipate 
Is when you pounce and break their necks 
Sure, some call me insane 
But danger is my middle name I have spied tiger spiders 
On the prowl along my fence 
But the speed at which they travel 
Makes a chase much too intense So you set your traps with care 
Scattering them here and there 
Hoping for a leg to snare 
(And with eight, the odds are in your favor) Watch out, they can maim 
Even with a leg left lame 
Sure, some call me insane 
But danger is my middle name There is one great adversary 
That consumes my thoughts foremost 
You see, a dragonfly breathes fire 
So it's not safe to get too close But it's hard to be aware 
Of them appearing from nowhere 
As they swoop down through the air 
I might just need a rocket launcher Not even scalding flame 
Could make me shake my aim 
Sure, some call me insane 
But danger is my middle name
