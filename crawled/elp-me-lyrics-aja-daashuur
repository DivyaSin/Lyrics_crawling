I am a shadow of what I could be 
I hide in silence, a mystery 
I try to come out of my shell 
But theres no one there to share my private hell Please help me 
To try to be me 
To be free Walls of Isolation are my home 
Land of loneliness is where I roam 
Someone help me cross this canyon 
Someone give me strength 
Strength of a thousand stallions Please help me 
To try to be me 
To be free You think I like this cage of mine 
But honey its not a cage of my design 
You think I like being sealed in despair 
I just need guidance, some love and care So now youve heard my call for peace 
If this my fate, this song is my release 
If I am to go on as I am 
Someone tell me why, cause I dont understand Please help me 
To try to be me 
To be free Please help me 
To try to be me 
To be free
