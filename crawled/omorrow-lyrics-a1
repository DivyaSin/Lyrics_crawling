You used to say that everyday 
We will always be this way 
Flying Angels lifting high To reach the sun where I belong 
Girl you know you were the one 
Above the clouds I see you cry You know that when you smile you stop the rain (top the rain) 
And we will be together once again Although I'm gone remember me 
Please be strong I'll never leave 
Just hold on to the memories 
Cause while I'm here all I'm thinking about is 
Tomorrow I've always known the love you've shone 
Means you'll never be alone (alone) 
There'll be times you wonder why Seeing you with someone new 
Used to makes me feel so blue 
But now I'm with you all the time Oh cause you know that when you smile you stop the rain (you stop the rain) 
And we will be together once again Although I'm gone remember me 
Please be strong I'll never leave 
Just hold on to the memories 
Cause while I'm here 
All I'm thinking about is 
Tomorrow From the moment that I looked into your eyes 
All of my life I thought I'd be there by your side (by your side) 
I wish I'd took the time to find the words to say (to say) You know that when you smile you stop the rain (you stop the rain) yeah 
And we will together once again Although I'm gone remember me 
Please be strong I'll never leave 
Just hold on to the memories 
Cause while I'm here 
All I'm thinking about is 
Tomorrow Cause while I'm here 
All I'm thinking about is 
Tomorrow
