Hush now, my baby; be still love, don't cry 
Sleep as you're rocked by the stream 
Sleep and remember, my last lullaby 
So I'll be with you when you dream River, oh river, flow gently for me 
Such precious cargo you bear 
Do you know somewhere he can be free? 
River, deliver him there Safe from all harm 
Holding you 
I'm smiling, too Hush now, my baby, be still love, don't cry 
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream 
Sleep and remember this river lullaby 
And I'll be with you when you dream Here in my arms 
Safe from all harm 
Holding you 
I'm smiling, too Sleep and remember this river lullaby 
And I'll be with you when you dream 
Sleep and remember this river lullaby 
And I'll be with you when you dream 
I'll be with you when you dream
