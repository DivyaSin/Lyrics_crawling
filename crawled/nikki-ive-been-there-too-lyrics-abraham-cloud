Nikki I've Been There Too When you feel like you don't belong 
And everything you've ever done is wrong 
Nothing here makes 
much sense at all 
Give me a call, it's true Nikki, I've been there too When you're hiding all alone in your place 
Trying to wipe the night off your face 
Wish you'd never said what you feel 
Feelings are real things too Nikki, I've been there too Counting up your change 
Ready to change everything today 
Hop on a bus, 
for a new place to start again Nikki, we've been there too Remember not to take it too hard 
Tomorrow it's a joke at the bar 
We'll be drinking sweet memories 
Long Island Ice Teas for two Nikki, I've been there too 
And it's getting every day 
Ya we're getting better every day 
Nikki, I've been there too 
and I'll always be there for you 
Nikki, I've been there too.
