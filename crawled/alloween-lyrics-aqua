Hello? 
Remember me? 
Who's there? 
I got your number Oh no, no 
I'm back to hunt you down 
No, stay away 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha It's Friday night 
So creepy outside 
It's thundering and lightning 
There's nobody home 'Cause I'm all alone 
It's scary and it's frightening The sound of shoes 
A shadow that moves 
Something odd is tic tac ticking 
Someone's in here 
I'm so full of fear 
The telephone is ringing Now I can see you 
Oh no, please no 
Now I can touch you 
Oh god, please go I'm right here now 
Oh please, tell me where 
Ha ha ha ha 
I'm in a nightmare You better run 
I'm back to hunt you down [Chorus] 
Halloween, in the death of the night, hear me scream 
I'm coming, I'm coming 
Halloween, is the fear that I fight, in my dream 
Keep running, keep running (Just keep running, oh, keep on running, yeah) 
(Just keep running) 
(Just keep running, oh, keep on running, yeah) 
(Just keep running) Hell broke out 
On this Friday night 
Zombies passing deadly 
My Candyman, from Bountyland 
Is coming here to get me Now I can see you 
Oh no, please no 
Now I can touch you 
Oh god, please go I am right here now 
Oh please tell me where 
Ha ha ha ha 
I'm in a nightmare You better run 
I'm back to hunt you down [Chorus] (Just keep running, oh, keep on running, yeah) 
(Just keep running) 
(Just keep running, oh, keep on running, yeah) 
(Just keep running) It's squeaking and creaking 
I move silent in the night, ha ha ha ha ha 
Could be the boy from next door 
You'll never guess my disguise 
Ha ha ha ha ha! Kids and children fight 
Pumpkin and candlelight 
You might be the fearsome one at Junior High 
Tonight! [Chorus] Halloween! (Just keep running, oh, keep on running, yeah) 
(Just keep running) Halloween 
(Just keep running, oh, keep on running, yeah) 
(Just keep running) Halloween Ahh!
