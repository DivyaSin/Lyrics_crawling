One lonely night I stumbled upon a dream 
In my ordinary world, 
With eyes like an angel, 
A voice like a song from the heart, 
You came into my world 
You crossed a river of time, 
You climbed a mountain of hope, 
Yes you did, 
You brought me all the love that I've been living for, 
And now I can only ask for one thing more, Just to have and to hold you, 
Inspire and console you, 
And be with you every day, 
Be with you every day, 
I want to love and adore you, 
Do anything for you 
And be with you every day 
Be with you every day of my life Just like the stars, 
Shining down from the heavens, 
Into my solitary world, 
Just like the glow that comes when the rain is over, 
Bringing warmth to the world, 
You are the dawn of my day, 
Yes you are, 
You are the lantern that lights my way, 
You are the love that I cherish in my heart, 
I pray to heaven that we never part, I want to have and to hold you, 
Inspire and console you, 
And be with you every day, 
Be with you every day, 
I want to love and adore you, 
Do anything for you, 
And be with you every day, 
Be with you every day,
