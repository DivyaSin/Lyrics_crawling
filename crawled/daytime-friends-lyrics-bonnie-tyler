Some friends you lose 
Some friends you win 
Time will heal the pain 
I would give up everything 
To hold you once again Sorry doesn't make it right 
And tears are not enough 
I can't take these lonely nights 
And shadows from this love We are daytime friends 
And night-time fools 
Oh nobody takes the place of you 
Oh a woman is a man's best friend 
Oh in this world, baby We are daytime friends 
And night-time fools 
Oh baby, breakin' up is hard to do 
I have golden days 
And restless lonely nights 
With you, darlin' (baby) Oh heaven knows where heaven is 
How does this love survive 
Try a little tenderness 
To keep this love alive Nights begin to drive me down 
It's waiting in my heart 
Oh love it makes the world go round 
But we're so far apart We are daytime friends 
And night-time fools 
Oh nobody takes the place of you 
Oh a woman is a man's best friend 
Oh in this world, baby We are daytime friends 
And night-time fools 
Oh baby, breakin' up is hard to do 
I have golden days 
And restless lonely nights 
With you, darlin' (baby) I'm missin' your sweet tender kiss 
I'm missin' you tonight, babe 
All I want's your sweet caress 
There's nothing left to hide, baby We are daytime friends 
And night-time fools 
Oh baby, breakin' up is hard to do 
I have golden days 
And restless lonely nights 
With you, darlin' (baby) We are daytime friends 
And night-time fools 
Oh nobody takes the place of you 
Oh a woman is a man's best friend 
Oh in this world, baby We are daytime friends 
And night-time fools 
Oh baby, breakin' up is hard to do 
I have golden days 
And restless lonely nights 
With you, darlin' (baby)
