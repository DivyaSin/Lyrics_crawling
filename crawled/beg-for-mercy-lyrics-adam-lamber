Wo oh oh oh 
Wo oh oh oh the stars collide 
they fall to earth alive 
as my hunger heights 
desires that are burning 
ready to land 
i shall overcome 
and when you're numb 
a deeper breath goes up wo oh oh oh 
i'll make you beg for mercy 
i'll make you beg for mercy 
yeah eh eh eh 
come to settle the score the strength inside 
the lightning and the fun 
i'll take in check 
won't hide 
in lightning you too under 
the hard the post is racing towards a mine 
is every beat i found 
go trickling down the vile i'll make you beg for mercy 
we rule the sun 
we rule the sun 
yeah eh eh eh 
i'll make you beg for mercy 
come to settle the score 
wo oh oh oh my adrenaline is pumping 
yeah eh eh eh 
i got it next to nothing 
wo oh oh oh 
come to settle the score i'll make you beg for mercy 
wo oh oh oh 
i'll make you beg for mercy 
yeah eh eh eh 
come to settle the score wo oh oh oh 
i'll make you beg for mercy 
we'll rule the sun 
we'll rule the sun 
i'll make you beg for mercy 
we'll rule the sun 
we'll rule the sun
