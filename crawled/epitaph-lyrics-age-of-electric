She read your words on my TV, So much anger in her grief 
A candle lit for you, And the words you wrote they sing with 
So much truth, More than you could ever know 
You lost your faith in something, How could you do this to us? 
You went and sold yourself out, You lost your love in someone 
How could you do this to us, You took the easy way out 
I hear your voice now everyday, You sing much louder from your grave 
All the questions why, And mysteries of why 
The good must die young, Are lost now with your life 
You lost your love in something, How could you do this to us 
You went and sold yourself out, You lost your love in someone 
Why did you take it out on us, You took the easy way out 
She read your words on my TV, So much anger in her grief 
And the candle lit for you, Burned out to soon before 
Your star could shine, Now we will never know 
Open your eyes 
Don't you cry 
Say goodbye
