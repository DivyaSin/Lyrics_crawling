I can't stop loving you 
I've made up my mind 
To live in memory of the lonesome times 
I can't stop wanting you It's useless to say 
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday 
Those happy hours 
That we once knew Tho' long ago, they still make me blue 
They say that time heals a broken heart 
But time has stood still since we've been apart I can't stop loving you 
I've made up my mind 
To live in memory of the lonesome times 
I can't stop wanting you It's useless to say 
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday 
Those happy hours 
That we once knew Tho' long ago 
They still make me blue They say that time 
Heals a broken heart 
But time has stood still 
Since we've been apart I can't stop loving you 
I've made up my mind 
To live in memory of the lonesome times 
I can't stop wanting you It's useless to say 
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday
