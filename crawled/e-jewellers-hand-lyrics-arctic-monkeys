Fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake 
Though it caresses once again irritate 
Tread softly stranger 
Move over toward the danger THAT you seek You think excitement has receded 
And the mirror distracts 
The logic of the trance 
Quickly reaches and grasps 
Handsome and faceless 
And weightless, your imagination roams And now it's no ones fault but yours 
At the foot of the house of cards 
You thought you'd never get obsessed 
You thought the wolves would be impressed 
And you're a sinking stone 
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
That procession of pioneers all drowned In the moonlight they're more thrilling 
Those things that he knows 
As he leads you through the grinning 
Bubble blowers in the snow 
Watching his exit 
Is like falling off the ferry in the night The inevitables gather to push you around 
Any old voice makes a punishing sound 
He became laughter's assassin 
Shortly after he showed you what it was And now it's no ones fault but yours 
At the foot of the house of cards 
You thought you'd never get obsessed 
You thought the wolves would be impressed 
And you're a sinking stone 
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
That procession of pioneers all drowned If you've a lesson to teach me, 
I'm listening, ready to learn 
There's no one here to police me, 
I'm sinking in, until you return If you've a lesson to teach me, 
Don't deviate, don't be afraid 
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, 
Let's get it ingrained If you've a lesson to teach me, 
I'm listening, ready to learn 
There's no one here to police me, 
I'm sinking in, until you return If you've a lesson to teach me, 
Don't deviate, don't be afraid 
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, 
Let's get it ingrained If you've a lesson to teach me, 
I'm listening, ready to learn 
There's no one here to police me, 
I'm sinking in, until you return If you've a lesson to teach me, 
Don't deviate, don't be afraid 
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, 
Let's get it ingrained
