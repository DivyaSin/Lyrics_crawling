You're the only one in the valley 
Dredging the flood 
You part my brow 
See the changes 
I'm in love again You stare me through 
How'd you do that? 
Curtains open 
Funny foolish 
Coming from me 
You don't fight you only laugh And I don't know what to say 
'Cause you don't owe me anything 
And I don't know what to say 
'Cause you don't owe me I'm not as strong as you are 
I'm not as strong as you are
