Listen to the rain come down on the roof 
Someone needs a miracle, and I'm the livin' proof 
Drink, light a cigarette, and let me count the ways 
But I can hear a whisper in our haunted house these days She won't set me free, she won't let me go, she won't leave my soul alone [Chorus:] 
She just leads me to the river, as my heart goes down in flames 
'Til she comes back to me, I'll have to pray for rain 
Wrap yourself around me, only you can pull me through 
Through this desert that I call my heart, I'll pray for rain to you To you, to you 
I can see the firelight reflected on her skin 
She was smooth as alabast, with a taste of salt and sin 
Slave to a servant, a prisoner to a kiss 
Addicted to temptation, and we did not resist Now I can't get free, 'cause she won't let go, she won't leave my soul alone [Chorus] Now I'm a stranger to myself, now my life is not my own 
She won't leave my soul alone [Chorus] (Lead me to the river) Lead me to the river, I'll pray for rain 
(Lead me to the river, pray for rain) She comes back to me again 
(Lead me to the river) Lead me down, take me down 
(Lead me to the river, pray for rain) Pray for rain (Lead me to the river, lead me to the river 
(Lead me to the river, pray for rain) 
[Repeat]
