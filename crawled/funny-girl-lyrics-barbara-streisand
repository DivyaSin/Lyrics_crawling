Funny 
Did you hear that 
Funny 
Yeah, the guy said honey 
You're a funny girl 
That's me I just keep them 
In stitches dug out in half 
And though I may be all wrong for the guy 
I'm good for a laugh 
I guess it's not funny 
Live is far from sunny 
When the love is over 
And the jokes are you 
A girl ought to have a sense of humor 
That's one thing you really need for sure 
When you're a funny girl 
A fellow said a funny girl 
Funny, how it ain't so funny 
Funny girl...
