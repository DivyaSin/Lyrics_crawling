You can have an adventure in a far away land 
You can learn about a tuba in a marching band 
You can travel to the stars, or the deep blue sea 
When you learn to borrow books from the library But please don't be loud shh, so that everyone here can read 
You will be proud when you take a book home from the library You can have an adventure in a far away land
