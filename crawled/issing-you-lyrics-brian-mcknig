I be missin you, missin you, missin you 
I be missin you, missin you, missin you 
I be missin you, missin you, missin you 
I be missin you, missin you, missin you 
Missin you [Verse 1:] 
Mmm thinking back from yesterday 
All the things I couldve said, but didnt say to you 
Shouldve begged you to stay 
Heard that youve moved on 
Heard youve been doing okay 
Been thinking about you all the time 
Do you ever reminisce 
Do I be crossing your mind 
All the tears and wasted time 
Nothings been the same since you went away [Hook:] 
Girl I know that I used to be your man 
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand 
I let you slip away 
Just like grains of sand [Chorus:] 
When Im lying in my bed at night 
Wish I was holdin you, wish I was touchin you (Baby) 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
Wish I was kissin you instead of just missin you 
Girl I keep holdin on (I keep holdin on) 
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on (I keep holdin on) 
Girl I keep holdin on [Verse 2:] 
Wish I could turn back the hands of time 
Inside me theres so many questions why 
?? Is to live a lie 
But in my heart now its just too late 
Its just like staring up in the pouring rain 
I refuse to believe that Ill never see you again 
All thats going on inside my brain 
That I cant seem to get it straight 
'Cos [Hook:] 
Girl I know that I used to be your man 
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand 
I let you slip away 
Just like grains of sand [Chorus:] 
When Im lying in my bed at night 
Wish I was holdin you, wish I was touchin you (Baby) 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
Wish I was kissin you instead of just missin you 
Girl I keep holdin on (I keep holdin on) 
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on (I keep holdin on) 
Girl I keep holdin on And If I ever hurt you 
I didnt mean to treat you bad 
I think about the good times that we had 
And theres no way they can be gone I be missin you, missin you, missin you 
I be missin you, missin you, missin you 
I be missin you, missin you, missin you 
I be missin you, missin you, missin you 
Missin you [Chorus:] 
When Im lying in my bed at night 
Wish I was holdin you, wish I was touchin you (Baby) 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
Wish I was kissin you instead of just missin you 
Girl I keep holdin on (I keep holdin on) 
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on (I keep holdin on) 
Girl I keep holdin on When Im lying in my bed at night 
Wish I was holdin you, wish I was touchin you (Baby) 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
Wish I was kissin you instead of just missin you 
Girl I keep holdin on (I keep holdin on) 
Girl I keep holdin on 
Girl I keep holdin on (I keep holdin on) 
Girl I keep holdin on
