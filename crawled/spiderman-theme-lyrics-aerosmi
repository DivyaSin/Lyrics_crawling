Spider-Man, Spider-Man 
Does whatever a spider can 
Spins a web, sweet surprise 
Catches thieves just like flies 
Look out 
Here comes the Spider-Man Is he strong? Listen bud 
He's got radioactive blood 
Can he swing from a thread? 
No escape from his spider web 
Look out 
There goes the Spider When the chill meets the night 
At the scream of a crime 
Like a laser light 
He arrives just in time Spider-Man, Spider-Man 
Doin' the impossible, Why? Because he can 
Spider-Man, Spider-Man 
Doin' what he gotta, yeah, according to the plan
