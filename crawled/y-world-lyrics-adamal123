Beware of the time as it moves along 
Taking you back always feeling strong 
Like the rush of the wind he moves on and on and on and on and on 
He's the fire, flame, conflicting pain 
Untouched,uncrushed and will remain 
The one, the two, the three, the four 
Heading straight for an open door 
He can see and he can feel 
Without a touch, it seems unreal 
But it's true, the power lives inside of you 
Inside of you, yeah! In my world! (My World!) 
Where life is strong (Life is strong) 
In my world! (My World!) 
Life's an open door (Open door) 
In my world! (My World!) 
Where compromise does not exist 
In my world of worlds, every step meets the risk! 
In my world! (My World!) 
Where one is all (One is all)) 
In my world! (My World!) 
Never fear the fall (Never fear the fall) 
In my world! (My World!) 
Where compromise does not exist 
In my world of worlds, every step meets the risk! Beware of your mind as it proves you wrong 
A bullet pushed, the clock strikes strong 
Like the rush of the wind he moves on and on and on and on and on 
He's the tower, power, admits no shame 
Untouched, uncrushed and will remain 
The one, the two, the three, the four 
Heading straight for an open door 
He can see what he can feel 
Without a touch, it seems surreal 
But it's true, the power lives inside of you 
Inside of you, yeah! In my world! (My World!) 
Where life is strong (Life is strong) 
In my world! (My World!) 
Life's an open door (Open door) 
In my world! (My World!) 
Where compromise does not exist 
In my world of worlds, every step meets the risk! 
In my world! (My World!) 
Where one is all (One is all)) 
In my world! (My World!) 
Never fear the fall (Never fear the fall) 
In my world! (My World!) 
Where compromise does not exist
