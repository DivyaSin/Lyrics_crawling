I dont know what I really want in life 
Well, of course, I want some love 
And I may need something to keep my inspired, 
So I dont drive myself crazy On the way, I tried to stay on my path 
Glad for the things that Ive learned in my past 
And I try not to choose based on old decisions 
And soon Ill get stronger, 
Without such divisions And I want to know the future, yeah 
But I cant look over this day, no 
I could work until Im blue, from the mission 
Til its more than just a vision in my head More than just a vision in my head 
More than just some thing somebody said 
More than just a lesson to be read 
More like part of you and me, instead I dont know where to look for guarantees 
Well of course, I want the truth 
There are so many ways I could go, I think I.. 
Might just stay in the moment 
All I know is Ive got to make my way 
Cause I dont have time that I want to waste 
And if I honestly look, I might find: 
That Im dumb in the heart 
And out of my mind And I want to know the future, yeah 
But I cant look over this day, no 
I could work until Im blue, from the mission 
Til its more than just a vision in my head More than just a vision in my head 
More than just some thing somebody said 
More than just a lesson to be read 
More like part of you and me, instead Oh yeah 
Is this a bridge, yeah? 
Its just a bridge, yeah 
Its just a bridge, yeah And I want to know the future, yeah 
But I cant look over this day, no 
I could work until Im blue, from the mission 
Til its more than just a vision in my head More than just a vision in my head 
More than just some thing somebody said 
More than just a lesson to be read 
More like part of you and me, instead 
More than just some Thing hanging over my bed! 
Oh yeah 
More like part of you and ME
