Verse 1: 
Baby, there's something about you 
don't understand how you, go on and drive me so 
Crazy, cus all that I really do 
find myself thinkin bout you, maybe it's the smile on your face 
Seems like yesterday, would talk for hours each night 
felt like you were by my side 
Why did things have to change 
you started avoiding me continued ignoring me 
and I don't know why 
Don't know what happened, thought things were goin well, got me sayin what the hell 
Don't gotta hold back 
just be true to your heart, lemme give you my all 
Chorus 1: 
All I wanna do, is turn your world around 
show you what I'm about 
Girl we'll make it through, 
turn your dreams into reality, last an eternity 
Move on and forget your past, 
cus it's us that'll last, I promise you that 
Let me be one you'll run to, never gonna hurt you, 
Give me one chance to be with you 
Verse 2: 
Maybe, you're afraid to get hurt again, your heart can't withstand the pain, but listen to what I'm 
Sayin, believe this is destiny, put of all your faith in me, and I know that we'll be okay 
Why push me away, and think I'm like other guys, and think my words are all lies, no 
Don't be afraid, those are lies on your mind, quit being in denial 
Girl I know how you really feel, you know you feel the same way, quit playin them games on me 
What we have is real, ain't felt this way before, I'm forever yours 
Chorus 2: 
All I wanna do, is give you happiness 
cus you deserve the best 
Said we'll make it through 
take you anywhere you wanna be 
as long it's you and me 
I see forever right in your eyes 
you're my once in a lifetime 
I want you to be mine 
Let me show you that my love's true 
cus I'm so into you 
Give me one chance to be with you.
