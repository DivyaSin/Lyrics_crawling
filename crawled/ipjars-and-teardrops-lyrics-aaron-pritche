They say that music calms the savage beast 
And helps a heartache settle down 
Thats what I need tonight to sooth me 
And dull her memory when it comes around Tipjars and teardrops 
Sad songs for lonely hearts 
A temporary cure for the blues I got 
I get loose when I hear guitars but then the music stops 
And all thats left is tipjars and teardrops She used to fill my heart with melody 
Lovin words Id never heard before 
Now without her Im in quiet misery 
And I cant take this silence anymore Chorus
