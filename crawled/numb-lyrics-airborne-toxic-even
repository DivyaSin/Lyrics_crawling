I've been in a daze 
It seems like days that I've been waiting 
For this dream to pass 
It goes so fast 
It seems nothing lasts 
I think I've lost something Stuck here with these people 
While you wake I crush our bodies in one space 
I feel your heart blood from my tongue 
I wonder where you've gone And the ever turning, spinning wheel of people, places lies I feel 
The restless beat of the sleepless night to come 
I just want to be numb 
Just want to be numb Hopeless these three years like smoking years 
I go from place to place 
Just endlessly and half asleep 
Like I'm falling alone at some endless breach I don't know where I am 
I don't know what I've done 
I just go over it again and again and again 
I can't sleep at night 
I cant breathe 
But If I drink tonight I'll get you off my mind And the ever present pit I feel 
I'm turning on some spinning wheel 
Of faces and the scenes I see 
And none of it seems real to me 
Just the bleary haze of the morning still to come I just want to be numb 
Just want to be numb 
I just want to be numb 
I just want to be numb 
I just want to be numb
