She was born out in the sticks 
In the drought of '76 
Pulled the wings of bugs for kicks 
She's country Learned to drive in beat up hack 
Shotgun and an old bashed hat 
Chasin' roos and razorback 
She's country She'll look you in the eye 
Work all day and dance all night 
Drink the whole bar dry Hot day's you can find her there 
Lying by the lake and she don't care 
Wearin' nothin' but her long dark hair 
She's country She's country certified 
Country 'till the day she dies 
She's country born and bred 
She's country as it gets Grew up fast in '89 
Helped her Ma keep the farm alive 
The year her Daddy died Put a roof on the old hay shed 
Fixed the truck when it blew a head 
Hung in when she was over it 
She's country She was born out in the sticks 
In the drought of '76 
She'll never call it quits
