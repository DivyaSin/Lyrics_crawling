This song's totally worthless 
it's so generic 
it's got stale lyrics 
and derivative music 
"Talk Dirty" have you heard it? 
This sounds just like it 
why the hell are we dancing 
in front of the stock markets? 
Ok 
this song also sounds a whole lot like "Problem" 
crossed with an old Jewish wedding song 
I look like Chris Brown on crack 
with these scary face tats 
like I just got out of 
prison prison prison prison prison 
these girls' choreography is 
shitty shitty shitty shitty shitty 
I can't watch it no mo! 
Right now you're prolly asking why 
my voice is low 
then it goes really high 
and why I'm kicking this guy 
Can you stop? 
Your heel went in my eye! 
I'm the tallest in the band 
but believe 
I can steal your man 
if you wonder if I can 
go ahead 
just ask his fine ass 
I am having trouble gettin these 
glasses off my face I am the black girl in the group 
we've got one from every race 
Na uh you don't have an Asian 
Ooh we must have spaced 
this white girl we have really can't sing so 
she can be replaced 
This song's about how we're worth it 
worth having sex with 
as if we're harlots 
or hookers trying to get rich 
but in this we're actin 
like powerful women 
abusing these men 
it doesn't make any sense 
I am the cutest in the group 
and I got a smokin hot body too 
but our stylist has no clue 
he dressed me in this unsexy suit 
ew 
It's because in this vid 
you play Wall Street executives 
Who came up with that concept 
I don't know but it sure is stupid 
I am trying way too hard to be 
sexy to young dudes 
I wink and flip my hair around 
I do every cliche move 
I want boys to say I'm hot 
in the comments for this vid 
I look like Nicole Scherzinger and Zayn Malik had a kid 
We're the girl One Direction 
we're a collection 
of past contestants 
the 'X Factor' rejected 
But I got an erection 
first time I saw them 
so I signed them 
and now they let me shag them 
Ok 
this song also sounds a whole lot like "Problem" 
crossed with an old Jewish wedding song 
I look like Chris Brown on crack 
with these scary face tats 
like I just got out of 
prison prison prison prison prison 
these girls' choreography is 
shitty shitty shitty shitty shitty 
I can't watch it no mo! 
We are suing you 
Why? 
Cos we've both been harassed! 
You made me squeeze your junk! 
And you stuck your golf club up my ass! 
This is unacceptable behavior it cannot pass! 
And I demand justice for my clients and I want it fast! 
You can sue them penniless 
but they're now worthless 
they lost all their cash 
in the stock market 
What?! Sorry girls you're now homeless
