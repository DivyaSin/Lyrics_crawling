I am lost 
Out in this wilderness 
With just the hope that I 
Might find what I came for I'm Searching for the 
Missing piece thats left a hole in me 
And has left me adrift out here I'll find it I Im on the hunt I'm on the hunt 
For the part that makes me 
Im on the hunt i'm on the hunt 
But the piece escapes me Im on the hunt i'm on the hunt 
For the part that's missing 
Im on the hunt i'm in the hunt For too long i've been without the part 
Of the thing I want so out here ill find it 
I've spent too long sat in the warming sun 
I need to cold of the dark and the bite of the winter I'll find it I Im on the hunt I'm on the hunt 
For the part that makes me 
Im on the hunt i'm on the hunt 
But the piece escapes me Im on the hunt i'm on the hunt 
For the part that's missing 
Im on the hunt i'm in the hunt
