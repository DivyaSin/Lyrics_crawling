My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state 
I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville, barracks number 8 
I always done an honest job, as honest as I could 
I got a brother named Franky, and Franky ain't no good Now ever since we was young kids, it's been the same come down 
I get a call on the shortwave, Franky's in trouble downtown 
Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away 
But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way Yeah me and Franky laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood" 
I catch him when he's strayin', like any brother would 
Man turns his back on his family, well he just ain't no good Well Franky went in the army back in 1965 
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife 
But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we were gettin' robbed 
Franky came home in '68 and me I took this job Yeah we're laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood" 
I catch him when he's strayin', teach him how to walk that line 
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no friend of mine Well the night was like any other, well I got a call 'bout quarter to nine 
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line 
There was a kid lyin' on the floor lookin' bad, bleedin' hard from his head 
There was a girl cryin' at a table and it was Frank, they said Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights 
Well I musta done a hundred and ten through Michigan County that night 
It was out at the crossroads, down 'round Willow bank 
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank Well I chased him through them county roads 
Till a sign said "Canadian border five miles from here" 
I pulled over the side of the highway and watched his taillights disappear Me and Franky laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood" 
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother would 
Man turns his back on his family, he just ain't no good
