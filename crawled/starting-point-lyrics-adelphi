im sick of people telling me 
you've got nowhere to go and nothing to see 
stop living life like your gunna get somewhere 
its hard to make it when you just dont care 
its hard to try when no ones on your side 
sometimes i feel like caving in 
where do i begin .. my walls are closing in where do i begin? 
im tired of loosing sleep 
over little things that shouldnt matter to me 
do people notice i dont come around 
its hard to get up when youve been shut down 
and its hard to try when no ones on your side 
sometimes i feel like caving in where do i begin? where do i begin? 
my walls are closing in where do i begin? 
words are getting smaller by the second 
and im feeling short of breath 
such is a tragic story reality 
theres only one remaing question left.. 
where do i begin? where do i begin 
my walls are closing in where do i begin
