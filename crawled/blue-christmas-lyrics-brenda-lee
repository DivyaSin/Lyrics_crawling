I'll have a blue Christmas without you 
I'll be so blue thinking about you 
Decorations of gray on a green Christmas tree 
Won't mean a thing, dear 
If you're not here with me I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain 
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin' 
You'll be do with alright with your Christmas of white 
But I have a blue, blue Christmas (I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain) 
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin' 
You'll be do with alright with your Christmas of white 
But I have a blue, blue Christmas
