You enter your room 
It's a lonely world 
Laid out on the floor And you're rolling away 
Through fractured life 
Deep into the walls 'Cause if it can't work out 
What's right and fair 
It's time to escape And on the other side 
There's an endless light 
To brighten the way Take my breathe 
And my whole life too 
Please don't let me down Just to come undone 
If that were they 
Just to lose what we found You've got the strength within 
And don't give up there's so much more to see 
So many things beyond your wildest dreams 
They'll make you stop you if you just believe The world is at your feet 
This beach is wide and clean 
They'll teach us wild and pride 
We're gonna be alive The world is at your feet 
This beach is wide and clean 
They'll teach us wild and pride 
You're gonna be alive Please don't let me down 
Please don't let me down 
Please don't let me down 
Please don't let me down Please don't let me down 
Please don't let me down 
Please don't let me down 
Please don't let me down
