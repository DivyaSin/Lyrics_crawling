(tommy lee james/robin lerner) 
We had something i could never do without 
What a brilliant stroke of luck 
Heaven's angels came like sirens in the night 
Madness hit me like a truck One look,one touch 
And the skies just opened up 
Ain't no ordinary love 
Lightnin',thunder 
And the fateful arrow struck 
Ain't no ordinary love Happiness has got me jumping up for joy 
Sweet bliss i'm overcome 
Didn't notice i've been walking on thin air 
Somehow closer to the sun One look,one touch 
And the skies just opened up 
Ain't no ordinary love 
Lightnin',thunder 
And the fateful arrow struck 
Ain't no ordinary love Such a sweet beautiful thing 
A complete awaking 
Inspiration everlasting Stand back,hold on 
They don't make'em quite like us 
Ain't no ordinary love It's a extraordinary love
