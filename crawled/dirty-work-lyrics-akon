[Hook: Akon] 
Its a dirty job but somebodys gotta do it 
I see you working go and put your back into it 
Baby Imma watch,you just keep it moving 
You know exactly what youre doing 
So go and do your dirty work 
Go and do your dirty work [Verse 1: Akon] 
Ass up 
Face down 
Perfect body and she lay it to the ground 
Stacked up 
Waist down 
Wanted to throw it like a pitcher on a mound 
I see them niggas reaching for their last dollar 
Asking dumb questions like baby, do you model? 
Promising everything, hopin that they follow 
Praying for America, I hope they down with Harry Potter 
Isnt she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw? 
Dont she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought? [Hook] [Bridge] 
Gettin down dirty, gettin down dirty, gettin down... 
Go and do your dirty work 
Gettin down dirty, gettin down dirty, gettin down... [Verse 2: Akon] 
Back up 
Shake down 
Just give it all to me and do it right now 
Shack up 
Take down 
Just wanna love you without looking' like a clown 
Youre the best that ever did it 
Youre killing everybody, how're you supposed to make a living? 
Yes I know you hear it all when they trickin' 
I can hear them niggas saying you too pretty to be strippin' 
Isnt she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw? 
Dont she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought? [Hook] [Bridge] [Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa] 
More money, more problems, less rest 
If its about a dollar later, shorty, lets invest 
Drop the top, pull the whip out like a hamstring 
You on your job but Im a boss, I keep my hands clean 
Keep grabbin' all up on my coat 
Im lettin' out all of this smoke 
Im thrown' money in the air 
Im buying' bottles for my folks 
And then Im coming back for more 
Cause you know all my favourite features 
I'mma roll some of this reefer 
You can call me Young Khalifa [Hook] [Bridge]
