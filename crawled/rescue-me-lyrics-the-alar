A renegade 
Rides a run away train 
To liberate 
Tear these bonds assunder A fugitive 
Running from a chain gang 
Comfort me 
Grant me absolution Running all my life 
Running all my day 
Running through the night 
Seems like forever Take me now 
I'm so tired 
Take me now 
This time, forever RESCUE ME 
I'm on the run like a refugee 
RESCUE ME 
Oh come on rescue me I'm destitute 
I'm looking for protection 
I want love 
And physical asylum A vagabond 
Running from destruction 
Cover me 
While I seek defection Running all my life 
Running all my day 
Running through the night 
Seems like forever Take me now 
I'm so tired 
Take me now 
This time, forever RESCUE ME 
I'm on the run like a refugee 
RESCUE ME 
I believe you can rescue me Running all my life 
Running all my day 
Running through the night 
Seems like forever Take me now 
I'm so tired 
Take me now 
This time, forever RESCUE ME 
On the run like a refugee 
RESCUE ME 
Oh come on rescue me 
RESCUE ME Got to run like a refugee 
RESCUE ME 
I believe you can rescue me 
RESCUE ME 
Come on, come on, come on, come on
