Intentional dreaming reveals a deceit less obvious 
It's the liars who are punished but the liars speak the truth 
I will never know your intention but I'll make clear my own 
You are guilty by association and I'm taking your sentence on To forget is the greatest (ardor) 
Forgetting is the favorite cure 
There aren't many days left 
There aren't many days left to sleep 
Suspicious, silent, bullets 
Suspicious bullets, silent guns Here's where the men wear pride outside 
And women smile through dragonflies 
I'm the kill the retriever couldn't find 
The round that got away 
You were supposed to wait for me 
That's how I built this up to be 
Just leave my corpse to feed the worms 
I'll soon just dissipate I'm going straight to hell and you're coming with me 
And yesterday's air, it suffocates me See, I have this gift to give to you - take it carefully, it's yours 
But if ever you should break it, please return it to the source 
It's a shame you're not still hungry - sugared hands surround the sill 
Exhibitionist intentions through the windows carved in skin 
I'll shut up so you'll explain to me the human sacrifice 
Subtle tears, I loved you too, your desperate hillsides 
Your forests of depression and your houses built on lies I'm going straight to hell and you're coming with me 
Yesterday's air, it suffocates me 
I'll take your oxygen 
Equine corpses bore (me) to death 
Purge the fetus like arguments 
Time's up, get on board, you're coming with me It's hard to (watch you) crumble 
(Watch the flames) lick your complexion bare 
Remove the pretense that you cared 
I see the woman facing away 
I feel the distance in her gaze 
One day she will turn around 
(And) push me back so my past's erased 
Flying birds like kites, my eyes are full of sun 
I don't know how I'll ever learn your language 
Only an insect forgets the Earth when drawn into the sun I'm going straight to hell and you're coming with me 
Yesterday's air, it suffocates me 
I'll take your oxygen 
Purging sense in arguments 
How did we go from that to this? 
Sure, I'm guilty - still, you're coming with me
