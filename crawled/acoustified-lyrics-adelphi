lets start fresh this time 
we've reached this point again 
you know ive waited for these days and weeks to end 
saddest playing so long 
as tears roll down your face 
i hear them too 
and im thinking about you sick of lonely skies 
and missing long goodbyes 
you know id die for one last phone call just to say goodnight 
i wanna tell you that i hope this song will remind you of the time we spent away 
your eyes and mine 
will only meet on better days 
i hope you know 
your home is here with me 
but for now ill miss the things that you appreciate in me ill sleep next to the phone tonight 
your home is here with me your home is here with me 
ill sleep next to the phone tonight 
your home is here with me your home is here with me
