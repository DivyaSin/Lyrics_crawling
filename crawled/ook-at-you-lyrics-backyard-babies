Look at you, man, look at the band 
Look at the day, don 't throw it away 
I need a pill and a coffee re-fill 
And everything is gonna be alright 
I swear Look at your cat and your eighty square flat 
Look at your view over Stockholm 's Zoo 
Maybe you 're wrong but maybe I 'm right 
'Cause I guess I 'm born black and white You know you could be a rock n ' roll star 
No matter who you are 
It 's all the same 
'Cause you 're a real dead end That 's what you are 
Believe I 'm gonna have myself a ball 
And I don 't care if you don 't like 
How I act when I 'm on top of your wife 
I 'm going down, I 'm running up 
I 'm walking zig-zag and I 'm tripping too much 
So hold your fire, I 'm coming through 
I 've gotta kill another bottle of doom Now everybody want to dance with you 
I cannot dance 'cause my boots are stuck with glue 
Everybody want to talk too much 
But all I want is you Look at your amount on your credit card account 
A billion dollar tour but I just go for 
Heads up, legs up, stay-ups, fuck-ups 
'Cause everything is gonna be alright, right 
Well, I said, right, right, right That 's what you are That 's what you are 
Believe I 'm gonna have myself a ball 
And I don 't care if you don 't like 
How I act when I 'm on top of your wife 
I 'm going down, I 'm running up 
I 'm walking zig-zag and I 'm tripping too much 
So hold your fire, I 'm coming through 
I 've gotta kill another bottle of doom I 'm going down, I 'm running up 
I 'm walking zig-zag and I 'm tripping too much 
So hold your fire, I 'm coming through 
I 've gotta kill another bottle of doom Now everybody want to dance with you 
I cannot dance 'cause my boots are stuck with glue 
Everybody want to talk too much 
But all I want is you 
Yeah, all I want is you 
So why can 't I have you
