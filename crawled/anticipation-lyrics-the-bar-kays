I can't hardly wait Tonight the need for love, is here between us 
And the desire for each other, we cannot hide 
Cause anxiously we wait, to feel the passion 
That the hunger in our eyes, can't disguise So girl let's not waste, another moment 
Trying to decide, right or wrong 
Just come and hold me close, to your body 
And let's release the love we've been holding back so long I'm trying so hard to be patient, 
But when you're near me I loose control 
And there is no time for hesitation, 
And if you don't give your love to me, 
I'm going to explode from Anticipation, anticipating your every move 
Anticipation, anticipating what we're going to do 
Don't make me wait, yeah So girl let's put an end, to all this waiting 
And let the power of our desires, tonight unfold 
No matter how hard, we try to fight it 
When the needle rises baby, it's time to let go I'm trying so hard to be patient, 
But when you're near me I loose control 
And there is no time for hesitation, 
And if you don't give your love to me, 
I'm going to explode from Anticipation, anticipating your every move 
Anticipation, anticipating what we're gonna do Ooh, yeah 
Every breathe you take
