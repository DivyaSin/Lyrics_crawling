Her Eyes Were Watching God To prey upon a kind and generous heart 
To turn away from and leave a mark 
To go too far just to make youself feel better 
But you could not steal her song Her eyes were watching god 
Never felt any pain at all 
From gravel to gold she walks 
Shes not long for this world 
Shes not long for this To plant the smallest seed 
That bears the bitterest fruit 
To still believe the sweetest truth 
Hold up the lie till the sun shines through it 
Dont you let them steal your song Your eyes are watching god 
No need to feel any shame at all 
From gravel to gold we walk 
Youre not long for this world 
Youre not long for this Moving towards the light 
Peace follows the fight Our eyes are watching god 
No need to feel any pain at all 
From gravel to gold we walk 
Were not long for this world 
Were not long for this
