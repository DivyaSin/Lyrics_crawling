Procedure shows that the ginger would 
Can you hold her and the passed down mud 
She is bowing in wind 
A row of miles of to Brooklyn again 
Limpin' out of the womb 
Bent and blowin' home soon 
Acid still is on your teeth 
Active care is all of me 
On sulfur pain grew zeros 
All sustain to crawl off the door
