The ring like a stain in the wood 
A drink from years ago I'm sure 
A black and white on the wall from years ago when we were good 
Somewhere 
This house is a pain station 
Awaiting blueprints for relief 
The party's finally over 
And everyone else had to leave 
It binds you, reminds me 
Pick up the grocery for your head 
Take this invitation 
Please don't waste another day 
Hold my hands above my head 
This ride is misery 
Between the bars you're clinging to a world of cold embrace 
I'm still here to remind you 
The world hasn't changed 
You're still alone 
"No more pretending for him" 
A hopeless voice cracks on the phone 
It's deafening, reminds me pick up the passport for your trip 
Take this one 
It's leaving 
It's the last bound for repair 
I'll be here relieving all your loves and all your cares 
If there were words to give you hope 
If you would treasure all you have 
They'd believe in you my friend 
So long, so long 
I'll keep the gold
