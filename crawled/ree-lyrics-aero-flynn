I've already tired 
I've already tired 
Of everybody's head 
Of everybody's head Rallying you of dirt 
Rallying you of dirt 
You have genuine scars 
You have genuine scars Take a bit of tea 
Take a bit of tea 
Relax in fallen trees 
Relax in fallen trees I'm so afraid 
I'm so afraid 
Of everybody else 
Of everybody else I've already tired 
I've already tired 
Of everybody's head 
Of everybody's head Take me out to sea 
Take me out to sea 
Take me out to sea
