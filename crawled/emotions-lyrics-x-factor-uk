It's over and done 
But the heartache lives on inside 
And who's the one you're clinging to 
Instead of me tonight? And where are you now, now that I need you? 
Tears on my pillow wherever you go 
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean 
You never see me fall apart In the words of a broken heart 
It's just emotion that's taken me over 
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul 
But if you don't come back 
Come home to me, darling You know there will be nobody 
Left in this world to hold me tight 
You know there will nobody 
Left in this world to kiss goodnight 
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight I'm there at your side 
I'm part of all the things you are 
(Ahh) 
But you've got a part of someone else 
You've got to find your shining star And where are you now, now that I need you? 
Tears on my pillow wherever you go 
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean 
You never see me fall apart In the words of a broken heart 
It's just emotion that's taken me over 
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul 
(Baby, I'm lost in your soul) 
But if you don't come back 
Come home to me, darling Don't you know there'll be nobody 
Left in this world to hold me tight? 
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight 
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight 
(Ahh) In the words of a broken heart 
It's just emotion that's taken me over 
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul 
But if you don't come back 
Come home to me, darling You know that there will be nobody 
Left in this world to hold me tight 
(Nobody, nobody) 
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight 
(Ahh)
