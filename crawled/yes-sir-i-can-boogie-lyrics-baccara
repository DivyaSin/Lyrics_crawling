Mister 
Your eyes are full of hesitation 
Sure makes me wonder 
If you know what you're looking for 
Baby 
I wanna keep my reputation 
I'm a sensation 
You try me once, you'll beg for more Yes Sir, I can boogie 
But I need a certain song 
I can boogie, boogie boogie 
All night long 
Yes Sir, I can boogie 
If you stay, you can't go wrong 
I can boogie, boogie boogie, all night long No Sir 
I don't feel very much like talking 
No, neither walking 
You wanna know if I can dance 
Yes Sir, already told you in the first verse 
And in the chorus 
But I will give you one more chance Yes Sir, I can boogie 
But I need a certain song 
I can boogie, boogie boogie 
All night long 
Yes Sir, I can boogie 
If you stay, you can't go wrong 
I can boogie, boogie boogie, all night long Yes Sir, I can boogie 
If you stay, you can't go wrong 
I can boogie, boogie boogie, all night long Yes Sir, I can boogie 
But I need a certain song 
I can boogie, boogie boogie 
All night long 
Yes Sir, I can boogie 
If you stay, you can't go wrong 
I can boogie, boogie boogie, all night long Yes Sir, I can boogie 
If you stay, you can't go wrong 
I can boogie, boogie boogie, all night long Yes Sir, I can boogie 
If you stay, you can't go wrong 
I can boogie, boogie boogie, all night long
