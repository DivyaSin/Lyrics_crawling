I'm listening like my father 
Told me how to 
And burning like my brother 
Always knew I would I admit these strong defences 
All around you, yeah 
Check, check, check 
Turn your face to the wall and laugh The chains we wore 
Are breaking up the wall 
Forget my indescretions 
These looks and my confessions So praise the Lord 
Way up high 
Is it good to feel alright
