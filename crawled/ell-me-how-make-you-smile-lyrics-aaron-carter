I remember the day we met 
Almost like a fairy tale 
Kinda like Romeo and Juliet 
I'm never gonna forget Now my knees went weak 
When you said "hi" 
And then you held my hand 
And looked me in the eyes 
I almost died 
Deep inside Theirs so much love 
That I don't understand 
That I'll never learn myself 
I want to do what you want me to do 
I want you and mo one else Tell me how to make you smile 
Tell me how to love you baby girl 
I want you tell me how how 
Tell me how to make you smile 
Tell me how to make you smile I heard about how wonderful love can be 
But in my mind 
I never could of dreamed 
Such a fantasy 
Maybe it's destiny To share myself with you in a special way 
I'm not a little boy I'm never gonna leave you 
And I'm gonna say 
Everything is okay
