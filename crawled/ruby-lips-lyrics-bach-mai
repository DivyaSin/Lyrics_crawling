I need a second to myself so I can pick back up my thoughts 
Hopefully it doesn't take too long for me to realize that I am lost 
Without you Walk me back home 
Walk me to the stairs 
Maybe around the lake, take in some air 
We could spend the rest of the night together 
Enjoying the weather, depending whether or not you'd care to And I know that I'm not opposed 
To spending the rest of my night with those 
Ruby Lips 
Those eyes, those hips I need a second to myself so I can pick back up my heart 
Hopefully it doesn't take too long for you to realize that I am not 
Just hitting on you Talk to me love 
I just want to relate 
Talk about our fears, our hopes, our dreams 'til late 
We could spend the rest of the night together 
Enjoying each other, no physics depending on what you're into And I know that I'm not opposed 
To spending the rest of my night not just with your 
Ruby Lips 
Your eyes, your hips 
I still can't shake 'em
