Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee! 
E'en though it be a cross that raise'th me, 
Still all my song shall be, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee. 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee! Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down, 
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone. 
Yet in my dreams I'd be 
Nearer, my God to Thee. 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee! There let the way appear, steps unto heav'n; 
All that Thou sendest me, in mercy given; 
Angels to beckon me 
Nearer, my God, to Thee. 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee! Then, with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise, 
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise; 
So by my woes to be 
Nearer, my God, to Thee. 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee! Or, if on joyful wing cleaving the sky, 
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I'll fly, 
Still all my song shall be, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee. 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee! There in my Father's home, safe and at rest, 
There in my Savior's love, perfectly blest; 
Age after age to be, 
Nearer my God to Thee. 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee!
