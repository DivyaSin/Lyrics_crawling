Children are sleeping 
Tucked in their beds 
The Night before Christmas 
Has finally been read Everything?s quiet under the tree 
Baby, it?s Christmas for you and for me Let?s light a candle 
Put on some tunes 
We?ve got til morning 
To kiss and to spoon I know you?re weary 
We could both use some sleep 
But, baby it?s Christmas 
For you and for me. Close your eyes darlin? 
I?ll tell you when 
I know you?re wonderin? 
How much did I spend? Let?s start unwrapping 
Ribbons and lace 
I see the want to 
All over your face I?ll always give you your favorite things 
Baby, it?s Christmas for you and for me.
