When I was yet unformed 
You saw me and my days were numbered 
You formed me when I was in the dark 
You searched me every part turned over 
You found whats inside of my heart Where can I go if I want to be alone? 
I turn and Youre there 
And now, Im gonna let it out All I know is Your mercy surrounds me 
Your thoughts for me outnumber the sand 
Now, Im gonna sing it out 
From my soul, only You understand me 
Youre holding me inside of Your hands From the moment I was born 
You tried me and You made me stronger 
I remember when You let me take control 
So I would wonder, who I am and who Im under? 
You broke me to show me who You are Where can I go if I want to be alone? 
I turn and Youre there 
And now, Im gonna let it out All I know is Your mercy surrounds me 
Your thoughts for me outnumber the sand, yeah, yeah 
Now, Im gonna sing it out 
From my soul, only You understand me 
Youre holding me inside of Your hands Outside got into my inside 
You wont stop til You stop 
The pride in my head, in my head Inside You can give me one mind 
Press me til I rewind 
Into Your hands, into Your hands Where can I go if I want to be alone? 
I turn and Youre there 
And now, Im gonna let it out All I know is Your mercy surrounds me 
Your thoughts for me outnumber the sand, yeah, yeah 
Now, Im gonna sing it out 
From my soul, only You understand me 
Youre holding me inside of Your hands, yeah Youre holding me inside of Your hands 
Youre holding me inside of Your hands
