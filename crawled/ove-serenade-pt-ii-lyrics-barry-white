Take it off, baby, take it all off 
I wanna see you the way you came into the world 
I don't wanna feel no clothes, I don't wanna see no panties 
And take off that brassiere, my dear, everybody's gone 
I'm taking the receiver off the phone because baby you and me 
This night we're gonna get it on to love serenade You know I get in these moods, well you know how it is 
And I'm very glad to know that you feel the same way too 
Baby we're gonna lay here and gonna make love 
And we're gonna do it like it's supposed to be done 
Heaven only knows what goes on behind closed doors 
The very depths of our souls will reach out tonight 
You and me, baby in love serenade, oh baby, oh baby Make me want you, tempt me, tempt me, tempt me 
Make me need you, let me long for you 
You'll know what it's like when a man and woman becomes one 
And the only real way you can do that baby 
Is when we're makin' love to each other 
When you reach that, that simple feeling 
When you're makin' love it's, it's like you're in another world 
Help me, help me, oh baby help me 
Lord have mercy on me
