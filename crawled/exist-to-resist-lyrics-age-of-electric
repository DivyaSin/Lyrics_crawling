Bottom won't make it go away 
Petting doom is second to nothing 
Could I waste more time getting there? 
Or share in the boiling know how 
Exist to resist 
I'll feed myself 
You're gonna wanna watch, I'll bet 
Exist to resist 
Beside myself, beside myself 
Holding back, we don't kiss the run At the beginning of summer, in the 
field of skies 
Found how to save some time to waste 
Your most hopeful trait 
You swoon, I wane 
Exist to resist 
I'll feed myself 
You're gonna wanna watch, I'll bet 
Exist to resist 
I wanna join, wanna sign, wanna buy 
I'll stir the consequences 
Inner bursting joy, down boy 
Exist to resist 
Beside myself 
Beside myself 
Beside myself
