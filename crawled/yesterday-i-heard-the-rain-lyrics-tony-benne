Yesterday I heard the rain whispering your name 
Asking where you'd gone 
It fell softly from the clouds on the silent crowds 
As I wandered on 
Out of doorways black umbrellas came to pursue me 
Faceless people as they passed were looking through me 
No one knew me Yesterday I shut my eyes, face up to the skies 
Drinking in the rain 
But your image still was there, floating in the air 
Brighter than a flame Yesterday I saw a city 
Full of shadows without pity 
And I heard the steady rain 
Whispering your name 
Whispering your name Yesterday I saw a city 
Full of shadows without pity 
And I heard the steady rain 
Whispering your name 
Whispering your name
