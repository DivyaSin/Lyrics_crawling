Hello New Jersey! Sweet heaven, I'm in love again 
Sweet heaven, I'm in love again 
You came along now what can I do? 
I only want to be with you Sweet heaven, here I go again 
I'm hooked from head to toe again 
One minute, I'm so lonely 
And then Oh, sweet heaven 
Hey, babe now that I found you life's a song 
Say babe where were you hidin'? 
I've been waiting so long Sweet heaven, I'm in love again 
So totally in love again 
I'll shout it everywhere I go 
I'll sing it on the radio 
I want the whole world to know 
Sweet heaven, I'm in love again Sweet heaven, I'm in love again
