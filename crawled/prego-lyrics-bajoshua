Release The Farthest Keys Your Distance Now Haunting Me 
Never Forget The Ocean I Kept It Clean For You 
Cut The Tail Off Of A Rattlesnake 
You Borrow By Daily Insurance Rent What's Truly Needed 2x 
I'm The Guy You Wanna Thank For Not Telling You Told You So

Too Many Bands And Not Enough Fans 
Too Many Brands And Not Enough 
For Every Door We Open 
Another One Destroyed Unless 
The Entity Is Potent Enough To Be Enjoyed 
We Switching Roles 
White Noises On The Phone 
Remain Calm This Not The Psalms 
No Man's Land Home Without A Zone 
Only Neutral Ground Now Is Sidewalk And Sea 
Verse Remain Two And Three 2x 
I'm The Guy You Wanna Thank For Not Telling You I Told You So 
Prego Prego

I Didn't Want You To Go But Music Was Your Enemy 
Let The Past Be The Past Be The Past Be The Past 
Shooting For The Stars Weren't Cha (You) I Could've Swore We Did This Before 
Denounce Everything Ah Can't You See 
Look Ahead Look Ahead Look Ahead Look Ahead 
Shooting For The Stars Weren't Cha (You)
