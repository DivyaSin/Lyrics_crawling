More than you'll ever know 
I know a lot of years have passed us 
But I still love you more than you'll ever know 
There was a time I felt it wouldn't last us 
And baby how I felt I didn't show 
Sometimes I took you for granted 
And thought that you would understand it 
But through it all we managed to make it through tough times No I can't imagine not having you by my side 
Everything you are and all you do 
I'm still in love with you More than you'll ever know 
Just like the stars in a thousand skies 
More than you'll ever know (ever know) 
Deeper than the place where the ocean floor lies 
You're still number one in my eyes 
And to this day I still get butterflies 
Know that I love you more than you will ever know Sometimes I watch you sleep and 
Kiss you and fall in love all over again 
In the morning when you're leaving 
I start to miss my best friend 
You're my better half like a twin 
You complete my words when I begin 
We don't have to be validated 
With love we'll always make it No I can't imagine not having you by my side 
Everything you are and all you do 
I'm still in love with you More than you'll ever know 
Just like the stars in a thousand skies 
More than you'll ever know (ever know) 
Deeper than the place where the ocean floor lies 
You're still number one in my eyes 
And to this day I still get butterflies 
Oh wait, know that I love you more than you will ever know See I don't ever want to be without you 
To me you're one of a kind (to me you're one of a kind) 
You're my everything (everything) 
Girl your my sunshine 
You stood with me, stood by me through tough times 
So glad that you are mine 
Knowing you're my ride or die 
I love you More than you'll ever know 
Just like the stars in a thousand skies 
More than you'll ever know (ever know) 
Deeper than the place where the ocean floor lies 
You're still number one in my eyes 
And to this day I still get butterflies 
Know that I love you more than you will ever know More than you'll ever know 
Just like the stars in a thousand skies 
More than you'll ever know (ever know) 
Deeper than the place where the ocean floor lies 
You're still number one in my eyes 
And to this day I still get butterflies 
Know that I love you more than you will ever know
