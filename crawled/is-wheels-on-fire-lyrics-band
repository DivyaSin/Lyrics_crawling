If your memory serves you well, we're going to meet again and wait 
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late 
No matter what, we'll come to you with another tale to tell 
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well [Chorus] 
Wheel's on fire 
Rolling down the road 
Just notify my next of kin 
The wheel shall explode If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your face 
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case 
If I knew for sure that it was gone, and it was oh so hard to tell 
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well [Chorus] If your memory serves you well, you'll remember that you're the one 
Who called on them to call on me to get you your favors done 
And after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell 
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well [Chorus]
