Our honor, our pride belongs to you 
Our swords will kill for you 
All who stand against us 
Are standing against you Escort us on our way 
To win this battle 
Guide our swords and shields 
We wade through till the victory is ours You are the one who ensures 
That our men return home proudly 
You make heroes out of them 
For they die as heroes You are the king, the Cherusker 
Standing over all kings 
Your strength is what we remember 
You live in us for all times
