I know you thought it best 
That we spend a little time apart 
But one night without you 
Is so much for my heart 
I know I promissed not to call 
Sorry, but I didn't have a choice 
I just had to hear your voice 
Oh, please dont't be mad at me 
'Cause I really did the best I could 
Not to dial your number 
But I didn't do much good 
Hung up the phone so many times 
'Til I really didn't have a choice I just had to hear your voice 
I had to know that you're okay 
I couldn't get to sleep this way 
And I had to hear you say hello 
I had to 
Because I love you so . 
I know you thought it best 
That we spend a little time apart 
But I had to hear your voice 
Though I know is just wasn't right 
I just had to hear your sweet voice
