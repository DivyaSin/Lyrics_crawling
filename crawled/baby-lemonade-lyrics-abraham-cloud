Baby lemonade can be good for you too 
Maybe you and me could find something to do If you see me standin' by the side of the road 
Won't you give a run-a-way a ride 
"Cause you might not get it but at least you won't regret it 
When you sit by my side Baby lemonade can be good for you too 
Maybe you could show me just what to do When the cold wind blows and you're home all alone 
Wishin' you had spoken up 
I'll be knockin' on your window with a piece of summer shinnin' 
And 'hello' in my eyes Baby lemonade can be good for you too 
Maybe you and me could find something to do Some people never understand 
the little child inside the big angry man 
but if you take my hand we'll figure it out Baby lemonade can be good for you too 
Maybe you and me could find something to do I don't think its hard and I don't understand 
can't you just let it out 
can't you just get it out 
and stand by you're man ?
