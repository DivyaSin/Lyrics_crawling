[hook] 
I'm only human 
Come on baby dry your eyes 
Wipe your tears 
Never like to see you cry 
Won't you please forgive me 
I wouldn't even try to hurt you 
I just needed someone to hold me 
To fill the void while you were gone 
To fill the space of emptiness 
[chorus] 
I'm only human 
Flesh and blood I'm made 
Human 
Born to make mistakes 
So many night I long to hold you 
So many times I look and saw your face 
And think to change to way I feel 
No one else could ever take your place 
[chorus rap] 
Dee is the name, life is a game 
Can be true or not, whats up with you 
I mean to say I make you cry 
Don't have to be but I didn't know why 
Baby I'm sorry if I heard you cry 
Would you please forgive me 
If I tell whats keeping inside 
I promise to know of each day and every day 
So please forgive me 
[repeat chorus]
