It's something wonderful when he makes love to me 
He's everything I ever need 
They can't understand what I see in him 
He's so different when we're on our own 
He has all the things I can't do without 
No matter what you say to me 
He will always be my love energy 
Burn inside of me, why do they say [Chorus:] 
He's bad for me, that's what they say 
Bad for me but I don't care 
Bad for me, what do they know 
Bad for me, whoa 
When he's standing close I'm too blind to see 
All the things he doesn't do for me 
Just so long as I can be by his side 
Doesn't matter, that's enough for me 
Don't need anything better in my life 
Than my baby when he's holding me 
He will always be my love energy 
Burn inside of me, why do they say [Chorus] 
Whoa 
Whoa 
He has all the things I can't do without 
No matter what you say to me 
He will always be my energy 
Burn inside of me, why do they say [Chorus]
