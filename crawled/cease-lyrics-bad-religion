Blacktop pavement cover me 
Like a chemical reaction or a steam roller 
Spreading randomly There's a distant and a low frequency 
It tickles my ear, it rumbles under my feet 
And it shakes the leaves off of every tree (violently) 
What pretension! Everlasting peace 
Everything must cease Institution on the Hill 
Like a beacon in the mind of an ancestor 
To ignite a people's will There's a shadowed stain on the west facade 
It has spread like decay to enshroud the fraud 
And the descendants find oh so odd 
(oh so odd) 
What pretension! Everlasting peace 
Everything must cease Grave memorial hewn white stone 
Like the comforting caress of a mother 
Or a friend you've always known It evokes such pain and significance 
What was once, is reduced to rememberence 
And the generations pass without recompense 
What pretension! Everlasting peace 
Everything must cease
