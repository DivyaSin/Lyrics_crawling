Well, I couldn't tell you 
Why she felt that way 
She felt it everyday 
And I couldn't help her 
I just watched her make 
The same mistakes again What's wrong, What's wrong now? 
Too many, too many problems 
Don't know where she belongs 
Where she belongs She wants to go home 
But nobody's home 
That's where she lies 
Broken inside 
With no place to go 
No place to go 
To dry her eyes 
Broken inside Open your eyes 
And look outside 
Find the reasons why 
You've been rejected 
And now you can't find 
What you've left behind Be strong, be strong now 
Too many, too many problems 
Don't know where she belongs 
Where she belongs She wants to go home 
But nobody's home 
That's where she lies 
Broken inside 
With no place to go 
No place to go 
To dry her eyes 
Broken inside Her feelings she hides 
Her dreams she can't find 
She's losing her mind 
She's falling behind 
And she can't find her place 
She's losing her faith she's falling from grace 
She's all over the place, yeah She wants to go home 
But nobody's home 
That's where she lies 
Broken inside 
With no place to go 
No place to go 
To dry her eyes 
Broken inside She's lost inside 
Lost inside, oh ohhh 
She's lost inside 
Lost inside, oh ohhh yeah
