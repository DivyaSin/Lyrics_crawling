Oh man, I got a splittin' headache 
And my heart is broken up into 
A thousand tiny little microscopic pieces I got a head full of headaches, a heart that's full of woes 
I'm constantly singin' them downhome blues 
And not many people knows 
That leaves me with a twisted view 
Of the whole wide world as I know it 
And I guess I got no choice but to be a poet Now in my natural habitat I gravitate towards having that 
And I elevate on having that 
And I'll never get caught in your rabbit trap 
From Yellowstone to Venezuela 
Nigeria down through Australia 
There's somethin' I learned that I gotta tell ya 
There's a whole lot of us ain't wrapped too tight Now I could been your doctor or your lawyer 
Or come to your house and clean up for ya 
Self destruction won't destroy ya 
If you got somebody that's lookin' out for ya 
Men are murdered women raped 
People gettin' beat on videotape 
And people elsewhere tryin' to escape Just to come to America to lick the plate 
Helicopters scope the land 
Hell is here so I hope you 'stand 
Hip hop culture is African 
And rappers like me gon' rule the earth I got a head full of headaches, a heart that's full of woes 
I'm constantly singin' them downhome blues 
And not many people knows 
That leaves me with a twisted view 
Of the whole wide world as I know it 
And I guess I got no choice but to be a poet Now everyday I manifest and I generate 
And smoke cannabis 
And I penetrate and I innovate 
And I demonstrate from Los Angeles 
From Amsterdam to the Northern border 
Panama, Spain to Atlanta, Georgia 
Somethin' I learned that I haven't told ya 
Brothers like me don't live too long Now I know you know it ain't who you know 
But do you know 
You see 'cause you could go just like any Joe 
And that's for sho' true 
So if you're straight and you're narrow 
And the snake's in the barrel 
And the serpent is under the rainbow 
And you're head over heels instead of the reals 
Then you're bound to be tangled 'Cause brothers are singin' and dancin' and rappin' 
Like they was a vaudeville act 
But knowledge is wealth and you gotta know self 
And you gotta know God's still black 
'Cause every so often I sit and I wonder why I even trip at all 
'Cause half are down when I get down 
The other half wanna see me fall Waitin' around all heaven bound 
And you seen that your L-7's round 
And when the sky falls to the ground 
And you found that the only way up is down 
Don't give me no additives, no sedatives 
Or preservatives, or repetitive 
Rhetoric you give, just let it live 
Yet my head is poundin' 
I'm dealin' with this load on my mind I got a head full of headaches, a heart that's full of woes man 
I'm constantly singin' them downhome blues 
And not many peoples knows 
Man, that leaves me with a twisted view 
Of the whole wide world as I know it 
And I guess I got no choice but to be a I got no choice but to be 
I guess I got no choice but to be a poet 
I guess I got no choice but to be a prophet 
I guess I got no choice but to be a griot 
A gangster, a athlete, a bum 
A nobody, a criminal, a convict 
A black man, a MC, a MC, a MC I got a head full of headaches, a heart that's full of woes 
I'm constantly singin' them downhome blues 
And not many people knows 
That leaves me with a twisted view 
Of the whole wide world as I know it 
And I guess I got no choice but to be a poet Mmm, hmm, you know that's right 
That's why people got to get their high, so they can get high 
They blast and they passed the pipe to get high 
Just like a Jedi, never said I would, I, even if I could I 
Didn't do it but I just rather get a little shut eye 
So I sleep from dawn to dusk in a bomb shelter 
'Cause ya never know when the man is gonna drop that big one Oh, pelting, people burning, melting, alarm the farmers 
Armageddon, karma psychic readings 
Greetings, Earthlings, I'm from Mars 
Got two more planets to go and then I'm on my way to the stars 
Oh no, there I go through the ozone layer hole 
Where the men are the men and they mean it 
Down where the wind don't blow where the indo grow 
In the snow and everybody po'
