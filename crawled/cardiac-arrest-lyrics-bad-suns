I've been trying to keep my grip, yeah I think I'm over this 
I can hear it now, oh no 
Yeah, my tongue, I'll let it slip, why'd I do those things I did? 
I can taste it now, oh no I'll try my best, how much do I invest? 
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips 
I'll try my best, how much do I invest? 
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss My innards turn, your eyes, they roll, I'll be there to take the fall 
I can feel it now, oh no 
Same old story since day one, but I've got no place to run 
I can see it now, oh no I'll try my best, how much do I invest? 
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips 
I'll try my best, how much do I invest? 
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss High voltage in her lips, they catch me when I slip 
High voltage in her lips, they catch me when I slip I'll try my best, how much do I invest? 
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips 
I'll try my best, how much do I invest? 
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips 
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss I'll try my best, how much do I invest? 
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips 
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
