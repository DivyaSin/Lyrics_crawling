Were getting dressed up for a good time 
Got your ticket? Well I got mine 
Grab your girl and let's ditch this place 
It's time to leave the human race 
Guys and ghouls will gather round 
Smell-o-rama and stereo sound 
Raise the curtain just pull the cord 
Get lost in the Graveyard Boulevard Damn it Janet what's wrong? 
Monster movies playing all night long 
Damn it Janet LET'S GO to the 
Midnight Creature Feature Picture Show Dead come alive on the silver screen 
A psycho slips into your dreams 
Carnivores feast on their meat 
Just like candy & trick or treat 
Psycho slasher is about to start 
He'll carve his way into your heart 
Alien invaders from outer space 
Monsters on the loose in any case Night stalking killer is a basket case 
Disappears without a trace 
He's got a way of making girls drool 
He ties them up until there skin turns blue 
Rotting zombies and slimy sluggs 
Giant spiders and atomic bugs 
Well the end is a mystery 
This is the place that I want to be
