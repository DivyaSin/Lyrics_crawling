Hey, Hey I pull up in the tints all black 
Black shades black this black that 
Call it the gash mobile 
BMW Black man wheels 
Kingston ma' nigger when the world don't got a clue' 
Roll in the club with a fresh hot stunner ooh 
I got the cheddar with the bread and the butter too 
Got ma glass shades on like Spike Lee 
Chinese ladies I'm your lychee 
I'm so cool like mind freeze 
In my whitees fresh pair of Nikees 
In an hour my flight leaves 
Ah, don't blame it on the Chrys 
Blame it on the new shit 
Blame it on the wrist 
'Cos I got a ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-rolly on 
You got a ph-ph-ph-ph-ph-phony on 
No I ting go my Peroni on 
Chicks in the club 
I don't get my lonely on 
Beverley Hills 
Axel Foley on 
Whipe on me 
They big I'm holding on 
Ah, all of the dem get down whine, (Tick Tock, Tick Tock) 
Shape up your waist and go and whine 
The way your body feel when you put it on mine 
Shake up your buddum buddum gal whine 
Shake up your buddum buddum gal whine 
Ladies in the club whine, (Oh Oh Oh) 
Tick tocking with the gal dem calling me later 
Just fly out the bar just pull out a paper 
Late night flight London - Jamacia 
We gotta' reach Keke calling later 
Tell them get ur triple A passes up 
I'll take three gal on a night flight 
Don't joke 'cos u know your wife might 
My flow sicker than back road 
Run this Castro 
Can't tolerate it lactose 
MC nachos 
Them man are cheesy 
Chat cash money like them man are Weezy 
So on top when them man'll see me 
Shot them a box like them man are Ri-Ri 
They can't come around 'ere 
When I di-di-di-di-di-di-done ya' 
Spain Europe Berlin from England to France and the German Berlin they turning for me like a whirl wind 
Emancipate and keep it burning 
Come in the place with the nine in my waist 
Tequila me feel for a line me ah taste 
Black like a diamond line ina face 
All the gal dem wine up dem waist 
I don't say hi 
Say bye to haters 
If raps your field then mines an acre 
I'm Kobe like I'm a Laker 
Owe me like I'm I favor 
Girls naughty with me just by nature 
Black, white, latin, asian 
Me and Wiley make bread, bakers 
Whole family east end, Slaters 
West Geoffrey suit tapered 
Bond, stirred not shaken 
Gone alligator, later
