He did it all 
Enough for you and me 
Played Rock 'n' Roll 
Hard, fast and free 
Full speed ahead 
Like a bullet train 
No sleep 'till death 
His ghost still haunts the stage It's all for one and one for all 
Together we stand, together we fall 
Coz it's all for one and one for all 
It's all for Rock 'n' Roll All 'round the world 
He left his mark 
A million ear drums 
Shattered like a glass 
There was no surrender 
The stage is empty 
So raise your glass 
And have a drink with me It's all for one and one for all 
Together we stand, together we fall 
Coz it's all for one and one for all 
It's all for Rock 'n' Roll 
(GUITAR SOLO) 
All for one, one for all 
All for one, for Rock 'n' Roll 
All for one, one for all 
All for one, for Rock 'n' Roll
