Ain't a motherfucker I gotta change fo' right 
Therefore I'm a be this way until I go Yeah! Guess who walk around with diamond chains and rings on 'em

Sprayin' up the wall like graffiti artist 
Some niggaz by the bootleg but go and cop the real shit 
'Cause the fans love us I'm nicer than grandmothers 
I wake up get dressed put on my tan butters

And have you screamin' in the back of the club louder than lil' Jon Now don't try to stand next to me right

A felony walkin' out the front do' right 
Ain't a motherfucker I gotta change fo' right 
Therefore I'm a be this way until I go You now lookin' at the hood meal ticket seven thou on my wrist 
It's kinda hard to keep the balance with this 
It keeps the challengers pissed 
I vacate to different islands and twist 
And back home where the violence exist, now silencers fixed 
You buy mileage as gifts as well as man's best friend 
And I don't own no rottweillers and pits 
It's getting extremely hard for the man to roam 
With little kids putting this picture on the camera phone Shit change now that the cameras on 
A bitch will jeopardize the marriage to fuck you when that man is gone 
These niggaz ramblin' on about the paper that they getting stop it 
I got more money than you in my little pocket 
Yeah, I'm stingy so it's stretch long 
With G-unit sweats on thread needle to Teflon 
Des' Eagle and vest on, 'cause everybody ain't enthused 
That's your name's around about good news, fuck y'all Now don't try to stand next to me right 
'Cause I'm the nigga they came here to see right 
Ain't nothin' 'round here for free right 
And I'm here to let these motherfuckers know
