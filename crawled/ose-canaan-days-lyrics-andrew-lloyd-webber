Do you remember the good years in Canaan? 
The summers were endlessly gold 
The fields were a patchwork of clover 
The winters were never too cold We'd stroll down the boulevards together 
And everything round us was fine 
Now the fields are dead and bare 
No joie de vivre anywhere 
Et maintenant we drink a bitter wine Those Canaan days we used to know 
Where have they gone, where did they go? 
Eh bien, raise your berets to those Canaan days Do you remember those wonderful parties? 
The splendor of Canaan's cuisine 
Our extravagant, elegant soirees 
The gayest the Bible has seen It's funny but since we lost Joseph 
We've gone to the other extreme 
No one comes to dinner now, we'd only eat them anyhow 
I even find I'm missing Joseph's dreams Those Canaan days we used to know 
Where have they gone, where did they go? 
Eh bien, raise your berets to those Canaan days It's funny but since we lost Joseph 
We've gone to the other extreme 
Perhaps we all misjudged the lad 
Perhaps he wasn't quite that bad 
And how we miss his entertaining dreams Those Canaan days we used to know 
Where have they gone, where did they go? 
Eh bien, raise your berets to those Canaan days 
Eh bien, raise your berets to those Canaan days
