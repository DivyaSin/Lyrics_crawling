There's always been something that I can't say 
You'll find it between all the notes I paid 
And when everything that is spoke has been stripped away 
You'll hear it ring after you're hit, there is night meets day I don't know if I will leave with you but 
I believe in you 
I don't know if I will leave with you but 
I believe in you 
I don't know if I will leave with you but 
I believe in you 
Everything I've ever wanted to do is 
Interleave with you What I've got with you, all I see is fit 
I need to hang on to the voice I hear 
You tell me from deep in your heart that you need to breathe 
and I read a lee where the cloth from the clothes you weave I don't know if I will leave with you but 
I believe in you 
I don't know if I will leave with you but 
I believe in you 
I don't know if I will leave with you but 
I believe in you 
Everything I've ever wanted to do is 
Interleave with you
