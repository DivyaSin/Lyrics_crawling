You say you don't know what you were thinking 
Neither do I 
And after all the time we spent together 
You think you deserve another try Well girl, I don't know what it is that you're expecting 
Just because you look me in the eye And say you're sorry 
Sorry 
You want it back the way it was 
Well, I'm sorry 
But sometimes sorry 
Just ain't good enough You say you never meant to hurt me 
Honey, that might be true 
Do you really think I should forgive you 
For what you put me through? Oh, I remember every time you said you loved me 
But I know now your love was just a lie And you say you're sorry 
Sorry 
You want it back the way it was 
Well, I'm sorry 
But sometimes sorry 
Just ain't good enough Oh girl, I don't know what it is that you're expecting 
Just because you look me in the eye 
And say you're sorry So, you're sorry 
You're 
You want it back the way it was 
Well, I'm sorry 
But sometimes sorry 
Just ain't good enough
