I thought u left me here alone 
I want to know just what u know 
I need to hold u in my arms tonight 
And know that ur all right I wanna c u when the sun goes down 
I wanna c u when i wake up 
Just tell me baby u wont leave me 
And that ur hear to stay CHORUS 
Dont go i want to not be alone 
Coz baby i cant live without u 
I need u to hold my hand so tight 
Coz baby i just cant live without u Lonlyness hurts the heart 
The way to stop the way to start 
Dont u mess me around 
Coz baby i smash u to the ground 
Livin without u woz the hardest thing 
And coz of that uv drove me to sing 
This littlesong 
I'll pretend theres nouthing wrong 
I am tired of being alone 
I aint gonna take it any MORE
