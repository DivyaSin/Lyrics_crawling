I got the key to the highway, 
Billed out and bound to go 
I'm gonna leave here running people 
Because walking is most too slow I'm going back, to the border 
Before they put up the fence 
Where I'm better known 
Because you haven't done nothing baby, 
Except drove a good man away from home When the moon peeks over the mountains 
Baby I'm gonna be on my way 
I'm gonna roam this mean old highway 
Until the break of day So give me one, give one more kiss baby 
Before I go, 
'Cause when I leave this town 
I won't be back no more, no more So give me one more kiss baby 
Give me one more kiss baby before I go, 
'Cause when I leave this town 
I won't be back no more, no more So goodbye, goodbye baby 
Baby I must, I must, I must say goodbye 
Cause I'm a roam this mean old highway 
Until the day I die 
I'm gonna do this til the day I die folks
