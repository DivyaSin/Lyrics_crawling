Please, I'm only here to protect you 
We all know exactly what's going on here 
I will kill him 
I swear to God he's dead 
I bring judgment 
I bring judgment 
I've kept this in for way too long 
I am the end of days 
I am the fucking end 
Do you still feel so comfortable lying underneath him? 
Don't pretend like we're so blind 
I never said I was a good man 
So where you get these ideas is beyond me 
I am by no means a saint 
And I will not seek forgiveness 
I will tear you from society 
I am so god damn fed up with every human on this planet 
But, you will be first 
How does it feel to be a notch on his belt? 
I will taste blood by the end of the night 
You will cease to be 
I'll rip out your fucking teeth 
You won't speak 
You won't speak 
I will eat you bit by bit 
You are nothing less than shit 
Less than shit 
Less than shit 
Do you honestly expect me to keep this quiet? 
Well I can't I've got to spill it out 
Do you believe that I am here to save you 
Well I refuse to let this go 
And now your world is falling upon you 
And there's no where left for you to run 
You can't pretend this never happened 
This is real 
And when you die 
The vultures will not pick at your eyes 
They have too much taste for that 
This is your era of suffering
