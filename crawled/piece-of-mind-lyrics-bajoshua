I Have An Eye For Things That Bring Sacrificial Meaning 
And When A Cycle Breaks That Scene Played Out Before Me And It's Time I Remind Myself Impulse Just How I Felt 
Forget To Speak To Get A Piece Of Mind 
When She Smelled That Sober Rose When Those Elevators Closed 
The Overtone Was Like Convulsive Nerves Showing Up Caused A Spontaneous Rush 
We Were Prepared For War At Any Turn Signal 
You Fell Asleep Before The Arrival Drew Already Believed Both Was In 
Good Company We Pushed A Button 
Down With A Pressure 
Can It Reach The Ground Floor 
Elevate The Heart You Stole And It's Time I Remind Myself 
Impulse Just How I Felt 
Forget To Speak To Get A Piece Of Mind 
When She Smelled That Sober Rose When Those Elevators Closed 
The Overtone Was Like Convulsive Nerves On the Outside Looking In Doors Closed I've Lost A Friend 
When I Heard The News There's No Words To Explain 
It Didn't Hit Me (Until) I Left Separation Anxiety 
Direct Me Remotely To The Nearest Vice We Pushed A Button Down With A Pressure 
Can It Reach The Ground Floor 
Elevate The Heart You Stole
