Gracefully looking up to your idols, 
you get fulfillment in emulating them 
Their seeming philosophy of life 
more and more becomes a part of you 
Decadent behaviour and hypocritical laughter, 
in their eyes the greed for fame; 
Sooner or later you'll recognize 
that this truth is full of lies. [Refrain] 
Free your consciousness and breathe the scent of truth 
It is time to strengthen your individuality 
Look around and tell me what do you see! 
Truth and illusion - it's construality I'm struggling to find the right words, 
words you hear and understand 
Ignorance and foolish prejudices 
are blinding the peoples' reason 
But I will scream until you listen, 
enslaving your thoughts from apathy 
There's no obstacle, there's no border, 
no excuse that could stop me (Refrain) I'm searching for answers still unfound 
Words and lies keep circling around Don't try to understand - just live your way 
Raise your head above the clay!
