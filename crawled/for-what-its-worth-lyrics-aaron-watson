I just called to say good bye 
But I was hopin' that you would beg me not to go 
You where my only reason for stayin' 
Besides the amirillo winters are to cold to spend alone [Chorus] 
So what its worth 
I'll be in fort worth 
Just in case you ever start missin' me 
I'm gonna be right here in Fort Worth 
So for what its worth that's where I'm gonna be Before the pain I put you through 
Those late night calls from those random county jails 
I know I swore never to bother you again 
But if you don't mind could you find the time to forward me my mail [Chorus] If you need a friend, a friendly conversation 
You got my number and an open invitation [Chorus] Fort Worth Texas is where you'll find me
