Wheels turn like my memories 
And the head-lights shine like my used-to-be's 
And time, time's taking way too long 
And forgiveness, well I hope its not too far gone [Chorus] 
A hundred miles from her is where I need to be 
And a hundred miles from now I'm gonna hit my knees 
Say I miss you oh I love you and I'm sorry 
And if she can find the way to take me back 
I'll spend the rest of my life making up for the past 
All my answers, all my hopes, All my fears 
Are a hundred miles from here I, I told her I had to go 
And now I know what I didn't know 
And this road could lead me back to your door 
But can it take me to a girl who can love me more [Chorus]
