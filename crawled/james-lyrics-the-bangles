I knew it'd turn out like this 
I'm keeping one foot on the train 
And I must be a masochist 
To ever take up with you, James. It sounds familiar 
That tone in your voice 
You're gonna quit, James 
You leave me no choice. Oh, James 
Letting me down again, James. Well, it wasn't so long ago 
I saw love in your eyes 
And I think I should've known 
But I'm feelin' somewhat surprised. You think there's someone 
Better for you 
You think I'm too young 
To see this thing through. Oh, James 
Letting me down again, James. (Ooh, let me down) down, down 
(Ooh, let me down) let me down, down, down, down 
(Ooh, let me down) down, down 
(Ooh, let me down) let me down, down, down, down 
(Ooh, let me down) down. I knew it'd turn out like this 
I'm keeping one foot out the door 
And I don't think I should trust 
That kind of love anymore. And now I realize 
I had it all wrong 
I'll only take this 
Trip for so long. Woe, James 
Letting me down again, James 
Guess this is goodbye again, James 
Letting me down again 
Letting me down again, James.
