Ships are sailing by my car 
What a majesty 
I felt comforted inside 
Would you believe that I was wrong 
Would you come out 
And show your face, and show your eyes 
Talk to me now and tell me 
Why you did it, why you planned this cruel trap 
Well in fact I dont care about your psychological reasons 
I only came here to warn you 
You little bastard There comes a time when you will have to consider my anger 
There comes a time when you will have to believe in my strength 
There comes a time for revenge 
And sweet eye for an eye with you 
Burst into laughter 
Now burst into laughter 
The one who laughs last is the one who wins How is it to fall down 
And sink into the mud 
Break down in pieces 
Like I did before 
And was it worth it at all 
To make me scream and howl 
To play my master? There comes a time when you will have to consider my anger 
There comes a time when you will have to believe in my strength 
There comes a time for revenge 
And sweet eye for an eye with you 
Burst into laughter 
Burst your laughter 
The one who laughs last is the one who wins
