Give, You know she gave, Till she was running like a fuckin' slave 
Take, You know he took, Till she was running on an empty tank 
A tongue made of gold, Empty promises and all 
He tastes like sugar coated cyanide 
He pulled your body full of fire and your head 
Full of shit and your mind full of suicide 
Hurt, I know you hurt, You're not the only one in this world 
Live, Your still alive, And just remember you're a quality girl 
You're like a fire burnin' out of control 
Love like a laze burnin' into your soul 
She was a quality girl 
Speak, You know he spoke, With words that made her fell so alive 
Feed, You know he fed, Fed her a belly full of fuckin' lies 
Amphetamine smile and a valium kiss and a bottleful of liquid 
Pride, You got your artificial courage and a make shift mask 
Soul canker's something you can't hide
