Hello, my fellow man 
You look like youve had it rough 
You look like your story aint been kind to you 
Have you known the pain? 
Do you even have a name? 
What do you have that makes you worth my time? You look, to me, like a man of crimes Do not hold back love 
From those who deserve it 
When youve got the opportunity to act 
Everyone deserves 
To be treated well by you 
Everyone deserves your love Hello, my sister 
You are the face of a nameless race 
Of lust and lies and alcohol and drugs But whatve I got that makes me better? 
Ive still got my vices 
What is it that makes me think 
Im worth more than another? Everyone deserves your love 
Everyone deserves your love 
No matter where theyre coming from 
No matter about the things theyve done 
Everyone deserves your love
