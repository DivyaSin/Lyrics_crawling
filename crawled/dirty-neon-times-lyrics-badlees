I thought I felt her ghost again last night 
And I kept a fire burning through the morning light 
You, early morning diner on the neon range 
You, you drove away as it began to rain Twenty months of feedin' off original sin 
Ain't shut the door blown open by what should have been CHORUS And time's been like a dog that begs 
And I find it's needin' to be fed 
Guardian angel rise, pull me out of my disguise 
And shut the door behind on the dirty neon times I became an island on a social sea 
And I let someone take my shores occasionally 
Wine, good weed and cigarettes assured they'd leave 
Fine, fine women all but I could not receive Twenty months of feedin' off original sin 
Ain't shut the door blown open by what should've been CHORUS 'Cause to condemn her now don't make no sense at all 
Like taxis in the backwoods, like striptease at the mall 
You hit a wall CHORUS
