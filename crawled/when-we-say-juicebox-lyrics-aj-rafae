somethin bout the way 
somethin bout the way you look 
in my eyes 
you make everything so damn easy 
so easy that i dont got to worry bout a thing and baby when we touch 
all i can see is the image of us 
sitting by the ocean 
just before the dusk 
sippin on a juice box and 
sand between our toes this is the part when we say were in love 
and the part where we have our first kiss 
but this ain't a movie 
i know you cant come with me 
you got your life 
he better be treatin you right just tell me you dont love me 
tell me you dont feel the same way that i do 
tell me i dont make you smile 
like i do when you walk in the room 
you're so hard to let go this is the part when we say were in love 
and the part where we say it's forever 
but this ain't a fantasy 
i know you can't come with me 
you got your life 
he better be treatin you right this hurts so much to know that you're 
with someone else when you should be w me 
its just hard to accept that i cant be around 
he better be treatin you good 
i'm no einstein but i know a sign 
when i see one 
and i know you love me too
