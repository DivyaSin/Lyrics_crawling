Quickstep (written 4/77) 
I knew my youth couldn't last forever 
I knew some chords so I got the band together 
Sick of sleeping and beating up my mother 
Forget these luxuries, I've got myself another buzz 
Now you don't see me, now you do 
Pretty s 
oon you're going to see what punks can do 
I stole some tunes from the radio 
I lost my nerve but it didn't show 
I found some friends with a little faith 
Less money and no taste 
Now you don't see me, now you do 
Pretty soon you're going to see what pu 
nks can do 
But you've got to work at it, what a drag 
You've got to work, work, work, work 
You can't lag behind, lag behind, lag behind 
I want to get this gig over 
And I don't want to see it again 
But I don't want to go until it's over 
And I don't w 
ant to die in pain, die in pain 
2-3-4! I knew my youth can't last forever 
I'll sing the words until I can't keep the band together no more 
Oh! to do the quickstep on a Saturday night 
And hunt like brave man with a flashlight 
Now you don't see me, no 
w you do 
Pretty soon you're going to see what punks can do
