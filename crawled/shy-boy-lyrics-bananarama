Shoop shoop aah 
Shoop shoop aah 
Shoop shoop aah 
Shoop shoop aah He used to be a shy boy 
Until I made him my boy 
I never missed a heart beat 
Just sitting in the back seat 
Yeah I'm gonna give him all my love 
Each and every night 
One thing I'm always dreaming of 
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight [Chorus] 
But don't it make you feel good 
Shoop shoop aah 
And don't it make you feel good 
Shoop shoop aah 
Don't it make you feel good 
Shoop shoop aah 
And don't it make you feel good 
Shoop shoop aah Every minute we're together 
Seems to last forever 
He knows about a good time 
Gonna make him all mine 
All mine He gives me loving like nobody else 
I like the way he turns me on 
I wanna keep him all to myself 
If my heart could be that strong [Chorus] I'm gonna give him all my love 
Each and every night 
One thing I'm always dreaming of 
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight But don't it make you 
Shoop shoop aah 
But don't it make you 
Shoop shoop aah He gives me loving like nobody else 
I like the way he turns me on 
I wanna keep him all to myself 
If my heart could be that strong [Chorus]
