Sometimes at night I drive by and stare 
And wonder what my life would be like if I had wound up there 
Would I walk around with that look on my face 
That dreaded look of having been condemned to this place [Chorus:] 
I could have kept on drinking 
I could have gone to jail 
My twisted road was sinking 
Straight to the? Allen Hotel 
The Stories they tell 
At the Allen Hotel 
The broken memories that dwell The hanging light bulb reflecting through the broken pane 
Bullet-filed walls, the roof cant seem to stop the rain 
Out on the Streets, whores trade their bodies for balloons 
Had to get away, couldn't get too far too soon [Chorus] [Chorus]
