[Chorus: Ronnie Banks] 
Don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring it 
No, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring it 
No, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring it 
No, don't ring the alarm 
Press snooze, fall back and I'm gone [Adrian Marcel] 
Oh No, No, No, No 
Cause every night I dream girl I dream of you, my love love 
No I don't wanna wanna wake up 
Wake up no, no, no 
Cause in reality she don't notice me 
Oh love love 
So I don't wanna wanna wake up 
Wake up no, no [Verse 1: Ronnie Banks] 
I don't wanna wake up (wake up) 
All night I'm feeling your touch 
And I think I'm in love 
Every time I think about us 
I guess you can call me crazy, baby 
[?] Come through in that Mercedes, baby 
I'll pick you up in that 
Ridin round town with the top pushed back 
(Yeah she told me she don't like it, she loves it 
Yeah, so we started kissing under the covers, yeah) 
It was about to get good 
'Til that alarm went off like... 
Was just 'bout to let her know 
But now that I'm up where'd you go? [Chorus: Adrian Marcel] 
Oh No, No, No, No 
Cause every night I dream girl I dream of you, my love love 
No I don't wanna wanna wake up 
Wake up no, no, no 
Cause in reality she don't notice me 
Oh love love 
So I don't wanna wanna wake up 
Wake up no, no [Ronnie Banks] 
Don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring it 
No, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring it 
No, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring, don't ring the alarm 
Don't ring it 
No, don't ring the alarm 
Press snooze, fall back and I'm gone [Verse 2: Ronnie Banks] 
Nuh uh 
I don't wanna wake up 
Cause one night girl just ain't enough 
No lie, I'm just sprung off that 
Girl give me all your love don't hold back 
We can stay here forever baby 
Cloud nine all the time 
It's forever baby 
Anywhere you wanna go 
All around the world, what you waitin' for? 
(Yeah she told me she don't like it, she loves it 
Yeah, so we started kissing under the covers, yeah) 
It was about to get good 
'Til that alarm went off like... 
Was just bout to let her know 
But now that I'm up where'd you go? [Chorus: Adrian Marcel] 
Oh No, No, No, No 
Cause every night I dream girl I dream of you, my love love 
No I don't wanna wanna wake up 
Wake up no, no, no 
Cause in reality she don't notice me 
Oh love love 
So I don't wanna wanna wake up 
Wake up no, no [Ronnie Banks]
