Come, I'll melt you down 
God is Sun 
Pull me under 
Foam is pouring out 
Hidden one 
Night is wonder 
Home until another King 
all my blood love is stained 
I'm falling 
Through my head through my veins 
God is Sun and all this space 
I'm falling 
I'm falling 
God is Sun (x4) 
Come, Shiva sun 
Shock the blood 
Shock the Veda 
Home, I'm overcome 
Flesh and blood 
Shock the Veda 
Home until another King 
All my blood love is stained 
I'm falling 
I'm falling 
Through my head through my veins 
God is Sun and all this space 
I'm falling 
I'm falling 
God is Sun (x4) 
God is Sun (x6)
