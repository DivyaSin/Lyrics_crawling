Chorus- 
Songbird, it's takin' longer, 
I see the ego in the people get stronger, 
Could take a lifetime, to see the right signs, 
So let's remind every mind we're the same, people pass the front line, 
Even past the guns drawn, worries and our failures, everyone is one kind. I'm a part of a motivated movement, hop up in the FAM if you're for improvement, 
some by the pool, mixing drinks, straight coolin', 
While other's are struggling, just to be a student, 
uncover the bright side, it's always time for that, 
no more running kids with AK's strapped to back, 
I'mma reach my inked out arm to help, don't think that it's all gone to hell, 
Look ahead, look to the future, sew up them sutures, mend the world, 
pick up the loser, put down the uzi, headlines lined with crime alerts, 
some of the sickening things that are happening come from the lack of respect, 
it's all big heads, yeah we're doing well, pick up the slack and take on what's next Chorus- 
Songbird, it's takin' longer, 
I see the ego in the people get stronger, 
Could take a lifetime, to see the right signs, 
So let's remind every mind we're the same people past the front line, 
Even past the guns drawn, worries and our failures, everyone is one kind. Verse 2 - Don't let that ego get in the way, don't make people think that you've gone and changed, 
I'm a self made man, that's right, still the damn same, but I'm on the tracks to a louder life, 
and I'm fortunate enough to have that income coming in, 
we hold it down and stay grounded, some of y'all just hovering and go! 
Focus on a mind outside your own, 
never change for anyone at all
