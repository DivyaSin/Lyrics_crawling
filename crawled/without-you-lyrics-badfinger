No I can't forget this evening, 
Or your face as you were leaving, 
But I guess that's just the way the story goes. 
You always smile, but in your eyes, 
Your sorrow shows, yes it shows. No I can't forget tomorrow, 
When I think of all my sorrow, 
How I had you there, but then I let you go. And now it's only fair 
That I should let you know what you should know. 
I can't live, if living is without you. 
I can't live, I can't live any more. 
I can't live, if living is without you. 
I can't give, I can't give anymore. No I can't forget this evening, 
Or your face as you were leaving, 
But I guess that's just the way the story goes. 
You always smile, but in your eyes, 
Your sorrow shows. 
Yes it shows.
