and just like you said, I'm alone and I'm a child 
so would you let me hold your heart? 
babys only need lies in your affection 
never got to touch that part is there anything of me you want 
because i would give you everything 
but if your heart is cut out 
i can give you nothing and just like you said, I'm a fool and a creep and a scam 
but wont you let me hold your heart? 
babys lying face down in the starlight 
never got to hold that heart unconditional is what i gave 
and what it cost 
you will never understand...
