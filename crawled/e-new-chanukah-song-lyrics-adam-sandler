Chanukah is the festival of lights 
Instead of one day of presents 
We get eight crazy nights 
So when you feel like the only kid in town 
Without a Christmas tree 
Here's a new list of people who are Jewish 
Just like you and me 
Winona Ryder drinks Manachevett's wine 
Then spins a dreidel with Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein 
Guess who gives and receives loads of Chanukah toys 
The girls from Veruca Salt and all three Beastie Boys 
Lenny Kravits is half Jewish 
Courtney Love is half, too 
Put them together 
What a funky, bad-ass Jew! 
We got Harvey Keitel 
And flash dancer Jennifer Bill 
Yasmine Bleeth from Baywatch is Jewish 
And, yes, her boobs are real 
Put on that yarmulke 
It's time for Chanukah 
Two time Oscar winner Dustin Hoffmonica celebrates Chanukah 
OJ Simpson, still not a Jew 
But guess who is 
The guy who does the voice for Scooby Doo 
Bob Dylon was born a Jew 
Then he wasn't, but now he's back 
Mary Tyler Moore's husband is Jewish 
'Cause we're pretty good in the sack 
Guess who got barmitzvahhed on the PGA Tour 
No, I'm not talking about Tiger Woods 
I'm talking about Mr. Happy Gilmore 
So many Jews are in the showbiz 
Bruce Springstein isn't Jewish 
But my mother thinks he is 
Tell that ho Lamonica 
It's time to celebrate Chanukah 
It's not pronounced CH-anukah 
The C is silent in Chanukah 
So read your hooked on phonica 
Get drunk in Tiajuanica 
If you really, really wannaca 
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy, Chanukah 
Hapyy Chanukah!
