I don't know what I want 
I don't know what I need 
I don't why I'm always around you Oh, I try find a home 
A life to call my own 
I don't know why 
But I need you beside me Oh, I You, always on my side 
Forget about what's wrong or right 
I never had to ask you why oh why Nobody's gonna take this heart 
Nobody's gonna replace what we had from the start 
It's gonna take the two of us, forever feels like tomorrow 
It doesn't get easier So, I'm nothing without you 
Yeah, nothing without you Oh, I could never seem to get things right 
Oh, it's better again 
What are we arguing about last night? 
Something real dumb, 
I do apologize Turning all the way that smile 
I'm pulling in your hands 
Now make me understand 
Don't sell me on something I don't wanna be alone 
That's right, hell, I'm afraid 
I thought we had more time together 
Time to let go before the colors fade to grey Nobody's gonna take this heart 
Nobody's gonna replace what we have from the start 
It's gonna take the two of us, forever feels like tomorrow 
It doesn't get easier Who knows this song none better than you 
None better than you
