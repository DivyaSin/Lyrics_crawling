Ionospheric splendour ignites the northern skies 
Unseen by jaded eyes 
Preferring more an insect's view of mundane, grindstone lives 
This planet, once a paradise before the serpent spoke 
And greed became the rope 
By which the race would hang itself 
Naked, without hope Racing like lemmings to the brink of holocaust 
With scant concern for cost 
We fall before the god of pleasure 
Jeopardizing without measure 
The rarest gem of everlasting life With staggering shortsightedness our golden calves are raised 
Ignoring former days 
Gambling with our heritage in this self-seeking age 
The endless quest for freedom, much like the northern lights 
So beautiful and bright 
But far beyond the mortal's grasp 
As witnessed by our plight Too much casual violence 
Too much casual sex 
Too much casual unconcern 
For what may happen next The endless quest for freedom, much like the northern lights 
So beautiful and bright 
But far beyond the mortal's grasp 
As witnessed by our plight 
The splendour of redemption ignites the newborn heart 
A spiritual upstart 
Who cannot fathom what's to come Or what will be his part Racing llike lemmings to the brink of holocaust 
With scant concern for cost 
We fall before the god of pleasure 
Jeopardizing without measure 
The rarest gem of everlasting life
