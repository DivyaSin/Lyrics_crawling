[Verse 1] 
Struggle with myself 
And out of all the people that can't handle this 
I thought you were the only one that could 
Im tired of hearing how no one's tired about talkin' 'bout 
How Im so fucking tired of us, girl 
But you look so familiar, girl 
Coming down off a line right now... 
Look at youve done, girl, to me... 
Look at what youve made of me this far 
Feelin' so mutual now, 
I cant feel my face, feel my face, oh no 
And maybe it was only me, girl 
Cant find my heart, find my place no more 
And no 
Im so high right now, girl 
And my mouth is so numb, baby 
Oh no, Oh no. [Verse 2] 
Should I save myself, girl? 
I know you know who you are 
And girl I already loved you 
Way before I met you girl, so 
So what's takin' so long, whats takin' so long? 
I I dont wanna give my tears away 
Love's not in your heart to stay 
But if youll never be mine, how can you be so sure? 
Girl what is it? 
Are you scared of the fact that its always snowin', girl? 
Or is it, you cant find out why the fuck I chose you, girl? 
Try hard not to think, girl, listen to what I say 
Just listen to what I need, oh need... 
And Im... 
And Im so high right now, girl 
And I cant feel my mind 
Oh yeah...Oh yeah [Verse 3] 
All I think about is gettin' away from this fuckin' city 
Then you started to notice when my nose is always bleedin' 
Imma sniff it 'til I feel it, Imma use it til' it kills me 
Somebody should've told you, I dont want to get older 
Yeah, I dont wanna get older, dont wanna get older 
Dont wanna oh no, oh no 
Can I fuck you girl, can I fuck you girl? 
Thats all I need 
Can I love you girl, you love me, girl? 
Maybe its me this time 
Maybe its me this time... 
Can I fuck you girl, fuck you girl? 
Thats all I need 
Can I love you, girl, love you girl? 
Baby, its me this time 
Maybe its me this time, girl 
Me this time, girl
