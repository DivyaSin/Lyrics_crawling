Blinded by Stars My blood does remember the rhythm of a drum Beat by a boy soldier whose revolution won I?ve carried pretty flowers to fallen heroes graves & stood in silence honoring the price our fathers paid This was their flag but this ain?t their fight Dirty with oil tattered by spite This was their flag but this ain?t their fight So what do you call justice & what is freedom for Don?t let the towncrier decide if we go to war 'cause this ain?t about your medla The choice is of the soul & hate is never brave while mercy?s always, always sold Blinded by stars tangled in stripes This is our flag but this ain?t our fight Dirty with oil tattered by spite This is our flag but this ain?t our fight This is my flag but this ain?t my fight Now I was born a rebel, I question what I?m told No wonder this young skin I?m wearin? Feels so old Don?t be blinded by stars tangled in stripes This is our flag but this ain?t our fight Dirty with oil tattered by spite This is our flag but this ain?t our fight This I s my flag but this ain?t my fight
