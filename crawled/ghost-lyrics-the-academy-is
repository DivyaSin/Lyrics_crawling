Hey, stop on a dime 
Take both your hands 
Reach them above, one at a time 
Are you alone in here? 
I heard the voice so clearly I tried not to breathe 
Tried not to speak 
Clamping my tongue between my teeth 
Are you alone in here? 
I heard the voice so clearly say Well, there are fine lines I've seen 
We are stuck in between 
With separate eyes to use and throw aside 
How we die, nobody wants to know 
Who decides where everybody goes? 
Where everybody goes? Well, no, this can't be it 
I start to sweat 
Haunted by all the things I'd miss 
This can't be right 
I realized right then, that 
It's me or him, yeah There are fine lines I've seen 
We are stuck in between 
With separate eyes to use and throw aside 
How we die, nobody has to know 
Who decides where everybody goes? 
What if I don't? Oh, no, I can't believe this 
I don't know why 
This had to happen 
I had no choice 
Well, it was me or him 
Well, it was me or him There's a fine line 
Between what is justified or just obscene 
Fragile eyes to use and throw aside 
How we die, nobody wants to know 
Who decides where everybody goes? 
Where everybody goes? How we died, no one will ever know 
Who decides where everybody goes? 
Who decides where everybody goes? 
Who decides where everybody goes? Who decides where everybody goes? 
Who decides where everybody goes? 
Who decides where everybody goes? Who decides where everybody goes? 
Who decides where everybody goes? 
Who decides where everybody goes?
