Written by Kevin Bacon "It's about having the strength to re-define your life's work. A follow-up to 'Guess Again.'" KB Emma Rae's riding on a north-bound train 
Spilling all that pain 
On the plains of Dover 
Emma Rae's crying from a hot cell phone 
She said she never felt so alone 
This time the dream is over Surely this is her darkest hour 
I've even heard her talk about a higher power 
Deep in her heart comes a tiny voice 
And it says "hold on momma, 
'Cause you've got one last choice" Bring your dreams down to the river 
And let the water wash all your dreams away 
When the night comes, it will deliver 
Through the darkness, your heart is gonna light the way Old man standing on a soap box 
He's wearing wool socks 
On the hottest day all year 
Old man preachin' to the handful 
With a head full 
He says "the end is surely near" 
Now, who among you even cares? 
They're turnin' circles into squares 
But deep in his heart comes a tired voice 
And it says "hold on daddy, 
You've got one last choice" Bring your dreams down to the river 
And let the water wash all your dreams away 
When the night comes, it will deliver 
Through the darkness, your heart is gonna light the way 
Light the way, light the way 
Through the darkness, your heart is gonna light the way Light the way, oh light the way 
Through the darkness, your heart is gonna light the way
