Tonight someone will die 
All alone 
Tonight someone will fall 
All alone 
They've fallen from the sky 
Will you cry 
Wonder why When it rains 
Phoenix fall down on me 
I rise from the ashes 
When angels fall down 
When it rains 
Phoenix fall down on me 
As they all fall down 
When it rains phoenix fall down on me 
As they all fall down So I call 
Time to pick them up 
Least they fall 
The skies are full enough 
Take them back 
Not time to go home yet 
Don't let go 
If you love 
They will live When it rains 
Phoenix fall down on me 
I rise from the ashes 
When angels fall down 
When it rains 
Phoenix fall down on me 
As they all fall down 
When it rains phoenix fall down on me 
As they all fall down From the wings of angels 
From the wings, from the wings, from the wings 
From the wings of angels I will fly 
Find the strength to carry on 
On the arms of angels I will fall 
My heart breaks and bleeds 
On the wings of angels I will fly 
See the writing on the wall 
From the arms of angels I will fall 
My heart breaks and bleeds When it rains 
Phoenix fall down on me 
I rise from the ashes 
When angels fall down 
When it rains 
Phoenix fall down on me 
As they all fall down 
When it rains phoenix fall down on me 
As they all fall down
