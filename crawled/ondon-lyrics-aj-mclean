When I wake up in the sunlight 
And look into your eyes 
And I hold you for a little while 
Then I see behind your smile 
I remember how beautiful 
I used to think you are 
Now the only love that meant something is gone I should have let you go 
When I saw that it was over in your eyes 
What do I have to do 
To get rid of you 
I'll be better on my own 
Now I miss the sun 
But as long as I'm with you 
It's just another rainy day in London I still hold on to the memory 
Of how we were meant to be 
And I wonder did you ever care 
You were never there for me 
I thought I was stronger 
But then why am I here 
When there's nothing left to say 
When the only one that meant something is gone I should have let you go 
When I saw that 
It was over in you eyes 
What do I have to do 
To get rid of you 
I'll be better on my own 
Now I missed the sun 
But as long as I'm with you 
It's just a another rainy day in London Just another rainy day in London I remember how beautiful 
I used to think you are I should have let you go 
When I saw that 
It was over in your eyes(it was over in your eyes) 
What do I have to you 
To get rid of you(rid of you) 
I'll be better on my own(I'll be better on my own) 
Now I missed the sun 
But as long as I'm with you 
It's just another rainy day in London 
Just another rainy day in London
