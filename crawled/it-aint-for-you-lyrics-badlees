(Alexander) Hush now baby, can't you see 
This cross I bear, it ain't for me 
I do my job, it's all I have 
To give you things I never had I had my chance in '63 
To start my own small company 
That's over now, I know it's true 
For me babe, it ain't for you Listen to the things I say 
Don't run and hide, don't turn away 
Ain't no one knows what you should do 
Boy, it's too late for me 
It ain't for you Son I see you're going far 
Out of college, brand new car 
Your business is doing well 
Your mom and I, we're proud as hell But remember everything I said 
He who hesitates is dead 
And a simple man with honest means 
Is better than a thousand thieves Listen to the things I say 
Don't run and hide, don't turn away 
Ain't no one knows what you should do 
Boy, it's too late for me 
It ain't for you Hello dad, I know it's late 
There's something that just couldn't wait 
I'm working seven days a week 
I need some time for family There's too much work for just one man 
So now I'm looking to expand 
I did the things you said to do 
And now 'm coming back for you Listen to the things I say 
Don't run and hide, don't turn away 
Ain't no one knows what you should do 
Boy, it's too late for me 
It ain't for you
