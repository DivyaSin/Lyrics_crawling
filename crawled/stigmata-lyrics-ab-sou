Righteous man 
Walk with me 
Bear the burden Yo, yo, yo, no, no 
Don't do you dare, cast one stone in air 
I'm cracking stone with bear hands, you're a mere man 
I know all my stoners here, all my visionaries 
Shades in the night, that's a scary sight 
I'm never in the dark though, my squad the brightest circle 
Watch with the internet alone I enlighten the whole globe 
That's iTunes from a nigga with astigmatism 
I got it from my moms, thank you Steve Jobs 
You took my grandpa job and you gave me a job 
Not just a physical but digital way of displaying my rhymes 
And making these kind people pay a fine 
I've been through a lot, I deserve a lot, this work's fine I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion 
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses 
I'm more than a man, I've been died and rose again 
Left these holes in my hands, so you know who I am 
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata 
Yawk-yawk-yawk-yawk 
Stigamata, stigmata, stigmata From the fiery pits, on some Dead Poet's Society shit 
Here to bring you a variety mix 
Grab my dick, violently spit 
Cause I don't give a fuck about the type of shit 
Batty boys are wrong, get your vaginas wet 
And you shaking in your ballet shoes 
At the restaurant we valet twos, bad news 
Half moons on ten goons, uh 
On the four wheeler shredding up the sand dunes 
There's something wrong and that's quite clear 
I smell deception in the night's air 
That shit is sweeter than a ripe pear 
For your love, I cut my right ear I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion 
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses 
I'm more than a man, I've been died and rose again 
Left these holes in my hands, so you know who I am 
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata 
Yawk-yawk-yawk-yawk 
Stigamata, stigmata, stigmata Oh no, no, no they didn't 
Cause these ain't bars, these prisons 
Walk with me, every step I take in these Visvims 
Real rare breed, cut from the cloth like 
A phoenix feather when I write, molotov, yikes! 
You seen them flowers bloom, know that they grew in despair 
A blessing in disguise, nobody knew it was there 
My crown has been made, I just had to put it on 
Now I spread my wings and let the bird of dawning sing its song 
And when my grandpa died I broke down and cried 
But still I am more than a man, I am a God 
Sweetest still is pain amongst all of the thriller things 
I been through enough and so I need all of the iller things One of these days some simple soul will pick up the Book of God 
Read it, and will believe it 
Then the rest of us will be embarrassed
