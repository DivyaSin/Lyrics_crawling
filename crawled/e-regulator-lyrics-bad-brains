You tell me what to say and when to say it. you tell me what to do and how to do it. And if I ask you why, yoou'll arrest me. And if I call you lie, you'll detest me. You control what I'll be, you control who I see. And if I let you you'll control me. You're the man who owns all the keys to the stores. You're the man who always wants so much more. You're the regulator.
