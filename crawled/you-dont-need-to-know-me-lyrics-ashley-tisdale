[Chorus:] 
Oh-you don't need to know me 
I already got it all settled 
If you think 
You can remember 
My number.then 
Don't call me 
I don't want you here today Your time to shine you think that 
Well no your wrong 
Don't need a shoulder to cry on, 
Don't need somebody by my side 
I have a life and i 
Realy,realy wanna use it [Chorus] Now what you thinking of 
Hear what i got to say baby 
Tell me the truth(tell me the truth) 
And you'll find out what... [Chorus] (whispering) 
Oh baby baby baby baby 
Oh baby yeah 
Oh baby yeah [Chorus 2x]
