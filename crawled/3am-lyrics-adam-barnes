Give me another glass of spirit 
Let it slowly drown my soul 
It doesn't matter what is in it 
As long as my problems go 'Cause we can't wait around till morning 
For the bar is sure to close 
And we'll exaggerate the impact 
That it's been leaving on my steady cl But the warmth in my throat 
May not be as permanent as I once feared 
And the shadows on the stool 
Aren't as shy as they appear If I'm a drunk then please ignore me 
I wasn't there when times were bad 
You thought I never once adored my coldest feet 
And since ignored the only girl I ever truly had So take your coat and go 
You'll need it when it's colder 
Or stay with me tonight 
And watch me waste my only chance 
To hold her 
It's the only way to learn about mistakes you've made 
At 3 am 'Cause she has poise, she has thunder 
She speaks a love that's never shown 
And I'm not sure that she'll remember 
Those many nights she left me here alone 'Cause I'm a drunk and I deserved it 
There were more than subtle signs 
There's no reflection in the mirror 
What I once believed was here 
It's getting clear I struggle with my mind So take your coat and go 
You'll need it when it's colder 
Or stay with me tonight 
And watch me waste my only chance 
To hold her 
It's the only way 
to learn about mistakes you've made 
At 3 am Give me another glass of spirit 
Let it slowly drown my soul 
It doesn't matter what is in it 
As long as my problems go 
As long as my problems go
