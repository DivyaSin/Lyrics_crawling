1, 2, 3 and 4 more makes 7 
And 6 is afraid of 7, cause 7 ate 9! Nine was minding his business 
Talking to 10 about Gordy Howe's clothes 
Why 7 ate 9, nobody knows. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 
What about 9? 
Seven ate nine! Oh the cat'll have to live with eight lives now 
Ronaldo will have to make do 
Ever since seven ate 9 it seems 
I've got an extra finger and an extra toe too Seven ate nine! Once upon a time in our solar system 
We couldn't make do without 9 
But Pluto's not a planet now, so eight'll do fine. Oh the cat'll have to live with 8 lives now 
And the Chinese will be out of luck 
And the vampires will have to think of some other method 
Cause without their K-9's, how will they suck? Seven ate nine! 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 
What about nine? [Repeated x4] 
Seven ate nine!
