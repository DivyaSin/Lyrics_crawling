How to stay paralyzed by fear of abandonment 
How to defer to men in solvable predicaments 
How to control someone to be a carbon copy of you 
How to have that not work and have them run away from you How to keep people at arms-length and never get too close 
How to mistrust the ones you supposedly love the most 
How to pretend you're fine and don't need help from anyone 
How to feel worthless unless you're serving or helping someone [Chorus] 
I'll teach you all this in 8 easy steps 
In the course of a lifetime, you'll never forget 
I'll show you how to in 8 easy steps 
I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best How to hate women when you're supposed to be a feminist 
How to play all biased when you're really a hypocrite 
How to hate God when you're a prayer and a spiritualist 
How to sabotage your fantasies by fear of success [Chorus] I've been doing research for years 
I've been practicing my ass off 
I've been training my whole life for this moment, I swear to you 
Culminating just to be this well-versed leader before you [Chorus] How to lie to yourself and thereby to everyone else 
How to keep smiling when you're thinking of killing yourself 
How to know them all too well to avoid going within 
How to stay stuck in your life blaming them for everything [Chorus: x2]
