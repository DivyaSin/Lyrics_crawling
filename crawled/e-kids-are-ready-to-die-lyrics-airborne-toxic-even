All these inanimate places feel like there changing 
And the kids are lined up on the wall like they're ready to die 
His forms ascending me its like they just rearranged them 
We're all caged up like animals, questioned and ready to cry 'Cause I was just thirteen when I got my first taste of danger 
Standing by the church I had a bottle and a pen in my hand 
I said "father, I'm sorry, I just don't know what to do with this anger" 
And this behavior is correctable, I know this wasn't part of your plan Oh but punks like us we were always receiving instruction 
And you could burn our clothes you could wash out the ink and the dye 
But you can't look me in the eye and say you don't feel like a little destruction 
And the kids are lining up on the wall and they're ready to die 
And the kids are lined up on the wall and they're ready to die All these days just seem like they're getting longer 
The view from my room, its a gloomy and overcast gray 
The weakness we left it behind seems to be getting stronger 
I swear there's something in the air and I don't know what anyone could say
