Two sugars in my coffee cup 
Make it strong make it wake me up 
Put my boots on in the dark 
While I'm hoping that my car will start Working ten hours a day 
Another stack of bills to pay 
The job don't bother me no more 
There's three reasons 
That I'm working for Family Life 
Mortgage, two kids 
And a beautiful wife 
We ain't got much 
But we're good at getting by 
And you're looking 
At a man who's proud 
Yeah you're looking at a man 
Who's found where he wants to be 
Where he's meant to be 
Family life is alright with me Cooking bacon on a Sunday morn 
Grab a beer and then I mow the lawn 
Kids jumping on the trampoline 
My woman in her old blue jeans
