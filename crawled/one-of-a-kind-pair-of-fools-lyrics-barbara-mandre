He had the best of both worlds 
Yours and mine 
And I bet he's proud of himself 
The way he split his time Telling all his friends 
How good it feels to play both ends 
I'm sure in all of their eyes 
That you and I are One of a kind, a pair of fools 
Two women one man's been lying to 
You thought you were the only one, I thought I was too 
We're one of a kind, a pair of fools Honey, we could talk this out 
Like the best of friends 
But we're not to blame for the pain 
That, that man has put us in When we break the news 
That you know about me and I know about you 
After what he's done 
He better start to run from this One of a kind, a pair of fools 
Two women one man's been lying to 
You thought you were the only one, I thought I was too 
We're one of a kind, a pair of fools When we break the news 
That you know about me and I know about you 
After what he's done 
He better start to run from this One of a kind, a pair of fools 
Two women one man's been lying to 
You thought you were the only one, I thought I was too 
I guess we see now what blind love can do We're one of a kind, a pair of fools 
Two women one man's been lying to 
You thought you were the only one
