All the lazy summer days 
We'd sit and look for rainbows in the sky 
Trying to be like Zimmerman 
But ended up in Ziggy's band, we tried 
It's time to leave it all behind us 
It's time to leave it all behind This is what it's come to 
Think it's time to leave it all behind Imagine all the people sang 
A Lennon song, everybody crying 
All the lonely people who are lost 
Because they never said goodbye 
It's time to leave it all behind us 
It's to leave it all behind Love is all you need 
Everybody's heard the Beatles song 
But I'd rather listen to the Rolling Stones 
Anyday 
Love is all we need 
But love will make you bleed 
Anyway This is what it's come to 
Think it's time to leave it all It's time to leave it all behind us 
It's time to leave us all behind Love is all we need 
Everybody's heard the Beatles song 
But I'd rather listen to the Rolling Stones 
Anyday 
Love is all we need 
But love will make you bleed 
Love is not for me Love is all we need 
Love is all we need 
Love is all we need 
But love will make you bleed 
'Cause love is not for me 
For me
