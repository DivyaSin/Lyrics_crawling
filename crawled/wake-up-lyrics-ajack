INTRO 
Reppin' that city i'm from, Man i'm going so hard, You can bet I won't stop it 
Way that this music improving I swear that you think that i'm getting profits 
I'm still in my room with a mac and Garageband 
Whole city reach out like "AJACK you popping'" 
I'm really just rocking, 
Junky mic thats nothin' 
Verse 
When I reach out to you boy you thinkin' he somethin' 
Thats nothin' 
When I say that i'm the best, boy you know that i'm stuntin' 
But the truth is, I am really just huntin' for the top spot 
Tryna get a rolex, way i'm on the watch, 
And you know i'm on the watch (tick tick) 
Trilla J bout to spazz on this beat with his team 
We ain't never on repeat, Just watch us 
Now you playing us on repeat, that's nauseous, 
Nervous feeling in my stomach, that will never stop me 
Throw a punch in the ring, that's rocky, 
Fake friends see me out, they be like "AJACK whats popping" 
But before you were sleeping on me 
You must of forgot it X3 (woah) 
I swear you must of forgot it 
You were sleeping on me, 
You must of forgot 
Pre-Chorus 
They been sleeping on me all day now (all day now) 
They been sleeping on me they won't wait up (they won't wait up) 
They been sleeping on me all day now (all day now) 
They been sleeping on me they should wake up ( they should wake up) 
Chorus 
They should wake up, 
They should wait up for me, they should wake up (wake up) 
They should wait up for me, they should wake up (wake up) 
They should wait up for me, they should wake up (wake up) 
Bridge 
I been going so hard for this paper, 
They should quit sleeping i'm way up, (way way way way up) 
Going so hard getting paper, i'm way up 
Verse 
I am so way up, yeah, you are so way down 
I just get paper, yeah, you just get weighed down, 
you a featherweight boy, yeah, you are so lightweight 
I'm a heavyweight boy, don't get in my face, 
These rhymes that I'm spitting are way above your face 
Way above your head (way way way) 
Way above your head boy, (way way way) 
Way above your head (way way way) 
Chorus
