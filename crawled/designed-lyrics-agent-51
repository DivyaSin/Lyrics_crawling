Here I am a soldier, slowly sinkin' in the 
Quicksand of the past 
Got no recipe. Muffins won't rise 
And the margarine's goin' fast 
My walls are blue 
Colors won't with the red door still in sight 
I think of you 
The sky caves in and my eyes are stabbed with light 
Hurt me 
Hate me 
Help me 
Who's gonna save me? 
Walk a thousand paths and Babylon itches 
With the shifting of the social scale 
Like a castaway 
Rabbit yells back and the register rings "no sale." 
Don't nail the lid 
I'm still breathin' and my heartbeat's goin' fast 
Not givin' in 
Maybe I'll get lucky and I'll find 
Inner peace at last 
What's my destiny 
Whoa no that can't be 
Just look and you'll see 
Want self sufficiency 
Whoa no that can't be 
What's my destiny 
Slavin' to the grind, workin' overtime 
Whoa no it can't be
