* heavy breathing * 
Check this out man 
All this gym shit 
Runnin around for a scholarship 
Ain't even my style man 
I don't even know what the fuck I'm doin in this shit 
Bout to get the fuck up out of this shit 
Ain't even with this [akinyele] 
Me play sports? don't place your bet 
I'm not the type of guy to run up and down and break out in a sweat 
I just make the words sound hip 
I leave it up to jane fonda, to take care of that physical fit shit 
Nothin wrong with bein overweight, everything straight 
So long as my pockets stay in shape 
I never participated in gym 
I hated the thought, to even have to take a loss to begin 
They say health brings you longevity 
But I'm not one for that extra-curriculum activity 
You might see the ak, with a baseball hat 
Won't see me on no field with no baseball bat 
In case some nigga head, got to get cracked 
Other than that, I don't plan to run track 
Picture me joggin for miles.. hah! 
Come on kid, that's just not my style 
I just talk to girls on the horn 
You won't see the ak upstairs, puttin no butter on his corns 
Another athlete bites the dust 
Another nigga from egypt, make egyptian musk 
Picture me wearin pro keds, runnin the full court 
Don't jump out your basket-ass head 
I just cool around the block and hold down the fort 
Straight up and down nigga, I'm not a good sport * rob swift cuts "exercise" * [akinyele] 
Don't throw your soccer balls this way 
The name is akinyele, not no motherfuckin pele 
Baseballs is what I'm not with 
So don't hand me no catcher's mitt, cause I ain't catchin shit! 
The only time I slide and run, is after a murder's done 
I get ghost before the homicide come! 
But that's a different subject - that's called games of death 
When your man play russian roulette while upset 
He can't handle it, he wants to stop it 
He grabs the hammer and cock it, but that's a whole different topic 
I just throw my voice on plastic 
You won't see me wrasslin in no arena, gettin my ass kicked 
Or better yet boxin in, some ring with gloves 
Talkin about pst pst losin oxygen 
You know the whole blase-blasah, the ak saga 
I'm quick, to run your shit like a jogger 
Huh! I don't carry no stopclock 
I knock the j off of jock, so you can just call me ak! 
Yeah, it's just that simple son 
On my spare time, I be rackin bitches up, at the wimbledon 
But I'm not one for tennis 
Nor breakin no sport records in the world book of guinness 
I just cool around the block and hold down the fort 
Straight up and down nigga, I'm not a good sport * rob swift cuts "exercise" * [akinyele] 
Me jumpin over fences, don't make sense kid 
On a hot day, you'll find me coolin on the benches 
And you could ask me where the water's at 
But don't come ask me to act, like no motherfuckin quarterback 
Shoulder pads and helmet, yeah right 
Talkin that hut one, hut two, hut three, hike - psych! 
I'm poetic, while dealin with the alphabetic 
Not athletic, that's why I don't sweat it 
So you can keep your sports on hold 
Fuck soccer, the shit that I kick, yo it's bound to go gold 
I just cool around the block and hold down the fort 
I just cool around the block and hold down the fort 
I just cool around the block and hold down the fort 
Straight up and down nigga, I'm not a good sport * slow scratching, heavy breathing * 
Uh-uh, I'm the fuck out 
I ain't with this shit 
Find the nigga, blow the whistle man
