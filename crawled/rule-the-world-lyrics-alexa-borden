I could rule the world in this highest tree 
Thrusting to the sky would you climb up for me? 
Cause we could rule the world honey 
I could be deceiving if you want me to be 
I could be everything if you just ask kindly 
I could be your girl I could rule the world 
I could rule the world I bet you want me I could be explosive unexpectedly 
Bursting to the sky like a cherry bomb tree 
I could blow this world 
I could be deadly I could be, I could be 
And I could be anything if you just say please 
Cause I wanna be your girl honey I could rule the world 
I could rule the world I bet you want me now I could rule the world 
I could rule the world 
I could rule the world 
I could rule the world I bet you want me now
