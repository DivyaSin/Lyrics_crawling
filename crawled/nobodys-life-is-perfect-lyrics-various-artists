This ain't a song for the broken hearted 
No silent prayer for the faith departed 
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd 
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out aloud It's my life! 
It's now or never 
I ain't gonna live forever 
I just wanna live while I'm alive 
It's my life! Nobody's Perfect! 
I gotta work it! 
Again and again 'til I get it right 
Nobody's Perfect! 
You live and you learn it! 
And if I mess it up sometimes... 
Nobody's perfect It's my life! 
It's now or never 
I ain't gonna live forever 
I just wanna live while I'm alive 
It's my life!
