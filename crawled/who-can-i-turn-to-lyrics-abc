If only I could stand 
On my own two feet 
Oh honey, then I`d know 
Life could be so sweet Someone to drive 
Someone to blame 
Someone to rush through my veins 
Someone to wash it all away * Who can I turn to now 
If not you, tell me 
Who can I turn to 
If not you If I could get 
What I want for free 
Then I wouldn't have to borrow 
Take a tranquillizer 
From your limousine driver 
before we crash into tomorrow Someone to love 
Someone to hold me 
Someone so courageous 
Someone to drag me in from the cold (* repeat 3 times) 
Who can I turn to (tell me who) 
Who`s gonna be there (if not you) 
Tell me who (tell me) 
Tell me who (tell me) 
Tell me who 
Tell me who can I turn to 
(if not you) 
Ooh (tell me who) 
You've got to, you've got to 
Tell me who
