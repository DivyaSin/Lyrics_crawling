Give me half the chance 
I'll make you understand 
That what I got to give 
Is so much more that this 
Than you'll ever know I don't say what's on my mind 
But you'll find this out in time 
Don't always open up 
I'm not quick to trust 
And let someone inside I've got a lot to learn 
Never felt this way before 
But I gotta see what's right for me You should know that I can 
Be more than you will ever need 
I'll show you something new to see 
I'll be the one you can believe 
I'll be one better, yeah 
I'll be one better You've seen some falling stars 
You felt a broken heart 
Time is all it takes 
Learn from my mistakes 
Know exactly what you are 
But I can't hang on the side 
I've had enough of all these fights 
Gotta give to you 
Gotta get this through Till' you realize 
I've got a lot to learn 
Never felt this way before 
But I gotta say what's right for me You should know that I can 
Be more than you will ever need 
I'll show you something new to see (yeah) 
I'll be the one you can believe 
I'll be one better, yeah I won't back down (no never, no never) 
You don't have to be alone 
Girl, alone (oooh, oooh) no (oh) You should know that I can 
Be more than you will ever need 
I'll show you something new to see 
I'll be the one you can believe 
I'll be one better (oh)
