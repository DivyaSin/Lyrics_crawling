I've bowed out from this, can I say I'm sick 
And now it's time for me to stand up and make you hear me 
This world you rob innocence, you never gave us a chance 
We were born believing you had all the answers for me Look out, you will find out 
That here I am so far from them so I take my chances 
'Cause I don't live for you 
And I'll say what I have to 
So, who cares, who cares, who cares of what I do If we don't speak, who will? 
If we don't fight, we're still 
Stuck without a voice 
And we are tired of being silenced Look out, you will find out 
That here I am so far from them so I take my chances 
'Cause I don't live for you 
And I'll say what I have to 
So, who cares, who cares, who cares of what I do We are set apart 
We've been chosen now 
We are children of the God 
So what holds us back? 
What's holding us back? Yeah So, I take my chances 
'Cause I don't live for you 
And I?ll say what I have to 
So, who cares, who cares, who cares of what I do
