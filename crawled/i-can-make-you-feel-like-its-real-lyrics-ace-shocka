This is a recall, you can be my default 
Girl I'm all in it 
Vacuum packed authentic (oh yeah) I don't need no other reason 
Gave myself a new design, but my vision colorblind 
Swear I'm all in it 
I'm all in it [Pre chorus] I don't want to waste your time, I 
I get so lost when I'm all up inside of your eyes, I 
Couldn't have sworn that I lost you back there but I'm done [Verse 2] I don't want it to break this time (oh no) 
How could I mistake this time? (oh no) 
I want to change your mind, baby [Pre chorus] [Chorus] I can make you feel 
Like it's real 
Darling I can make you feel 
Like it's real [Verse 2] Oh we stay 
Ridin', ridin' ridin' ridin' round

Ridin', ridin' ridin' ridin' round 
(ridin', ridin' ridin' ridin' round) 
Oh I been getting dizzy from the sound 
Oh we stay 
Running, running, running, running 'round (Running, runnin' runnin' runnin' round) 
Running, running, running, running 'round (Running, runnin' runnin' runnin' round) 
Oh I been getting dizzy from the sound, oh oh [Pre chorus] [Chorus] x2 [Outro] Darling I can make you feel

(I don't believe we've had the pleasure?) 
Are you sure? 
(I think I would remember meeting a handsome, I mean, important man like you) For Naomi (What's your name?) 
Hazel 
(No, what's your full name?) 
Hazel Grace Lancaster (Will you tell me your real name? Finally, please?) 
(Why are you lying to me?) There's so much in a name and so much more in you
