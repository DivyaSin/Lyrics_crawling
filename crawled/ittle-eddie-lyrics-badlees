There are nights when I'm in my bed 
Fear, like a freight train, runnin' through my head 
Watch a man in the county seat 
Bring a gavel down and he looks like me Little Eddie stares at the corn all day 
He says, "wonder how God makes it grow that way" 
They say, "watch that weird kid wase away his life 
He's one of those Kline boys and you know what they're like" Ooh, take me away to another world that doesn't think that way 
Ooh, take me away to another world Last September, it was late one night 
Eddie's on a hilltop and he's listening to a fight 
Finds a young girl, well, she's younger than most 
Left with a blank stare, given up her ghost He touches her lips and shuts her eyes 
Pulls the knife out and begins to cry 
Look at Eddie standing in the moonlight 
That weird little kid's got a switchblade knife Ooh, take me away to another world that doesn't think that way The hour arrives and the time is at hand 
Eddie gets up and he walks off the stand 
Stares at the jury sitting row by row 
Wonders why god ever let them grow Ooh take me away to another world that doesn't think that way
