There's a summer moon shining through my room 
Just like it did that night 
You laid me down we tossed and turned 
We bathed in that blue light 
I was gone as it gets with the touch of your lips 
We were burning like fire flies 
Just when I thought l was over you girl it's July If only I could make it through this time of year 
With every day like a souvenir 
From the places we went 
And the love we were in 
Over and over and over again 
Your in my blood your in my thoughts 
Every corner I turn every street I walk 
Every time I drive by the coast your ghost appears 
This time of year I still dream about those cut off jeans 
And your pretty pink sunburnt cheeks 
That big winter snow we spent by the fire 
Yeah we just made love all week 
I wished you'd call when the leaves start to fall 
And the showers come down in May 
Every time the seasons change I say
