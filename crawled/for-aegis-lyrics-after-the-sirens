I thought of writing you a song 
in a tired repetition 
of the words I meant to sing you all along 
but never did. I have some great appreciation 
for lunar tides and roses 
and my heart always intends to beat for you 
but rarely does. Well, here are fingers 
that have reached for 
anything they've wanted; 
how often have they broken in the door? 
And here are wings that I unfolded 
at the bottom of an ocean 
and wondered how I never left the floor. I always gravitate toward comfort 
but I'd kill for my convictions 
so long as you don't ever make me move. 
You always do.
