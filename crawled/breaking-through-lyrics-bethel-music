Your love is like a sunrise 
Shattering the dark of night 
Your presence is a paradise 
To our hearts You're filling all the world with light 
You're making every wrong thing right 
You're waking up the dead to life with your love God you're always breaking though the dark 
Breaking into lives and healing hearts 
Your love has torn the veil 
Your love can never fail 
Your love is making all things new Your love is an eternal fire 
A jealous and pure desire 
Strong enough to be the sacrifice 
That set me free You have taken all our sins away 
You have risen and won the day 
You have broken every bond and chain in Your love So we lift up one voice 
We lift up one voice 
We sing and we shout for joy For now we are Yours 
Yes our hearts are Yours 
You ransomed us with your blood
