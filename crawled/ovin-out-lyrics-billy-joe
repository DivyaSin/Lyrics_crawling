Anthony works in the grocery store 
Savin' his pennies for someday 
Mama Leone left a note on the door 
She said 
"Sonny, move out to the country" 
Workin' too hard can give me 
A heart attack (ack) 
You oughta know by now (oughta know) 
Who needs a house out in Hackensack? 
Is that what you get with your money? It seems such a waste of time 
If that's what it's all about 
If that's movin' up then I'm movin' out Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat 
At night he becomes a bartender 
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down 
On Sullivan Street 
Across from the medical center 
He's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac 
You oughta know by now 
And if he can't drive 
With a broken back 
At least he can polish the fenders It seems such a waste of time 
If that's what it's all about 
If that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
