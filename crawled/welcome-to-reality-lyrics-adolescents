Blood so deep the horse must hold his head up high 
In the valley of deceision third of the world wiil die 
Beat your hoes and plows into axes and spears 
As the armys meet in a battle they predict for years [Chorus] 
Let the weak say I'm a warrior bring down the warrior 
Let the faithless regain faith 
Your faith is hopeless The prophets and the psychics and the military agree 
Continual world war crisis leads us straight to world war three 
Roll the red carpet let the angel of death ride in 
To the valley of the valley of decesion let the mayhem begin [Chorus]
