I'm sitting here lookin at your body 
Baby baby baby 
I've never seen something so beautiful here 
Lately lately lately 
I love tha way tha candles are bringing out you're skin tone 
Baby baby baby 
Don't ever put you're clothes on again stay buttnaked 
Baby baby baby I love the way you sound 
When I let you in 
That sweet low moaning 
( you look so good imma sing it again ) I'm sitting here lookin at your body 
Baby baby baby 
I've never seen something so beautiful here 
Lately lately lately 
I love tha way tha candles are bringing out you're skin tone 
Baby baby baby 
Don't ever put you're clothes on again stay buttnaked 
Baby baby baby The neighbors are gonna damn sure hear us tonight 
I know your gonna do some eatin at my table tonight 
Your bodys so banging you don't need no protection tonight 
( Did I just say that? Yes I Did) I'm sitting here lookin at your body 
Baby baby baby 
I've never seen something so beautiful here 
Lately lately lately 
I love tha way tha candles are bringing out you're skin tone 
Baby baby baby 
Don't ever put you're clothes on again stay buttnaked 
Baby baby baby I love the way you sound 
When I let you in 
That sweet low moaning
