*** introduction: E / bm / f#m :|| *** verse 1: Well I guess you got your friend 
Some friend to take me down 
Was it getting on your nerves 
Just knowing I'm around 
It wasn't enough, it's never 
Enough for you to merely be unkind 
But turning the screw, here if I were you 
Might be a hobby not to find *** chorus: 'cause I have got the truth on my side 
And that's the one thing you can't abide 
You couldn't make that scene if you tried 
Bearing down is easy, just a word and 
Watch your little house divide *** verse 2: I've got a little secret 
Others will concur 
Some people are too stupid 
As you thought they were 
Including of course, the one you were 
Rest assured would never make a stand 
But battles get lost, when one extra push 
Is all you need to tip your hand *** chorus: 'cause I have got the truth on my side 
And that's the one thing you can't abide 
You couldn't make that scene if you tried 
Bearing down is easy, just a word and 
Watch your little house divide *** bridge: You better pray, the lies you have going 
Can keep from owing much more than you do 
'cause the debt just gets bigger 
And one day I figure 
Someone will be calling it due *** verse 4: (instrumental) 
.

And I will admit, I'd like to commit to 
Tearing down [the wall] I see 
But why raise a hand, when I know the 
End is coming soon enough with-out me *** chorus: 'cause I have got the truth on my side 
And that's the one thing you can't abide 
You couldn't make that scene if you tried 
Bearing down is easy, just a word and 
Watch your little house divide *** coda:
