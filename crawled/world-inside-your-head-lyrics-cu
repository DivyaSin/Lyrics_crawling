Take the world inside your head 
Take the world inside your head 
Feel it better when you're dead 
Take the world inside your head Inside, worlds collide 
I get clues 
Rights to choose 
Who I'll be 
Suddenly I am home 
Away from home Take the world inside your head 
Take the world inside your head 
Feel it better when you're dead 
Take the world inside your head Take the world inside your head 
Take the world inside your head 
Take the world inside your head 
Take the world inside your head
