I met up with an acrobat 
In Brooklyn or some place like that 
With life and taxis flying past 
We tore that dance hall down Pocket change and subway cars 
Our big ideas filled empty bars 
You might be from the moon or mars 
Either way, I'm never going home So, lets hang an anchor from the sun 
There's a million city lights but You're number one 
You're the reason I'm still 
Up at dawn 
Just to see your face 
We'll be going strong 
With the vampires, baby 
We belong, we belong awake Swinging from the fire escape I was drinking from the wishing well 
Some junkie metal-head hotel 
When we boarded the carousel 
The roof was caving in On the stage my Oxblood friend 
Was singing songs about the end 
The bankers in the lion's den 
Were dropping lines like beggars in the snow So, lets hang an anchor from the sun 
There's a million city lights but You're number one 
You're the reason I'm still 
Up at dawn 
Just to see your face 
We'll be going strong 
With the vampires, baby 
We belong, we belong awake Swinging from the fire escape 
Swinging from the fire escape 
Swinging from the fire escape Walking home your hand in mine 
Tattoos on the river line 
The morning birds are taking flight 
Either way I thought that you should know You're my number one 
You're the reason I'm still 
Up at dawn 
Just to see your face 
We'll be going strong 
With the vampires, baby 
We belong, we belong awake Swinging from the fire escape 
Swinging from the fire escape 
Swinging from the fire escape 
Swinging from the fire escape
