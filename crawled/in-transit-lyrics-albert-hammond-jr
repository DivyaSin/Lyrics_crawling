Free from it all 
I'm not gonna change till I want to 
And I'm free from it all 
I'm not gonna change till I want to By the way she looked, I should've calmed down 
I went too far, oh, that's all I've got to say 
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down 
I went too far, oh, that's all I've got to say Free from it all 
I'm not gonna change till I want to 
And I'm free from the world 
Where I've built too many roads By the way she looked, I should've calmed down 
I went too far, oh, that's all I've got to say 
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down 
I went too far, oh, I went too far
