It's three in the morning 
You're nowhere in sight 
And all that I wanted was 
To be with you 
Tonight 
I've watched love get closer 
And then fade away 
I've seen you believe in me 
I've seen you trying to stay 
But what good is holding on 
When you know 
That all you can think about 
Is letting go 
They say if you love someone 
Then set them free 
If they come back again 
Then in the end 
It was meant to be 
I thought we were lovers 
I thought we were friends 
I guess when reality 
Steps in 
The dreaming ends 
We live for the future 
We learn from the past 
No matter how hard we try 
Some good things never last 
All you can think about 
Is letting go 
Be true to yourself my love 
That's all I ever wanted you to be 
Just don't forget to smile 
When you think of me 
I'll reach for the stars 
I have got them in sight 
There's someone who really needs me 
Out there in the night 
We'll live for the future 
We'll learn form the past 
No matter how hard we try 
Some good things never last 
Why can't they last?
