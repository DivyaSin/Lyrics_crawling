Desert highway to a memory, I said that I'd come back for you 
By the jukebox at the starlight grill, kickin' out an Elvis tune 
Are you waitin', little sister, killin' time and dreamin' too 
You need a fraction of long distance love, I'm driving all night for you, yeah I'm gonna be there in a big way, you can leave the radio on 
Like an outlaw, like Jesse James, another hundred miles is gone 
Sunrise to sundawn, I'm gonna turn you around, yeah Baby I've been so lonely, what am I s'pposed to do 
Out in the sun with passion, out of my head for you 
Baby my heart's a mustang, just let it run its course 
Take it up by the river, I'm gonna give you more Ride the rockin' horse, hey, ride the rockin' horse, yeah 
Got the top down, wishin' on a star, underneath the Spanish moon 
Golden Earring on the radio, radar love is coming through 
She's a station on the interstate, I'm coming with a message of love 
In the saddle, you can ride all night, rock your reins around my glove, yeah Sunrise to sundawn, I'm gonna turn you around, yeah 
Baby I've been so lonely, what's a man s'pposed to do 
Out in the sun with passion, out of my head for you 
Proof papa's got the fever, just let it run its course 
Take it up by the river, I'm gonna give you more Ride the rockin' horse, hey, ride the rockin' horse Baby I've been so, baby I've been so, baby I've been so lonely 
(Ride the rockin' horse) Lo-lo-lo-lo-lonely, lonely, yeah 
Baby I've been so, out of my head for you, whoah (ride the rockin' horse) 
Baby I've been so lonely, baby baby baby (ride the rockin' horse) 
Babe I've been so lonely, what am I gonna do, thank you New York (Ride the rockin' horse) (repeats out)
