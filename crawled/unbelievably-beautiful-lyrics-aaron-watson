Whenever she walks flowers grow in her footsteps 
Whenever she talks all the birds hush their singing 
The heart of a saint and the face of an angel 
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful And when this cruel world's been gettin' me down 
She'll take my frown and she'll turn it back around 
Like a clown, she'll crack a joke 
Acting crazy as a fool 
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful (Chorus) It'd be a big old fat lie, if I said I 
Wasn't turned on just by her looks alone 
She's so much more, so much more than meets the eye 
She's an angel on loan from up above
