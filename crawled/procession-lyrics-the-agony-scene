The stench of the hopeless and wounded 
The cries that escape from the depths of regret 
A bleeding, mass in procession 
That fell on the path from which it strayed A whisper in total darkness 
To die at the hands of what we are 
A breath escapes from the lifeless 
The blind and the feeble of our decay This is the pain we must suffer.. 
This is the endless agony.. 
This is the darkest of secrets.. 
We give our lives to keep The light that's surrounding 
I am all that you've made me 
Their endless desire 
Feeds the fire inside me 
And all I can ask for 
Take this life that you gave me 
I'm not your messiah.. The fear that grows like a cancer 
Held like a breath and sacrificed 
The blood that flows from the wounded 
Consumed by the masses who've longed to taste This is a prayer for the hopeless.. 
This is an endless tragedy.. 
This is the darkest of secrets.. 
We give ourselves to keep The light that's surrounding 
I am all that you've made me 
Their endless desire 
Feeds the fire inside me 
And all I can ask for 
Take this life that you gave me 
I'm not your messiah.. I pray for redemption 
These unanswered cries 
In darkness it came to me, 
And I breathe 
The distant voices sing to me 
And everything changes suddenly 
And i.. The light that's surrounding 
I am all that you've made me 
Their endless desire 
Feeds the fire inside me 
And all I can ask for 
Take this life that you gave me 
I'm not your messiah.. The life that's surrounding 
I am all that you've made me 
Their endless desire 
Feeds the fire inside me 
And I didn't ask for 
Take this life that you gave me 
I'm not your messiah..
