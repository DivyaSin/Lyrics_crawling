I've got a problem 
and it's all named after you (all named after you) 
I tried to solve it 
but I never could get through 
you run around like you're some kind of king 
sitting on a throne of diamonds 
people kissing your ring 
if you want my opinion 
i think you need a shrink 
there's no gain in misery I've got a problem 
and it always ends the same (always ends the same) 
your whining never stops 
like a dog left in the rain 
you talk to me like i'm some kind of joke 
if insults cost money 
you'd be going for broke 
I've learned to tune out 
all the lies that you spoke 
you tied your own rope for every time you try to get away 
for every time you try to run and hide 
this is an answer for all of the years 
I've spent living in silence If you hate me 
HEY 
throw up your hands 
If you hate me 
HEY 
throw up your hands 
If you hate me 
HEY 
throw up your hands 
throw up your hands 
cause I'm not changing 
If you hate me 
HEY 
throw up your hands 
If you hate me 
HEY 
throw up your hands 
If you hate me 
HEY 
throw up your hands 
throw up your hands 
cause I'm not changing I've got an issue 
with the way you seem to make (way you seem to make) 
everything about yourself 
like I'm an actor in your take 
but now the cameras roll 
and paybacks the fashion 
no time for make up 
lights camera action 
come to find out you're the latest attraction 
typecast and getting old for every time you try to get away 
for every time you try to run and hide 
this is an answer for all of the years 
you've spent ruining people's lives If you hate me 
HEY

HEY

throw up your hands 
cause I'm not gonna change I won't apologize 
That part of me has died 
I've been doing fine 
And after this I'll leave you behind 
you were never right 
cause I've been doing fine 
without you in my life 
and after this i'll leave you behind If you hate me
