I'm going out to get some air will you join me 
I want to feel the wind on my face will you join me Let my hair fall on my shoulders 
Let the sun shine on my skin 
I dreamt too much last night 
And then I couldn't sleep 
Worries got a hold of me Suffocating me I have no dignity 
Only God can see me 
But men they oppress me Suffocating me I have no dignity 
Only God can see me 
But men they oppress me Hiding me in the folds of my clothes 
I was once, full of milk and honey 
The ground dries up, beneath my feet 
I'm eating dust I want to breath I dreamt too much last night 
And then I couldn't sleep 
Worries got a hold of me Suffocating me I have no dignity 
Only God can see me 
But men they oppress me 
Men they oppress me Suffocating me I have no dignity 
Only God can see me 
But men they oppress me Suffocating me I have no dignity 
Only God can see me 
But men they oppress me 
Men they oppress me 
Suffocating me Suffocating me I have no dignity 
Only God can see me 
But men they oppress me 
Men they oppress me 
Suffocating me
