In the fright night he comes to your mind 
He is searching for something that he find 
With you 
He's a man, he's a monster, is a Ghoul 
He is a Ghoul 
Ghoul He's a corpse-eater but you're not dead 
And if he doesn't find a dead body he eats a rat 
But he wants you 
He's a man, he's a monster, is a Ghoul 
He is a Ghoul 
Ghoul As you're still alive he comes at night 
And when you see his grimace you're afraid 
And he kills you 
He's a man, he's a monster, is a Ghoul 
He is a Ghoul 
Ghoul And when you're dead he is drinking your red blood 
Eats your flesh, sucks your eyes, lick your sweat - but 
He has not enough yet 
He's a man, he's a monster, is a Ghoul 
He is a Ghoul 
Ghoul 
Ghoul
