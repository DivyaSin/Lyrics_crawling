Tell me where am I supposed to go? 
And who am I supposed to believe. 
If only you knew what I knew. 
Then you could see just what I see. So I grab my bags and go, as far away as I can go. 
Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
And I try to hide, 
But I just can't hide no more. 
There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost. You say I look fine, 
If only you knew what's on my mind. 
You'd see a whole different side, 
I couldn't show you even if I tried. 
I must have got lost in time 
When I found out I was only free to be, 
Wherever I want to be. Some say I'm out of sight, 
How ironic and that we're all so blind. 
If you could open up your eyes, 
You could see what I couldn't describe. 
And then, you'd see the signs, 
And then your soul would be set free, 
And then you'd be released. So I grab my bags and go, as far away as I can go. 
Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
And I try to hide, 
But I just can't hide no more. 
There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost. Tell me where am I supposed to go. 
And who am I supposed to believe. 
If only you knew what I knew. 
Then you could see. (Hey) So I grab my bags and go, as far away as I can go. 
Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
And I try to hide, 
But I just can't hide no more. 
There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost. And I'm terrified, like I've seen a U-F-O. 
Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
(ain't what I used to know) 
And I try to hide (try to hide) 
But I just can't hide no more. 
There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost. (I go) 
(A U-F-O) 
(And I'm so tired of hiding, 
I've been running, I've been trying, to get away, to get away) So I grab my bags and go, as far away as I can go. 
Cause everything ain't what I used to know. 
And I try to hide, 
But I just can't hide no more. 
There's nothing worse than feeling like a ghost.
