Ain't it good to have someone to talk to someone you can trust and be proud of 
Ain't it good to know he needs you and always does his best to please you 
Ain't it good just be in love 
Nights are never cold since I've got strong arms to hold me 
Warm lips to kiss me and I feel so good inside 
And when you say you love me it makes everything better 
I just can't get enough of you 
Ain't it good to have someone to talk to... 
[ steel ] 
When it's time for loving you know just how to touch me 
You never rush me and I feel so satisfied 
And I can hardly wait to feel your arms wrapped around me 
And let the love surround me one more time 
Ain't it good to have someone to talk to... 
Ain't it good just be in love
