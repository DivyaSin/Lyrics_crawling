The wheels on the bus go round and round 
Round and round, round and round 
The wheels on the bus go round and round 
All through the town The doors on the bus go open and shut 
Open and shut, open and shut 
The doors on the bus go open and shut 
All through the town The people on the bus go up and down 
Up and down, up and down 
The people on the bus go up and down 
All through the town The babies on the bus go wah, wah, wah 
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,wah 
The babies on the bus go wah, wah, wah 
All through the town
