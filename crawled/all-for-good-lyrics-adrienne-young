It's just one more day out of my life 
Gone for good, gone for good 
I keep turning over in my mind 
Did I get it right, right this time? Worry's only ever in your mind 
In mine all the time 
What I'd give to be a bird in flight 
Rapid climb, natural line Plain as day, choices made Why can't I let go? I'll always wonder 
All this surrounds me. Why do I hunger? 
I am a river, forever changing 
Struggle is perfect. All that is here is for good What has happened to the days when I 
Would wake and smile like a child? 
Every day a precious open book 
Yet another chance I always took But as I watch my complications rise 
I realize, I decide 
Simple slow and easy is the flow 
That moves with grace, this I know Choices made, plain as day Why can't I let go? I'll always wonder 
All this surrounds me. Why do I hunger? 
I am a river, forever changing 
Struggle is perfect, all that is here is for good Now as I let go I sit in wonder 
If all this surrounds me, I question my hunger 
I am a river, forever changing so 
Struggle is perfect and all that is here is for good
