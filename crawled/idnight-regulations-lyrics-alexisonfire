I find myself concerned 
For the common man, these days 
Evil are the minds 
That push the divide 
Forced to live a life 
In fear that his future is on the wane 
Midnight regulations 
Midnight regulations 
Burned his candle down 
Working to make ends meet 
But what can be done 
About the way things have become 
Fingers to the bone 
Ready to admit defeat

Midnight Brother! There is no charity 
For the common man 
When he is in need of relief And now he's hanging on 
To his final stitch of faith 
So, here's to all the years 
Of deaf ear fallen prayers 
Rich men behind closed doors 
Are trying to keep him in his place

Oh, all you common men 
You need to fight for a new way 
Old hearts, we need to mend 
It's time to start again 
Palace walls dismantled 
Brick by brick, you will have your day 
Midnight regulations 
Midnight Brother! There is no charity 
For the common man 
When he is in need of relief They say just to hold onto your hope 
But you know if you swallow your pride 
You will choke Brother! There is no charity (there is no charity) 
For the common man 
When he is in need of relief (when he is in need) 
Brother! 
Brother! 
Men! 
Men!
