I was young and didn't have no where to run 
I needed to wake up and see what's in front of me 
There has to be a better way, sing it again now 
Better way to show I'm grateful So I thought up this song to show my appreciation for lovin' me so long 
You don't know how much you mean to me 
'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned away 
You were right there and I thank you (thank you) When I felt I had enough you never turned away 
You were right there and I thank you (thank you) 
Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, bop 
Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, bop 
Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, bop 
Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, bop bop All through my life I knew that you'd be my world 
Knowing every where I go, things you taught me, they would show 
So many times and changes you've seen me through 
I sure 'nough couldn't have survived without you, you And so I thought up this song to show my appreciation for lovin' me so long 
You don't know how much you mean to me 
'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned away 
You were right there and I thank you (thank you) When I felt I had enough you never turned away 
You were right there and I thank you (thank you) 
'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned away 
You were right there and I thank you (thank you) 
When I felt I had enough you never turned away 
You were right there and I thank you (thank you) 'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned away 
You were right there and I thank you (thank you) 
When I felt I had enough you never turned away 
You were right there and I thank you (thank you) 'Cause even though when times got rough, you never turned away 
You were right there and I thank you (thank you)
