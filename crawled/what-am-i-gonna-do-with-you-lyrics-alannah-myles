Everything happens for a reason 
All our rivers run to the sea 
Every last emotion has its season 
Who knows which one brought you to me? You struck me like a match 
And I had to burn 
You found a deeper part of me What am I gonna do about the way that I feel? 
How do I shake the weight of everything that I have been? 
It's so hard to fall after all that's fallen through 
What am I gonna do with you? The whole world's hanging on this heartbeat 
And the angle of your smile 
I can only hold back for so long 
Lemme know you for a while Well, love is like a flood 
And there ain't no end in sight 
Coming from a deeper part of me So what am I gonna do about the way that I feel? 
How do I shake the weight of everything that I have been? 
It's so hard to fall after all that's fallen through 
What am I gonna do with you? Oh, love is like a flood 
And there ain't no end in sight 
Coming from a deeper part of me So what am I gonna do about the way that I feel? 
How do I shake the weight of everything that I have been? 
It's so hard to fall after all that's fallen through 
What am I gonna do with you? 
What am I gonna do with you?
