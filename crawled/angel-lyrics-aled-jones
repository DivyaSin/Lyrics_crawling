Hark! The herald angels sing, 
"Glory to the new-born King; 
Peace on earth, and mercy mild, 
God and sinners reconciled!" 
Joyful, all ye nations, rise. 
Join the triumph of the skies. 
With angelic hosts proclaim, 
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!" 
Hark! the herald angels sing, 
"Glory to the new-born King." Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace, 
Hail, the Son of Righteousness 
Light and life to all he brings, 
Risen with healing in his wings. 
Mild he lays his glory by 
Born that man no more may die 
Born to raise the sons of earth 
Born to give them second birth. 
Hark, the herald-angels sing, 
"Glory to the new-born King!" Christ, by highest heaven adored, (Christ is the) 
Christ the everlasting Lord, (Everlasting Lord) 
Late in time behold him come, (Late in time behold him) 
Offspring of the Virgin's womb 
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, (Veiled in flesh the Godhead) 
Hail, the incarnate Deity (Sing with heaven "Hail, the Deity") 
Pleased as man with men to dwell, 
Jesus our Emmanuel. 
Hark, the herald-angels sing, Fall on your knees, 
O hear the angel voices! 
O night divine, 
O night when Christ was born! 
O night divine, O night, 
O night divine!
