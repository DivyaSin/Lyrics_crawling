Shiver me timbers, blow me away in a dead mans hat 
Scatter my bones in a Singapore alleyway 
Ill hang my head in a Hong Kong wind and hum a homesick song 
A cigarette burning on the tip of my tongue 
When the ship pulls into harbor 
And the moth burns its wings and falls 
Incense burning in the dragonfly room come sit on my knee 
Mumble unknown Oriental words 
Shadows dance from the candles and the sandalwood taste of skin 
So hot tonight the air is as heavy as gauze 
When the ship pulls into harbor 
And the moth burns its wings and falls 
Man underwater -- Im here in the belly of the beast 
Man underwater -- Im choking on an invisible feast 
Got rolled last night by a shadow who cut my lip with a stone 
Woke in the gutter with blood on my chinnie chin chin 
Made it back to the ship and the groan of the hawser pulling at the wharf 
Pulled a sliver of glass from my hand 
Man underwater -- Im here in the belly of the beast 
Man underwater -- Im choking on an invisible feast 
So kiss me again, you know I spent good money for this 
Ill slip into you like the mainland mists at dawn 
Ill crush your lips are as hot and sweet as the milk of my mothers love 
Shes dead and denied but youre still young and firm 
Man underwater -- Im here in the belly of the beast 
Man underwater -- Im choking on an invisible feast 
Man underwater -- Im here in the belly of the beast 
Man underwater -- Im choking on an invisible feast 
On an invisible feast ... on an invisible feast ... on an invisible feast
