Silver scents of Saint Augustine 
Fire in the ground 
Between my better teeth 
We're dancing on the poison in their graves 
At the end of the night 
We'd all seen better days I know you tried 
I know you're cursed 
I know your best was still your worst 
When Hollywood was calling out your name If I stayed behind 
Would you let your hair grow? 
I will forget 
The favors that you owe 
I'm dreaming of car wrecks and thunderstorms bright 
Let's bury ourselves 
And go haunt someone tonight I know you tried 
I know you're cursed 
I know your best was still your worst 
When Hollywood was calling out your name 
Saint Augustine
