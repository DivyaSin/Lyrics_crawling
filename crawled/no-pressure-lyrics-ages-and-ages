The day I left 
My past behind me at the gate 
I ended up 
In such an unfamiliar place And what I saw of the mess they made 
So many lines, not a word to say 
I couldn't turn it off, so I had to turn away I never wanted 
That jilted version of the truth 
And everything they fought for 
They wanted me to fight for too So here's what I said to the ones I faced 
If you're coming in, there's a price to pay 
So you can take it up, but you can't take it away I see the whites of their eyes through the cracks of my 
Fence and I wonder how long it'll take 
For them to gather up whatever nerve they got 
We'll be the wall they hit, lay them to waist I see the whites of their eyes through the cracks of my 
Fence and I wonder how long it'll take 
For them to gather up whatever nerve they got 
We'll be the wall they hit, lay them to waist
