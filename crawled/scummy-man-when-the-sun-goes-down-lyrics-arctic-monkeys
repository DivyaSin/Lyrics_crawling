Said who's that girl there 
I wander what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets. 
She don't do major credit cards I doubt she does receipts it's all not quite legitimate. 
And what a scummy man just give him half a chance I bet he'll rob you if he can. 
Can see it in his eyes yeah that his got a driving ban amongst some other offences. And I've seen him with girls of the night. And he told Roxanne to put on her red light. We're all infected but he'll be alright cos his a scumbag don't you know... said his a scumbag don't you know. (Guitars) Although your trying not to listen. 
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground. 
She makes a subtle propostion. 
I'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down. 
Oh and he must be up to something 
what are the chances, sure, its more than likely. 
I've got a feeling in my stomach, you start to wonder what his story might be, what his story might be. Chorus: 
Yeah, cos they said he changes when the sun goes down, 
And they said he changes when the sun goes down, 
And they said he changes when the sun goes down around here, around here...oh Look here comes a Ford Mondeo, isn't he Mr Inconspicuos. 
And he don't even have to say out' 
shes in the stance ready to get picked up. 
Bet shes delighted when she sees him. 
Pulling in and giving her the eye, 
because she must be fucking freezing. 
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky. 
It dun't stop in the winter no. And they said he changes when the sun goes down, 
Cos they said he changes when the sun goes down, 
and they said he changes when the sun goes down around here. Well they said he changes when the sun goes down, over the river going out of town 
and they said he changes when the sun goes down around here, around here oh. and what a scummy man. 
Just give him half a chance i bet he'll rob if he can. 
Can see it in his eyes yeah that his got a nasty plan. 
I hope you not involved at all.
