When will we get 
The time to be 
Just friends? It's never safe for us 
Not even in the evening 
'Cause I've been drinking 
Not in the morning 
When your shit works 
It's always dangerous 
When everybody's sleeping 
And I've been thinking 
Can we be alone? 
Can we be alone? When will we get 
The time to be 
Just friends? 
When will we get 
The time to be 
Just friends? And, no, I'm not ashamed 
But the guilt will kill you 
If she don't first 
I'll never love you like her 
Thought we need to find a time 
To just do this shit together 
'Fore it gets worse 
I want to touch you 
But that just hurts When will we get 
The time to be 
Just, just friends? 
When will we get 
The time to be 
Just friends, just friends? When will we get 
The time to be 
Just friends, just friends? 
When will we get 
The time to be 
Just friends, just friends? Just friends
