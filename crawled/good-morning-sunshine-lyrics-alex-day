Good morning sunshine, I hope that you're well 
Honey I missed you, last night when night fell 
You should know, sunshine, you brighten my day 
The world gets so dark, love, when you go away They say absence makes the heart grow fonder 
But I can't help but wonder If the darkness came tomorrow, 
Could I keep you in my mind? 
Where you rise i'll gladly follow 
Just for the chance 
To stand in your light Good morning sunshine, I'm glad you're still here 
My darling it's hard when my friends can't be near 
Till I can be there to show them I'm true 
I hope what they're seeing is as bright as you They say absence makes the heart grow fonder 
But I can't help but wonder If the darkness came tomorrow, 
Could I keep you in my mind? 
Where you rise i'll gladly follow 
Just for the chance 
To stand in your light If the darkness came tomorrow, 
Could I keep you in my mind? 
Where you rise i'll gladly follow 
Just for the chance 
To stand in your light Just one more chance 
To stand in your light Good morning sunshine, I wish for your heart 
There's no point pretending that you won't burn out 
But you're still a symbol to all that you meet 
'Coz you keep on shining, you're extraordinary If the darkness came tomorrow, 
Could I keep you in my mind? 
Where you rise i'll gladly follow 
Just for the chance 
To stand in your light If the darkness came tomorrow, 
Could I keep you in my mind? 
Where you rise i'll gladly follow 
Just for the chance 
To stand in your light Good morning sunshine!
