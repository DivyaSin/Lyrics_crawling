Yeah! And you don't stop 
Now, once again Ace One is on the wax 
and this one goes out to everybody 
who experienced in their lifetime 
or going to experience in their lifetime some type of hardship 
Because everybody goes through hardships See hardship belongs to me 
I will never give it away or sell it for a fee 
I regret to inform you I will never set it free 
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be 
I take my pain just like a G 
Got my struggle of life down to a T 
It's nobody's fault but mine if I can't see 
So I open my eyes and start looking for the key 
Hardship is mine to hold onto 
all through to the Yellow Brick Road it goes 
My shoulders got the heaviest load but I pack light 
and I compensate I got act right when I conversate 
See some people relate but they don't understand the words 
Some people can climb mountains but can't jump curbs 
and vice verse. I know it's such a nice verse 
but hardship makes everything worse 
and worse is a reminder to stay on the path 
But hardship is mine to have 
because hardship keeps me in check 
mainly so I can check myself I give up full respect 
because he's real like a hundred-dollar bill 
Without hardship you wouldn't appreciate your meals 
Without hardship I wouldn't appreciate my skills 
And so I do and so I grew and so I knew 
that hardship not only makes most of my days blue 
but it teaches me how to struggle in the jungle 
and never crumble and how to remain humble 
Some people they live life inside a glass case 
Some people they live life in the vastness of space 
And others will live long at a snail's pace 
I live with hardship slapping me in the face Because hardship belongs to me, 
I will never give it away or sell it for a fee 
I regret to inform you I will never set it free 
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be How hard it could be... 
How hard it could be... 
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be.
