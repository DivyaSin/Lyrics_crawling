Now when the rumor comes to your town 
It grows and grows, where it started no one knows 
Some of your neighbors will invite it right in 
Or maybe it's a lie, even if it's a sin they'll repeat the rumor again Close your eyes, hang down your head 
Until the fog rolls away, let it roll away 
Open up your arms and feel the good 
'Cause it's comin', a brand new day Big men, little men turned into dust 
Or maybe it was all in fun, they didn't mean to ruin no one 
Could there be someone, here among this crowd 
Who's been abused, had his name so misused and his privacy refused? Close your eyes, hang your head 
Until the fog rolls away, let it roll away 
Open up your arms and feel the good 
'Cause it's comin', a brand new day Now all you vigilantes wanna make a move 
Or maybe they won't, you know I sure hope they don't 
For whether this rumor proves true or false 
You can forgive or you can regret but he will never ever forget Close your eyes, hang down your head 
Until the fog rolls away, let it roll away 
Open up your arms and feel the good 
'Cause it's comin', a brand new day
