I cant believe my eyes, it's been 7 months and still you cry, 
The thought of me singing you to sleep. Time passes by and still we try to rewrite the past and make our future plans,

Right nows the only time we have complete control,

And the chances we take along the way (no more regret) Lets just throw away the past 
(no more regret) Another chance to make this one last 
(no more regret, open up your eyes and see what the life is like) Time passes by and still we try to rewrite the past and make our future plans, 
And if we'd only noticed that, 
Right nows the only time we have complete control, 
So lets let today know. We're done running away from decisions we made 
And the chances we take along the way  We're done running away
