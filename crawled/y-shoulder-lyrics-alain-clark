Lay your head down 
on my shoulder 
everything will be alright 
Lay your body down girl 
cry till it's over 
everything will be alright I know it feels like the first of December 
I know that it can get so cold 
Even though it's hard you gotta try to remember 
you always got someone to hold on to Lay your head down 
on my shoulder 
everything will be alright 
lay your body down girl 
cry till it's over 
everything will be alright Times are bad and days are long 
but somewhere light shines through the clouds 
And I get visions of you dancing to this song 
with a smile on your face and nothing to worry about Lay your head down 
on my shoulder 
everything will be alright 
lay your body down girl 
cry till it's over 
everything will be alright Lay your head down 
on my shoulder 
everything will be alright 
lay your body down girl 
cry till it's over 
everything will be alright 
know that everything will be alright Lay your head down 
on my shoulder 
everything will be alright 
lay your body down girl 
cry till it's over 
everything will be alright It'll be alright 
it'll be alright' 
You will be alright baby 
you'll be fine darling 
be alright...
