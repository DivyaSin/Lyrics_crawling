Pharaoh, he was a powerful man 
With the ancient world in the palm of his hand 
To all intents and purposes, he was Egypt with a capital E 
Whatever he did he was showered with praise If he cracked a joke then you chortled for days 
No one had rights or a vote but the king 
In fact you might say he was fairly right wing 
When Pharaoh's around, then you get down on the ground 
If you ever find yourself near Ramses, get down on your knees A Pharaoh story, a Pharaoh story Down at the other end of the scale 
Joseph is still doing time in jail 
For even though he is in with the guards 
A lifetime in prison seems quite on the cards 
But if my analysis of the position is right At the end of the tunnel there's a glimmer of light 
For all of a sudden indescribable things 
Have shattered the sleep of both peasants and kings 
Strange as it seems, there's been a run of crazy dreams 
And a man who can interpret could go far, could become a star Could be famous, could be a big success Could be a star
