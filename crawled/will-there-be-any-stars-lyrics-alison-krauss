I am thinking today of that beautiful land 
I shall reach when the sun goeth down 
When through wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand 
Will there be any stars in my crown. Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown 
When at evening the sun goeth down 
When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest 
Will there be any stars in my crown. --- Instrumental --- In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray 
Let me watch as a winner of souls 
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day 
When his praise like the sea billow rolls. Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown 
When at evening the sun goeth down 
When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest 
Will there be any stars in my crown. --- Mandolin Instrumental --- Oh, what joy it will be when his face I behold 
Living gems at his feet to lay down 
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold 
Should there be any stars in my crown. --- Banjo Instrumental --- Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown 
When at evening the sun goeth down 
When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest 
Will there be any stars in my crown...
