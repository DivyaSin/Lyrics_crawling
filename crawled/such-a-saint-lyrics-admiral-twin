She digs holes in Heaven and then laughs 
When I catch a glimpse from way down here 
I'm crawling up the lamp post like a worm 
She flips the switch and leaves me blind And I've known evil, mean, bad people, kinder than that 
If you're such a saint, reprieve me 
And I've known traitors and deceivers, kinder than that 
If you're such a saint, don't leave me I have been an ornament for hoods 
And I've been the driver of a car 
But now, I've left the driving up to her 
And she does not know or care where we are And I've known evil, mean, bad people, kinder than that 
If you're such a saint, reprieve me 
And I've known traitors and deceivers, kinder than that 
If you're such a saint, don't leave me She and Joan of Arc, were having lunch 
Today down at the Blue Room 
She told Joan, she'd like some barbecue 
Then laughed, as Joan began to cry And I've known evil, mean, bad people, kinder than that 
If you're such a saint, reprieve me 
And I've known traitors and deceivers, kinder than that 
If you're such a saint, don't leave me And I've known evil, mean, bad people, kinder than that 
If you're such a saint, reprieve me 
And I've known traitors and deceivers, kinder than that 
If you're such a saint, don't leave me
