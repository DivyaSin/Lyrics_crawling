Today was blase, I had my delusions of grandeur 
With my head on my desk in Math 
When I wiped the drool form my mouth 
And I lifted my head, DAZED 
Recollections of all the dreams of you I've had Dazzling, oh so lovely Sitting in History, outside the bounds of Interesting 
My mind is forced to wander to thoughts of you 
I wanna drive you home 
I wanna seek and find the secrets that you know 
I wanna make up for all the time I blew You're so lovely!
