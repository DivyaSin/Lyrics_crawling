Mama hold her head and cry 
Cause her son had been shut down on the streets and died 
Oh why oh why? 
Is what she cries She cries. The biggest problems in the cities 
Is them daddies ain't there 
And if it ain't about the money 
Then nobody don't care 
And then I spoke to an OG trying ment to me said boy 
these streets suck the love right out your heart 
So don't believe that bullshit. You know god damn well these niggaz won't show up 
(oh no no noo) 
know god damn well These bitches will grow up 
I'm sinking down to the ground of the ghettos We can't get no lower 
So I' m askin' God How we can dig ourselves out? 
We can't afford a shovel If there's a problem in the hood everybody comes together Just to solve that problem 
But that's the problem in the hood No one comes together unless she involved violence 
Cause we were taught to be the tough guys And we were told just to remake silence 
The you got them niggaz telling on the next guys Stand and tell them what it takes to solve them Is there a problem that I don't know about? 
Is there a problem that I haven't heard about? 
Sad sick kids are robbin each other Prostitues and drug dealers 
We won't get much further unless we start helping each other 
But they're none believers will say You know god damn well That these niggaz won't show up You know god damn well that these bitches won't grow up I'm sinking down to the ground of the ghettos We can't get no lower 
So I' m asking God How we can dig ourselves out? We can't afford a shovel [OG Boo Dirty] 
Rule 16, brothers with no fathers around

Momma worked at 2 jobs while babysitting hard name we wanna see ma daddy when we was in a drill

You know god damn well That these niggaz won't show up You know god damn well that these bitches won't grow up I'm sinking down to the ground of the ghettos We can't get no love up 
So I' m askin' God How we can dig ourselves out? We can't afford a shovel.
