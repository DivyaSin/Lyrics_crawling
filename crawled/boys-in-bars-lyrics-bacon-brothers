Now you could hear that jukebox pound 
But you could barely see inside 
Now rumor had it years ago 
Is where that girl had died 
Now why they caled it a cafe 
Well I never understood 
Cause there aint no tables on the street 
The coffee tastes like mud 
But every night at five o'clock 
They'd start to come around 
We'd begin to set em up 
And they would knock em down 
Sometime after midnight 
With a pocket full of green 
We'd lock the doors and step outside 
And our days would begin 
Cause we were boys in bars 
Runnin over the shootin stars 
Cruisin Broadway without cars 
We were gonna take that town 
Nothin there would knock us down 
That old apple would be ours 
George was a lawyer 
In an old Brooks Brothers suit 
And Glen worked for homicide 
He had a pistol in his boot 
Franco was a sculptor 
Who looked something like an eagle 
Chas did a lot of things 
And none of them were legal 
Debbi was a waitress 
And she came all the way from Queens 
Sit around and wonder how 
She got into those jeans 
Nicky tended bar 
So he always drank for free 
Johnny was a lover 
And he taught everything to me 
And we were boys in bars 
Cool as ice cubes, Sharp as darts 
Runnin down all those lonely hearts 
All that liquid goes 
All those lives we sewed 
All those medals all those scars 
Last night I was thinkin back 
To those sweet old Disco days 
But you know the memories were cloudy 
Through that thick Marlboro haze 
Freezin outside 54's 
Just hopin he'd pick me 
Skiing down Columbus 
Just like Jean Claude Killey 
Back before the ticking clcok 
Made all of us it's slave 
And back before the search for love 
Could put you in your grave 
I'd never trade the days I lost 
For the years that I have found 
Sometimes late at night 
I can hear that jukebox pound 
And we were boys in bars 
Runnin over the shootin stars 
Cruisin Broadway without cars 
We were gonna take that town 
Nothin there would knock us down 
That old apple would be ours 
Boys in bars 
We were boys in bars 
Runnin over the shootin stars 
Boys in bars 
We were boys in bars 
Cruisin Broadway without cars 
Boys in bars 
We were boys in bars 
Cool as ice cubes sharp as darts 
Boys in bars 
We were boys in bars 
Runnin down all those lonely hearts
