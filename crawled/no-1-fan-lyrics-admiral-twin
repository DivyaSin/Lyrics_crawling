I know, I know 
You've come to take me down 
I knew this would happen Relax 
Could it be you were meant for this? 
Did you ever doubt it? But if I cease to be 
What of all those lonely, lonely nights? 
Your darkroom and your 8x10's? 
And if I cease to be 
Who will you believe in anymore? 
This world is such a bore Some lives have a way of colliding 
And blurring into headlines 
I've had dreams about this for years, you know 
(Thought you would be taller) But if I cease to be 
What of all those lonely, lonely nights? 
Your darkroom and your 8x10's? 
And if I cease to be 
Who will you believe in anymore? 
This world is such a bore Such a beautiful world 
What a beautiful lie 
Such a beautiful world 
What a beautiful lie 
Such a beautiful world 
What a beautiful, a beautiful lie Maybe I'm amazed at how real this is 
That's why I'm not frightened 
Oh no, guess my time's coming to an end 
You've taken your mask off Such a beautiful world 
What a beautiful lie 
Such a beautiful world 
What a beautiful lie 
Such a beautiful world 
What a beautiful, a beautiful lie
