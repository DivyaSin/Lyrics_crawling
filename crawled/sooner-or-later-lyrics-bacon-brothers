Sheridan Square, high as a kite 
Beer in a bag, toasting the night 
And we dreamed as the Manhattan moon, sunk like a stone 
Oh, but sooner or later, sooner or later 
Youre gonna have to stand and walk back home 
You're gonna have to stand and walk back home You were good with your hands, you were good with your heart 
You were good to your friends and thats a good place to start 
You say a mans not a man, if he dont do it alone 
Oh, but sooner or later, sooner or later 
Youre gonna have to stand and walk back home 
Youre gonna have to stand and walk back home Now your fading away, like a freeway mirage 
Are you out in the valley or in your garage? 
And I know its hard, every dog loves his bone 
Yeah, but sooner or later, sooner or later 
Youre gonna have to stand and walk back home 
Youre gonna have to stand and walk back home Sooner or later, sooner or later 
Youre gonna have to stand and walk back home
