On the World Wide Web 
Finding out if the hospitals are Y2K compliant 
He goes out to the country 
And checks out the buffets 
And is writing a guide to cute nurses 
He thinks its a real job 
A real job 
A real job 
But its at Uni, So i 
t can't be. 
Sometimes he has to wear 
pants. 
Sometimes he has to wear 
A tie. 
So he 
Thinks its a real job. 
Thinks its a real job. 
Col Lin thinks its a real job. 
But its at Uni, So it can't be. 
That's OK, everyone needs to dr 
eam 
And his job will end around about the same time 
All the embedded circuits that he missed end too 
And then he can find 
A real job. 
A real job. 
Col Lin thinks its a real job. 
But its at Uni, So it can't be.
