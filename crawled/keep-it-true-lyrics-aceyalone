you know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we 
keep it true 
you know we keep it true - we got to keep it true we got to keep 
it true 
we got to keep it true - you know what we do you know what 
we do 
we got to keep it true 
relax your mind w/the music - you know what we do you know what we do 
sit back and vibe w/this true shit this isn't really what you think it is 
that is if you're even thinkin' in the first place 
the first place isn't always the winner 
and winnin' isn't everything 
and this is not a race 
i am not a android i am not a mongoloid 
i am not annoyed by the void in your brain 
this is not a trick son you are not a victim 
you are just a man be	-boyed out the game 
let me explain 
Abstract are you fresh? 
ain't nobody fresher 
but it's hard to get around w/out some clown tryin' to test ya 
Acey are you dope? 
dopest in the world 
i give it to the moms and pops i give it to the boys and girls 
oh so you a family man? 
aren't we all aren't we all 
yes we are 
trying to make jams man and expand my repertoire we got to keep it true we got to keep it true - relax your mind w/the music 
you know what we do you know what we do - sit back and vibe w/this true shit well i be arrangin' thoughts in my brain cell family 
embarking on incredible creative routes 
understanding me is truth shining like a lie 
when i say break wide i mean take trips not just in your ride 
in your mind 
cause when you left you're right on time 
the sun'll come out tomorrow and it'll set in the west 
so i don't sweat the rest 
who want to inhale stress 
keep it true you know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we 
keep it true 
you know we keep it true - you know what we do you know what we 
do 
we got to keep it true - the W the W the W 
we got to keep it true 
relax your mind w/the music - and keep it true and keep it true 
sit back and vibe w/this true shit the world is full of bullshitters 
liars and triers and quitters 
could-a-beens want to be's thought-i-was isn't-i-is's 
and everybody in your business 
damn 
now what is really your main aim 
when you are just a blotch and a stain on the planetary plane 
just another name in the phone book of fame 
bustin' out the seams it seems you haven't gained enough 
to be seen in the right scene 
your thoughts they seem so convincing hmmm 
but your actions don't follow through 
remember 
never say never because it never comes true 
your thoughts they seem so convincing for instance 
you told me that you're a level higher 
liar 
element of desire earth and the wind and the fire 
not 
you ain't even halfway hot 
not lukewarm you don't got no form 
you (...?...) 
all caught up in bein' waterproof 
when you shoulda been tryin' to catch up w/the truth 
for all intent and purposes your life on earth ain't worth it's weight in 
gold 
that's probably why you get blowed 
cause people tell people things and people sell people things 
that are useless and irrelevant 
and it stifles my intelligence 
i stay true you know we keep it true - and we keep on and keep on and keep on 
you know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true you can mumble jumble if you got somethin' to say 
but i doubt it's gonna affect me i row my boat steady 
everready is my battery description 
meaning i'm equipped to take long trips 
and my brain cells overload when i get blowed 
gotta bring it down there's a point where the joint stops 
being passed through the fingers of a rhyme (?singers?) 
the smoke from my last hit still lingers 
bring us your tired and your weary and your poor 
i'm a take you higher while you're hearing metaphors 
and similes 
assimilation of new creation 
mind emancipation 
rhymes command the nation 
and so on and therefor and such and such 
dust to dust i thrust from the ground 
w/no where else to go but up L.A. is where i'm found 
throwin' up sets and blowin' up sets and goin' up Stepney 
about to get a heavy track 
(?or jimmy in the spot?) 
or plenty of hip hop goin' round three 
heavyweights it's your time so register 
foundate your legacy we serve all them replicas 
true style true style? 
true style new style you know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we keep it true 
you know we keep it true - the W and every crew we keep it true 
we got to keep it true - from me to you do what you do just keep it 
true 
we got to keep it true - relax your mind w/the music now i'm gonna take my last verse on a good note 
you better prepare your footnotes 
hold your wigs tight 
open up the middle 
(?center me in the more?) 
words are the foundation action is the building and unity 
and the concept to result in logic and the use of logic 
now the object to be neutral partial to a judgement 
and the subject's concentration here is the pop quiz 
what hip hop is you know we keep it true - relax your mind w/the music 
we got to keep it true - sit back and vibe to this true shit the wrong thing to do is stop
