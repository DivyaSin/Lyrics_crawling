She burns too hot, plays too rough 
She's got a dress full of dangers stuff 
The way she looks tears me apart 
The way she loves me nearly stops my heart If her lovin' don't kill me 
Don't put me six feet down 
I'll be the last man standing 
On the top of the hill 
If her lovin' don't kill me 
Then nothing will My doctor told me I looked kind of ragged 
He said, what happened son, did you fall off the wagon 
I said, it ain't my drinking or my smoking doc 
It's just my drop dead darling rockin' me around the clock and If her lovin' don't kill me 
Don't put me six feet down 
I'll be the last man standing 
On the top of the hill 
If her lovin' don't kill me 
Then nothing will Every night she tears me up 
She gives it good and I can't get enough If her lovin' don't kill me 
Don't put me six feet down 
I'll be the last man standing 
On the top of the hill 
If her lovin' don't kill me 
Then nothing will
