Bottled up and coming down 
Binge and purge and yet you never miss a meal 
Fashion equals Fascism 
Bolan smiling down on your empty intentions 
Vacant grace, fall or fly 
I don't mind, I don't mind 
I'll try anything 
Hypersensitive, keep me up like greasy spoon truck-stop coffee 
Supermodel razor-burn, talking circles wrapped in 
Eye candy and fun for pvc 
Fall or Fly 
I don't mind, I don't mind 
I'll try anything 
I don't mind, I don't mind 
I'll swing at everything 
Hide it all away 
I will hide it all away 
I will hide it all inside 
Bottled up and coming down 
Binge and purge and yet you never miss a meal 
Feast or famine, Crash and Burn 
Bolan is smiling down on me 
Bolan is smiling down on me 
Bolan is smiling down on me 
Bolan is smiling down on me 
Bolan is smiling down on me
