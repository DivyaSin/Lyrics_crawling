i got your message 
it screamed aloud 
your dancing and your singing 
gave it a shroud 
we all may have laughed 
as they dragged us down 
now all the clear is mundane 
with a broken, crooked crown sometimes 
i don't feel your love 
sometimes 
i can only hope to stay alive 
sometimes 
you come and take me away i feel like the chatter 
cleared my head 
but always your ways 
left me better off for dead the chance of reason shook 
away the way 
now all is a sunday 
for a man who's lost his way sometimes 
i don't feel your love 
sometimes 
i can only hope to stay alive 
sometimes 
you come and take me away don't lean back too far 
as the colors fade to gray 
don't breathe in too much 
or the weight will blow you away do you give a little in? 
all that's left is sometimes right 
your happiness danced away 
far away... 
to the distance in the twilight sometimes 
i don't feel your love 
sometimes 
i can only hope to stay alive 
sometimes 
you come and take me away
