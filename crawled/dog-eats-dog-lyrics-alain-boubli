"Thenardier: 
here's a hint of gold 
stuck into a tooth 
pardon me mieseur 
you won't be needing it no more shouldn't be too hard to sell 
add it to the pile 
add it to the stack 
here among the sewer rats 
a breath away from hell 
you get accustomed to the smell well someone's got to clean them up my friends 
bodies on the highway 
law and order upside down 
someone's got to collect their odds and ends 
as a service to the town here's a tasty ring 
pretty little thing 
wouldn't want to waste it 
that would really be a crime 
thank you sir i'm in your debt here's a little toy 
take it off the boy 
his heart's no longer going 
and he's lived his little time 
but his watch is ticking yet well someone's got to clean them up my friends 
before the little harvest disappears into the mud 
someone's got to collect their odds and ends 
when the gutters run with blood it's a world where the dog eats dog 
and they kill for the bones in the street 
and God in his heaven 
he don't interfere 
cause he's dead as the stiffs at my feet i raise my eyes to see the heavens 
and only the moon looks down 
the harvest moon shines down
