All my friends are drifters 
All my friends are lost 
Let's get out of the city 
To the westcoast Leave all our troubles 
Let's find a new way 
Nothing new on the horizon 
In this promised land Oh, all this time we're wasting 
We'll never get it back 
Searching for the answers 
Along this dusty old track And those who came before us 
The rebels and the saints 
We're just like a drizzle 
They were hurricanes Oh love 
What will I become? 
What could I have done? We are wanderers by trade 
We're like mockingbirds, we're fake 
We are selfulfilling prophecies 
Born to walk the earth without a cause 
We are, who we say we are Raise your glass for freedom 
Raise your glass for fun 
We are sons and daughters of 
The children of the sun And if there's yet a battle 
A battle to be won 
We sit back and listen 
While the government roars Oh love 
What will I become? 
What could I have done? We are wanderers by trade 
We're like mockingbirds, we're fake 
We are selfulfilling prophecies 
Born to walk the earth without a cause 
We are, who we say we are Better rise up 
Turn the lights on 
Find a rock 
That doesn't roll 
Sing a new song 
For the lost love 
Just remember 
You reap what you sow
