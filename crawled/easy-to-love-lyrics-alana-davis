Like a sparrow with a wounded wing 
Left all alone, to a tree I'll sing 
But it can't respond to my melody 
And it can't lend me harmony 
It's just one my one thin lonely voice 
And it's not my choice to be alone 
But I've come too far now to go back home 
On my own it's no fun to roam 
I've got to find me someone to be around 
When all these blues get me down 
Maybe you've got the time 
Maybe you'll share yourself with me 
I don't need to call you mine Just like you, babe I need to be free 
And just like you, babe I need to be me 
Just like you, baby I would be so easy to love I don't want someone to watch over me 
I don't care about the holes in your jeans 
You just come and you do what you do 
And could you be there baby when I call for you 
I could use some peace of mind It's not my choice to be alone 
But I've come to far now to run back home 
On my own it's no fun to roam 
I've got to find me someone to be around 
When all these blues get me down 
Maybe you've got the time 
Maybe you'll share yourself with me 
I don't need to call you mine
