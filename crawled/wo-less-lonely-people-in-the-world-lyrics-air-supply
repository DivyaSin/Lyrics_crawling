I was down my dreams were wearing thin 
When you're lost where do you begin 
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day 
Looking for the love that never came my way Then you smiled and i reached out to you 
I could tell you were lonely too 
One look then it all began for you and me 
The moment that we touched i knew that there would be [Chorus] 
Two less lonely people in the world 
And it's gonna be fine 
Out of all the people in the world 
I just can't believe you're mine 
In my life where everything was wrong 
Something finally went right 
Now there's two less lonely people 
In the world tonight Just to think what i might have missed 
Looking back how did i exist 
I dreamed, still i never thought i'd come this far 
But miracles come true, i know 'cause here we are [Chorus] Tonight i fell in love with you 
And all the things i never knew 
Seemed to come to me somehow 
Baby, love is here and now there's [Chorus]
