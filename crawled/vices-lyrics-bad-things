I kicked the world so close to me 
Get out of trouble for the people I meet 
(Yeah) 
Don't you ever loose your faith 
I never had it never wanted it anyway (Chorus) 
We got a long way home 
Givin' it all the way 
Hold your head hold your own for the big fade out 
We are the lonely ones 
We got a chance to say 
Hold your head hold your own until we fade out Don't bother at all 
Keepin' it for an instant, watch it make a roll 
Baby it's gung ho 
Come tomorrow, stay till you belong (Chorus) 
We got a long way home 
Givin' it all the way 
Hold your head hold your own for the big fade out 
We are the lonely ones 
We got a chance to say 
Hold your head hold your own until we fade out *Guitar solo* Say you won't run away 
Say you won't run 
(For the big fade out!) (Chorus) 
We got a long way home 
Givin' it all the way 
Hold your head hold your own for the big fade out 
We are the lonely ones 
We got a chance to say 
Hold your head hold your own until we fade out (Chorus) 
We got a long way home 
Givin' it all the way 
Hold your head hold your own for the big fade out Watch your head son 
(We'll never get fault) 
Lay your body safe 
(We'll never get fault) Hold your head hold your own, till we fade out
