Father I didn't really know you 
Mother you are so very far away from me 
Hopeless birthdays made me cry 
My heart kept saying: It's all right 
Obviously that's the way it was meant to be Now I know 
There was a reason for it all 
And I am not lonely anymore 
I got my reward 
That's why I am loved I have you 
A lover and a friend 
You are everything I need 
You are the sun the air I breathe 
Without you, life wouldn't be the same 
Please never go away 
And if you go then don't forget to take me with you The love that I gave was used against me 
Honesty seemed a foreign and old-fashioned word 
Maybe I just don't understand 
Cause I'm a stranger in this land 
Even friends failed to make me feel at home Now I know 
There was a reason for it all Jestes moja nagroda 
You are my reward
