Scarlett lips, a silk embrace 
But there's no laughter in her face 
A crowded room is a lonely place full of lies A wicked smile a shifting glance 
The passion light you feel at last 
Her pleasure somehow eased the pain 
Too late to chance it all again Before we kiss the world goodbye 
It's only a breath away 
One more dance before you die 
So tender as the music plays There's no emotion 
Only passion in your crime 
Killing the love that drives you out of your mind 
When you dance with a stranger A spinning room a cool caress 
A try to hide my loneliness 
Cheek to cheek we let the evening drift by The hollow mask has disappeared 
We drown our love through salty tears 
We speed at night like a racing car 
And now I see you as you really are Before we kiss the world goodbye 
It's only a breath away 
One more dance before you die 
So tender as the music plays There's no emotion 
Only passion in your crime 
Love is the last thing on your mind 
When you dance with a stranger Dance 
Dance with a stranger 
Dance Before we kiss the world goodbye 
It's only a breath away 
One more dance before you die 
So tender as the music plays There's no emotion 
Only passion in your crime 
Love is the last thing on your mind 
When you dance with a stranger Watching and waiting 
For the moment to arrive 
Dance with a stranger 
Love is the last thing on your mind 
When you dance with a stranger There's no emotion 
Only passion in your crime 
Love is the last thing on your mind 
When you dance with a stranger
