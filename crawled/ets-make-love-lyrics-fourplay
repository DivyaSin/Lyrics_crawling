Everytime I see you 
I break down and cry, 
Cause anytime I see you 
You always are sublime 
I wanna be your man, be your world, 
be my friend, be my girl, 
be the one you're closest to. Oh, cause when you're close to me, 
My heart just wants to speak 
And say these words to you 
(Say these words to you, my baby) Chorus: 
Let's make love, 
In a heat of the night, 
Making love in the bed, on a rug, near the door, in a tub, 
On a kitchen floor 
Wherever it feels good, 
Let's make love. Everytime I'm near you, 
Girl, I get so high 
I wanna be inside you 
For more than just one night 
I wanna be the man in your life, or your lover on a side, 
be the one that pleases you Ooh, whenever you're with me 
My heart just wants to speak 
And say these words to you, my baby, oh, my baby Chorus And ooh, I love to love you, girl 
(love to love you, girl) 
Cause you're the ceil above my earth 
And no one else but you, 
I'd cry for you, 
I'd sacrifice my life for you 
That's how you make me feel when we make love 
(Oh, we make love) 
Let's make love tonight, baby. Chorus
