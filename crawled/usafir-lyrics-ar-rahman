Intezaar is testing me 
Intezaar is strolling 
Intezaar is turning me round 
Bequarrar is pinching me 
Bequarrar is moving me 
Bequarrar is taking me down 
Take a look at taqdeer 
Turn around my taqdeer 
Oh rabba take me take me home, 
I am a Musafir 
Making up the tasveer 
Do we get the tasveer 
Oh rabba get me get me home, 
I am a Musafir. (2) 
I am flowing flowing 
I am falling falling 
I am drowining to something true 
I am turning turning 
I am running running 
I am flowing to the truth 
Hoshiya is pushing me 
Hoshiya is pulling me 
Hoshiya is taking me down 
Hoshiya is belling me 
Hoshiya is filling me 
Hoshiya is taking me now 
I am flowing flowing 
I am falling falling 
I am trying to something true 
I am turning turning 
I am running running 
I am flowing to the truth
