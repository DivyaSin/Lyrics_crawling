makeba 
honey girlfriend 
left in a whirlwind put a brother in a tailspin 
just twirlin' 
had a few laughs and kicks 
but me and my clique don't be trippin' no tricks 
i still got a piece of me to give you 
you still got a piece of you to give me 
you listenin' but you don't hear me 
we can pick up right where we left at but 
i gotta be me and you gotta accept that 
i just want to be homies 
cause i ain't got love like Monie 
cause soon as you got close you got ghost 
and you tried to leave Acey 'lone-why 
so hook up w/me if you can cool 
but you know i know what you get loose to 
and if you play your cards right get your shit tight 
then we might be down like we used to
