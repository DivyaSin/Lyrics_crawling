Hush, just stop 
There's nothing you can do or say (baby) 
I've had enough 
I'm not your property as from today (baby) You might think that I won't make it on my own 
But now I'm Stronger than yesterday 
Now it's nothin' but my way 
My loneliness ain't killing me no more 
I, I'm stronger Than I ever thought that I could be (baby) 
I used to go with the flow 
Didn't really care 'bout me You might think that I can't take it 
But your wrong 
'Cause now I'm Stronger than yesterday 
Now it's nothin' but my way 
My loneliness ain't killing me no more I, I'm stronger Come on now 
Oh yeah 
Here I go 
On my own 
I don't need nobody 
Better off alone Here I go on my own now 
I don't need nobody not anybody 
Here I go Alright Here I go Stronger than yesterday 
Its nothin' but my way 
My loneliness ain't killin' me no more I'm stronger than yesterday 
Now it's nothin' but my way 
My loneliness ain't killing me no more 
I, I'm stronger Now I'm stronger than yesterday 
Now it's nothin' but my way 
My loneliness ain't killing me no more 
I, I'm stronger 
I'm stronger
