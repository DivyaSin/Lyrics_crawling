im on top 
missionary 
say my name 
three times 
like bloody mary 
and i'll be there 
in a flesh girl 
love it when i 
use my tongue 
as a gesture 
just to 
let you know 
my taste buds 
look nice 
now i wonder 
do you taste good 
uh 
and i mean that 
in the best way 
say my name 
like god 
on a sunday 
oh oh 
champagne 
set the mood right 
no clothes 
leave your panties 
on my nightlight 
looking for the plumber 
i can lay the right pipe 
no keyboard 
shawty just 
the right type 
plus you outta this world 
you so sci-fi 
im just being real 
shawty tell me 
why lie 
i bet the neighbors 
know my name 
and you know why 
yeah you know how 
specially when you 
scream out
