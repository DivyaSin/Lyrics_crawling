They met up in Rockport 
Where the moon rose early and the days were short 
And the miles between were still too many to mention The Blue Ridge rides at starfall 
Oh, the epic scope of it all 
Those days before the double-edged blade of contention CHORUS Sometimes passion's like a cigarette 
Burning clean out 'fore it really takes wing 
But you always fly high for a little while 
When you think you've got the real thing He moved in for the long haul 
The '81 Hog, the guitar and all 
They got an apartment, a conversation piece But the big spark dimmed substantial 
You know it's always financials 
That give the portrait of happiness its nasty crease CHORUS Sometimes they'd find common ground 
Some days he'd run to where he couldn't be found 
A ride in the pines can truly inspire 
The need for a soul to come clean from a waning desire He laid there deciding 
What side of a man should come out of hiding 
While she laid there, the key to his conventions She had brought some changes 
But how could he pretend with all these empty pages 
And the miles to go, still too many to mention CHORUS Do you think you got the real thing
