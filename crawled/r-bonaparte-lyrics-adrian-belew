how did you get it in your head, mr. bonaparte 
that everything you did and said would amount to law 
and all of the players and pieces on the map you drew 
should be happy to revolve their lives around you i live in my lonely mind 
i wonder do you ever reflect 
that you're only another man with a bag of regret 
and your life will be done in the blink of an eye 
and you won't even be a footnote on the page of time according to the book I read, Mr. Bonaparte 
all your plans and proclamations fall apart 
and the loyal few who remain intact 
only seem to pay attention 
while they laugh behind your back
