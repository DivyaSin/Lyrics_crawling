Barry White, he woke me 
Out of my sleep 
"Love Unlimited" on infinite repeat 
I live alone, 
So why's the shower running? 
My mind is groggy 
My memory's foggy 
The smell of incense 
Lingers in the bedroom 
I can't believe 
It's already past noon 
On my arm 
There's a strange new tattoo 
Shirt on the fan blade 
Pants on the lampshade You get the picture, 
Clear as a bell 
You get the picture, 
Just hang it on your bedroom wall 
You get the picture, 
And put a frame around it 
Empty bottle of tequila, 
Jose Cuervo margaritas 
Popcorn and a game of Twister 
You get the picture 
You get the picture A book of matches 
On my dresser from the Sky Bar 
Doggie bag from Dos Amigos 
That valet parker 
Still has the keys to my car 
Piece by piece, 
It's coming back to me 
I met my buddies after work 
We shot some pool, a couple beers 
Before I knew it, we were rocking 
Met some girls, we started talking 
It's not like me to get nervous, 
But she was perfect You get the picture, 
Clear as a bell 
You get the picture, 
Just hang it on your bedroom wall 
You get the picture, 
And put a frame around it 
A mariachi band was playing, 
She was dancing close and swaying 
Fireworks when I kissed her 
You get the picture Suddenly, the shower opens 
In a cloud of steam 
Standing there, 
The woman of my dreams You get the picture, 
Clear as a bell 
You get the picture, 
Just hang it on your bedroom wall 
You get the picture, 
And put a frame around it 
You get the picture 
You get the picture, 
Clear as a bell 
You get the picture, 
Just hang it on your bedroom wall 
You get the picture
