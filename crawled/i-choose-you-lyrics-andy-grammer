When we're born into this world 
We don't really get to say 
Little boys and little girls handed the brand new families 
There comes a time in life 
When we finally get to choose 
And I choose you, I choose you We can't give our two cents 
Of how tall we want to be 
We don't get an opinion 
On our ethnicity 
But the one we spend our life with 
That we get to choose 
And I choose, I choose you I choose you, to be by my side 
I choose you, to hold me at night 
It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right 
I choose you, I choose you Everybody has one, 
A choice they get to make 
Half human half heaven 
That decides the family tree 
Now we all pick the branches 
That then becomes the roots 
I choose you, I choose you I choose you, to be by my side 
I choose you, to hold me at night 
It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right 
I choose you, I choose you I was worried I would not know what to do 
If I was in these shoes 
Standing here it's clearer than the sky is blue 
That I choose you, I choose you 
With so little we control, thank God it's in the rules 
We get to choose, and I choose you I choose you, to be by my side 
I choose you, to hold me at night 
It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right 
I choose you, I choose you
