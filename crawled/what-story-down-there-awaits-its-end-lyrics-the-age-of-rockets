A steady hand at dooms blank stare 
with voices calling you back to bed. 
Delancey Street trembles beneath 
as you rise to meet the day It's a long night wide awake 
with work in the morning and I'm 
Saving each word from certain death 
always look right, always turn left 
and I'm up to meet you there 
Cat got your tongue and left the rest 
got chased around like marionettes 
and i'm up to meet you there
