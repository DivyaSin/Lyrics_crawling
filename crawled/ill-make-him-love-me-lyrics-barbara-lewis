If it's the last thing that I do, I'll make him love me 
If dreams are things that still come true, I'll make him love 
Nothings impossible in this crazy world 
Yesterday's miracle's just happened to me 
Tomorrow's reality, oh wait and see Although he may not want me now, I'll make him love me 
I'm gonna get his heart somehow, I'll make him love me [Repeat: x2] 
Life's unpredictable, but one thing's for sure 
Just as I know tomorrow follows today 
I know that I'll find a way to make him love me 
I'll make him love me Oh I'm gonna make him love me, wait and see 
Oh how he's gonna love me and fade
