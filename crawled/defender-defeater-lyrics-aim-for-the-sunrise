i'm afraid we'll all get stuck in this hole. 
in the arms of broken men, they fill it up. 
and let it grow old. 
we are the dead and the living are laughing at us. 
they turned us against ourselfs, crush us all at once. but i've got something here, that they cant reach. 
i will not give in. they can try, oh they can try, but they'll never kill this 
they can try, oh they can try, but they'll never kill this And even if they break my hands, i will not give in. 
and even if they break my hands, i will not give in. it's not a burden, it's a curse. 
we are forgotten, what could be worse. 
it's not a burden it's a curse. it's not a burden, it's a curse. 
we are forgotten, what could be worse. 
it's not a burden, it's a curse. 
we are forgotten, what could be worse. and even if they break my hands, i will not give in. 
so lay down your heart, so lay down your starving heart. so hold your tounge, dont say a word, theres nothing you can do, so hold your tounge, dont say a word. so lay down your starving heart, there's no end to this. 
we are the backbone, what's left when we're gone. but i've got something here, something you could never understand, here i am broken, here i am pure. if there's no one above us, then why are we created, if we live with no purpose, then why are we placed on this earth. 
if there's no one above us, then why are we created, if we live with no purpose, then why are we placed on this earth. 
(i'll bury you with the sky, along with their hearts, i'll bury you with the sky.) Spoken words: And we're all just waiting for the conquerors to come, for a chance to defend our homes. The home that we have betrayed. He wears the key to his heart around his neck. we have tried so long to defend whats ours, and now that they had won. 
we have tried so long to defend whats ours, whats left to defend.
