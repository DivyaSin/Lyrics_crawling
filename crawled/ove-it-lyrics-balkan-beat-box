Move it, we wanna bust your radio 
Move it, double a shot like stereo 
Move it, we move the train to carry y'all 
Ho no no 
Move it, one time let's give it all a go 
Move it, push it on up and let it blow 
Move it, might be the end but you don't know 
Ho no no Life is on top of all 
And it's my favorite 
I might fly with it 
I might drown in it 
I might look aside of it 
but I can't ignore it 
Don't be the ignorant 
Who turns his back on it 
And now we are in a race 
And now u show your face 
If u can't find your place 
then we can show u how to send u to outer space 
to fly on your own We move the train to carry y'all 
So u can skip the barrier 
And move it to your area 
So we can bust your radio 
And speak out through your speakers 
And scream out to the sleepers 
They freak out when they hear us 
we make beats like gorillas 
in this giant concrete jungle 
the digital monkeys on a move 
talking straight, we never mumble 
making sure your dancing feet will move Blue Eyed Black Boy
