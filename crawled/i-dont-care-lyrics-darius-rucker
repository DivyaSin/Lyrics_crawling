Is ten o'clock in the morning, 
To early to drink beer? 
I don't know, and I don't care. When a girl walks by in a two piece, 
Is it impolite to stare? 
I don't know, and I don't care. I don't know, what beach this is, 
I don't know, what day this is, 
I don't know, if I packed enough clothes to wear, 
And I don't care. Hey man do you think those are real or you think there fake? 
You mean those? Right there, 
Hell, I don't know, 
And I don't care. Do you want the blond or the brunette? 
Or the one with the long red hair, 
I don't know, 
And I don't care. I don't know, what her name is, 
I don't know, where she learned to kiss, 
I don't know, if that's her boyfriend over there, 
And I don't care. Is four o'clock in the morning, 
To late to drink beer? 
I don't know, but you know what? 
I don't care. I don't know, last time I ate, 
I don't know, how I'm still awake, 
I don't know, how long a man can live on beer. Man, I don't know where I left my phone, 
I don't know, when we're going home, 
I don't know, if I still got a job up there, 
And I don't care. I don't care, 
I don't know, 
And I don't care.
