lyrics: G. Gross, C. Capek, A. Humpe 
music: A. Humpe I'm leavin' on a jet plane, but all the same, 
I still don't know when I'll be back again, 
But don't be afraid and don't be blue, 'cause you know that it's true, 
That when I'm up above, I'll be smiling down on you, And I'll be thinkin' about you every minute of each day, 
And even if you can't see me, then I'll still find a way 
To show you that I'm all right, so don't cry, baby, don't cry, 
'Cause you and me, we last longer than a lifetime, And now I see that it's true, if love comes from the heart, 
Even if one of us is gone, we'll never part, 
And like I'm waiting for you, just wait for me, too, 
And then we'll always make it through, me and you Refrain: 
Wait for me, it's time to say good bye, 
Wait for me, I hate to see you cry, 
Always I will keep you on my mind, 
Always you're the best one I could find. Won't be forever .... never say never Just imagine that I'm taking a trip to a better place 
And that you'll take the same trip and we'll be face to face 
And then we'll never be apart from each other again, 
But baby girl, until then Just let the sun be my face and let the moon be my soul, 
And let the rain be my tears when I'm out of control 
And let the stars be my eyes watching over your sleep every night 
Just to see if you're safe and if you're all right. 'Cause now I see that it's rue, if love comes from the heart, 
Even if one of us is gone, we'll never part, 
And like I'm waiting for you, just wait for me, too, 
And then we'll always make it through, me and you. Refrain 2 x
