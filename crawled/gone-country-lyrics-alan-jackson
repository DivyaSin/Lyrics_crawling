She's been playin' in a room on the strip 
For ten years in Vegas 
Every night she looks in the mirror, 
And she only ages 
She's been readin' 'bout Nashville on the records, 
That everybody's buyin' 
Says, I'm a simple girl myself, grew up on Long Island 
So she packs her bags 
To try her hand 
Says, This might be, my last chance She's gone country, 
Look at 'dem boots 
She's gone country, 
Back to her roots 
She's gone country, 
A new kinda suit 
She's gone country, 
Here she comes Well the folk seems dead, 
But he's holdin' out in the village 
He's been writing songs, 
Speakin' out against wealth and privilege 
He says, I don't believe in money, but a man can make him a killin' 
Cause, some of that stuff don't sound much different then Dylan I hear down there,

Look at 'dem boots 
He's gone country, 
Back to his roots 
He's gone country, 
A new kinda' suit

Here he comes He commutes to LA, 
But he's gotta house in the valley 
But the bills are pilin' up, 
And the crop scene just ain't on the rally 
He says, Honey I'm a serious compose, good in voice and composition 
With the crime and the smog these days, 
This ain't no place for children 
Lord it sounds so easy, 
It shouldn't take long 
He'll be back in the money, 
In no time at all He's gone country, 
Look at 'dem boots 
He's gone country, 
Back to his roots 
He's gone country, 
A new kinda' suit 
He's gone country, 
Here he comes Yaah, he's gone country, 
A new kind of walk 
He's gone country, 
A new kinda of talk 
He's gone country, 
Look at 'dem boots 
He's gone country, 
Oh, back to his roots 
He's gone country, He's gone country, 
Everybody's gone country 
Yeah, we've gone country 
The whole world's gone country 
We gone
