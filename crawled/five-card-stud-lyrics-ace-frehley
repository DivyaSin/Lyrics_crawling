I was born the son of a car shark 
With a deck in my hand 
I'm the best at playing the game 
I'm known throughout the land At the tables you'll find me 
A stack of chips by my side 
Poker Gin or 21 
A wining hand is my pride Just cut the pack 
I'll take the one-eyed Jack 
There's no holding back 
I call your bluff It ain't no crime 
Winning all the time 
The money's on the line I play for blood 
I'm the five card stud Don't try to con me 
Let's get it understood 
You'll never get one past me 
I know every trick in the book I'll play you double or nothing 
If you think you're so good Lets go for broke 
Afraid you're gonna choke 
Got one slim hope 
That ain't enough Well you're outta luck 
Lost your bottom buck 
I hit a royal flush 
And I smell blood 
I'm the five card stud
