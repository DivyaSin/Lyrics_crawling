I've been known by the fractured queen 
And I have cornered all the scenes. 
I have loved and I have lost 
But now I am found, oh yes, I am found 
I've been raptured by love before 
Cut my tongue trying to have some more 
Wanted what I could not take 
So I had to reach the sky, oh I had to reach the sky. 
Because I know things can never be the same so 
I reach up and touch the sky 
I'm so healed as I try, try and touch the sky. 
I've heard screams from beyond the door 
Fractured love lying on the floor 
There are hands that try as they may 
They try and get so high, human hands try and get so high. 
I've been raptured be love be for 
The Queen is come'n and she wants more 
Fractured fingers for those who claw 
For a lost love to be found, for a love to be found.
