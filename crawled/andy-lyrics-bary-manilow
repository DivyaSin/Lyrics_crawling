I remember all my life 
Raining down as cold as ice 
Shadows of a man, a face through a window 
Cryin' in the night, the night goes into mornin' Just another day 
Happy people pass my way 
Lookin' in their eyes, I see a memory 
I never realized, you made me so happy Oh Brand, oops 
Well, you came and you gave without takin' 
But I sent you away, oh Mandy 
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shakin' 
And I need you today, oh Mandy I'm standing on the edge of time 
I walked away when love was mine 
Caught up in a world of uphill climbin' 
The tears are on my mind and nothin' is rhymin' Oh Mandy 
Well, you came and you gave without takin' 
But I sent you away, oh Mandy 
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shakin' 
And I need you today, oh Mandy Yesterday's a dream, I face the mornin' 
Cryin' on the breeze, the pain is callin' Oh Mandy 
Well, you came and you gave without takin' 
But I sent you away, oh Mandy 
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shakin' 
And I need you today, oh Mandy Well, you came and you gave without takin' 
But I sent you away, oh Mandy 
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shakin' 
And I need you today, oh Mandy, oh Mandy
