I want you to think about it, To think about the things that he said 
I want you to live without it, To breathe without the bruises on your head 
I want you to sleep without it, To sleep without the demon in your bed 
I want you to live without it, To breathe without it, Without a doubt 
Gotta run, Gotta run, Got to getaway 
Gotta run, Gotta run, Get you somewhere safe 
Gotta run, Gotta gotta getaway 
Gotta run away, Gotta getaway 
Don't want you to think about it, To think about the things that he did 
Don't want you to think about it, Forget about it, Without a doubt 
I want you to think about yourself, Gotta get you out of your 
Prison cell, There's got to be some other way, Gotta getaway 
Get yourself out of your fuckin' menagerie Ah yeah, Gotta getaway 
I want you to think about it, To think about think about yourself 
I want you to get out of it, Get the fuck out of your spousal hell
