It's a shame about the roadblock, we're afraid that we'll get caught or stopped 
Let's go right now, surf city eastern block 
I'm in the trunk my surf board on top The eighties ain't been kind to anyone, I just wanna find myself some sun 
It's 1984, we're on the run, goodbye Berlin, hello Autobahn It's a shame about the roadblock 
If they catch us, we won't ever talk 
Let's go right now surf city eastern block
