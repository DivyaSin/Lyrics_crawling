I wouldn't want to waste the wold 
I had to help for hell back haunting 
I wouldn't want to waste the wold 
I had to help for hell back haunting Don't let it fall don't let it fall 
Don't you ever give up 
But I keep letting it fall go live it up 
To the end of it all Don't let go don't let go 
This is your time just for the moment 
Don't let go don't let go 
I want to take it all on I wouldn't want to waste the wold 
I had to help for hell back haunting 
I wouldn't want to waste the wold 
I had to help for hell back haunting Why waste the love on anyone 
Can you killer of all 
Forever young go live it up 
Haven't you had enough Don't let go don't let go 
This is your time just for the moment 
Don't let go don't let go 
I want to take it all on Where do you go when your heart turns cold 
And you're over joyed cause you lost yourself 
Where do you go when your heart still cold 
Whoa oh Don't let go don't let go 
(I got my gun but I lost my lips) 
(cause I shot it off I shot it quick) 
Don't let go don't let go 
(and I lost my gun but I found my lips) 
(I shot them up I sowed them shut ) 
Don't let go don't let go 
(this is your time just for the moment) 
Don't let go don't let go 
(I want to take it all on)
