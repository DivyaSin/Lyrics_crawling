I'm trying to get back to the day 
When my bitch came runnin' 
From the dead end way 
Holding her close in my arms 
Yeah my world was doing fine, 
Staying away, breaking away as I try 
To sell her lies. But now I feel you again 
And you left me as I climb 
Over the pains, over the chains of my mind 
Where the freedom springs from the well of my heart 
And the love shines through as he kisses the dark 
And the beast smiles up the frown 
Into sound Now I'm trying to roll with the day 
As my love keeps runnin' 
From the dead end way 
One touch I gotta feel you again 
And you left me as I climb 
Over the pains, over the chains of my mind 
Where freedom springs from the well of my heart 
Where the love shinesthrough as he kisses the dark 
And the beast smiles up the frown 
Into sound
