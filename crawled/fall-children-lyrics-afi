As the cries start to penetrate 
Still air 
This day we celebrate 
The wait now ends From four corners smoke plumes into a reddened sky 
(Woah oh, woah oh) 
In the face of lantern light, tonight, my destiny flies 
(Woah oh, woah oh) 
Oh oh This day so hallowed 
This day so hallowed 
From here to forever, its will I will follow 
This day so hallowed 
This day so hallowed 
Tonight will come to life Deadened branches stirred by whispers in the wind 
(Woah oh, woah oh) 
Fall children fill the streets at dusk, at last, it all will begin 
(Woah oh, woah oh) 
Oh oh This day so hallowed 
This day so hallowed 
From here to forever, its will I will follow 
This day so hallowed 
This day so hallowed 
Tonight will come to life Oh oh oh 
Oh, hallowed, hallowed, hallowed 
Hallowed, hallowed, yeah Fall children This day so hallowed 
This day so hallowed 
From here to forever, its will I will follow 
This day so hallowed 
This day so hallowed 
Tonight will come to life 
(Woah, oh oh oh) 
To life 
(Woah oh oh)
