Don't always know all the answers 
When people say I've gone astray 
Don't always know what I'm doin' half the time 
Makin' a mess every day And yet, my lips recall what I can do when I feel small I still find comfort in these words 
In the voice in the southern night sky 
And the words that I learned help me out when I've burned 
Every bridge in this pitiful life And I don't understand all the meanings 
And I don't always know what to say 
But I'm only sixteen and I think I believe 
I can still find my way 
Oh - I still pray When folks say I'm lost and won't amount to much 
I think of how Momma would pray 
Believin' that somebody's listn'in' above 
That someone is guidin' the way My tears still recall, all that she taught, when I was small I still find comfort in these words 
In this voice in the southern night sky 
And the words that I learned help me out when I've burned 
Every bridge in this pitiful life And I don't understand all the meanings 
And I don't always know what to say 
But I'm only sixteen and I think I believe 
I can still find my way 
Oh - I still pray Words comin' back to my mind 
Brought to my knees in the darkness 
Words leadin' me to the light 
Seeds that Momma had sown 
Are all the hope that I've known 
They tell me I'm not alone I still find comfort in these words 
In that voice in the southern night sky 
And the words that I learned help me out when I've burned 
Every bridge in this pitiful life And I don't understand all the meanings 
And I don't always know what to say 
But I'm only sixteen and I think I believe 
I can still find my way I still find comfort in these words 
In His voice in the southern night sky 
And the words that I learned help me out when I've burned 
Every bridge in this pitiful life And I don't understand all the meanings 
And I don't always know what to say 
But I'm only sixteen and I think I believe 
I can still find my way 
Oh - I still pray Oh - I still pray
