Somewhere the wind is whispering 
Into somebody's ear 
Somewhere someone is hearing 
Just what they want to hear 
Somewhere somebody's savior 
Has finally appeared 
The kind that makes great poetry 
And abbreviates careers Love all, trust a few 
Jehoshaphat the genius 
Said to Bosco the Kid 
Come and get it, 
Youth is served, 
You're gonna love it, kid 
Don't get it on your clothes, 
Don't put it up your nose 
Pass the madness 'neath the door, 
Pass the madness 'neath the door Love all, trust a few 
Given time I can find 
A reason to love anyone 
A reason to love anyone Somewhere a man is washing 
His clothing in a fountain 
Somewhere a man is throwing pennies 
Not bothering to count them 
Somewhere a man's reflection 
Reveals nothing about him 
Somewhere a man's forgetting 
All of this was once a mountain
