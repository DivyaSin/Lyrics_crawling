You make me walk and look beyond 
Everything that can be said in silence; 
That in each and every touching 
Make out a new world rising. Awaken I can realized you 
Asleep Im dreaming about you; 
And when you keep so close to me 
Your arms become my shelter. Chorus: Letter of love 
You took me higher 
With your love and charming happiness 
With the way you are; 
So special you have to see beyond 
You are my force and strength 
Supportive one, My shoulder. You my love, my friend, my lover 
My wish, and my dream love; 
You fulfill my deepest heartbeats 
Deep in pleasure, something beautiful. Without your touch i imagine you 
When I was sleeping i felt you; 
You move me far from over 
The home of desire your kisses.
