Another Sunday, another one way road away from home 
I keep thinking one day I'm going to wake up far from what I've known 
There's a man, he's going to cheat me if he can 
He's looking for someone to scam Here I am with my guts out in my hand, looking for some place to stand 
It's hard to hold on to what you're found when what comes around always goes around 
Here we go round and around on the outside 
Do we know how to hold on with our hands tied? Another Sunday ,ain't no change in how we're living now 
I keep hoping one day maybe Monday will be, will be different somehow 
In the end there are lovers, there are friends, there are liars who pretend 
They'll cheat you if they can- seems to be their master plan To leave you with an empty hand 
And it's hard to hold on to what you're found when what comes around always goes around 
Here we go round and around on the outside 
Do we know how to hold on with our hands tied? Here we go turning around one the inside 
Do we know how to hold ..can we survive? 
Work for so long and we try to be strong 
Time just keeps moving us along It's hard to be right when everything's wrong 
But we've got to keep on...
