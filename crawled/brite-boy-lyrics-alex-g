Brite boy I can help you if you let me take your hand 
Bring you right to promise land, bring you right to promise Brite boy I can help you if you let me be your wife 
Love you so for all my life, love you so for all my Waiting by the water you return with eyes cast down 
Brite boy what has made you frown brite boy what has made you Waiting by the water sun is setting on the sea 
Brite boy please return to me Brite boy please return to me
