Goin' to Detroit, Michigan 
Girl, I can't take you 
Hey, I'm goin' to Detroit, Michigan 
Girl, you got to stay here behind Goin' to get me a job 
On the Cadillac assembly line I'm tired of whoopin' and hollerin' 
Up and down the Mississippi road 
Hey, I'm tired of whoopin' and hollerin' 
Pickin' that nasty cotton Gonna catch me a bus up North 
I won't have to keep sayin' yes, sir, boss Goin' to Detroit, Michigan 
Girl, I can't take you 
Hey, I'm goin' to Detroit, Michigan 
Girl, you got to stay here behind Goin' to get me a job 
On the Cadillac assembly line Well, girl, if you'll be alright 
And keep your blue jeans zipped up tight 
When I make my first check
