Watch the skies light up Lybia tonight 
Last whispers come bleeding from lips 
They stole your freedom for military might 
Prostituted like the whores of the apocolypse [Chorus:] 
Reagen plays the liar - power's his desire, theres nothing for the world we can do! 
Reagen plays the lyre - the flames are burning higher, while the world burns down around you! They say they're telling us the honest truth, 
Then they stab us in the back and lie to our face. 
They say they're building a new free world, 
But it's just the empire of a new master race. 
They say "It's not our policy to kill civilians, 
But it's to make the world safe for democracy..." 
The fact they're still lying while our children are dying 
Only stands as proof of man's insanity. [Chorus] Do you wave the flag, can you support a man 
Who'd rather arm the world than give it food. 
As the new master twists the nuclear screw, 
He laughs as Kiev burns on the six o'clock news. [Chorus] They say they're telling us the honest truth, 
Then they stab us in the back and lie to our face. 
They say they're building a new free world, 
But it's just the empire of a new master race. 
They say "It's not our policy to kill civilians, 
But it's to make the world safe for democracy..." 
The fact they're still lying while our children are dying 
Only stands as proof of man's insanity. Reagen plays the liar - power's his desire, theres nothing for the world we can do!
