Nu Afrika! 
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah..... 
Pay Attention! Taa! 
Saa!! 
Raa!!! 
We're back on this hustlers who say they're hot 
Get off ma stove or maybe not 
They're burning their bones 
Heavens gate is locked 
Yeah.. They thought their swag was hot now they're claiming they're cold 
And all eyes on you, it don't mean you know 
My good wife is the hard work 
You move like you're ignorant 
Let me show you how the world look like Chorus:(Arabic) 
Haftalah Haftalah Bethlalim Ball J Beat (2x) 
Haftalah Haftalah Bethlalim [Ball J Beat (3x)] 
(The best in the world, the best in the world, Ball J Beat) All eyes on you 
All eyes fall on you 
God's hands on you 
All eyes on the government 
And all eyes on living presidents and they lie 
And all eyes on dead presidents money don't lie 
Here in Africa that's where the good dies and bad flies 
Here in Africa this where the gold and jewels lie 
Its like everything lies down, here in Africa this where the truth lies Chorus:(Arabic) 
Haftalah Haftalah Bethlalim Ball J Beat (2x) 
Haftalah Haftalah Bethlalim [Ball J Beat (3x)] 
(The best in the world, the best in the world, Ball J Beat) Talk about ballers am real 
Real recognize the deal 
Been here for a minute for real 
When I perish you inherit 
Doing time making meal 
Am down with ma shield not down with ma shield 
Never gave up on ma field 
Goodbye to the hustle 
Welcome to the kingdom 
Goodbye to the system 
New Africa the rhythm 
From hasville to a skilli to a milli in ma deali 
All eyes on ma busi 
Am really the busai 
If you grew up in this cells 
And got old on the streets 
They're going all well but you're going on your knees 
You should celebrate and live 
The book of life is a give 
Don't be acting like you're ignorant 
Let me show you how the world look like Chorus:(Arabic) 
Haftalah Haftalah Bethlalim Ball J Beat (2x) 
Haftalah Haftalah Bethlalim [Ball J Beat (3x)] 
(The best in the world, the best in the world, Ball J Beat) You don't wanna pay for one thing; your sins 
But you can pay for one thing; attention 
All the tvs you be watching and cds you're rocking 
this how this worlds going to end and you still watch it Reversed Chorus Repeat
