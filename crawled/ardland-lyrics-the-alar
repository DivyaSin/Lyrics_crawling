Hardland ripped & torn apart 
Hard dreams leave scarred 
In the lines of my face 
The story of faith 
Hardland I came back 
Home to a hardland 
Where a man is judged 
By the scars on his face 
Where that sliding scale still operates 
To come home, I had to go away from here HARDLAND I saw a land 
Standing at the crossroads 
I saw her wrath 
Burning in a burned out home 
Saw her tears 
In rivers running cold 
Her tragedy, waiting to explode 
In the HARDLAND 
Ripped and torn apart 
Hard dreams 
Leave me scarred 
In the lines of my face 
A story of faith HARDLAND I feel afraid 
When I think about my children 
I feel scared 
When I walk down a street at night 
Feel sad 
When I look on the flag 
I feel the anger 
Rising in the heart of the 
HARDLAND 
Ripped and torn apart 
Hard dreams 
Leave me scarred 
In the lines of my face 
A story of faith HARDLAND Wherever I wander across this land 
Of my fathers 
The valley is ripped and the mountain scarred 
Tom apart 
A house is ablaze on the hillside 
A sign says "This land is not for sale" HARDLAND Ripped and tom apart 
Hard dreams 
Leave me scarred 
In the lines of my face 
A story of faith HARDLAND 
(Hardland) The Lines On My Face HARDLAND Ripped and tom apart 
Hard dreams 
Leave me scarred 
In the lines of my face 
A story of faith HARDLAND 
HARDLAND 
HARDLAND 
Hard dreams 
HARDLAND 
HARDLAND
