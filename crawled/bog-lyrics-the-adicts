Oh God, you are my hero, 
You're my main man. 
Oh God, you are my hero, 
You're my main man. I read the bible everyday 
To see what you have got to say 
It doesn't make no sense to me 
I'd rather read the beano! Oh God, you are my hero, 
You're my main man. 
Oh God, you are my hero, 
You're my main man. So what if I dont go to heaven? 
It's all a load of '27' 
I'll have a better time in hell, 
Don't want to be an angel! Oh God, you are my hero, 
You're my main man. 
Oh God, you are my hero, 
You're my main man. The things you preach are out of reach 
I'm getting crucified! 
How viddy he bog as a rabid dog 
Selling fucking lies!? Oh God, you are my hero, 
You're my main man. 
Oh Bog! 
Oh God, you are my hero, 
You're my main man. 
Oh Bog!
