1.When the sun falls from the sky 
and the muse begins to fly 
Then she will come to wrestle me 
Just as I am about to sleep 
When the moonlight in the fall 
Make some movie on the wall 
Then she will come to tears 
Shes afraid of fall from reality Ref: Walk around the world tonight 
See these places theyre only in my mind 
I see everything - beautiful things 
I can do the garden in your hair 
Visualize the city in the air 
Where little faces in little squares 
Talk to me 
I am late 
I am late 2.If a man cant learn to bend 
Like a reed does in the breeze 
Then how will he ever comprehend 
All of lifes sweet mysteries. Ref: Walk around the world tonight
