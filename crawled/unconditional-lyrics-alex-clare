You don't need nothing at all, but you need this good love 
Good love, whoa, whoa, whoa You need love 
Off some of mine 
Got no time for ache 
That's just fine 
Life's too short 
To be angry 
Take it out 
Take it out on me Get to know ya 
I wanna play a part 
I wanna know every inch of your heart 
So let rain 
A love supreme of the unconditional kind 
It's what we all dream of 
It's what we all dream of I don't, no, I don't know enough

Good love, whoa, whoa, whoa Be it now 
If you wanna be 
I got something to give, no negativity 
Don't know what it is 
But, it is something good 
And I won't let it lie or be misunderstood 
There is nothing 
Nothing left to say 
So, I show my actions 
In the deepest way 
The riddle of you 
So selfless 
Never be broken 
I feel helpless 
Feel helpless I don't, no, I don't know enough
