She deserves it and can't get used to so much joy 
But hopes that she deserves it 
Can't believe there's so much love around her now It wasn't always there 
She wouldn't even dare to think it could be her glad and so lucky 
Sadly, the pain is still inside her 
It leaves a little doubt in her gentle heart She deserves it and can't get used to so much joy 
But hopes that she deserves it 
Can't believe there's so much love around her now Not in her wildest dreams 
Could she ever see herself to be with him blessed and so happy 
One day there'll be not trace of sadness 
But only fearless faith in her gentle heart
