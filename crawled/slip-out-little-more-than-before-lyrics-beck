I don't know since when I changed to such a cold-hearted guy 
I have to warm this frozen, icy, lonely heart to thaw 
I like being wrapped with warmness more than anything else for sure 
I'm gonna take my coming days and fill them with laughter and joy I let myself down by being crueler than I thought I would be 
I'm just a loser learning to care for the soul inside of me 
I don't give my heart to no one cause I don't wanna waste my time 
I tried to love this loneliness to slip out from where it hides [Chorus] 
Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown my sensations 
Regrets taught me how to make any hard decisions 
Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once 
Love is not a word reserved only for sweet romance Well, I'm scared,I'm scared,I'm scared,I'm scared to death 
And I'm scared to keep on going on my way 
Well, I'm scared,I'm scared,I'm scared,I'm scared to death 
And I'll tell myself I'm special till the end Recalling my torn, broken, aching heart of these long days 
And all the memories I wanted to forget for making waves 
Recalling, breaking, aching, crying, making sure I see 
That'll take it all and grin at the future on it's way to me... [Chorus] I don't give my heart to no one cause I don't wanna waste my time 
I tried to love this loneliness to slip out from where it hides...
