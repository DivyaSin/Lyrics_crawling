As the night moves in 
Love takes on a new meaning 
If you were here 
You would know what I mean to say The circumstance leaves me only waiting 
For the chance 
I only want to love you more, more 
Can't you understand it Girl you know how much I care 
It's not the way I planned it no 
If you could only know my feelings 
You would know how much I do believe If you were here tonight 
By my side 
If you were with me now 
When the lights go out I can not pretend 
This bed?s too big for me 
To be in alone all alone 
Slow burn light a candle for our love, love So we'll always be one to one in love ooh love 
Can't you understand it 
Girl you know how much I care 
It's not the way I planned it no If you could only know my feelings 
You would know how much I do believe 
If you were here tonight oh love 
By my side If you were with me now 
Every night alone I just wait here anticipating 
For the day I won't feel this pain baby 
Please don't keep me waiting Come to me 
If you were here tonight 
Ooh oh girl 
Be by my side Girl this bed's too big for me 
For me to be in all alone 
All alone 
(By my side) Don't keep me waiting baby 
If you were with me now 
Oh oh ooh hold me girl all night 
Want you for myself Do me right 
Got nobody else 
All by myself 
Got nobody else girl This love is true 
Please take me home 
Be with you tonight 
Give our love a light Do just what you feel 
Please don't be a tease 
Girl I love you more 
You're the one that I adore
