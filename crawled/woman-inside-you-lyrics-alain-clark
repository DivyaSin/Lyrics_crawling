The only reason that I'm bringing this up 
Is 'cause I think you don't even know it 
Maybe somewhere along the way you forgot 
How to carry it or how to show it And I don't mind for a second reminding you 
Of every bit of gold you're made of

Who you should always rely on

Is hot, fierce, full and dangerous like fire Funny how it's kind of a thing 
That you can never really see what I see 
And let me tell you girl you better believe it 
You're so perfect to me 
And all I wanna do is remind you girl 
Of every bit of shine around ya 
Oh God given beauty
