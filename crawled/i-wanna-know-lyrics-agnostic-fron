In a world of made up hero's 
Broken promises and zeros 
I can't seem to see much worse than this 
I want to know, want to know what's going on? 
want to know what's going on today In a world not fact but fiction 
Fairytales and drug addictions 
I can't seem to see much worse than this 
I want to know, want to know what's going on? 
want to know what's going on today I want to know 
I want to know 
I want to know 
What's going on today! I've got no feeling, I've got no feeling there's 
No more feelings inside of me In a world of constant hate 
Rape and murder chalked up to fake 
I can't seem to see much worse than this 
I want to know, want to know what's going on? 
want to know what's going on today I want to know 
I want to know 
I want to know 
What's going on today! 
What's going on today! Everything is alright today 
Everything is alright today I've got no feeling,got no feeling 
I've got no feelings inside of me
