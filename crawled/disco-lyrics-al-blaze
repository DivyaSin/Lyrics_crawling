Bring it to the dance floor 
Bring it to the dance floor 
Bring it to the dance floor 
Bring it to the dance floor 
Who dance we dance everybody dance 
Welcome to the Disco 
Left foot first when I go in 
Look left look right 
Everybody looking 
Back at me 
Throw my hands up hear them scream 
Move my body to the laser beam 
One step two step everybody moving 
Feel the sweat on my skin 
Love the crowd love the scene 
Love the girls young old and teens 
Short skirt tight skirt tight jeans 
Love white love black 
Yellow and green 
Love them all like a sex machine 
I wanna lick them like whip cream 
Lick who lick them lick me 
I want to party Throw my hands up in the air 
Go through the crowd and make my way 
Comon DJ turn it up and let it play 
Crank it up all the way 
Grab one grab two grab three 
One booty two whos grabbing me 
Get down get up and turn slow 
Let me feel you touch your toe 
I wanna hump your bump 
Feel you up its getting hot 
Rub your body back on mine 
Damn baby girl you feel so fine 
Yelling timber as I fall 
Watch my feet move on the floor 
Hear screams begging for more 
I wanna party Everybody knows when I walk in 
Tall handsome with a white skin 
Party from Atlanta to Berlin 
Sarajevo Paris to Dublin 
All the cities where Ive been 
Calling me mister original sin 
Yup thats me so come and see 
How we let it be when we party 
Scream and jump and go crazy 
Thats how we do in the USA 
So whos with me down to see 
Crazy night where you can be free 
Whos ready to party 
NY LA San Francisco
