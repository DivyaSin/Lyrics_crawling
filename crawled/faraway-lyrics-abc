What a state to be in 
It's a world of indecision 
So self destructive 
And such an ugly business In and out of fashion 
You always leave your mark 
An indefinite decision 
A dangerous remark ** when you're cold and tired 
Don't turn your head away 
The distance that's between us 
Gets bigger every day * how come you never see 
You're as faraway as faraway can be 
You're as faraway as faraway can be You try so hard to impress 
You talk the telephone to death 
It's what you can't see that counts 
But you haven't worked that out yet There is no reason 
There is no plan 
The truth can be deceptive 
From such a quiet man There's madness in your words 
Not wishing to be heard 
But just like yesterday 
You've already slipped away (* repeat) 
(** repeat) 
(* repeat) You're as faraway as faraway 
As faraway as faraway 
As faraway as faraway 
As faraway as faraway 
As faraway as faraway 
As faraway from me as you can be
