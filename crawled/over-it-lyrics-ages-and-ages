I'm over it, I'm over it, I'm over it, uh huh 
I'm over it, I'm over it, I'm over it, uh huh Even in my apartment 
With the noise of the freeway 
And I feel so separate 
Yet I feel no shame I'm over it, I'm over it, I'm over it, uh huh 
I'm over it, I'm over it, I'm over it, uh huh And all they tell me is progress 
I don't want any part of 
And I feel no remorse 
No, I feel no shame Found it and it's all 
Just as we thought it should be 
Waited up forever 
Or what seemed like it to me And I have (and I have) no remorse (no remorse) 
For the way that I am anymore 
No I feel (no I feel) feel no shame (feel no shame) 
If you want you could just look away And I have (and I have) no remorse (no remorse) 
For the way that I am anymore 
No I feel (no I feel) feel no shame (feel no shame) 
If you want you can just look away And I have (and I have) no remorse (no remorse) 
For the way that I am anymore 
No I feel (no I feel) feel no shame (feel no shame) 
If you want you can just look away
