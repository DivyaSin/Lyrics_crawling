There's a reason that he did what he did 
And he said what he said to me 
He lived it and watched it 
I can still hear him telling me 
Someday, somewhere the sky is gonna fall 
But remember this When your going through it all 
There's a joy in the sadness 
There's love in the hard times 
A rainbow in the clouds 
Gold in water 
Just when you think you hit rock bottom 
There's wings for the broken 
Doors that will open 
When your running out of faith 
There's answers in you heart 
You're stronger than you think you are It was April the red bus were blooming 
When she came to me that day 
She said I love you but I hate what I'm doing 
Holding you back this way 
Somewhere out there your star is gonna shine Chorus
