I can't believe how tightly 
you can shut your eyes 
Mouth open wide your words say more 
than any text book could 
I've never seen nothing 
take up so much space 
Your wisdom rings hollow 
It's just some shit that your drunk father 
nailed into your head when you were ten 
He stomped on your mind 
You could not bridge the gap 
between you and me 
Some things are better left unsaid 
But I can't just smile - nod my head when 
I should be screaming - Screaming at the sun 
So I waste my fucking time beating my head 
against brick fucking walls 
Sharing words with you 
With you
