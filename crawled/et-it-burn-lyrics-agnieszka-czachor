[Verse 1] 
It's just another kind of living 
When your thoughts are not just a thoughts 
You can't wait to see the day you'll believe in 
Cause it's the only one that you've lost [Pre-chorus] 
So you sit and stare 
Trying to understand [Chorus] 
Now you're running away, running away 
Feeling something again, something again 
But you'll never see, 
Many of your dream 
Every word that was said, word that was said 
Kills you inside your head, inside your head 
If you're strong enough 
Take it as light in the dark Let it BURN! [Verse 2] 
Everyone thinks that you were right 
Cause last night you promised not to cry 
Even your smile is not the same 
You know that there's something more to learn [Pre-chorus] 
So you sit and stare 
Trying to understand [Chorus] 
Now you're running away, running away 
Feeling something again, something again 
But you'll never see, 
Many of your dream 
Every word that was said, word that was said 
Kills you inside your head, inside your head 
If you're strong enough 
Take it as light in the dark Let it BURN! [Bridge] 
Don't ruin your life for fear 
You're too young for this 
Now you see the wave of pain 
Hold on and pray 
You can't be save and tamed 
One day you'll understand 
That real worries about time 
That you've got to be alive! [Chorus] 
Now you're running away, running away 
Feeling something again, something again 
But you'll never see, 
Many of your dream 
Every word that was said, word that was said 
Kills you inside your head, inside your head 
If you're strong enough 
Take it as light in the dark Let it BURN! 
Let it BURN! 
Let it BURN! Let it go away, go away 
Let it go away Let it burn
