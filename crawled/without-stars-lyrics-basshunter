Without the stars what would happen with us then? 
Without anything that shines on the sky what would I rest on then? 
Without the stars, say how would we manage then? 
Without anything that brighten up our way 
Whom would we rely on? As we may not forget that all stars are life 
(They are the) life as we (are), although they live in another world 
The world of feelings, where all souls have their place 
In heaven, in life's dream palaces, 
Without the stars Without the stars what would our hearts believe in? 
Without that what helps us to see, how would then our love grow? 
Without the stars could you love me then? 
Would you then feel safe when I'm close to you? As we may not forget that all stars are life 
(They are the) life as we (are), although they live in another world 
The world of feelings, where you and me can find peace, will never end, I hope 
Above the world we live in. Without the stars.
