I'm finally up and I'm strong on my feet 
Been through the war, now nothing rocks me easily 
Don't always want what I get but I get what I want 
You suddenly right beside me up in my face 
Must be from London or Milano 'cause I like your taste 
Maybe I am just the girl that you need Baby, usually I'm never short of the words 
Every drink I have just makes it worse 
My mouth only mumbles, my confidence tumbles 
I crumble inside and I st-st-st-st-stumble [Chorus] 
I've just broken free, got the whole world at my feet 
I'd be crazy, I'd be crazy if I let you take this from me 
I'm a superwomen now, got my superpowers out 
I'd be crazy, I'd be crazy now that I'm cool with me Somebody hold me back before I make a mistake 
There's only so many times a heart can break 
Temptation calls me back for more 
Maybe another time or place I'll let you in 
Just learnt to be happy waking up in my own skin 
Stay sober girl it really ain't worth it You're the sweetness, the cure and a curse 
Saying no, no, no just makes it worse 
My mouth only mumbles, my confidence tumbles 
I crumble inside and I st-st-st-st-stumble [Chorus] Can't let you stay and I can't let you go 
Can't help getting close but I might lose control 
A taste of you, a taste of me 
We chain react like chemistry 
Better stop this now before it's too late 
The more I try to run from you 
The more I get myself confused 
I saved my heart from getting bruised 
But there is nothing, nothing 
I would rather do [Chorus] With me, with me, with me 
Now that I'm cool with me.
