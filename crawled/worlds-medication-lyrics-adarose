Looks like this feeling's here to stay. Looks like I'm feeling this forever. Maybe my sickness isn't that at all. Maybe it's who I am and it will never go away. I can't talk my way out of this one, no drugs or words or herbs will get me out of this one. 
I'm sick they're dying are we all? I'm hungry they're staving are we all? I'm cold they're frozen are we all? I'm hurt they're bleeding for how long? 
This world is getting crazy and the commotion seems to mirror what is in my head. They doctors say they'll fix me, but I'm concerned about what they'll prescribe the world. I can't talk my way out of this one, no drugs or words or herbs will get me out of this one.

If we're all in this together, then who will get us out of this one? The hippies, the leaders, the dreamers, the fools, or is it us? I don't know how you guys are perceiving me, but I've been hungry, starving, dying and bleeding. I might know a little bit about making a change. Mix a little understanding, effort, empathy, here's a prescription for a plan to make a difference in our world. 
Hold hands with a stranger make sure they're warm. Feed them 'til their wounds bleed no more. Do this to a stranger, a neighbour, or someone far away. I'm screaming can you hear me?

Hold hands with me. Make sure I'm warm. Feed me 'til my wounds bleed no more. Do this to a stranger, a neighbour, or someone far away. I'm screaming at my loudest have you heard?
