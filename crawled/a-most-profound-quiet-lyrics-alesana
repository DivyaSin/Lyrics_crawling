We should go ahead and kill her right now 
But her eyes are so lovely 
I can't wait, just imagine how she will suffer 
Would someone please tell me I'm not alright 
How could you fall for my charming charade? Days fade away but guilt still burns inside of me 
I feel as if I am responsible 
Why can't I realize just how the pieces seem to fit? 
I feel as if I am responsible, responsible Does she know before I met her 
I have only dreamt of so much blood? 
So why is she tempting me? 
Can you see the visions of pain? How could I is that possible? 
You must give her to me 
I'm tired of washing my hands clean of what I've done 
'tis to a murderer's den you have come Days fade away but guilt still burns inside of me 
I feel as if I am responsible 
Why can't I realize just how the pieces seem to fit? 
I feel as if I am responsible, responsible It's time we throw away the mask, what have we done? 
We got too attached, we can't let her escape 
This is the last time we ever have to speak again 
She is no longer yours, we can't let her escape 
She's all mine Days fade away but guilt still burns inside of me 
I feel as if I am responsible 
Why can't I realize just how the pieces seem to fit? 
I feel as if I am responsible Does she know before I met her 
I had only dreamt of so much blood? 
So why is she tempting me?
