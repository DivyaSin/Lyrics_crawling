Your love is like an ocean 
So deep and stormy like the sea 
And we are sailing on so free 
The love that means devotion 
So full of life and ecstasy 
The love is huge and it's meager 
Deep in my emotion 
Deep inside my heart I know 
I want you forever 
Deep in my emotion 
I can never let you go, oh no no 
Deep in my emotion 
I'm forever close to you, ooh, ooh 
Girl, love is never easy 
There will be hurt and sometimes pain 
But then you'll see the sun again 
Girl, love is meant forever 
It makes you feel you got a home 
That you are no longer alone 
Deep in my emotion 
Deep inside my heart I know 
I want you forever 
Deep in my emotion 
I can never let you go, oh no no 
Deep in my emotion 
I'm forever close to you, ooh, ooh 
Deep in my emotion 
Deep inside my heart I know 
I want you forever 
Deep in my emotion 
I can never let you go, oh no no 
Deep in my emotion 
I'm forever close to you, ooh, ooh 
Deep in my emotion 
Deep inside my heart I know 
Deep in my emotion 
I can never let you go, oh no no 
Deep in my emotion 
I'm forever close to you, ooh, ooh 
Deep in my emotion...
