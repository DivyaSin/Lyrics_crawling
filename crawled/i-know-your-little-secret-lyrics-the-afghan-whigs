He liked to kiss the boys 
He liked to kiss the girls 
He liked to kiss the in-betweeners 
Rub his tongue on their gums 
Rub his tongue on their gums And lie with them 
And lied to them 
And light it up I know your little secret 
I know your little secret Watch my eyes 
They see what you don't see 
They see what you know 
And what you think I don't know Ah, but now we both can share 
Everything we've ever done 
Everyone we've ever touched 
You liked the boys and girls I know your little secret 
I know your little secret All the lies 
All the hesitation 
Won't bring me closer now 
Won't you bring me close I know your little secret 
I know your little secret 
I know your little secret 
I know your little secret
