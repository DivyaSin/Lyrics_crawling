I'm leaving for a new life 
for a new start an new town 
and a new home I'm leaving leaving this old life 
behind for a new start a new town 
and new home My old life it seemed so rough 
nobody cared but mamma did 
she made my food she fix my bed 
and took me to school Its time for me to leave my old life 
look for a new one maybe a new type 
open my eyes there's a whole word 
out there to find "Woah Oo" I'm gonna do this for my mamma 
not for me and not my father 
my mother she helped me all the way 
i'm leaving home today Sky are blue the sun is out 
bus 59 is on its route 
i pick up my bags and 
i'm leaving this old life behind No gloomy days no restless nights 
no leaky roofs on rainy nights 
i'll find a way to help my mamma 
soon Its time for me to leave my old life 
look for a new one maybe a new type 
open my eyes there's a whole word 
out there to find "Woah Oo" I'm gonna do this for my mamma 
not for me and not my father 
my mother she helped me all the way 
i'm leaving home today I'm leaving home today

look for a new one maybe a new type 
open my eyes there's a whole word 
out there to find "Woah Oo" I'm gonna do this for my mamma 
not for me and not my father 
my mother she helped me all the way
