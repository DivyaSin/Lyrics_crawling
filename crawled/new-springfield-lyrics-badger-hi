If I could see, maybe I'd believe 
And if I could see, maybe I'd believe 
That someone was looking down on me 
And looking after me I've never cried like I did that night 
I've never cried like I did that night 
It's not what I do 
No I won't blink, if it's not real How can you offer me your prayers? 
No one up there seems to care 
I lose one, I lose two, I lose three No one but you will know your pain 
They just think you're weird; they just think you've changed 
I lose one, I lose two, I lose three How can you speak when you're out of your mind? 
How can you speak when you're out of your mind? 
All seems in time, rhythm and rhyme 
When you don't feel small Baby please don't come and save me again 
Baby please don't come and save me again How can you offer me your prayers? 
No one up there seems to care 
I lose one, I lose two, I lose three No one but you will know your pain 
They just think you're weird; they just think you've changed 
I lose one, I lose two, I lose three How can you fall on passing tears 
I have to live with this for years 
I lose one, I lose two, I lose three
