It's the perfect time of year 
Somewhere far away from here 
I feel fine enough, I guess 
Considering everything's a mess 
There's a restaurant down the street 
Where hungry people like to eat 
I could walk but I'll just drive 
It's colder than it looks outside (Pinch me) Like a dream you try to remember but it's gone 
(Pinch me) Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn 
(I'm still asleep) When you try to see the world, beyond your front door 
(Please God) Take your time, is the way I rhyme gonna make you smile 
(Tell me) When you realize that a guy my size might take a while 
(I'm still asleep) Just to try to figure out what all this is for It's the perfect time of day 
To throw all your cares away 
Put the sprinkler on the lawn 
And run through with my gym shorts on 
Take a drink right from the hose 
And change into some dryer clothes 
Climb the stairs up to my room 
Sleep away the afternoon (Pinch me) Like a dream you try to remember but it's gone 
(Pinch me) Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn 
(I'm still asleep) When you try to see the world, beyond your front door 
(Please God) Take your time, is the way I rhyme gonna make you smile 
(Tell me) When you realize that a guy my size might take a while 
(I'm still asleep) Just to try to figure out what all this is for Pinch me, pinch me, cause I'm still asleep 
Please God tell me that I'm still asleep On an evening such as this 
It's hard to tell if I exist 
If I pack the car and leave this town 
Who'll notice that I'm not around 
I could hide out under there 
I just made you say "underwear" 
I could leave but I'll just stay 
All my stuff's here anyway (Pinch me) Like a dream you try to remember but it's gone 
(Pinch me) Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn 
(I'm still asleep) When you try to see the world, beyond your front door 
(Please God) Take your time, is the way I rhyme gonna make you smile 
(Tell me) When you realize that a guy my size might take a while 
(I'm still asleep) Just to try to figure out what all this is for (Pinch me) (I'm still asleep) Try to figure out what all this is for 
(Pinch me) (I'm still asleep) Try to see the world beyond your front door 
(Pinch me) (I'm still asleep) Try to figure out what all this is for
