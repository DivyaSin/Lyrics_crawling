Something you said to me 
But I can't explain it 
Something you said to me 
I, I know you've asked it Somehow you found me 
The words are in motion 
Somehow you found me 
The words are in motion now I, I got locked in myself 
And I don't know what to do 
There were dreams in my eyes 
That now - Don't shine through Something you said to me 
I, I can't explain it 
Something you said to me 
I, I know you've asked it Somehow you found me 
The words are in motion 
Somehow you found me 
The words are in motion now I'm beginning to feel that 
You don't know what you do 
Is it possibly true that motions 
Get lost on you 
Get lost on you And you never grow up 
And you never did see 
The worlds coming down 
Was crashing right upon me 
Upon me 
And everyone knows 
That you never go back 
'Cause you never did see 
'Cause we never attack 
Forget me 
I'll forget you Something you said to me 
Something you said to me 
I, I can't explain it 
Something you said to me 
I, I know you've asked it
