All that I know is that I want you here with me 
To hold you and never let go 
All that I see is someone I love leaving me 
And that's not the way I want it to be 'cause I wanna hold you and make you mine 
And I wanna keep you for the rest of my life I want you back in my arms 
I need you here in my heart again 
I want you back in my arms 
That's where you belong, back in my arms I still wake up thinking that you're next to me 
But an empty space is all I see 
And all I can do is let you know the way I feel 
And I hope one day you feel it too And if you need to take some time 
I will be waiting if you change your mind I want you back in my arms 
I need you here in my heart again 
I want you back in my arms 
That's where you belong, back in my arms And if you need to take some time 
I will be waiting if you change your mind I want you back in my arms 
I need you here in my heart again 
I want you back in my arms 
That's where you belong, back in my arms I want you back in my arms 
I need you here in my heart again 
I want you back in my arms 
That's where you belong
