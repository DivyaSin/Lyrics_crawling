[Intro] 
Oh baby baby baby 
Give me your love 
Give me your love 
Give me your love.... [Verse 1] 
I'm gonna keep you no matter 
Girl you're mine you know we belong together 
Yeah, there's no way for us to be apart 
Because i feel like you're a part of me [Chorus] 
Bring the light to me 
It's only you who i need 
My gleam baby, i can hear the angels sing You know, i love you so much but sometimes 
I make mistakes but just forgive me, that's all 
Cuz i love you [Verse 2] 
There's true love in my life 
A love of melody and bliss sublime (Alright) 
There's true peace in my soul 
I'm so blessed to have you now [Chorus] 
Bring the light to me 
It's only you who i need 
My gleam baby, i can hear the angels sing 
No no no 
C'mon let me ease your mind
