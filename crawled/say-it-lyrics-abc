I was lost in paradise 
I was washed ashore 
I was praying someone 
Would walk right through that door 
I was hung in effigy 
I was flayed alive 
I was lost and lonely 
And struggling to survive. 
Say that you need me 
Say that you care 
Say you believe in me 
Say it, say it, say it 
And I'll be there, oh yeah. 
I was baked Alaska 
Burning deep inside 
I was wondering 'round this earth 
Trying to find a place to hide. 
I was Mr. Heartache 
I was ripped and torn 
I was hardly living 
Until you came along. 
Chorus 
Come on and say it. 
Whisper in my ear 
Come on. 
A ripple of uncertainty 
Became a tide of change 
That wave became an ocean 
Now you're out of range. 
Seen heaven in a rainbow 
Many splendid things 
None compare, none come close 
You're my everything 
Say that you need me 
Say that you care 
Say you believe in me 
Say it, mean it, say it, and mean it 
Say it, and mean it, say it 
And I'll be there, oh yeah.
