It was an upset 
In two minutes flat 
We're back on the freeway 
Foot to the mat I can't understand it 
We had it down pat 
It's very upsetting 
Could we leave it at that We all had positions 
We each had a role 
We'd overrehearsed it 
We had full control They can't teach you acting 
It's there in your soul 
It's the same with a bank job 
And each thing we stole So I don't need attitude 
'Cause you knew just what to do 
We all did our best now 
We all need to rest now 
Leave me alone 
And wait by the phone I was the driver 
You ran the show 
You had the last word 
The go or no go I knew every laneway 
In Ontario 
But it's not what you're sure of 
It's what you don't know It should have been filled with 
The usual ones 
Throwing their cash in 
To mutual funds We all had our ski masks 
And sawed off shotguns 
But how do you plan for 
A bank full of nuns But I guess we panicked 
We all have taboos 
And they were like zebras 
They had us confused We should be in condos 
With oceanfront views 
Instead we're most wanted 
On the 6 o'clock news So, I don't need attitude 
'Cause you knew just what to do 
We all did our best now 
We all need to rest now 
Leave me alone 
And wait by the phone Inside the police car 
You tried to explain 
Your crisis of conscience 
The voice in your brain And now that the whole thing 
Has gone down the drain 
I think we all know who 
Should shoulder the blame 'Cause you made a choice there 
Almost sublime 
I'm all for compassion 
Just not on my dime You look like an amateur 
And that's the real crime 
So I'll take a walk now 
And you do the time And I don't need attitude 
'Cause you knew just what to do 
We all did our best now 
We all need to rest now 
Leave me alone 
There's no need to phone We all did our best now 
We all need to rest now 
Leave me alone 
We all did our best now 
We all need to rest now 
Leave me alone
