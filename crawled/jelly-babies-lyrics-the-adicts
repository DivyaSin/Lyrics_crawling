You don't like the food 
That mummy made 
You wouldn't join in 
The games we played 
Why do you have to be 
Such a party pooper 
You wouldn't even dance 
To Alice Cooper So small and sweet 
So lovely and soft 
Come sit with me 
I won't bite your head off 
I know your name 
Sugar and spice 
They call you candy 
And all things nice
