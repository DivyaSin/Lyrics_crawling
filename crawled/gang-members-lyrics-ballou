[Intro: Ballout] 
Killing everybody 
Glo gang bitch we is the murder king, murder capital 
Bitch we fucking murder thing, walk up on your block... 
[Verse 1: Ballout] 
Glo gang bitch you know we the fucking murder team 
We murder thing 
Pull up and we pull up and we murk the scene 
All black 911 pull off and emergency 
Ball still taking niggas chains doing burglaries 
Kill a nigga, kill a bitch, if they say they ain't heard of me 
Heard of who? Pull up on your block, then murder you 
Glo gang is so fucking cool, all my niggas so fucking stupid 
Get up off them Xans then we get up off in a fucking [?] [Verse 2: Tadoe] 
The other day a nigga got up in my city (boom boom boom) 
Or got shot up in the face, the other kidney (gratatah) 
Flat line said they weren't living 
Pulled up on his block with the fifty 
(Gratatah) Nigga wasn't living 
Heard nigga was sneak dissing 
(Buckah buckah buckah) Is you with it? 
If you ain't Glo gang we'll spit it [Verse 3: Terentino] 
Niggas tweaking how I'mma have to up the semi 
Smoking Tooka Truey jeans and some Fendis 
I'm in the Audi truck hell no this bitch not rented 
I'm steady running red lights I'mma get a ticket 
Tadoe off the molly steady riding Raris 
Bally off the Xanis he gone crash the party 
I'm steady rolling Swishers getting high like Marley 
I might just pull up on you shooting off a Harley 
Justo just called me said he need some molly 
Cause he got some thotties and they ready to party 
Almighty grab the 30 I'mma grab the shottie 
Taking big hits like Muhammad Ali 
I'm off hella Xanis feeling like a zombie [Verse 4: Chief Keef] 
Just went and bought me a Ruger 
Just to shoot at a nigga medulla 
With the crew cuts, and we go too nuts 
Pull up, get to shooting at you, and you 
Better have your vests and shoot nigga [?] 
Come in then we screw shit 
I'm a screwed up I was raised by a bunch of screw kids 
Remember when I was a school kid 
I dropped out, now look who is, I is 
Wish a nigga would try this 
Got the SIG on me and I will blast this 
Shoot a nigga in his temple 
And go and hit the temple, forgiveness 
Ask god for forgiveness 
Forgive me for all my sins, I'm sinning
