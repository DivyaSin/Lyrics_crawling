All those simple songs we sang 
And the Christmas we spent yesterday, 
When we danced the night away. 
All my make-up it ran, 
And caused our love to fade away, 
We fade away, 
We fade away, 
We fade away, 
We fade away. 
Oh London town is burning 
And the mice and men are running 
But nothing, oh nothing can tear us apart. 
London town is burning 
and the New York lights are laughing, 
But nothing oh nothing can tear us apart. Is your soul for sale 
Is your soul for sale All those simple songs we sang, 
Are the same songs we sang yesterday. 
When we danced the night away, 
All my make-up it ran, 
And caused our love to fade away, 
We fade away, 
We fade away, 
We fade away, 
We fade away. Is your soul for sale 
Is your soul for sale Painters paint to spite us 
Love isn't love 
When lies divide us 
london town is burning 
And the men and mice are running 
But nothing, oh nothing can tear us apart London town is burning 
And the New York lights are laughing, 
But nothing oh Nothing can tear us apart London town is burning 
And the men and mice are running 
But nothing oh nothing can tear us apart 
London town is burning 
And the New York lights are laughing 
but nothing oh nothing can tear us apart
