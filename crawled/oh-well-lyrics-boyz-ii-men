Since you've been gone I've been lonely 
Longing to be with you only 
Maybe there still is a way 
I could find you and say just how I feel Oh, oh 
I can't believe that it's over 
Wish somehow I could have showed her 
All that was inside my heart 
'Stead of playin' the games, you might have stayed 
(Yeah, yeah) Funny just the other night 
I was thinkin' 
And wondered if you ever think 
About me 
I call you on the phone 
There's no answer Oh, well 
There's still tomorrow 
Oh, well 
I'll try again 
Oh, well 
Maybe, just maybe Since you've been gone I've been lonely 
Longing to be with you only 
If there's a way I could beg you to stay 
Would you please stay with me I was thinkin' maybe I 
Could come over 
Hoping we could find a way 
Work this out 
Even if tonight we don't 
Don't find an answer Oh, well 
There's still tomorrow 
Oh, well 
I'll try again 
Oh, well 
Maybe, just maybe Woo, well If I had another chance 
We would stand hand in hand 
You'd be my girl and I'd be your man 
Oh, well 
Maybe, just maybe we can I still call you on the phone 
Still no answer Baby, you don't want to try 
One more time 
Or am I just a fool 
To keep tryin' Oh, well 
There's still tomorrow 
Oh, well 
A fool's what I am 
Oh, well 
Maybe, just maybe Oh well 
There's still tomorrow 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, well 
Maybe, just maybe 
See, if I got down on my knees 
And give you every little part of me Oh, well (Oh, well) 
There's still tomorrow 
Oh, well (Oh, well) 
I'll try again 
Oh, well (I'll take you and I'll hold you) 
Maybe, just maybe (Just maybe) Since you've been gone I've been lonely
