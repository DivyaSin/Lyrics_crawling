Wake the dreamer 
From sleep comes the secret held deep in the psyche 
Restless vision 
The pain of regaining the truth in the message 
What we all are 
Descendents of creatures so cruel and self serving 
Infected again and again [Chorus] 
Know your master 
You're not equal 
Know your master 
Face your father Beneath the ruins 
Revealed before time might destroy all the remnants 
Predecessors 
Creators of space and lords of dimension 
Godless fathers 
Transcribing the answers 
Written in mind and in body, in gene, the code that erodes with your humanity The change is upon us 
Arranged with the dawning 
Revealed to us all
