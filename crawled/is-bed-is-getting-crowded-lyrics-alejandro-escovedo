This bed is getting crowded 
One, two, three 
This bed is getting crowded, baby 
Who you want me to be? 
I'll be your lover in the midnight 
I'll be your lover in the dawn 
I'll be your lover when the party's raging 
Long after everybody's gone This ain't love 
This ain't love 
This ain't love 
This ain't love 
Call it what you want 
But it don't feel like love to me This bed is getting crowded 
Baby something feels wrong 
Let's go somewhere quiet 
Somewhere we can be alone 
You got a statue in your front yard 
And it bleeds on cue 
All these arms and legs and limbs 
Who do you want me to do? This ain't love 
This ain't love 
This ain't love 
This ain't love 
Call it what you want 
But it don't feel like love to me This bed is getting crowded 
I look up it's four a.m. 
Am I here with you 
Are you here with me? 
Or are we both here with him? I'll be your lover in the midnight 
I'll be your lover in the dawn 
I'll be your lover when the party's in full swing 
Baby, I'll be your lover when everybody's gone This ain't love 
This ain't love 
This ain't love 
This ain't love 
Call it what you want 
But it don't feel like love to me
