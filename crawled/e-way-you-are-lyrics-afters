Until You came I was just the same 
As everybody else 
Whoever saw the light 
And turned away You love me now, You loved me then 
And every now and again 
You show me how it would be 
If I'd gone the other way And after all this time 
I've come to find my soul's fragility 
But You've rectified my frailty 
By Your strength It's like the sun swallowed up by the earth 
Like atomic bombs in reverse 
As if a glass could contain the sea 
That's the way You are in me, that's the way You are Now here I stand 
Looking back 
To the way things used to be 
But I will never be alone again 'Cause You're with me 
And now I see 
What it means to me 
To be a part of such a mystery After all this time 
I've come to find my soul's fragility 
But You've rectified my frailty 
By Your strength It's like the sun swallowed up by the earth 
Like atomic bombs in reverse 
As if a glass could contain the sea 
That's the way You are in me, that's the way You are After all this time 
I've come to find my soul's fragility 
But You've rectified my frailty 
By Your strength It's like the sun swallowed up by the earth 
Like atomic bombs in reverse 
As if a glass could contain the sea 
That's the way You are in me 
That's the way You are in me 
That's the way You are That's the way You are in me 
That's the way You are in me 
That's the way You are in me 
That's the way You are in
