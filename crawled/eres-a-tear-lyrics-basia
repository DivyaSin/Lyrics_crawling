I wonder if you'll ever know 
That every day I miss you so 
Was I wrong to let you go 
Or maybe you feel just like I do 
And wonder if I'll ever know 
That every day you miss me so 
Why did we let it all fall apart 
Before it even had a chance to start there's a tear in my eye 
The other is dry 
There'll never be a better time 
Honey, this moment is your life it all started with a dream 
Then it seemed a hopeless scheme 
Now I think what could have been 
You took my panic for indifference 
But how was I supposed to know 
That one day I will miss you so 
I would have fought for you to the end 
I would have never let you slip away now there's a tear in my eye 
The other is dry 
There'll never be a better time 
Honey, this moment is your life
