Ravage me, take your time, 
swallow me, Glamorize. 
Loving touch, sick suicide, 
feel so much, Glamorize. Be extreme, take your time, 
silently, Glamorize. 
Feel my breath upon your thighs, 
feeling wet, Glamorize! We should run away, get caught up. 
Forget the world, tell it to shut up. 
I'll take your hand to a private place, 
we escape the dark in a fire's blaze. You take me in, ignoring time. 
We're burning now and I know your mine... 
Constillations veer this way! 
Universe align, Glamorize today!~~ Ravage me, take your time, 
swallow me, Glamorize. 
Loving touch, sick suicide, 
feel so much, Glamorize. Be extreme, take your time, 
silently, Glamorize. (Glamorize~~ Today~!) 
Feel my breath upon your thighs, 
feeling wet, Glamorize! We should run away, get caught up. 
Forget the world, tell it to shut up. 
I'll take your hand to a private place, 
we escape the dark in a fire's blaze. You take me in, ignoring time. 
We're burning now and I know your mine... 
Constillations veer this way! 
Universe align, Glamorize today!~~~~~ Glamorize, Glamorize, Glamorize, rise, rise, rise, rise. 
Glamorize, Glamorize, Glamorize, rise, rise, rise, rise. 
Yeaaaahhh~~ Oh!
