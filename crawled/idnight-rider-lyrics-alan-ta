And there'll be no more turning back, 
So take your place is history. When he ride, ride, rides across the sky, 
You know that something has got to change, 
When he ride, ride, rides out of the night. 
Don't be afraid, 
When he comes calling your name. When he ride, ride, rides into your life, 
You know that nothing will be the same,
