Sun, all our dreams are dreams of fun handing out the water gun 
Shoot me and I'll drink you into the shade I'll shrink you 
Finally we're done and stare up into the 
Sky, flat on our backs we lie in quicksand slowly my hand 
Flies up and away with the yellow bird driven by Wind, I think I'll come to sin with all this heaty windy skin 
Around my neck and what glory the sand in my pants 
Reminds me of Doreen 
Sand, we cannot fight getting tanned 
All the limits banned into the night flight time's right no fight 
There goes the sun into the the nightlife Yeah Whang I sing while the others swing 
Like a beam of light through a bottle 
Suzie swings her phoney rings Time, bugs crawling up our spine and the memory is mine 
I'm a grain of sand in your hand so hand me mine yeah 
That would be fine 
Heat, I kiss the blisters on your feet a lizard's eye I great 
I'm afraid there's no aid 'til we get laid 
Into the night flight time's right no fight
