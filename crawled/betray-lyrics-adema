I watched you change 
I never knew 
That you would be 
Like all the rest 
You were so true, too good to be true I trusted you, and fell apart again 
I cannot change the fact 
That you're not coming back 
So depressed, I'm your slave 
Betrayed me, you're not the one 
To be trusted with my love 
Betrayed me, you're not the one 
Who should be trusted with my love I had to leave, so I could breathe 
I hate to fightthat's not what I want 
You were so true, too good to be true I trusted you, and fell apart again 
I cannot change the fact 
That you're not coming back 
So depressed, I'm your slave 
Betrayed me, you're not the one 
To be trusted with my love 
Betrayed me, you're not the one 
Who should be trusted with my love I trusted you, and fell apart again 
I cannot change the fact 
That you're not coming back 
So depressed, I'm your slave 
Betrayed me, you're not the one 
To be trusted with my love 
Betrayed me, you're not the one 
Who should be trusted with my love I trusted you, and fell apart again 
I cannot change the fact 
That you're not coming back 
So depressed, I'm your slave 
Betrayed me, you're not the one 
To be trusted with my love 
Betrayed me, you're not the one 
Who should be trusted with my love Betrayed me, Betrayed me,slave, Betrayed me, Betrayed me
