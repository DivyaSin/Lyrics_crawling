Gettin' a job 
Sweat and grime 
Bound to come some day 
Now I'm not sure about the rules Make them as they play 
That's alright 
That's okay 
I've seen it all before They smile at you and shake your hand 
Then throw you out the door 
All that I need to know 
Well I loved it where the trumpets show Won the ribbons at the Rodeo 
But lost them on the way home 
Oh when the cold wind blows 
And I watch the stars and feel their glow I realize that I'll never know 
So down and out I go 
Looking back along the trail 
Thought I saw your face Tired and worn 
Your eyes turned gray 
Tried to find a place 
That's alright That's okay 
It's the only way to go 
So smile at me and shake your head 
As you stumble to the floor All that I need to know 
Well I loved where the trumpets show 
Won the ribbons at the Rodeo 
But lost them on my way home Oh where the cold wind blows 
And I watch the stars and feel their glow 
I realize that I'll never know 
So down and out I go All that I need to know 
Why I love it when they slam the door 
Guess that's just the way it goes 
At the rodeo
