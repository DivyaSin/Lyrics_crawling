I burn the pages in my head 
But the memories are so clear 
A thousand words left unsaid 
And you never shed a tear 
You say that you wanna be close to me 
So how does it feel? Now the tables have turned 
You can learn how to live without me 
Live without me 
Pictures up on the wall 
Suddenly now youre all about me 
All about me 
Where were you when I needed you? 
The only thing that I learned from you 
Was how to walk out the door 
Sincerely yours Now Im a man 
Im on my own 
I am not ashamed 
You broke my heart 
You stole my pride 
All you left me was my name 
I know you wanna be in my shoes 
So how does it feel? Now the tables have turned 
You can learn how to live without me 
Live without me 
Pictures up on the wall 
Suddenly now youre all about me 
All about me 
Where were you when I needed you? 
The only thing that I learned from you 
Was how to walk out the door 
Sincerely yours I just wanna forgive and forget all about you 
Why cant I just move on? 
From this place in between loving and hating you 
Dont know where to belong I burn the pages in my head 
But the memories are so clear Now the tables have turned 
You can learn how to live without me 
Live without me 
Pictures up on the wall 
Suddenly now youre all about me 
All about me 
Where were you when I needed you? 
The only thing that I learned from you 
Was how to walk out the door 
Sincerely yours 
Sincerely yours, yah
