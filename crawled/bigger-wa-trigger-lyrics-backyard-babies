What were you thinkin' 
when you went down? 
it's kinda funny 
since we always stuck around 
what were you doin' 
what went so bad? 
you and me together 
and everything we had run into a future 
try not hiding from my past 
I'm looking for tomorrow 
and the next day just as fast only one 
only lonely one paranoia mornings 
nightmares in my bed 
too hard to fuckin' cry 
so I'd rather sweat instead 
no zero numbers 
just having fun 
no time for seconds 
I'm the only lonely one never pull the trigger 
cause your finger's working best run into a future 
try not hiding from my past 
I'm looking for tomorrow 
and the next day just as fast 
you want it all 
you do not want the rest you think you're bigger 
with a trigger
