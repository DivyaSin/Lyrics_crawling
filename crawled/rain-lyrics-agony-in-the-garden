I want go out again 
Back into the rain 
Gotta make a change 
Starting over Looked at my life 
I realized it's not over 
Found hope in myself 
Found a reason 
To be me Rain is coming down 
Falling hard on me 
Nothing makes a sound 
I'm alone now 
And dawn waits for me Rain is coming down 
Never makes a sound 
Though it cuts me deep 
I never bleed 
The sun shines for me If you're like me 
Trying to make a change 
Look inside yourself 
Rain will come again Walk the shallow ground 
Wait for the sound 
The skies bring you life 
Wash away your strife Rain is coming down 
Falling hard on me 
Nothing makes a sound 
I'm alone now 
And dawn waits for me Rain is coming down 
Never makes a sound 
Though it cuts me deep 
I never bleed 
The sun shines for me Rain come down on me 
Fall hard on me 
Make a new way for me 
Rain oh rain 
Come down on me 
Fall hard on me 
Make a new way for me
