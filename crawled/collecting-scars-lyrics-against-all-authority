Close your eyes and shut your mouth 
Because it's all the same and it won't change with you or without 
They've got your number and that's all you are 
To them it makes no difference, we're collecting scars again One day soon we're gonna run out of room 
Because we've carried our share digging graves and building the tombs 
That make up this town that keeps us locked down 
We're locked down Locked down and collecting scars again Hey, we're seeing stars 
And spilling blood, it's not yours, it's ours 
We're locked down and collecting scars 
While oil fields burn and bodies char Remain silent with all that you know 
As we rise to the top on the backs of those living below 
Breathe easy, you're safe where you are 
Go about your business and leave us collecting the scars Produce doom and we consume 
We're all enslaved filling graves and filling the tombs 
That make up this town that keeps us locked out 
We're locked down Locked down and collecting scars again Hey, we're seeing stars 
And spilling blood, it's not yours, it's ours 
We're locked down and collecting scars 
We gotta know who the hell you think you are Safe at home while the world is spinning out of control 
From the lies you tell and the power you hold 
And you steal and you kill, let the truth be told Let's burn this town and we'll all sit around 
Getting warmer by the fire with friends 
Collecting scars again 
What comes around goes around and I'm down 
And out but coming back again 
Collecting scars again The burning embers make a sound I'll remember 
Forever as I watch it descend 
Collecting scars again 
What comes around goes around and I'm down 
And out but coming back again 
Collecting scars again
