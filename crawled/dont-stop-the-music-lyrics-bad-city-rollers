Don't stop the music 
I don't wanna lose her 
I just want to stay here tonight 
Make ev'rything right So don't stop the music Don't go now 'Cause if I lose her 
I will surely break down. So don't stop the music I don't ever wanna say goodbye How can I tell her 
That I really love her 
And though we just met here tonight 
It all feels so right Oh please can't you see 
That I need her Don't stop the music 
I don't wanna lose her So don't stop the music I don't ever wanna say goodbye. 
I'd never thought 
That I could hold her 
Though many times I tried 
I never thought 
I would see that look in her eyes Don't stop the music . . .
