bread and butter tastes more like it could be _cordon bleu_ 
mona lisa's smiling like a cheshire cat 
even johnny rocker sounds today like nat king cole 
every yellow taxi's like a cadillac and the cup that once appeared half empty 
has become a cup that is half full 
where there was a space there is now plenty 
you're a lucky sign ascending-- 
no one does for me what you do love is the sweetest illusion every innuendo seems to be in semaphore 
monday mornings turn into a mardi gras 
and a glass of soda taste more like dom perignon 
every dead end street's an ocean boulevard the more i look the more i see 
and i don't mind if my senses are deceiving me 
the more i touch the more i feel 
who cares what is imaginary and what is real 
if black is white and red is green 
i don't care which way around it is supposed to be 
i close my eyes but i can see... the more i look the more i see 
form where i stand my world is looking 
good to me 
the more i touch the more i feel 
don't want to know that is true what's 
make believe...
