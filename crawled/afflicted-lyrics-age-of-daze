Why did I come here tonight 
With all these feelings inside 
You're much too good for this life 
And all the pain that you hide 
I want to take you away 
Wipe the tears from your eyes 
But all that stands in the way is 
That you don't realize Why I I am addicted, addicted to you 
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill 
I can't get enough of you I am afflicted, afflicted by you 
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill 
I can't get enough of You you 
You you I want you so bad tonight 
That I can almost taste it 
I want to take you away 
Wipe the tears from your eyes 
But all that stands in the way is 
That you don't realize Why I I am addicted, addicted to you 
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill 
I can't get enough of you I am afflicted, afflicted by you 
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill And when it all comes crashing down 
Will you still love it 
And if tomorrow never comes 
At least I had it I am addicted addicted to you 
I'm addicted I can't get enough of you 
I can't get enough of you I am addicted, addicted to you 
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill 
I can't get enough of you I am afflicted, afflicted by you 
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill 
I can't get enough of You you 
You you
