(ronnie scott/ steve wolfe) 
Producers for bonnie: ronnie scott, steve wolfe 
Recorded in 1980 as a b-side to the single 'goodbye to the island'. lyrics taken from careful listening. I can't see in the dark, but I see you 
Words don't come from your heart, but they get through 
Something's happened to you, something's happened to me 
Someone's changing our lives, I know it isn't me Oh get out of my head and get into my heart 
Get out of my head and get into my heart 
I thought it was love 
But there's love and there's love 
So get out of my head and get into my heart Not much more I can do, than what I've done 
You shot me through the heart, without a gun 
Something's happened to you, something's happened to me 
Someone's changing our lives, I know it isn't me Oh get out of my head and get into my heart 
Get out of my head and get into my heart 
I thought it was love 
But there's love and there's love 
So get out of my head and get into my heart Something's happened to you, something's happened to me 
Someone's changing our lives, I know it isn't me 
Oh get out of my head and get into my heart 
Get out of my head and get into my heart 
I thought it was love 
But there's love and there's love 
So get out of my head and get into my heart Get out of my head and get into my heart 
Get out of my head and get into my heart 
Get out of my head and get into my heart 
Get out of my head and get into my heart
