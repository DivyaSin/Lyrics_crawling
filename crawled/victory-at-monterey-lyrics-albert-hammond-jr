She's got buttons with their name on it 
Lost sounds, well they tell you everything 
And it all goes back again 
Well 
And it all goes back again [Chorus] 
I said 
"Victory at Monterey" 
She said 
"Won't you come down and play" 
That's sad 
You didn't win anything 
That's sad 
Victory at Monterey Happy 
Man I got lost in you 
Well I'm over these, over these 
Gonna find you 
I'm so glad 
Now that I have you back 
Happy, happy 
'Cause I know it's true 
Now that I have back [Chorus: x2]
