I stood to face the wind 
Cold drops of rain hit my face and it stung boy 
But I faced the wind Thunder warned me to come down 
But I couldn't tell if her storm horses were around 
So I faced the wind No one will know 
No one will know (the pain or) 
The reasons why we're trying I felt dizzy and framed 
My hands began to shake from 
Hunger and sleep not around boy 
So I faced the wind No one will know 
No one will know (the pain or) 
The reasons why we're trying We're trying 
Till I face the wind
