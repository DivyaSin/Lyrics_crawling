You come around flaunting your views 
Thinking you're tough, beating on those smaller than you 
What do you have to prove 
Attacking people, there's no excuse 
Travelling around in you packs 
Intelligence is what you fucking lack 
With your boots you try to show your might 
So stupid you can't see you're not right 
If you've got such a problem with what you see 
Find somewhere else to inbreed so you'll be happy 
I don't give a god damn about what you want to do 
So when you go from here I won't bother with what happened to you
