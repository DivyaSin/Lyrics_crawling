Union of opposites becomes union of one's self 
The universe above mirrors the universe within 
You search for identity, schizophrenic multi-being 
Your two have become one Your Libran scales often sway 
Focus your thoughts on balance 
Meditate on harmony 
Elevate your mind and all that is shall return Inner equality of masculine and feminine principles 
Your active male fuels your fire for furious dominating 
Your passive female, maternal soul 
Psychic subconscious under the sceptre of Zues 
Your two have become one Let your will penetrate deeply from within 
Your Libran scales sway with eternal unrest 
Two as one, unisex 
You are she and she is him
