[Ace Hood] 
Yea 
Ace Hood 
See mama, all I want you to do is hold it down for me 
I want you to be my ride or die 
While I go get this money, I promise I'm get us out the hood baby [Chorus: Trey Songz] 
Even though I'm in the streets 
You know exactly what I do 
When I chase this paper 
You ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you 
Cause I ride or die girl we goin' be good 
And if you ride or die we goin' make it out this hood [Ace Hood] 
Listen 
Baby look, just ride with me 
Swear that I got us mama 
One thing I love about it 
See you ain't with that drama 
You be my ride or die like Bonnie I'ma play the Clyde 
Promise to move you out the hood into a bigger house 
That's why you never trip I'm grinding bump a 9-5 
Gotta get this money, paper calling but you never whine 
Gotta ask the cash come with bags you should see your eyes 
That's why I surprise about you stacks to ease your worried mind 
Cause when I'm gone lil' mama home alone at every time 
You never blowed my phone up yet cause you respect the grind 
And you never holla bout a problem keep it on the line 
My gutta baby, never maybe always gonna ride [Chorus] [Ace Hood] 
And um, we can do them long vacations 
Thinking Jamaica lately 
Cant take them deep relations, baby just keep it patient 
Shawty know what I do 
Shawty know who I be 
You know I'm in these streets the only way that we gon eat 
I keep it gutta never cut her when we in them sheets 
I get sum cutta grap the duffle then I'm in the streets 
Come back with bundles pimp a half a g and Louie V 
But you ain't tripping never question bout a nigga G 
We keep it real ain't no other that could fill ya sneak's 
I ride for you, you ride for me that's where we need to be 
I hold you down, you hold me down and I fulfill your dreams 
Your my Beyonce I'm hova wont you ride with me [Chorus] [Trey Songz] 
Now what's the definition of a rider 
Through it all they goin' stand right beside ya 
If you got one look em in the eyes 
Tell em you goin' ride 
Tell em you goin' ride (ride) 
Till the wheel fall off or the day that I die 
That's on my life ain't nun wrong wit tryin' love somebody 
Tryin' to tell you shawty that [Ace Hood] 
Ace, and I promise this to you 
I'ma get us out this hood 
Into them places that you thinking that you never could 
But you gotta ride like them tires on the mini coop 
I'ma get this cash paper bags and give half to you 
Forget them haters 
Keep you tailored see whats sexy too 
And I like your body all I think about is doing you 
And I love the money so I guess it's like doing two 
You ride or die same smile when you see the loot [Chorus] Yea yea yea 
We goin' make it out 
We goin' make it out this hood
