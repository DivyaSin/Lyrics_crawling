and if i could find a way, 
to make it through one more day, 
i'd sing to you one last time, 
and make everything alright, it's hard for me to explain, 
that i love you more everyday, 
and when it's time to let go, 
i just want you to know.. that you came, and your name, 
stayed a part of me everyday.. for you i would find the words, 
i'd sing them out, for all to be heard, 
for you i would fight my fears, 
i'd tear them down, and wipe all your tears but something just don't feel right, 
without you here by my side, 
could you tell me how it will be? 
when your not here with me you came, and your name, 
stayed a part of me everyday.. for you i would find the words, 
i'd sing them out, for all to be heard, 
for you i would fight my fears, 
i'd tear them down, and wipe all your tears, and i'll be, everything that you need, 
ya, i'll be...
