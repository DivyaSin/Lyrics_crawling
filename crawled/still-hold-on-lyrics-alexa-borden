To find some peace of mind 
Find a stifling high 
To tame my thoughts run wild 
Cause they'll chase after you 
To your memories tomb 
It's what I've yet to lose I still hold on anyways 
You wounded me willfully 
I still hold on anyways 
Anyways I'll always waste my life 
To search for what I might 
Might not ever find 
I keep my arms spread wide 
Heart beats all the time 
Come back whenever you like I'll still be lost anyways 
Abandoned me willfully 
I still hold on anyways 
Anyways
