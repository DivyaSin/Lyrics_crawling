A heart is reaching out 
It's finding there's no need to carry wrong 
A love is biding time it takes to heal to move along I like the way that if feels whenever you're around 
You've opened up a world of joy that's new and free 
And then I start to see that I was mistaken 
'Cause your love has finally opened up my eyes CHORUS 
I believe that I am falling for you 
One step closer to the real life 
Outside of all the madness 
This feeling I don't know why I never knew before Here you've been waiting for me 
I never noticed you 
Cause too much fire was in my life that I could not see through Lie awake, lie awake inside your arms 
I'll never wonder how it feels to be alone 
You see my heart is on my sleeve 
'Cause I was mistaken, and your love has finally opened up my eyes CHORUS 
I believe that I am falling for you 
One step closer to the real life 
Outside of all the madness 
This feeling I don't know why I never knew before And I believe that you could be the one 
My one and only in this new life 
Far away from all the sadness 
Cause you have turned out to be something real to me INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE CHORUS
