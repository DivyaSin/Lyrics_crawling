Your heart is in your home they say 
Your home's where you belong 
But someone stole my heart today 
So listen to my song I heard the news today 
They're going to move us far away 
Seems that our home must go 
They're going to build a motorway It isn't fair, nobody cares 
They're knocking down our home 
Ruining all we own 
They're knocking down our home 
Please help us 
Don't let them take our home Ma's cooking at the stove 
Where she's cooked for thirty years 
Ten thousand meals she's cooked 
But now her eyes are filled with tears
