You know I got a fire 
Burnin' so deep 
You know I got a fire 
Burnin' so deep 
And it burns so sweetly 
Make a man weep I got a love 
Older than time 
Yes, I have a love 
That's older than time 
And the way it feels 
It must be the reason why Got this humming 
Down in my bones 
Got this burning 
Down in my humming 
And the way it feels 
It moves my soul You know my soul 
Cries for you so badly 
You are the only one 
That can ever set me free, yeah You know my flesh, it hungers 
So, so, long 
Yes, my flesh it hungers 
So, so, long Like a man in dry and dusty land 
Nowhere to go 
I'm like a man in a giant dry and land 
With nowhere to call home
