Worked out that I probably made a mistake 
For each thing I've done right 
Just keeping it even at times 
Seems to take every ounce of my might I might've found gold instead of dust 
I might've found someone to hold in trust 
I may seem hard in harder times 
Even though my colors are fading I stay in the lines I can't be the sun 'cause I'd burn 
As sure as I leave, I will return 
The moon is too big and too bright 
I can't shine like stars but 
I'll be a satellite I'm ready, I'm ready, I've already torn 
All my pieces apart 
Be steady, be steady instead of my usual 
Fits and starts My heart has been worn but it ain't broke 
It may hiccough and cough black smoke 
It may seem old, but it still runs 
Yeah my love's got laces that won't come undone I can't be the sun 'cause I'd burn 
As sure as I leave, I will return 
The moon is too big and too bright 
I can't shine like stars but 
I'll be a satellite Your satellite 
Your satellite 
Your satellite Jupiter's too heavy to hold 
And Mars is too cold, and Venus too hot 
I'd try for Saturn's beautiful rings 
I am none of these things 
And I'm glad that I'm not 
'Cause you'd expect a lot I can't be the sun 'cause I'd burn 
As sure as I leave, I will return 
The moon is too big and too bright 
I can't shine like stars but 
I'll be a satellite Your satellite 
Your satellite 
Your satellite 
I'll be your satellite
