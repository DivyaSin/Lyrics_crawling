I'm innocent, I'm guilty too 
I wanna be, I wanna be with you 
Got a hole inside but I wanna fill you up 
Tell me did I leave you too long 
Or could it be that I was never gone? All in all you feel like home I wanna be, I wanna be with you 
I'm comin' home 
I wanna be, I gotta be 
I wanna be with you Your innocence, it pierces through 
A blurry mind and now I can see you 
And though I fail sometimes, don't wanna do you wrong 
It took a while but now I'm strong 
It's you and me and it was all along All in all you feel like home I wanna be, I wanna be with you 
I'm comin' home 
I wanna be, I gotta be 
I wanna be with you You've seen me run 
You've seen me blame 
Please close your eyes 
This time is not the same 
We'll carry on, we'll carry on All in all you feel like home I wanna be, I wanna be with you 
I'm comin' home 
I wanna be, I gotta be 
I wanna be with you 
Wanna be with you
