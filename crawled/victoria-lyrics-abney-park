Victoria, come back to me 
I should have never believed 
You've been gone so long 
Why did I let you leave? Victoria, come back to me 
I should have never believed 
You've been gone so long 
Why did I let you leave? Was it simply my self-doubt 
That made me give you away? 
I thought I couldn't take care of you 
Now I'll never see the day Victoria, come back to me 
I should have never believed 
You've been gone so long 
Why did I let you leave? Victoria, come back to me 
I should have never believed 
You've been gone so long 
Why did I let you leave? Our family fell upon hard times 
So many mouths to feed 
Thought you could have a better life 
How could I have seen their greed? Victoria, come back to me 
I should have never believed 
You've been gone so long 
Why did I let you leave? Victoria, come back to me 
I should have never believed 
You've been gone so long 
You've been gone so long 
You've been gone so long 
Why did I let you leave?
