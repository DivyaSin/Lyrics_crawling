In the morning there's a buzz of flies 
Between the pillows and the skies 
That beg into your eyes 
Through the looking glass 
And between your thighs 
And it's written no small surprise 
Let's straight down the rabbit hole 
There we go 
I've been meaning to tell you 
A sentimental thing that occurred to me 
I've been waiting to show you 
A set of photographs 
That'll make you laugh and smile You might wanna stick one on his nose 
Around his teeth, down this drug hole of him 
They've nowhere else to go In the morning there's a buzz of flies 
Between the pillows and the skies 
That beg into your eyes 
Through the looking glass 
And between your thighs 
And it's written no small surprise 
Let's straight down the rabbit hole 
There we go I've been meaning to tell you 
A sentimental thing that occurred to me 
I've been waiting to show you 
A set of photographs
