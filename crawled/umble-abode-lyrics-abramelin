Fear, you will fear me, ripped, I'll see you bleed 
Fall onto your knees, pray to be freed 
You'll soon become a part of us 
Endure such pain again and more Barbs of rust tear at your flesh 
Can't you control the ecstasy? 
Death waits here to embrace you 
Hack your body and rape your soul Instruments of the finest degrees 
Blades eager for the taste of the crimson 
This house is a place of evil 
This house is a crypt of pain Don't fear it, we enjoy it 
Bathe in its bleeding rain 
Your soul is mine for taking 
Your mind is not alone We'll soon be in there with you 
Come join our happy home 
You'll soon become a part of us 
Endure such pain again and more Barbs of rust tear at your flesh 
Can't you control the ecstasy? 
Drowning in blood writhing in pain 
Transgress to the realm of my madness
