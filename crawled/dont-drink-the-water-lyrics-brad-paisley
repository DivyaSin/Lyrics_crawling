Empty house, empty rooms 
Empty bottle of Patron 
I need to go out but not around here 
There ain't nowhere we haven't gone There's this travel agent that I know 
That says Cozumel's real nice 
And so he got me a deal on a flight and a room 
And little bit of free advice Don't drink the water 
I told him that's okay 
I ain't going down to Mexico 
To drink the water anyway Blake, ain't you been there before? 
Yeah, I been there a time or two 
They got some sweet Senoritas 
That are more than glad to meet you 
But I'm telling you, boy, whatever you do Don't drink the water 
Okay, okay 
I ain't going down to Mexico 
To drink the water anyway Corona or Tecate 
My old friend Jose 
I ain't going down to Mexico 
To drink the water anyway On this trip, anything I sip 
Had better have a kick and a burn 
Strong enough to get you off my mind 
Pickle my liver and a little grub o' worm 
Here we go Don't drink the water 
That's what they say 
But I ain't going down to Mexico 
To drink the water anyway No one I know goes to Mexico 
To drink the water anyway
