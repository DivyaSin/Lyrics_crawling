She's an idle child, high society 
Never pushed a broom, didn't physically 
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up 
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup I'm on the borderline She goes struttin' 'round and she shows so much 
With a neon sign saying "don't you touch" 
Between the devil and the deep blue sea 
She use me like an anchor, got a hold on me Chorus: 
On the borderline, see the danger sign 
On the borderline, getting out of line 
On the borderline, but it feels so good 
On the borderline, on the borderline 
On the borderline, borderline (here goes) You know I shoot the dice to climb the money tree 
You pull them in without a thought to me 
She doesn't want you when your pocket's dry 
The queen of hearts will kill you when your ace is high On the borderline She's an idle child, high society 
Never pushed a broom, didn't physically 
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up 
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup Chorus Gonna meet you there 
If you want me, meet me on the borderline
