My hands hold safely to my dreams 
Clutching tightly not one has fallen. 
So many years Ive shaped each one 
Reflecting my heart, showing who I am. 
Now you're asking me to show 
What I'm holding Oh so tightly. 
Cant open my hand; cant let go 
Does it matter? 
Should I show you? 
Cant you let me go? [Chorus] 
Surrender, surrender 
You whisper gently 
You say I will be free 
I know but cant you see 
My dreams are me, My dreams are me Say you have a plan for me 
And that you want the best for my life. 
Told me the world has yet to see 
What you can do with one 
That's committed to your call. 
I know of course what I should do 
That I cant hold these dreams forever. 
But if I give them now to you 
Will you take them 
Away forever? 
Or can I dream again?
