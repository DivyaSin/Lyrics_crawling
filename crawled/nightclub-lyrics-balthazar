Crippled by this raw desire 
I keep on reaching high and higher 
And now the stars replaced the sun 
And there's a woman's face 
In each and everyone 
And it's so blinding 
A little goes a long way 
A lot of it a long way further 
A little goes a long way 
A lot of it a long way further 
At first it Just affects your skin 
But then it takes you over from within 
It shines out through your eyes 
It starts to Shine out past the drought 
Inside of your mouth 
And it's all so blinding 
A little goes a long way 
A lot of it a long way further 
A little goes a long way 
A lot of it a long way further 
So i'm not going home Babe 
oh Why should I 
A little goes a long way 
A lot of it a long way further 
A little goes a long way 
A lot of it a long way further
