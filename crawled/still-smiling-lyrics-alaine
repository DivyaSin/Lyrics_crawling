driver said set your trap 
like the cream to the top.... i rise 
no man shall not tender 
bitter heart ...bitter thoughts.... 
live them all in the past..... cause i got no time linger hook: life is a winding road 
nobody knows the pain i known 
jah jah alone can keep me strong 
and carry me through streets and alleys 
over hills and valleys and trod-trod-trodding along chorus: 
and i'm still smiling...smiling ...smiling through the pain 
i'm still smiling...smiling ...smiling through the rain 
i'll smile......til i'm whole again 
smile... 
yea it's gonna be....gonna be fine....gonnna be fine.....gonna be (3x) 
jah jah shine on me verse 2: always dark before the light.. they will ever follow night 
so i'll wait...wait until the morning Hook: 
life is a winding road 
nobody knows the pain you've known 
jah jah alone can keep you strong 
and carry you through streets and alleys 
over hills and valleys and trod-trod-trodding along repeat chorus I'm holding on....i'm still still holding on 
evil coulda never make me fall 
i'm staning tall through it all 
i'm still standing (2x) repeat 1st hook repeat chorus (2x)
