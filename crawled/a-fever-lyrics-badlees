(Naydock, Palladino) With flu 
I dream of you 
In light as blue as neon when it's blue 
Past visions of rolling hills 
In movie stills 
A panoramic stew 
Above the scientific 
Element, content 
We spy the view (Chorus) 
A fever's brought me close to you 
In ways we can not be 
A fever's brought me close to you 
In ways we can not be 
Even in memory Sublime 
In double time 
We climb to where convention swerves and leans 
'Couple-a-beers 
In a tent by sears 
By a giant plastic nativity scene 
In color dogs endure 
I'm sure 
The light you've given me is green (Chorus) I mouth petitions 
Oh those soft renditions 
Of the ones I've come to lean on 
For you 
Again, in blue 
And straightening a photographic dawn 
May I experience 
The sense of 
Where I dream you when I'm gone (Chorus 2x)
