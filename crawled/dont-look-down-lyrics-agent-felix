step carefully 
one foot at a time 
you'd be less afraid if you just closed your eyes 
but instead your staring down 
clear your head and turn around don't look down 
you might fall 
cause you're standing on the ledge 
cause there is no one there to keep you holding on you could have everything 
but your lonely inside 
would you trade it all 
for someone at your side 
just one step could end the pain 
you say there is nothing left to gain
