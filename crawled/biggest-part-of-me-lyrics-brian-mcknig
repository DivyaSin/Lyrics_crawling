If You've ever had 
A broken Heart 
You promise yourself 
To never let it happen again 
Don't want to think about it 
Don't want to dream about it 
But it finds it's way back into your head The "I love you"'s 
The "I need you"'s 
They're only words that people say 
They're just words 
When they're hand in hand 
With the games that people play If I never see the top of a mountain 
If I never set foot in the sea 
I promise you I'll love you forever 
You'll always be 
The biggest part of me Wherever you go 
Whatever you do 
I will follow 
You've changed the way that I need to think 
I promise you I'll you forever 
You'll always be 
The biggest part of me Take a look at me 
I let you have my heart 
I swore I'd never let it happen again 
I'm not mad about it 
I'm kinda glad about it 
Cause I know on you girl 
I can depend The "I love you"'s 
The "I need you"'s 
They're only words that people say 
They're just words 
When they're hand in hand 
With the games that people play (But) If I never see the top of a mountain 
If I never set foot in the sea 
I promise you I'll love you forever 
You'll always be 
The biggest part of me Wherever you go 
Whatever you do 
I will follow 
You've changed the way that I need to think 
I promise you I'll you forever 
You'll always be 
The biggest part of me I believe 
Yes, I believe 
I believe in love again 
And I swear 
I'll always be there 
Isn't this the way that it should be? If I never see the top of a mountain 
If I never set foot in the sea 
I promise you I'll love you forever 
You'll always be 
The biggest part of me Wherever you go 
Whatever you do 
I will follow 
You've changed the way that I need to think 
I promise you I'll you forever 
You'll always be 
The biggest part of me
