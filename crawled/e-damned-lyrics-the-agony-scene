songs made of whispers silent screams like a choral of the dead needles 
prick the softest skin and the breeze screams bloodlust these eyes gazing 
over the hilltops burning red the night skies seem to follow me blanketing 
me with crowds of grey and black the crowd of the damned screams eyes shown 
red raise the dead the breeze screaming over the whispers in the dark 
setting the leaves in sway hanging there like a body from the raftors 
smiling back at me they wait in eager circles for me to stagger into the 
darkness these images that i have seen they still burn inside of me
