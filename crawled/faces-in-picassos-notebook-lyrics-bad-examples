Jennifer is laughing at my same old stupid jokes 
It's the first time that I've seen her since it all went up in smoke 
Her hair is longer, her eyes are sadder, her smile is just the same 
It's funny how we sit here as if nothing's really changed 'cause old lovers never fade away 
They haunt you and they hint at things 
That never could have been Like faces in picasso's notebook, visions that have lost their shape She acts a little jealous, 'cause my life is going well 
But we talk around the danger zones, we know more than we tell 'cause old habits burn into your mind 
They taunt you and they trick you 
And they twist your sense of time Like faces in picasso's notebook, visions that have lost their shape 
Faces in picasso's notebook, lovers who have lost their way And isn't it strange how we feel so close 
Now that there's no love to bind us? 
And isn't it strange how your heart keeps a hope burning? So we sit together, have a drink to all that might have been 
And drift into our separate lives - I guess that's how these things end Like faces in picasso's notebook, visions that have lost their shape 
Faces in picasso's notebook, lovers who have lost their way Lovers who have lost their way
