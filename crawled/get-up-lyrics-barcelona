Five days after black and red collide. 
The motion sickness past, I'll be the first to stand. 
Behind that weathered door, I thought it would be safest. 
My head is dizzy now, I thought we'd overcome. 
We might not make it home tonight. Crawling on the ash, she's pitiful. 
She lost her sense of light, she has to hold my hand. 
Had I known we might be two kids without their jackets. 
My fear would come alive, I wouldn't love her now. 
She might not make it home tonight. Get up

Get up 
Get up
