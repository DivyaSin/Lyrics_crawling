Said, I been missing you 
Said, I'm missing you Said, I'm sitting down by the bay on a lonely day 
Tossing rocks across the water and they fly away 
And the sun don't seem to shine and the trees ain't tall I got summer time blues in the middle of fall 
Said, I'm feeling kind of lonely and I feel I'm broken up 
'Cause we never have been apart Said, I'm missing you like crazy, baby, all the time 
Said, I'm missing you like crazy, 'cause you're on my mind 
Said, I'm missing you like crazy, baby, all the time 
Said, I'm missing you, missing you like crazy So, I'm walking down the street feeling lonely and sad 
Couples walking hand in hand looking mighty glad 
Every time I think of you the tears appear 
Got a broken heart, baby, 'cause I need you near Said, I'm feeling kind of lonely and I got a broken heart 
And I don't know what to do, 'cause we're so far apart 
Said, I'm feeling kind of lonely and my heart is torn away 
And no one's going to keep us apart, yeah Said, I'm missing you like crazy, baby, all the time
