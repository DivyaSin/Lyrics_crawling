He can only hold her for so long, the lights are on but no one's home 
She's so vacant, her soul is taken 
He thinks 'What's she running from? 
Now, how can he have a heart? When it got stole 
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies Even if she's contenting his wants, she is played with urgency 
Searches the man she misses, the man that he longs to be 
Now, how can he have her heart? When it got stole 
So he tries to pacify her, 'cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her, 'cause of what's inside her it never dies 
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies
