United Soldiers! 
I think I just hear the... Chorus: 
Bomb! Comin' from the sky 
Way up high 
Bringin' Afromental sound 
Bomb! Comin' from the sky 
So you better watch out 
It's gonna blow your mind Sickness, that's what I feel 
I feel sick of music that gives a mind-drill 
Who did that? Who's making a deal 
Who's fault's a radio full of bulshit 
We won't stepp back 
We'll fight whith that pigs 
We'll crash that unit, join us you'll fit 
Open your mind, look to the sky 
Listen now, 'cause I think I just heard the bomb! Chorus: 
Bomb! Comin,....... They dont have a good damn thing you wanna hear 
Treatingyou like their whores whit no ears 
They don't even give a shit about their responsibility 
To the people and the way they feel 
They think we're only listeners blinded by their garbage 
Loud and colorful but not real 
They almost forgot we are here whith the massive gear 
Hold On! 
'Cause I think I just heard the bomb! Chorus: 
Bomb! Comin,.......
