Some may believe it as a sign 
Some say they're afraid 
We are all looking at the sun Some run nowhere down the street 
Some seek a place to hide 
But we are all running out of time Here comes the day 
As the world will end 
And there's nothing that I can hang on 
Here comes the day 
As I feel regret 
I can't deny I feel so fear oh Some pigeons fall down from the sky 
Some trees have been drying away 
And we only mind of ourselves
