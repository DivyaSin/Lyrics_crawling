I can see everything from here tonight 
And who knows my destiny up in the sky I wanna ride, I wanna fly 
I wanna see the 7 wonders of the world 
I wanna live, I wanna die 
I wanna see the heavens in your eyes (bridge 1) 
I feel U moving closer 
I feel U inside me 
The waiting will soon be over 
And U will be mine (chorus) 
Cause U R my baby 
Don't U, don't U feel it baby 
Cause U R my baby 
Won't U, won't U say it baby 
Cause U R my baby 
Take me in you arms and take me 
Cause U R my baby 
Love me, love me baby baby U woke me from my underworld of dream 
Your salty waters takes me in so deep I feel U breathe, I'll never need 
Access of water as they're rushing over me 
The pain I feel it pleases me 
It takes me up to the land of make believe (bridge 2) 
I'm tripping solely over 
The edge of my mind 
U got me going crazy 
I'm lost in your eyes (chorus) (bridge 1) Cause U R my baby 
Cause U R my baby 
Cause U R my baby 
Don't U, don't U feel it baby 
Cause U R my baby 
Won't U, won't U say it baby 
Cause U R my baby 
Love me, love me baby baby 
Cause U R my baby 
Take me in you arms and take me
