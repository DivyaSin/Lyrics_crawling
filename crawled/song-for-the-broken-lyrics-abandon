Looking at the world 
I see a need for peace 
I want to change the course of history 
I see the heavy souls 
Praying for relief 
A song for the broken we will sing Oooo 
There's a light shining brighter than the sun 
There's a love that can't be broken 
Heaven is coming down, coming down I move within in your veins 
An apathetic face 
Try to recreate a beautiful escape 
Our silence is weak 
An epidemic on repeat 
Love holds the cure for all humanity Oooo 
There's a light shining brighter than the sun 
There's a love that can't be broken 
A savior giving hope to the world 
Heaven is coming down, coming down Blessed are the weak 
When we're down on our knees 
Heaven is singing, heaven is singing 
Blessed are the weak 
When we're down on our knees 
Heaven is singing, heaven is singing 
A song for the broken Oooo... yeah 
There's a light shining brighter than the sun 
There's a love that can't be broken 
A savior giving hope to the world 
Heaven is coming down, coming down 
Ohhh 
Ohhh
