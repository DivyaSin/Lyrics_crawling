Old pirates, yes, they rob i; 
Sold I to the merchant ships, 
Minutes after they took i 
From the bottomless pit. 
But my hand was made strong 
By the 'and of the almighty. 
We forward in this generation 
Triumphantly. 
Won't you help to sing 
These songs of freedom? - 
'cause all I ever have: 
Redemption songs; 
Redemption songs. Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery; 
None but ourselves can free our minds. 
Have no fear for atomic energy, 
'cause none of them can stop the time. 
How long shall they kill our prophets, 
While we stand aside and look? ooh! 
Some say it's just a part of it: 
We've got to fulfil de book. Won't you help to sing 
These songs of freedom? - 
'cause all I ever have: 
Redemption songs; 
Redemption songs; 
Redemption songs.

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery; 
None but ourselves can free our mind. 
Wo! have no fear for atomic energy, 
'cause none of them-a can-a stop-a the time. 
How long shall they kill our prophets, 
While we stand aside and look? 
Yes, some say it's just a part of it: 
We've got to fulfil de book. 
Won't you help to sing 
THESE songs of freedom? - 
'cause all I ever had: 
Redemption songs - 
All I ever had: 
Redemption songs: 
These songs of freedom, 
Songs of freedom.
