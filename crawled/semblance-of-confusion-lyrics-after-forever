As the light's becoming more fierce and the heat is melting your heart 
The fire is awakening there's an ancient fear we all know 
Ominous, misleading, get entangled in yourself It's a feeling, creeps up, deep within 
Sweet taste of innocence forgotten 
A semblance of confusion 
The strength I need is now flowing away 
The choking feeling obstructs everything So erratic in search for the truth 
The pain is strong and persists 
Silence was just a diversion to come out on the hard truth again 
Leaving this world of illusions seen through the eyes of the innocent 
Confronted with the infinity of chaos, forcing you to rearrange When your litanies are unheard 
Phantasm becomes coldly real 
There's a thin line between the world of illusion and reality 
A purgatoric trip through the mirrors within you 
Unconsciousness beholden
