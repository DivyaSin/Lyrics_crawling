Les poissons, les poissons 
How I love les poissons 
Love to chop and to serve little fish 
First I cut off their heads 
Then I pull out the bones 
Ah mais oui 
Ca c'est toujours delish Les poissons, les poissons 
Hee hee hee, hah hah hah 
With the cleaver I hack them in two 
I pull out what's inside 
And I serve it up fried 
God, I love little fishes, don't you? Here's something for tempting the palate 
Prepared in the classic technique 
First you pound the fish flat with a mallet 
Then you slash through the skin 
Gives the belly a slice 
Then you rub some salt in 
'Cause that makes it taste nice Zut alors, I have missed one Sacre bleu, what is this? 
How on earth could I miss 
Such a sweet little succulent crab? 
Quel dommage, what a loss 
Here we go in the sauce 
Now some flour, I think just a dab Now I stuff you with bread 
It don't hurt 'cause you're dead 
And you're certainly lucky, you are 
'Cause it's gonna be hot 
In my big silver pot 
Toodle loo mon poisson, au revoir
