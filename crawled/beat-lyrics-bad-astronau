Save your best moves. It gets weird 
Billions of cops, smoke and mirrors 
Carrying creed cards we all race for death 
Hope to be saved by our next breath 
Walk the beat. It takes years 
You'll drive a mustache or a beard 
We find a rhythm and we fight in song yeah 
All night long, all night long Today, I thought of seeing you 
Today, I thought of early days 
I thought of two cities privileged but estranged 
Today, our old construction site 
Today, a building incomplete 
You aren't missing anything 
But you're missing Good morning everyone 
I hope I didn't sleep too long 
I was dreaming of a failed career 
Killing fields, smoke and mirrors Today, I speak of missing you 
Today, I think of better days 
I see an old city will never be the same 
Today, our old construction site 
Is missing everything 
You're missing everything 
You're missing everything 
Today, I finished what we started 
Today, I thought you might be proud 
We have recorded your defeat 
An album always incomplete
