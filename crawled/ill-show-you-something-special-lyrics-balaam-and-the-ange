Well he takes you up 
And he beats you down yeah 
He plays around and he spends your money 
Heaven knows when that feeling goes 
I'll show you something special 
I'll take the sadness from your smile 
I'm gonna show you something special 
Take me before you break me up 
I feel it growing 
It drives me crazy oh 
Heaven knows I've been waiting 
Waiting for you to come around 
I'll take the sadness from your smile 
I'm gonna show you something special 
Heaven knows if you're gonna stop 
I'll show you something special who yeah 
I'll take the sadness from your smile 
I'm gonna show you something special 
Heaven knows I've been waiting 
Waiting for you to come around 
I'll take the sadness from your smile 
I'm gonna show you something special
