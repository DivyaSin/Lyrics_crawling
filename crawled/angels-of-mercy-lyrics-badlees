(Alexander/Badlees) (Chorus) 
There must be angels of mercy 
Lookin' down on me 
'Cause when I look up to the sky 
I swear I see 
Angels of mercy lookin' down on me Well, I know what I know 
And you know what you know too 
And I know that you know 
Exactly what I think of you 
And if I were you and you were me 
I wouldn't blame you for not liking me 
Even though we aren't enemies (Chorus) Time can have a way of changin' 
Everything you think is right 
And time can have a way of takin' 
Everything you hold too tight 
So you search for explanations 
And you find some now and then 
While the angels 
They're gettin' impatient 
With your experiments (Chorus) I believe there's a power of healing 
That comes with experience 
I believe in believing your feelings 
Even when they make no sense 
But I believe that the way I'm going 
I'm gonna end up too soon dead 
Well, when asked to give my reasons 
This is what I said I might have used my education 
If I gave a shit 
I might have spoke for my generation 
If I agreed with it 
Now some say that I've gone crazy 
But I ain't gone nowhere 
Some say I'm apathetic man, 
But I don't care I admit that I'm a loser 
I admit that I am scum 
I admit I like cheap beer and women 
As much as anyone 
I don't worry about the future 
Who knows what that will bring 
I just wait and see what happens 
And pretend I planned the whole thing 
So let's see what tomorrow brings (Chorus 2x)
