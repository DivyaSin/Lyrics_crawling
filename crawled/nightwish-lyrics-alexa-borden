A steady wind in whispers, 
a night wish's song. 
I ran from a place of safety 
And a place that I once loved. I slid into a deep fog 
lost the way I've always known. 
In whisps of fleeting visions. 
I lost my mind somewhere with the cold. So I'll go where I belong. 
I'll go where I belong. 
I'll just go, oh I'll just go back home. I could taste it in the verse of 
a night wish's song. 
The melody so bitter 
as I tried to venture, I tried to venture on. But I slid into a deep fog 
feeling the lonely in my bones. 
Sewing footprints in the snow logs. 
I sang my night wish, sang my night wish song. So I'll go where I belong. 
I'll go where I belong. 
I'll just go, oh I'll just go back home. Oh and on. On and on. 
On, on, and on, and on. So I'll go where I belong. 
I'll go where I belong. 
I'll just go, oh I'll just go back home. Mmm...
