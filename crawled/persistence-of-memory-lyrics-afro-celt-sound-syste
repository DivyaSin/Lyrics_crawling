When I'm travelling far from home 
On the white horizon, 
I can feel you're still around, 
And the dream overtakes me. Then I know 
You'll stay in this moment 
We'll go where its flowing. 
You'll be what you want to be Right here with me. 
When I'm out here on my own, 
And it all cuts through me. 
I see you're safe alone, Oh then it hits me. 
And I know 
You're here in this moment, 
Right where its flowing. You are what you want to be 
Right here with me. 
Stay in this moment. 
Go where its flowing. You are what you want to be 
Right here with me.
