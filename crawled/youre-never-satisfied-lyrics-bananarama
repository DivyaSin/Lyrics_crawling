I gave you everything but you still want more 
You just don't know what you're looking for 
You used to say I was all you ever need 
But now you're running 'round footloose and free You choose to play the other side of the tracks 
Then expecting me to take you back 
You never know what's good for you 
You want your cake and eat it too [Chorus] 
Took my love, threw it on one side 
Saying the grass is greener on the other side 
You can look but you'll never find 
Don't you know you're never satisfied? If you play with fire, you'd better learn 
You fool around, you get your fingers burned 
Out of mind is out of sight 
Don't know how you sleep at night? [Chorus] Took my love, oh, but you can look 
You're never satisfied 
Don't know how you sleep at night? 
Footloose and free 
You want your cake and eat it too You choose to play the other side of the tracks 
Then expecting me to take you back 
You never know what's good for you 
You want your cake and eat it too [Chorus]
