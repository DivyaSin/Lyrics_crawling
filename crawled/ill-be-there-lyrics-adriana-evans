Summer breeze and autumn leaves 
Children laugh and play 
A mother cries while lovers sigh 
And things my often change 
I'm just here to let you know 
I'll be there So skies are blue and skies are grey 
And heaven touched my hands 
So love could fill your empty heart 
I hope you understand 
I'm just here to let you know 
I'll be there Do you ever wonder what you life has meant 
Just look around 
And where your happiness is spent Well skies are blue and skies are grey 
And heaven touched my hands 
So love could fill your empty heart 
I know you'll understand 
That I'm just here to let you know 
Gotta let my feelings show 
I just came to let you know 
I'll be there 
I'll be there
