I believe I'm gonna 
Shut down my chakras, shift Shiva offa my shelf 
Take down my tie dyes, my Tibetan bells 
Cool down my karma with a can of O.P.T. 
Ain't no call for Casteneda in my frontline library. There's one thing I know, Lord above, 
I ain't gonna go, 
I ain't goin' to Goa, Ain't goin' to Goa now 
Ain't goin' to Goa, Ain't gonna Goa now. Ain't dancin' trance, no thanx, no chance to tranquilize me. 
Ain't sippin' no smart bar drinks, you, that don't satisfy me. 
Dosing up my dharma, with a drop of gasoline, 
I ain't down with Mr. McKenna, tantric mantra talkin' don't move me. I don't need no freaky, deeky, fractal geometry, crystal silicon chip. 
I ain't walking on lay lines, reading no High Times put me on another bad trip. 
Timothy Leary, just check out this theory, 
He sold acid for the F.B.I. 
Well, he ain't no website wonder, the guru just went under, 
You can keep your California Sunshine.
