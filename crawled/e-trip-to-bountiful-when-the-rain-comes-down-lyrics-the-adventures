Come Home 
She makes a promise 
Asks for love 
She needs to know that there is still a God above When the rain comes down 
She'll still be burning 
Her sense of freedom, her joyous air 
Has given way to days of darkness and despair When the rain comes down 
She'll still be burning When the rain comes down 
Burning when the rain comes down She can remember days gone by 
Dream in the open field beneath the starry sky 
She hears her lover's call 
Her heart is yearning She loved these people (loved these people) 
Loved this land (loved this land) 
She must return she feels her time is close at hand 
No matter how she tries, she can't stop caring When the rain comes down still be burning 
When the rain comes down 
Her heart is yearning for her own home town 
Still burning when the rain comes down Don't say tomorrow, it never comes 
O how she loathes this life being trapped in these city slums 
Deep in her memory, her heart is tearing And now she tries to heal the scars left deep inside 
The blood red flower, that once in bloom 
Is dying in her prison When the rain comes down 
Still be burning when the rain comes down 
Still be burning when the rain comes down 
Burning when the rain comes down Come Home
