I leave from softball practice every night 
It's getting dark, but the "golden arches" light up the way 
I turn the corner at the traffic light 
I count my money and then I rehearse what I'm going to say "i'd like an order of fries, a quarter-pounder with cheese, 
I love the light in your eyes, will you go out with me please? " Chorus: 
I am in love with a mcdonalds girl 
She has a smile of innocence so tender and warm 
I am in love with a mcdonalds girl 
She is an angel in a polyester uniform She doesn't try to impress anyone 
She doesn't act all tough like all the other girls that I know 
She don't treat me like a simpleton 
She's not ashamed to be the only other virgin I know 
When my hamburger's cold, I get up ready to go, 
She's only fifteen years old, and I'm in love with her soul She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore 
She'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door...boy! Chorus There she stands behind the register 
She's taking orders from the saddle river little league 
If they knew how much I wanted her 
Their home-room teachers would have to send them home for a week As I head through the door, the movement catches her eye, 
My heart begins to soar, she smiles, she waves good-bye, good-bye 
Good-bye, good byeeeeeeeeeeeeee Chorus Uno, dos, tres, quatro 
Big mac, filet o fish, quarter pounder, french fries 
Icey coke, thick shakes, sundaes and apple pies 
Sing that song of taste 
You can only find at one place: mcdonalds Chorus
