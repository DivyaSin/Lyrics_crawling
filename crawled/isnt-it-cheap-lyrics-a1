This punky club was spinnin' fores off a funky tee 
I'm on the floor and she's watching me 
Guess she was fine 
With a head to thigh inspection, yeah With my back against the wall I play it casually 
Man I don't know but when she smiled at me 
And started grindin' her arse on the horn of some dirty trumpet 
I had to say somethin' Camera shy, no style, gettin' it right 
I said, I wanna take you home, tonight 
And she said Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture 
Love me if you like but I'm not what you need 
Nothing comes for free 
Isn't it cheap, isn't it cheap?" As soon as she got me alone there was no, huh, hesitation 
And she started takin' off all her clothes to Lady Paris singin' 
And I was jackin' her up all night with a lethal injection 
The way she almost put up a fight was so close to perfection Tired eyes, no ties, turn on the light 
I want to see what gets you hot and tonight 
And she said Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture 
Love me if you like but I'm not what you need 
And nothing comes for free 
Isn't it cheap, isn't it cheap?" Isn't it cheap when I'm down on my knees? 
Talkin' sweet just to meet your demands 
See your delight as you're stealin' my night 
Just to play it straight in to my hands Let me take you 
Let me take you baby 
Let me take you 
C'mon and take me baby Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture 
Love me if you like but I'm not what you need 
Nothing comes for free Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture 
Love me if you like, I'm not what you need 
Nothing comes for free 
Isn't it cheap, isn't it cheap?
