You've taken the last of me 
The god's of your innocence shall not protect you from the hate of my wrath 
You've taken the last of me 
Blame the end on yourself 
You deserve each tear that falls 
Scratch out your eyes The blood will drown in red and I will leave you for dead 
A lovely evening draped in regret 
The shadow of justice now engulfs you 
As cold hands reap the pain they've sewn 
You've taken the last of me 
Blame the end on yourself 
You deserve each tear that falls 
Scratch out your eyes The blood will drown in red and I will leave you for dead 
A lovely evening draped in regret 
Forever gone 
The taste of your death replaced the smell of your breath 
A lovely evening draped in regret Suffocate your will to live with my pain 
You were so easily seduced by greed 
You could never feel my calloused hands closing around your throat 
Taste your loss 
Wake into the nightmare that has become our love 
May your screams never cease 
You've taken the last of me Blame the end on yourself 
You deserve each tear that falls 
Scratch out your eyes The blood will drown in red and I will leave you for dead 
A lovely evening draped in regret 
Forever gone 
The taste of your death replaced the smell of your breath 
A lovely evening draped in regret Forever gone 
The taste of your death replaced the smell of your breath 
A lovely evening draped in regret Suffocate your will to live with my pain 
You were so easily seduced by greed 
You could never feel my calloused hands closing around your throat 
Taste your loss 
Wake into the nightmare that has become our love 
May your screams never cease 
You've taken the last of me A knight in shining armor can make your dreams come true
