Shot in the dark 
I wait for your 
Dull gold heart 
I wait Most give it away 
Lay to rest 
Save themselves 
Please promise me now 
On your life 
You won't I've got all you've waited for 
I've got all you need Shot in the dark 
I wait for your 
Dull gold heart 
I wait You, you on your own 
You let me down 
You let me down Never stand in my way 
Your blood red heart 
Will stay 
Will stay I've got all you've waited for 
I've got all you need Shot in the dark 
I wait for your 
Dull gold heart 
I wait
