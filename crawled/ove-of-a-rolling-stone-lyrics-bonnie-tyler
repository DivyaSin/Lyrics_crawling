You hate old Chicago ,in the winter time 
When the cold wind blows right through you 
And you said it ain't no fun 
You called west a dream come true Then one week it got the best of you 
On a path lying in that Oklahoma sun 
Swore if this day ever came 
There'd be no strings, no playing games Misty eyes and sad goodbyes to say 
When love is gone why try to put 
A finger on what happened 
When somewhere down the road It slipped away 
All I ever wanted was a baby in my arms 
A wedding ring and a simple thing called home 
All you ever gave me was a look at some old highway The sky above and the love of a rolling stone 
I remember when you told me 
That you'd always be a drifting man 
And you didn't need another hungry mouth to feed And I won't bring a child into a world between roses 
And a thorn and the side of a tumbling tumbleweed 
One day you may miss me 
But I hope you don't feel guilty Go chase the sun until your dying day 
But inside me there's a second little heartbeat 
That goes with me 
And the one more thing that happened on the way All I ever wanted was a baby in my arms 
A wedding ring and a simple thing called home 
All you ever gave me was a look at some old highway 
The sky above and the love of a rolling stone
