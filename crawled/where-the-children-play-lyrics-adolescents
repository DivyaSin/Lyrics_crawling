Drive-by suicide bombers all over 
In our front yards and in our bedrooms 
Biochemical warfare, anthrax and smallpox 
Stuff it all back in the toy box I want to, I want to play 
I want to play where the children play 
I want to, I want to play 
I want to play where the children play 
In a world where the sun shines each and every day 
I want to play where the children play Fanatics on a mission, it's impossible to tell 
Where the last batch of FDA poison fell 
To justify their vision is a pretty tough sell 
Twin towers blew all our dreams to hell
