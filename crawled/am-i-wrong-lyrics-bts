All the people in all the world 
Will look for something that will keep it turning 
Everyone's got to keep the will 
Every boy every girl I'm no different why the other day 
I saw death like an ocean that could wash us away 
The only comfort that I got was this 
I once was unlovely and now I'm kissed I am born 
Aliver than the raging sea 
Stranger than the strangest beasts 
Than ever can be After midnight and the night is black 
You lie awake and the fear comes back 
That your breath will stop 
And this world will carry on But I am born 
Once there was nothing here 
Not even the smell of fear 
Nothing at all Until you are born 
Gasping out and in to open air 
Taking hold of the atmosphere 
And loving being born
