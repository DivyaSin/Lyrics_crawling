Hello, how are you? 
I'm pretty sure we should be best friends 
I'll walk you to school 
And tell you, you look pretty each new day We'll learn about philosophy by drawing on our arms 
And build ourselves an alright house made out of Uno cards 
They'll say we're unconventional and maybe a little crazy 
We'll ask 'em what's wrong with that? 
Yeah, we'll ask 'em what's wrong with that? Hello, how are you? 
I'm pretty sure we should be best friends 
I'll walk you to the store 
And buy you fancy clothes and shiny pins We'll learn about biology by taking off our clothes 
And buy some yellow spray paint to make a yellow brick road 
Say we're three dimensional and maybe a little lazy 
We'll ask 'em what's wrong with that? 
Yeah, we'll ask 'em what's wrong with that? Hello, how are you? 
I'm pretty sure that we should be best friends 
I'll walk you to the ocean 
And make you a castle of sand to live in We'll learn about geography by sleeping in the grass 
Our bodies'll twitch to wake us up when we fall asleep too fast 
They'll say we're unbelievable and maybe a little trendy 
We'll ask 'em what's wrong with that? 
Yeah, we'll ask 'em what's wrong with that? Hello, how are you? 
I'm pretty sure you're pretty much all I need
