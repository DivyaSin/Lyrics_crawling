Red light, green light 
Red light, green light 
Red light, green light 
Red light, green light 
Passion is dead 
Computer said 
We capture fire 
Karma has died Violence kills the innocent 
A modern youth 
A common truth 
Passion dies 
A silent souls 
Governments they take control 
Extra terrestrial behaviour 
In my own backyard 
The television always lies 
The camera blinds my eyes A.R.T. 
Confused art 
Confused art

Confused art Red light, green light 
Red light, green light Passion's a crime 
Money's alive 
Try and forget 
Karma is dead Politicians always lie 
They cover truth to rule our lives 
Passion dies 
Silent souls 
Governments they take control Extra terrestrial behaviour 
In my own backyard 
The television always lies 
The camera blinds my eyes A.R.T.
