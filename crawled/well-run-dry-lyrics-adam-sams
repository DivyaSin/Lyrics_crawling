Wake up rattled from another sleepless night 
Stuck in between miracles and traffic lights 
Work like the devil, but you're never satisfied You set your pace likes it's required 
And feel completely uninspired Don't let your well run dry 
Keep it filled up Here it comes again, another week gone by 
Like a train almost out of sight 
You try to catch it, but you always fall behind You feel your race has run its course 
But you still live in remorse Don't let your well run dry 
Keep it filled up I can see that you're running on empty 
I can see that your heart is tired 
There's no use in flying solo Caught in a stampede of lies 
Pounded in the ground like railroad ties 
Trying so hard that your engine's fried 
Lay down and rest tonight Don't let your well run dry 
Keep it filled up
