It was an evening to remember 
It was night of noregrets 
Oh well, I met this girl called Amber 
I never forget I met her at the restrooms 
She was the queen of the night 
She looked at me, and then she asked 
" Are you ready for ride?" Oh, oh, oh, this girl spins me round and round 
Faster than the speed of sound 
Oh, oh, oh a will follow her all over town 
As long as she's around 
She takes me up and down, let me feel what's real 
Just to be with her, sounds like a perfect deal 
Oh, oh, oh I guess it's what they call! 
A shot in a bull's eye In a rust we passed the dance floor 
All the guys there outside 
Then she took me to the front door 
And we entered the night 
We were croassing in her Chevy 
Drinking whiskey in the park 
She tasted like chocolate chili 
When we were kissing in the dark Oh, oh, oh, this girl spins me round and round 
Faster than the speed of sound 
Oh, oh, oh a will follow her all over town 
As long as she's around 
She takes me up and down, let me feel what's real 
Just to be with her, sounds like a perfect deal 
Oh, oh, oh I guess it's what they call! 
A shot in a bull's eye At the break of dawn, she said: 
" I guess I'll leave right now 
We had something really special here 
But it'll come to an end any how 
My mama used to say to me: 
Always end on a high note 
So i'm going away, let the memory stay 
And wish you a wonderful, wonderful day" Oh, oh, oh, this girl spins me round and round 
Faster than the speed of sound 
Oh, oh, oh a will follow her all over town 
As long as she's around 
She takes me up and down, let me feel what's real 
Just to be with her, sounds like a perfect deal 
Oh, oh, oh I guess it's what they call! 
A shot in a bull's eye
