Like a good friend 
The shadow from the landfill 
Visits my house everyday 
The glow from the reactor 
Keeps me warm at night 
And I always feel safe 
That was yesterday 
Now they're telling me 
That you've exposed me to your sickness 
And I know it's just a song 
but you can take it and you can stick it 
Where the fucking sun don't sunshine 
Cause it don't round here no more 
And lately I've been inclined 
To strike a few different chords 
With no apologies 
We're going down 
With best regards from Turkey Point 
You raped the land and sea and sky 
And now it's us that you exploit 
And I know I shouldn't drink the water 
Or breathe too deeply anymore 
A stench settles on Princeton 
When it rains sometimes 
And it's absorbed 
Into every pore 
And they're telling me 
And still they offer no apology 
And they show no remorse 
The glow from the reactor 
Chokes the stars at night 
And I know the source
