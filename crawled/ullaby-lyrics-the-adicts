You don't look so good 
You don't look so fine 
Do you think that you've gone too far this time 
O' I'll sing you a lullaby Is your head aching 
Is your body weak 
Is the floor moving 
Can't you speak? How do you feel 
How do you know 
Do you wish you were at home 
But it's a long way to go Find a corner 
Go right down 
Go to sleep 
You won't hear a sound
