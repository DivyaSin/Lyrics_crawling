Sitting by the window all day thinking of you 
Watching the days go by, I started to cry 
But they weren't tears of sadness they only meant I love you 
And I wanna tell you girl that I, oh, I I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you 
It's written in the melody I adore you 
I wrote my love a symphony 
To show you there's nothing I won't do Baby I'll walk around the China Wall for you 
If there's a way I'll do it all for you 
Anything you want me to 
You know I would do People think I'm crazy, they say I'm just a nothing 
Letting my life pass me by, believing you're with me 
Well I can't speak for no one but in my heart I know you love me, yes 
And that's why I'll always tell you I, oh I, oh I, oh I I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you 
It's written in the melody I adore you 
I wrote my love a symphony 
To show you there's nothing I won't do Baby I'll walk around the China Wall for you 
If there's a way I'll do it all for you 
Anything you want me to 
You know I would do I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you 
It's written in the melody I adore you 
I wrote my love a symphony 
To show you there's nothing I won't do Baby I'll walk around the China Wall for you 
If there's a way I'll do it all for you 
Anything you want me to 
You know I would do 
Baby, you know I would do, baby, you know I would do I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you 
It's written in the melody I adore you 
I wrote my love a symphony 
To show you there's nothing I won't do Baby I'll walk around the China Wall for you 
If there's a way I'll do it all for you 
Anything you want me to 
You know I would do
