The sun comes up 
The sun goes down 
But everything stays the same 
It's the same old movie 
Or the same old song 
Only the players change 
It's either 9 to 5 
Or work all night 
Everybody's got to pay their dues 
One half are wrong 
One half are right 
Sometimes you win 
Sometimes you lose Saying me oh my 
We all got to try 
To stay alive 
And we'll get by 
If we all try 
To stay alive There's problems here 
There's problems there 
We got confusion everywhere 
We're all working for a meal 
Or to get a better deal 
You only want what's fair 
I'm stuck on stage 
You're stuck at home 
Everybody wants to trade places 
So I'll be you and you be me 
Nothing changes except the faces Saying me oh my 
We all got to try 
To stay alive 
And we'll get by 
If we all try 
To stay alive Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive 
Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive The sun comes up 
The sun goes down 
But everything stays the same 
It's the same old movie 
Or the same old song 
Only the players change 
It's either 9 to 5 
Or work all night 
Everybody's got to pay their dues 
One half are wrong 
One half are right 
Sometimes you win 
Sometimes you lose Saying me oh my 
We all got to try 
To stay alive 
And we'll get by 
If we all try 
To stay alive Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive 
We got to stay alive, stay alive, stay alive 
Me oh my, we all got to try 
We got to try to stay alive 
We got to get by, we all got to try 
We all got to try, we got to stay alive 
We got to survive, saying me oh my 
We all got to try, to stay, stay alive 
We all got to try, to get by and stay alive Stay alive 
Stay alive 
Stay alive 
Stay alive 
Stay alive 
Stay alive 
Stay alive 
Stay alive 
Stay alive We got to survive, we all got to try 
To stay alive, alive, alive 
We got to got try to survive 
We all got to try to get by, to get by and get by 
We got to try and stay alive
