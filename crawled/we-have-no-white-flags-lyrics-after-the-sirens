Throw open the floodgates, 
we want to feel Your love! But haven't I been waiting? 
Haven't I been getting up from falling dreams 
and slipping on the frozen streams I build my towers on? 
Haven't I been praying for these moments 
where You pick me up and throw me down again? Touch the coal to my lips 
before the curses fall. Haven't I been waiting for the hour when the seasons change for good? 
Haven't I been getting up with bullet wounds and broken limbs and sores? 
Haven't I been praying for the strength to make a sound? Throw open the floodgates, 
we want to feel Your love! We will meet You with hands holding palms 
and we won't stop marching 
till our hearts kiss the hilt of Your sword...
