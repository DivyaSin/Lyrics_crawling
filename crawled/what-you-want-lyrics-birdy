What You Want To Say 
Wait 'Til You Get Home 
Sick Of Communicating 
Over The Telephone 
Tell Me How You Feel 
For I Am Lonely Too 
Need You To Know 
I'm Just As Cold And Numb As You But I Could Fly Away 
Or I Could Be No One 
And You Could Be The Sunshine Falling 
Over The Mountains 
Or You Can Come And Stay 
You Could Come Right Home 
I Don't See Why I Have To Live This Life 
All Alone And I Know 
There Is A Way To Make Up For Our Mistakes 
And I Know 
Whats Happening 
Is For A Reason 
I Know Time To Fly Away 
Or I Could Be No One 
Sunshine Falling Over The Mountains
