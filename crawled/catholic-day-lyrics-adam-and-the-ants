Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F 
Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F 
Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F 
Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F Kennedy No more messing 'round 
Playing with Monroe 
No more turning on 
The middle aged ladies All I remember 
Was his sporty young hairstyle 
All I remember 
Was the Catholic Day Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F Kennedy's wife 
With his brain on her knee 
Poor Jacky, Kennedy's wife 
With his brain on her knee 
Poor Jacky Kennedy, poor Jacky No more rocking chairs 
Sitting on the front porch 
No more soft drugs 
Playing the space race All I remember 
Was you levi sta-prest 
All I remember 
Was the Catholic Day I see the chickens 
Have come home to roost 
I see the chickens 
Have come home to roost I see the chickens 
Have come home to roost 
I see the chickens 
Have come home to roost 
I see the chickens 
Have come home to roost
