[Intro - Ace Hood] 
Mister Hood 
Well alright [Verse 1 - Ace Hood] 
Now little nigga I'm big shit 
Big whips on two six 
Fault niggas, I don't deal with them 
Them real niggas going to feel this 
Fuck niggas that talk a lot 
Fuck niggas that talking back 
Other niggas that ain't around 
But they quick to jump on your jock 
See Carter niggas I chill with 
Known for toting them big clips 
Run your mouth, you're too long around 
These niggas hitting that kill switch 
See money what I been about 
Fuck bitches, no handouts 
Do this shit with my pen down 
Guarantee that I tear down 
See that's all that they get from me 
Bubble gum in this bag of lean 
Bouncing up on that trampoline 
Riding off in that tangerine 
About the cost of my pinky ring 
Feet draped in that Louis V. 
Duffle bag when I'm over seas 
Get a flick when you see a G 
Nigga diamonds all on my neck and wrist 
Fuck a nigga that's hating me 
Hottest nigga you know about it 
Never needed no gasoline 
Nigga fly, nigga I been this 
Swag off the hinges 
Don't believe my word of mouth 
Just go and ask them bitches [Chorus - Ace Hood] 
Now why you mad? 
I'm getting bands 
I got a chauffeur homie, you in the van 
I hear them hating holmes, I understand 
Now watch me ball, stay in the stands 
Now why you mad? 
Why you mad? 
Why you mad? 
Why you mad? 
Now why you mad? 
Why you mad? 
They say I'm arrogant 
That's why you mad? [Verse 2 - Gucci Mane] 
They hostile like a little child 
They fragile, I'm agile 
I'm too cold, let me tell you something 
Nigga stop all because I'm iced out 
Hold up, Chris find this 
Your highness, I'm shining 
Got a gold touch like Midas 
My rock be the tightest 
You want to bite me 
Probably want to fight me 
I woke up in an igloo 
I'm always be icy 
Strapped up like Birdman, and Lil Wayne, and Mack Maine 
I'm Gucci Mane, I'm off the chain 
I have no go license 
Cigarette in my Lambo' 
Man in my Ferrari 
Call it Fast and Furious 
They furious, I'm sorry 
Curious, she choosing 
Looking at my pockets 
Mine full of them hundreds 
Baby it's no problem 
It's Gucci
