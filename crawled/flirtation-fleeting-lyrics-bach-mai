I'm watching the world fall apart 
And all I can see is you 
Holding my heart I can see in your eyes 
You pulling my insides 
Schemes and flirtation fleeting 
My soul can't bear your mind There's fire bursting in flames 
And all I can think is you 
Calling my name I can see in your eyes 
You pulling my insides 
Schemes and flirtation fleeting 
My soul can't bear your mind Woah, Woah 
Woah, Woah Just tell me the truth 
Tell me what you want me to hear 
Cause right now I'm burning 
It's your last chance my dear And I'm hoping 
That you'll pull me through this fate 
But it's too late I'm watching my world fall apart 
And all I can hear is you 
Ripping my heart
