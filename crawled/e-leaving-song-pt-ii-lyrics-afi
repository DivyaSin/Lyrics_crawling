Don't waste your touch 
You won't feel anything 
Or were you sent to save me? 
I've thought to much 
You won't find anything 
Worthy of redeeming Yo he estado aqu muchas veces antes y regreso To break down 
And cease all feeling 
Burn now 
What once was breathing 
Reach out 
And you may take my heart away Imperfect cry 
And scream in ecstasy 
So what befalls the flawless? 
Look what I've built 
(Please don't do this) 
It shines so beautifully 
(Why won't you look at me?) 
Now watch as it destroys me Y regreso aqu otra vez y comienzo To break down 
And cease all feeling 
Burn now 
What once was breathing 
Reach out 
And you may take my heart away Break down 
And cease all feeling 
Burn now 
What once was breathing 
Reach out 
And you may take my heart away I left it all behind and never said goodbye 
I left it all behind and never said goodbye 
I left it all behind and never said goodbye 
I left it all to die I saw its birth 
I watched it grow 
I felt it change me 
I took the life 
I ate it slow 
Now it consumes me Break down 
And cease all feeling 
Burn now 
What once was breathing 
Reach out 
And you may take my heart away Break down 
And cease all feeling 
Burn now 
What once was breathing 
Reach out 
And you may take my heart away 
Heart away
