(Here comes the night time) 
(Here comes the night time) 
(Here comes the night time) 
Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time I hurt myself again 
Alone with all my friends 
Feels like it never ends 
Here comes the night again Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time You hurt yourself again 
Alone with all your friends 
Feels like it never ends 
Here comes the night again Here comes the night time, coming on slow (Here comes the night time) 
Here comes the night time, I know that you know (Here comes the night time) 
Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time Well, I hurt myself again 
Alone with all my friends 
Feels like it never ends 
Here comes the night again Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night
