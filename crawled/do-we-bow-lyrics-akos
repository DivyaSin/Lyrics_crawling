Suffer from greed and look for more 
Try to get higher, try to get by 
Live your life without prayer 
Easy like the catcher in the rye 
Or set out on this journey with me 
Tired of all the lies 
Milk and honey overdose 
In the world of artificial smiles 
Do we bow, boy? 
You say you're happy then you cry at night 
The river of anguish will flow 
Rise up and shake off the pain 
Let off steam, let the strength show 
Unmask the torturer 
Unmask him, be brave 
Unmask the conqueror 
The one that turns your life into your grave 
Do we bow, boy? 
Do we bow, boy? 
Do we bow or do we fight for it? 
Do we bow, boy? 
Do we bow or do we fight for it? 
Do we bow, boy? 
Do we bow or do we cut them dead?
