About a sense I have wondered 
I have searched my deep, inner core 
And I said... to think I shall not anymore... The thought has aged me whole 
It ruined body, mind and soul 
Oh, thoughtless if I'd been born

And I said... to think I shall not anymore... Fetid thought, spawning curse

Only pain and suffering you brought 
The worst disappointment you are
