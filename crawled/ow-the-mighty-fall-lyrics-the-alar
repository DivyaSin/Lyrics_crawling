Once you held your finger on the trigger 
Now the gun is pointing at your head 
Once you reigned supreme 
Over all that you could see 
Now you walk on the other side of the street How the mighty fall 
I've seen it all before 
From the highest heights 
To the lowest of lows 
How the mighty fall Once your words were the first and last on the subject 
Now they hang like a noose around your neck 
Once you held the light 
That could be seen from near and far 
Now you fall and stumble in the dark How the mighty fall 
I've seen it all before 
From the highest heights 
To the lowest of lows 
How the mighty fall Once you held the secrets of the world within your hands 
Now you're just another grain of sand 
Once you were the first 
Revered to the last 
Now they talk about your fall from grace How the mighty fall 
I've seen it all before 
From the highest heights 
To the lowest of lows 
How the mighty fall (How the mighty fall) 
How the mighty fall 
(How the mighty fall) 
How the mighty fall 
(How the mighty fall) 
The harder, the harder, the harder they fall 
(How the mighty fall) 
The harder, the harder, the harder they fall 
(How the mighty fall) 
How the mighty fall
