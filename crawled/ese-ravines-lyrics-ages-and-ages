These ravines were here before us 
So make your case from on your patio 
We'll be thorough in ignoring it all And it makes no difference what you say 
'Cause we never listen and we're sure to be 
Safe as always from your patio calls And it's ours to explore how we want to explore 
There's a reason we're out here 
But you have no use 
So go back to wherever you came from before 
And remember your manners 'cause someday we're sure to be Ashes, ashes, everyone and whatever's left is 
better off in the world without us, 
here to squander it all So it makes no difference what you say to us 
We don't even take you serious 
Safe as always from your patio calls And it's ours to relate how we want to relate 
There's a reason we're in it 
But you have no use 
So go back to whatever 
You were doing before you decided to speak 
And remember your manners or we'll overshadow you all
