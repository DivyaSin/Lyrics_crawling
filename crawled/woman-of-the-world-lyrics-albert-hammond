Albert Hammond 
It Never Rains in Southern California 
Woman Of The World 
It isn't easy to say goodbye 
I try to understand the reason why 
My body is shaking 
My heart is aching within me From my window I watch you go 
He's waiting for you in the street below 
His arms wide open while mine are cold and so empty 'Cause your world and my world they're drifted apart 
in yours the sun is shining 
in mine it's raining 
knocking on the lonely one And your life and my life they've gone separated ways 
in yours a new tomorrow 
in mine the sorrow 
knocking on the lonely one Through the teardrops that cloud my eyes 
I see the image of the love gone by 
a silhouette that I won't forget for a long time 
The days are longer now that you're gone 
Without your loving arms to keep me whole 
My future lies on a cloudy skies with no sunshine 'Cause your world and my world they're drifted apart 
in yours the sun is shining 
in mine it's raining 
knocking on the lonely one 'Cause your world and my world they're drifted apart 
in yours the sun is shining 
in mine it's raining 
knocking on the lonely one And your life and my life they've gone separated ways 
in yours a new tomorrow 
in mine the sorrow 
knocking on the lonely one"
