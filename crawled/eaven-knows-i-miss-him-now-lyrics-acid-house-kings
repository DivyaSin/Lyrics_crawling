You never looked back* 
You never dared 
"Oh, please, do not remind me" 
What if you were 
and what if you cared? 
"Oh, why would I?" 
You're dancing the week away 
You're fooling a few, maybe 
But on a bus down memory lane 
You cannot help but cry 
Heaven knows I miss him now 
Heaven knows I'm coming back 
Heaven knows I'm a sea inside 
just like a heart attack 
But I never, no never 
did wrong 
Heavens knows I miss him now 
I can see the reason why you would 
"Oh well, it's not that often" 
Let me tell you when and how 
"Oh, and do you?" 
On weekdays you feel okay 
On Fridays you stay up late 
Sundays when you wake at home 
you cannot help but cry 
Heaven knows I miss him now 
Heaven knows I'm coming back 
Heaven knows I'm a sea inside 
just like a heart attack 
But I never, no never 
did wrong 
Heaven knows I miss him now 
The memories will haunt you to the end 
You'll listen to your love songs from back then 
Music sounds better with him 
Music sounds better 
Heaven knows I miss him now 
Heaven knows I'm coming back 
Heaven knows I'm a sea inside 
just like a heart attack 
But I never, no never 
did wrong 
Heaven knows I miss him now
