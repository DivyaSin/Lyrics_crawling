Congratulate my friends 
on the birth of a healthy son 
take him quietly and hold him in my arms 
It will seem so violent 
crying on each others' shoulders 
always We're for the other 
we're for each other Divided in the garden 
I am waiting for myself 
to cool off silently 
or to keep it by 
it's a gutted one 
a side that's split away 
I take him quietly and hold him in my arms When they know you 
when they know you 
when they know you 
when they really really know you 
it will seem so obvious 
fixing what is never broken 
always
