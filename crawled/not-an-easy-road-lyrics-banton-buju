Chorus-2x 
It's not an easy road 
Many see the glamour and the glitter 
And think it's a bed of rose 
Who feels it knows 
Lord help me sustain these blows 
From the minute of birth you enter this earth 
Obstacles in your way to overcome first 
Throughout everyday they seem to get worse 
Oh my God cast away this curse 
Everybody is trying to make ends meet 
Through every way the endeavor 
Lord God you see it 
No matter what the world may say on the street 
Must have to survive, won't accept defeat 
Now I'm weary, tired and dreary 
Got no time to waste 
You know me 
Chorus 
By you rise to see the sun 
Who you love a pull you down 
Trying to discredit the works you have done 
Some can't satisfy with the past of ally 
From the Scribes and Pharisees 
You've got to stay wide 
Hold up your head glancing on both side 
Waiting anticipating praying for you to slide 
Righteousness prevails with Jah by my side 
Deliver Jonah from the whale 
Never leave him to die 
Help us all Abbaba Joni 
Hold up my head and cry 
Chorus 
I've been travelling all morning 
With such a heavy load 
Now it's noon and I cannot afford 
To put down this burden alongside the road 
I've got to hold it, got to humble myself 
Like a child 
Upon my face I've the got to put on a smile 
Make up my mind just to walk more miles 
Because I know that 
Chorus
