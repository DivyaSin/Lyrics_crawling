You give me loving like crazy 
You make my daisy grow high 
You treat me good, so I'm lazy 
You make me feel so alive You get me feeling I'm okay 
And I've got nothing to hide 
And if you're leaving for a while, babe 
You know, I'd die babe, babe, I'd die I tell you I love you 
I'll tell you no lies 
I tell you I need you 
And I want you by my side Used to be cold and lonely 
You came along with your smile 
And if you leave now, I'll cry, babe 
You know, I'd die babe, babe, I'd die I tell you I love you 
I'll tell you no lies 
I tell you I need you 
And I want you by my side Used to be cold and lonely 
You came along with your smile 
And if you leave now and cry, babe 
You know, I'd die babe, babe, I'd die
