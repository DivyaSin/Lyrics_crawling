Our empire has fallen 
The columns came crashing down 
Faster than children could outrun the shadows drunk with hysteria 
The survivors are running for their lives 
As precious dreams erupt before their very eyes Tonight, its over, at long last we will fall 
Ruins will fight in our stead My flesh is burning from the embers 
But still the brilliant tale of our utopia 
Survives tonight her beautiful exterior may crash and burn 
To ash but the fight for her honor will rage on 
I hope I never see the end I hope 
I never have to live without her comfort but for now she dies 
Oh Rome! so full of majesty, you're gone Wind chokes on the ashes as acrid smoke strangles the sun 
Their jealous arrows rain, 
Hollow drums pound at the gates breaking the din of screams 
Our feeble offerings to forgotten Gods are left to rot in temples of their lust 
As they lay forth their plans to destroy our pride, our home Tonight, its over, at long last we will fall 
Ruins will fight in our stead My flesh is burning from the embers 
But still the brilliant tale of our utopia 
Survives tonight her beautiful exterior may crash and burn 
To ash but the fight for her honor will rage on 
I hope I never see the end I hope 
I never have to live without her comfort but for now she dies 
Oh Rome! so full of majesty, you're gone Beg the flames for our mercy These aged walls have seen too much 
To forget the past in the face of this final trial 
Watch her crumble so true as mayhem cuts her down let them have our treasure, 
Her voice lives on let them take our city for her splendor lives on At long last we will fall
