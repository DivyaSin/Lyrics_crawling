And when the world youre facing 
Is no longer kind 
And when the dreams youre chasing 
Have left you behind Faith holds on by a thread and hope becomes lost in the fray 
Keep these words in your heart just one more day: He will find you there 
When the world is blue 
In His arms youll stay 
He will comfort you 
He will light your way 
If youre lost and scared 
When youve run away 
He will find you there And when the cross you carry 
Is far too much, too much to bear 
And when the life you bury 
Is mourned in despair All is not lost and gone Come what will, come what may 
Keep this truth in your heart just one more day: He will find you there 
When the world is blue 
In His arms youll stay 
He will comfort you 
He will light your way 
If youre lost and scared 
When youve run away 
He will find you there And if the madness leaves you lonely 
And if the silence leaves you torn 
Just reach out for One who seeks love only 
Find peace safe from the dark storm He will find you there 
When the world is blue 
In His arms youll stay 
He will comfort you 
He will light your way 
If youre lost and scared 
When youve run away 
He will find you there He will find you there 
When the world is blue 
In His arms youll stay 
He will comfort you 
He will light your way 
If youre lost and scared 
When youve run away 
He will find you there He will find you there 
He will find you there
