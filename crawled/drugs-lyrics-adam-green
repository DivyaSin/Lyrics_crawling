There's a time that will come 
When the kitchen is sunny and 
There's just no other place I like to be And everything's gone 
And my finger is longer 
And I never want to come down again I feel so lonely 
I feel so lonely 
I got cold last night on a West-bound train I love the moonlight 
That combs the praires 
I got cold last night on a box car floor Oh my baby couldn't shame me that day 
When my lady threw my drugs away 
Hey, I almost thought she'd need me to know 
I like drugs 
I love them so I like drugs 
I like to linger in the alleyway 
I like drugs 
I like to hold them for a friend 
And everything's gone 
And my finger is longer 
I never want to come down again I like to do drugs 
I like to have drugs 
I like to hold a cigarette full of grass in my hand 
Until one morning 
That ugly morning 
When the brat got stabbed and the cat got drunk Oh my baby couldn't shame me that day 
When my lady threw my drugs away 
Hey, I almost thought she'd need me to know 
I like drugs 
I love them so I like drugs
