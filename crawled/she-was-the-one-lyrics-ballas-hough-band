I was the one 
I was the one who tried to pick you up 
But the other one was waiting 
I could not afford to be stood up 
Right as you call 
Right as you call "I have to get my stuff" 
Don't defend the decision 
Or pretend it didn't happen to us Just before I could go 
She would run run run run run run run 
She was the one 
She was the one who tried to break us 
One who tried to take us apart 
She was the one 
Before the fun had even begun And I hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
All the time time time 
Hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
All the time time time time time time time But forgiving is fun 
Over the nights I knew that she was the one 
I get my day book open just to angle for a coffee with someone 
But she'll never fall (in love) 
She'll never fall in love with one of us 
She's the time to keep us thinking 
All along that we've got things worked up Just before all I saw 
I could run run run run run run 
She was the one 
She was the one who tried to break us 
One that tried to take us apart 
She was the one 
Before the fun had even begun And I hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
All the time time time 
Hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
All the time time time time time time time You and I both know that's real enough to let it go 
But still 
We've got things all thinking all the time 
Enough to talk about 
And you know why things go wrong She was the one 
She was the one who tried to break us 
One who tried to take us apart 
Yeah, she was the one 
Before the fun had even begun 
And I hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
All the time time time 
Hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
Hardly think about her 
All the time time time time time time time 
I think that she was the one 
I think that she was the one
