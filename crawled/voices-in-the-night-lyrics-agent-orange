Night time - all alone - nowhere to begin 
It seems to me that in the past 
The darkness was my friend 
Those times have changed, I'm now a stranger In a violent place 
I walk alone down empty streets 
I turn my head, did someone call my name? I feel alright - but I keep on hearing voices in the night 
I've got a feeling something's wrong 
But I can't place it 
A feeling that I know is real 
'Cause I can taste it Someone's watching me - I feel their presence 
But I can't see them 
Some else is right behind me 
I hold my breath - I get the feeling...
