Well, it's hard to live, it's hard to live in the city 
Yes, it's hard to live, so hard to live in the city I've been following you for blocks 
And I wish that you would stop and tell me your name 
But I couldn't understand 
What you told me as you ran away So just lay your head down low 
Don't let anybody know 
That it's hard to live, it's hard to live in the city 
Yes, it's hard to live, it's hard to live in the city There's something about you that I couldn't tell 
And you were always crazy and I didn't like that 
There's something about you that I knew so well To all those questions, I have no answers 
I wish that I could sit in the sun So just lay your head down low 
Don't let anybody know 
That it's hard to live, it's hard to live in the city 
Yes, it's hard to live, so hard to live in the city What are you asking? No need for walking out 
You took all I could keep 
You couldn't even tell me, the look was on you face 
I'll think that we have left To all those questions, I have no answers 
I wish that I could sit in the sun
