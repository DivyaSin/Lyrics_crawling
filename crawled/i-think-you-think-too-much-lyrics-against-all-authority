Don't know I'm watching you and every move you make I know what you do and everything you say I hear loud and clear and there wont be no escape So don't stand in our way, obey For those of you who won't cooperate and you will soon be forgotten Or you'll be taken away mind and body rottin' I think you think too much- you think too much and you'll pay for what you do and say And everything you do and say will come back some day Just look at this fucking mess you made Choose carefully the words you wish to speak We're watching you Detained 8 hours, It was looking bleak Confiscated my zines and my lyric sheets We stood and watched in disbelief We pulled away to their defeat They called the dogs, they called us thieves They stripped our van to the cold concrete We made it to the show and didn't miss a beat Will follow you and its unfortunate And freedom of speech we will not tolerate So sign that line the lies that I create You opened your mouth and your words agitate
