we fought that beast 
your old man and me 
it had a chicken's head with duck feet 
and with a woman's face too 
(hey that's rad!) 
it was waiting in the bushes for us 
and it ripped off your dad's face 
he was screaming something awful 
in fact it made a huge mess I had to change the floors 
(the floors?) you see his blood had drained into the boards and I had to change 'em
