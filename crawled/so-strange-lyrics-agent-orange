I've heard that voice before somehow, I can't imagine 
It speaks words without knowing what they mean 
I've seen that face before somewhere, I can't remember 
It seems as if it happened in a dream I laughed and now you know 
That some things never change 
I laughed again because to me you seem 
So strange I know, I never should expect to finish something 
I know will never be complete 
I feel as if I'm lost again, I'm not, I'm only dreaming 
In a world where sound and silence seem to meet I block out all the noise 
A silent song remains 
I know it's only music but it sounds 
So strange How does it feel to speak the words 
And sing the song? 
So strange So strange 
So strange 
So strange
