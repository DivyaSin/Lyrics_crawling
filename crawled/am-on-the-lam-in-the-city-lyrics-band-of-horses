If the trials up here 
Are really getting you down 
You had a close call 
I didn't even see it in another one 
I hardly believed it all What the writers say 
It means shit to me now 
Plants and animals 
Appear on the bend when its 80 degrees 
The end of December whats going on 
Now before 
You and me In the showing up here 
Its going back to the south 
Were hungry next that I know 
And running a blender in a lightning storm 
The disguise is a blessing i'm sure And growing up here 
There comes a fork in the road 
Pants have got to go 
We're on an island on the 4th of July 
It looks like the tide is going home
