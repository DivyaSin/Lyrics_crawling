I told you and I thought you said you understood. 
It never stays inside your head, is it made of wood? 
I talk and talk all night, 
I never get it right, 
I never make it clear? 
Even I am screaming in my dreams, 
But no one seems to hear I'm-a weeping, 
I'm-a wailing, 
My life is so frustrating 
I'm-a weeping, 
I'm-a wailing, 
My life is so frustrating So many people everyday, I have to meet 
So many things I have to say, stay incomplete 
I try to be so nice, 
Listen to bad advice, 
Thinking all the while 
I'm so angry I just want to shout 
But behind the smile, Don't dabble with controversy they're telling me 
Make sure you don't offend the BBC 
Just try and keep it clean, Don't make it too obscene 
'cause if you do you'll land in trouble 
Please excuse me if I heave a sigh 
It makes me wanna cry
