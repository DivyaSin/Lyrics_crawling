Heavy duty pleasure zone 
The schools are empty and they're on their own 
Teenage libido they've got it made 
A touch of make-up an d they make the grade 
You know it is no secret 
Even though you don't believe it 
It goes on 
Down in the basement the wild child queens 
Soho monarchs to a manhood dream 
Caught in the limelight sex for fame 
Innocence is traded for the lines they gain 
You know it is no secret 
Even though you don't believe it 
It goes on
