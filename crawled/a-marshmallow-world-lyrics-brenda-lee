[Chorus] 
It's a marshmallow world in the winter 
When the snow comes to cover the ground 
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day 
I wait for it the whole year around Now those marshmallow clouds being friendly 
In the arms of the ever green trees 
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head 
It's shining so your nose won't freeze Oh, the world is your snowball, see how it grows 
That's how it grows whenever it snows 
The world is your snowball just for our soul 
So get up and roll it along It's a yum yummy world, made for sweet hearts 
Take a walk with your favorite guy 
It's a sugar date, what a spring is late 
In winter it's a marshmallow world [Chorus] Those marshmallow clouds being friendly 
In the arms of the ever-green-trees 
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head 
It's shining so your nose won't freeze Oh, the world is your snowball, see how it grows 
That's how it grows whenever it snows 
The world is your snowball just for our soul 
You better get up and roll it along Oh, it's a yumm yummy world, made for sweet hearts 
Take a walk with your favorite guy 
It's a sugar date, what a spring is late 
In winter it's a marshmallow world It's a marshmallow world 
It's a snow covered world 
It's yummy, yummy world 
It's a marshmallow world
