Im in the prime of my life, I feel like a kid 
One of these days itll all catch up 
But Id rather fight than quit 
In the Prime of my life, somethings gotta give 
Even if it kills, I wont give up 
Kill the kill joy... Live! Theres a big hole in my heart, where all the money used to be 
If loves a crime, Ive done my time as far as I can see 
Id trade in all the bullshit, even if I lose... 
For all the rock and roll Ive lived Ive drunk a case of blues Im in the prime of my life, feel like a kid 
One of these days itll all catch up 
But Id rather fight than quit 
In the prime of my life, somethings gotta give 
Even if it kills, I wont give up 
Kill the kill joy... Live! 
(dehnl alannahl ana deh deh deh deh) Life gives us a choice, we can laugh or we can cry 
I ve been bending over backwards trying to walk a straight damn line 
I was borne a child of light, but the devils been my friend 
Aint nothin gonna stop this woman from busting this dead end! Im in the prime of my life, I feel like a kid 
One of these days itll all catch up 
But Id rather fight than quit 
In the, Prime of my life, somethings gotta give 
Even if it kills, I wont give up 
Kill the kill joy... Live! What the hells so wrong with coming undone 
Its too late to stop whats already begun 
So what the hells so wrong with coming undone, Undone! (dehnl alannahl ana deh deh deh deh) Im in the prime of my life, feel like a kid 
One of these days Itll all catch up, But Id rather fight than quit 
Im in the prime of my life, somethings gotta give 
One of these days itll all catch up but I only got one life to live 
Im in the prime of my life, prime of my life, Prime of my life, 
Feel like a kid, one of these days itll all catch up 
But Id rather fight than quit 
Prime of my life, something's gotta give, 
Even if it kills, I wont give up, 
Kill the kill joy, kill the kill joy, Live x 9
