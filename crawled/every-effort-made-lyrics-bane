Holding this moment in the palm of my hand 
This thing still means so much to me 
Beliefs that have stood the test of time 
A force that surrounds us - penetrates us binds us all together 
These days belong to us 
It's in the things that we said, and all that it meant 
Ideals that won't fade and every effort made 
And it's so much more that just fucking clothes 
It's in the way that you cannot sit still 
Chewing on words but spitting out actions 
Fire the fire that burns so deep inside 
The fire that keeps hardcore alive
