I live the life that I've been left 
I leave most things unspoken 
But deep inside Geronimo is tearing me apart 
I've seen him in the streets 
And I've seen him in the pictures 
Killer in the home 
Killer in the home 
Now's the time I must digress 
From going through the motions 
Take my head out of its sling 
Free the warrior 
I'll fight him in my dreams 
And I'll fight him till he kills me 
Killer in the home 
Killer in the home 
They cut you in half with a gun 
And give you a band aid 
They gut you in half with a gun 
And give you a band aid 
Killer in the home 
Killer in the home 
Killer 
Is the home
