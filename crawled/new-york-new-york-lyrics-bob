Verse 1: 
This is the finish my friend, this is the end 
It's a revolution, it's a civilian revenge 
There's no need to move or adjust your television 
Whenever an era dies, another era begins 
These American fights, these American wars 
These American stripes, these American stars, 
But these American cages have American bars 
We hunger for truth, so we headed for ya'll 
Towers are crumbling, bridges are falling 
Limits are fading, but normal is boring 
Looking at time move, aggressively forward 
Looking at days just, just vanish before me 
You wanted the Benz, but you couldn't afford it 
Now you would kill to put your foot in a Taurus 
It's a different madness, they would never abandon us 
But this is a crisis, prepare for disaster Chorus: 
Start spreading the news (start, start, start, start spreading the news) 
I'm leaving today (and I'm gone, and I'm gone, and I'm gone just like that ) 
I want to be a part of it (be, be, be, be, yea) 
New York, New York, New York Breaker breaker nine breaker breaker one nine 
Could you please get an operator on the phone line 
This is not a riot, it's way much more than that 
These people are dying, we are under attack 
Wait, let me call you back, let me get my strap 
(cause) We ain't taking shit, so therefore we're fighting back 
We ain't waiting on the line for a 9-1-1-9-9 whatever man, 
I ain't got time for all this nonsense 
Enemy responses, ain't a dial tone in our home on that continent 
Got me in these bandages, this jungle is a fundament 
Man I swear they sleeping in your conscience, so they slumbering 
So we break the peace to get a piece of what we wanted yea 
Act like we new to this, not think I'm rummaging 
Let them know we run this shit 
And let them know just how you feel the way your country is 
Now look how beautiful destruction is, bloah Start spreading the news (start spreading the news) 
I'm leaving today (I'm leaving, I'm leaving yea) 
I want to be a part of it (be a part of New York) 
New York, New York, (New York) New York
