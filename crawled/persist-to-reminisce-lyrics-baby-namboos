Hear soft echoes 
The drums in the distance 
Like buried treasure 
I'm measuring my persistence 
True-a-view, I pursue 
Now that my conscience is free 
Open the claim 
The durban poison diva tree Now off my leash I'm free to roam 
And I give up all this load for some stones 
Take me back to a time

The durban poison diva tree

Hard like the building blocks of stability Now off my leash I'm free to roam 
And I give up all this load for some stones 
Take me back to a time 
When I was less of a man 
Had no plan and my mind was driftin' 
Movin' along into an unsettled future 
So many distractions 
I'm anxious as I nuture Now we got something for you, oh yeah 
Show you the way to the door and I don't care
