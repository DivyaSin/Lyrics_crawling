Can't you see, you're not free 
you ain't never gonna be 
I'm not gonna bend to fit society 
I'm not gonna remove what's deep inside of me 
money's your god its got no hold on me 
a puppet on a string is all you're ever gonna be 
they're gonna destroy what we worked so hard to create 
a subculture of consciousness againts a bourgeis society state 
a slave, I never want to be a part of your society 
can't you see you're not free 
you ain't never gonna be 
punk's not dead, it never will be 
if we keep the corporate shit out of the scenery 
your money, your suit, your tie doesn't impress me 
the media's corrupting the scene, but they can't touch me 
keep punk pure, keep punk true, beat your ass in, 
your black and blue take your money, shove it up your ass, 
ain't sellin' punk for cash alternatives big, 
corrupting the scene, major labels makin green 
i ain't gonna sell it, i ain't gonna buy it 
as long as their in the scene, i'm gonna fight it 
don't support the bands that sell it, 
they think their shit don' stink, i smell it 
bullet in their head is what they need 
time to take back the scene that we made 
rise up, wise up don't let the scene fade
