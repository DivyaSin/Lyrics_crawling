A rollin' rock, electric shock 
She gives a lickin' that doesn't stop 
She line 'em up, push you 'round 
Smokin' rings going round and round Her hot potatoes 
Will elevate you 
Her bad behavior 
Will leave you standing proud 
Hard as a rock Hard as a rock 
Harder than a rock 
Hard as a rock 
Harder than a rock The lightnin' rod, strike it hot 
Gonna hit you like the Rushmore rock 
No nicotine, and no pipe dreams 
So low and dirty it's darn right mean Hell elevator 
I'll see you later 
No I ain't gonna take it 
I'm bustin' out 
Hard as a rock Hard as a rock 
Harder than a rock 
Hard as a rock 
Harder than a rock
