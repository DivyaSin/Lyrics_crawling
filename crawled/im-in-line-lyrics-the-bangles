I don't want to wait in line for you 
Darlin', you know that's what I'll do 
The girls are pretty, the girls are many 
Aw, but you're heart is empty 
No one's filling it up for you. Well, I'm in line for you, my darlin' 
Yeah, yeah. In the morning when I rise I see 
Another girl in line ahead of me 
Oh, what advantage with the way you do me 
When you walk by and when you get round to me 
Yeah, take a look at me. I'm in line for you, my darlin' 
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah I'm in line (alright). I don't want to waste my time 
Waiting for some boy to change his mind 
You don't ever notice I'm standing in the shadow 
And I can't tell you why. I'm in line for you, my darlin' 
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah I'm in line. I'm in line, I'm in line 
I'm in line, I'm in line 
I'm in line, I'm in line 
I'm in line, I'm in line.
