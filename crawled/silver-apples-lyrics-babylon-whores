The earth becomes gold / And gold earth / A promise inhaled / With the breath of our birth / We chase the dragon / Trip the lights / Burning our eyes / On marvelous sights 
We are there (once awake) / Once asleep (never more) / Can we open the door 
And in the end / We kiss the ones / Sleeping next to us / With the lips of a snake / Heart full of Hell / Fearing that they would wake / So fragile they could break 
The silver apples of our truth / Green and gold of bygone youth / Haunting us each day to / Return anew / And day by day the thing inside / Grows and devours us alive / Just as sure as we will die / Just as sure as we will die
