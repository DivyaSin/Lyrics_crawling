If you have trouble coming to Jesus, my friend 
'Cause its so easy; just believe and He'll mend 
Your broken heart 
And give you eternal life I used to hate God, churches, and all 
But I took His new life when I heard His call 
Into my heart 
And I took His gift of love Strangeness inside; wonders and chills 
Then tears, like rain; such sweet, sweet pain 
I knew His love 
He left my hate far behind
