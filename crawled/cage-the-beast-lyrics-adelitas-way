I see it in your eyes 
You're feeling paranoid 
You know just what I've done 
You know what I've become 
I feel it deep inside 
With all the pain and lies 
I know just what I want 
I am an animal I think it's time I let you go 
If I could just end it all You can't cage the beast 
There's no breaking me 
You can't cage the beast inside of me 
I feel the weight 
And all the pain 
You can't cage the beast inside of me 
Inside of me I feel it in your vibe 
You are a parasite 
Who knows just what I've done 
I think your time has come 
You try to turn the tide 
I think you've lost your mind 
Afraid of what I want 
To see what I've become I think it's time I let you go 
If I could just end it all You can't cage the beast 
There's no breaking me 
You can't cage the beast inside of me 
I feel the weight 
And all the pain 
You can't cage the beast inside of me 
Inside of me You can't cage the beast 
There's no breaking me 
You can't cage the beast inside of me 
I feel the weight 
And all the pain 
You can't cage the beast inside of me 
Inside of me
