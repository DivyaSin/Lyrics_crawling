I'll stay with you either way) What's the bright idea? 
Come with me and I'll just put you down (I don't care bout what you say 
I still want you any way) You know what I've done 
I'm no good for anyone I've got nothing for you 
What do you think I've figured out?

What do you think I've figured out? 
Figured out? Why'd you bring that up? 
Do you know me better than myself? (I don't care bout what you say 
If you don't want me throw me away) If you wanna hold it over me 
than you might as well (I don't care bout what you say 
I still want you either way) You know what I've done 
Why don't you tell everyone I've got nothing for you
