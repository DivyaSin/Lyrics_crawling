Marlon Brando eats alone tonight 
I may be right 
But then, I don't know much about him 
There's a part of you my system lacks 
But through the cracks 
It only shows in bits and pieces I always feel I'm talking to 
The person who last talked to you 
Your rabbit's foot and four leaf clover 
Only serve to run me over now Which one of you 
Will join me tonight 
Which one of you will I see 
Which one of you 
Are you trying to hide from me I never understood this posturing 
The heart's a thing 
That makes or breaks your reputation 
If you were choking on excessive praise 
I couldn't raise 
An army strong enough to save you I always feel I'm talking to 
The person who last talked to you 
Your rabbit's foot and four leaf clover 
Only serve to run me over now Which one of you 
Will join me tonight 
Which one of you will it be 
Which one of you 
Are you trying to hide from me Are you the soldier 
With the world on his shoulders 
Or are you the hero 
Who never gets older 
The list goes on and on Marlon Brando eats alone tonight 
I may be right 
But then, I don't know much about him 
The saddest thing's to see you fade away 
The slow decay 
It eats at me at every level I always feel I'm talking to 
The person who last talked to you 
Your rabbit's foot and four leaf clover 
Only serve to run me over now Which one of you 
Will join me tonight 
Which one of you will it be 
Which one of you 
Are you trying to hide from me 
Which one of you 
Will join me tonight 
Which one of you will I see 
Which one of you 
Are you trying to hide from me
