Nice to meet you what's your name where ya from? 
Southern Ohio but your were born in Kentucky huh 
What you doin in Tennessee? Ahh yeah that's cool same with me. 
Nashville can pull you in like that, 
It'll make you feel lucky I've heard people say that 
When ya get that feelin the feeling's never wrong 
By the look in your eyes I'd say that something's going on 
Well tell me something I don't know And kiss me hello 
We been dancing dancing round it all night 
Got a feeling feeling that we just might 
Make a little magic in the moonlight 
So come on with it......lets get on with it 
We could waste a lot of sweet time 
Waiting too long for the right time 
I ain't looking for a goodnight kiss oh no 
I just want you to kiss me hello You like this song? I like it too 
I ain't much of a dancer but I sure would dance with you 
The band's gonna play a couple more tunes we could 
Hit the floor you could show me some moves 
And there's a lot more that I'd like to know so baby lets go And kiss me hello 
We been dancing round it all night 
Got a feeling feeling that we just might 
Make a little magic in the moonlight 
So come on with it......lets get on with it 
We could waste a lot of sweet time 
Waiting too long for the right time 
I ain't looking for a goodnight kiss oh no 
I just want you to kiss me hello I've been dying to know what's behind that smile cause I can't get enough 
Of that feelin that feeling that's telling me we gotta get to the good stuff We been dancing dancing round it all night 
Got a feeling feeling that we just might 
Make a little magic in the moonlight 
So come on with it...... 
And kiss me hello 
We could waste a lot of sweet time 
Waiting too long for the right time 
I ain't looking for a goodnight kiss oh no 
I just want you to kiss me hello
