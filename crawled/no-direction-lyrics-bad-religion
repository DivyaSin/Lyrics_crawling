A sullen figure walks along a dusty road 
His life was holy and he couldn't bear the load 
He left his people and a simple life behind 
He raised his torso and he looked into the sky Shouting his questions 
Looking for directions 
"what do I do now?" Now a confused school girl stares at the TV tray 
The stresses of maturing compound every day 
She glances up to see her favorite video 
And gets ideas from Madonna's nasty clothes In need of affection 
She craves affection 
Her heroes offer her Everyone is looking for something 
And they assume somebody else knows what it is 
No one can live with the decisions of their own it seems 
So they look to someone else To tell 'em what to be 
Tell 'em what to wear 
Tell 'em what to say 
Tell 'em how to act and think and compel others compulsively 
Until the world is all like them A righteous student came and asked me to reflect 
He judged my lifestyle was politically incorrect 
I don't believe in self important folks who preach 
No Bad Religion song can make your life complete 
You'll get no direction from me 
You'll get no direction from me
