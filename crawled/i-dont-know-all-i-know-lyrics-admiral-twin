I don't know what I'm supposed to feel 
all I know is that these feelings keep on haunting me. 
I don't feel what I'm supposed to know 
but my thoughts are plagued by old memories. 
All I know is that forever is a sacrifice endeavor 
into people, into places 
sharing complicated spaces. 
When the smiling, happy faces go away 
there will still be a happiness we feel 
Together. 
When I'm with you, I like the things I see. 
All the innocence, the beauty there is holding me 
to a hope that I could be with you 
that our joys would be aplenty and our sorrows few 
I have learned a few things from my past 
and I know someday I'll find a love that's going to last. 
Hold me now and tell me you're the one 
that I'll love now and forever 
until time is done
