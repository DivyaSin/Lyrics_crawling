Blue eyed Susans, standing in a domino line 
Falling in and out of love all the time 
They'll break your heart just to see a boy cry 
ah but not me 
I am a brown eyed loner, I march to my own drummer 
I'm a piccolo owner and the labor of my mother's love 
Honey you'd be a load off her mind But with or without you 
My only plan is to be free 
With or without you 
I'm still me 
Ah I'll join a band and sing like a canary 
Get out of here and change my name to Cherry 
And every night I'll thank holy Mother Mary 
I am a keeper 
Oh, I am a keeper baby 
I am a keeper Long stem roses, standing in a vase by my bed 
Standing tall like the dreams in my head 
I'm not gonna live in this house 'til I'm dead 
I like you a lot 'cause you're different a little 
You got answers to my riddles 
Your daddy is a pistol and you are a son of a gun 
I could be the daughter that he never wanted But with or without you I'll buy a farm at the edge of the prairie 
Live off the land and change my name to Cherry 
And every night I'll thank holy Mother Mary 
I am a keeper ah, I am a keeper baby 
I am a keeper With or without you, my only plan is to be free 
With or without you 
Bye babe I'll buy a sword and join the military 
Cut my hair and change my name to Cherry 
And every night I'll thank holy Mother Mary 
I am a keeper ah, I am a keeper baby 
I am a keeper, oh, I am a keeper baby I'm not one of those blue eyed Susans 
Ha ah, I'm doing my own thing I am a keeper 
I am a keeper baby 
I am a keeper 
I am a keeper baby 
I am a keeper 
I am a keeper baby
