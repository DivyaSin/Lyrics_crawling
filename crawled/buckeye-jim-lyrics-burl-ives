Way up yonder above the sky 
A bluebird lived in a jaybird's eye Buckeye Jim, you can't go 
Go weave and spin, you can't go 
Buckeye Jim Way up yonder above the moon 
A blue jay nest in a silver spoon Buckeye Jim, you can't go 
Go weave and spin, you can't go 
Buckeye Jim Way down yonder in a wooden trough 
An old woman died of the whoopin' cough Buckeye Jim, you can't go 
Go weave and spin, you can't go 
Buckeye Jim Way down yonder in a hollow log 
A red bird danced with the green bullfrog Buckeye Jim, you can't go 
Go weave and spin, you can't go 
Buckeye Jim
