Eyes hidden beneath black and blue 
Fangs behind your lips 
Skin so pale and untrue 
I see my BREATH WHEN WE KISS 
Why do your fingers go through mine when I just want to hold your hand? 
Why don't you speak to me when I just live to hear your voice? We're fucking dead 
With words unsaid 
Our lips are closed, we spill no secrets 
We'll fucking dance 
Like we've got no second chance 
In this dead romance The moon shining up above 
Red and glaring at your grave 
Bring back our lost love 
Dear, YOU WILL BE SAVED 
Put your hands together and say a prayer 
Because tonight redemption doesn't matter 
'Cause nothing lasts forever We're fucking dead 
With words unsaid 
Our lips are closed, we spill no secrets 
We'll fucking dance 
Like we've got no second chance 
In this dead romance We all know what you're looking for 
The false hope will make you sore 
More bruised 
Than your father left you WHY (WHY) ARE (ARE) YOU (YOU) GONE? (GONE?) 
WHY (WHY) ARE (ARE) YOU (YOU) GONE? (WHY ARE YOU GONE?) We're fucking dead 
With words unsaid 
Our lips are closed, we spill no secrets 
We'll fucking dance 
Like we've got no second chance 
In this dead romance 
We're fucking dead 
With words unsaid 
Our lips are closed, we spill no secrets 
We'll fucking dance 
Like we've got no second chance 
In this dead romance 
Hahaha
