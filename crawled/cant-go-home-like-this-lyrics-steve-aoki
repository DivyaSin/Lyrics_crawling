[Verse 1: Adam Lambert] 
Can't go home tonight 'til I work it out with you 
Standing on the edge of something we can't afford to lose [Pre-Chorus: Adam Lambert] 
Say you wanna leave, wanna leave 
Got my heart on a string behind you 
We are locked without a key, out a key 
And I'm just trying to get through [Chorus: Adam Lambert] 
When the bed's half-made and the light's blown out 
We can build our fate over hollow ground 
Open up the cage, let the birds fly out 
Cause we can't go home... 
Like this 
Like, like, like, like 
Cause we can't go home like this [Verse 2: Adam Lambert] 
I wanna fall down the kaleidoscope with you 
We gotta fix up the hearts we broke, before we do [Pre-Chorus: Adam Lambert] 
Say you wanna leave, wanna leave 
But I'm just trying to get through [Chorus: Adam Lambert] 
When the bed's half-made and the light's blown out 
We can build our fate over hollow ground 
Open up the cage, let the birds fly out 
Cause we can't go home like this 
No we can't go home like this 
No we can't go home like this 
Not like this 
Can't go home like this 
Yeah 
Like, like, like, like [Outro: Adam Lambert] 
Like this 
Can't go home like this 
Can't go home like, like this 
No we can't go home like this
