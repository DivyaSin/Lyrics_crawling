You know I'm like a hop, skip and jump from slappin' you senseless 
Perverted monk on this mic, you feel the sentence 
Hot vernacular scorch just like incense 
I'm intense, shit vibin' like a sixth sense Lyrics mutilated like X-men 
Shower ya, devour ya, technique algebra 
Smoothness, movements, halloed in the matrix 
Fist held high, I raise it up to the ancients Insightfully clear to you, how a master do 
Roll with the high and mighty flow tai chi 
Quench ya thirst, but first my journal high seas 
Lyrical, mathematical, razzle and dazzle you East New York, street talk, step with a better game 
Hydrate rhymes like I was Gatorade 
Rockin' a name, tappin' your brain 
With the sugar Shane Mosley doin' it like it's supposed to be They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats 
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks 
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly 
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats 
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks 
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly 
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody Avoid the devil's army, they want to harm me 
Salute to the Gulliani, crack babies, and zombies 
Parkin' lots and drug spots, in the pots are coke rocks 
A million in the building, buildings protected by more blocks Young childs, ghost smiles, money clips colored vials 
Stash fifty, in the world of bird city the warranters 
Send the foreigners the coroners 
A mess no vest multiplied wounds on chest Invest in free markets, cream cheese and pockets 
Three keys to a promise, stash keys in compartments 
Desert eagle my targets, hit ya lease I spark ti 
We get the drop on ya spot, make it hot and unlock it Firearms make fireworks, I wonder where lies lurk 
We bloodied up your shirt, all you saw was the fire spark 
I'm one of too many, who get amped off Henny 
Puttin' cowards in cemeteries, kill willies for pennies They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats 
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks 
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly 
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats 
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks 
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly 
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody Sex, butchery meat rack material, superior 
Crank that shit amplify the whole scenario 
Off the level live or in stereo 
Young hustle to stay ahead of step From where your best bet is to rep yours, repetitiously 
'cause this veteran will thrash to wreck yours, repetitiously 
If ever you get at me on some bullshit, flash quick 
Exactly who the fuck I got pull with Autographed it for big number one with a bullet 
Expressin' black glove love hood it down, how I put it down 
This style ain't never been shit to me, why would it now? 
I come forth with gun smoke, no petty read ya bound by honor That I mark you in the hunt for a dollar 
Alive on the strength of power you 
Divine karma, Allah's armor see you keep fraudulatin' 
I'll sick my wolves in your basement, with loaded shell casings They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats 
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks 
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly 
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats 
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks 
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly 
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody
