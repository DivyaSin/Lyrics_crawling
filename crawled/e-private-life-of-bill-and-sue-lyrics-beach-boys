The private life of Bill and Sue 
Can you dig what Im telling you 
No one knows just why we care 
We see their faces everywhere 
The strangest story you ever knew 
The private life of Bill and Sue 
(Refrain:) 
California to Mexico 
Everybodys just gotta know 
Dallas Texas to Monterey 
Wastin time on a sunny day 
San Onofre to Jersey shore 
At the line in the grocery store 
Everybody who ever knew 
The private life of Bill and Sue 
(Instrumental) 
The private life of Bill and Sue 
The world is wonderin' what they do 
We watch them on our TV screen 
Their lives are like a movie scene 
The strangest story you ever knew 
The private life of Bill and Sue 
(Refrain:) 
California to Mexico 
Everybodys just gotta know 
Dallas Texas to Monterey 
Wastin time on a sunny day 
San Onofre to Jersey shore 
At the line in the grocery store 
Everybody who ever knew 
The private life of Bill and Sue 
(Bridge:) 
Sometimes life can be so strange 
Maybe were just lookin for a change 
(Refrain:) 
California to Mexico 
Everybodys just gotta know 
Dallas Texas to Monterey 
Wastin time on a sunny day 
San Onofre to Jersey shore 
At the line in the grocery store 
Everybody who ever knew 
The private life of Bill and Sue 
Um - boddy yaddy - - Um boddy yaddy yea - -

California to Mexico 
Everybodys just gotta know 
Dallas Texas to Monterey 
Wastin time on a sunny day

Bill and Sue 
Stars of the once popular reality show 
The Private Life of Bill and Sue 
Were reported lost at sea today 
Along with their camera crew 
While filming an episode on location near Catalina Island 
Skeptics speculate that the once popular duo 
Whose ratings have been tumbling since leaving the network 
Actually faked their demise...
