I walked with you 
Just like we've done for so long 
You seemed so near 
But even that's become so common It's not just you, just been together so long 
That I thought I knew everything about you 
But today I saw; did you open up my eyes? 
'Cause I feel like I've just seen you for the first time [Chorus] 
I didn't see you 
But God I want to 
You've come alive 
And I think I've fallen harder than the first time Was I so blind; how did I not see you? 
Yet in all that time you never left my side 
So for all my life, I will live to know you 
So here I am; I'll take your hand [Chorus] I see your face; I feel you close 
The love you've always shown me 
Won't miss it now, can't waste a day 
Jesus I'm yours completely [Chorus]
