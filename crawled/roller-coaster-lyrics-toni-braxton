Today I got so mad at you, yeah 
It's like I couldn't control myself 
Girl, I was done, I was so through with you 
But I know I couldn't love nobody else Well I feel like you do 
I'm so 'bout done with you, 
I'm sick and tired of going through changes 
But I love, but I hate you 
Don't want, but I want to 
Back and forth, and back 
What should we do? When love is like a roller coaster 
Always up and down, eh 
When love takes over your emotions 
Spins you round and round? When you don't, when you don't know what you're feeling 
When you don't, when you don't know what is real 
When love is like a roller coaster 
Always up and down, 
And it goes back around Today I've said some things to you, babe 
I don't like the way it felt, no 
I've been giving you, giving you so much attitude, yeh 
Ah, I guess I really should really check myself Well, you've started it first, 
You said we'd make it work 
But here we are going through changes 
But I need you, can't stand you 
I want you, but damn you 
Back and forth, and back 
What should we do? When love is like a roller coaster 
Always up and down, eh 
When love takes over your emotions 
Spins you round and round (Ey) 
(And it goes back around!) When you don't, when you don't know what you're feeling 
When you don't, when you don't know what is real 
When love is like a roller coaster 
Always up and down, 
'Cause it goes back around! We don't ever have to worry babe 
'Cause we gon' be alright (yes baby baby baby) 
We ain't going nowhere darling (no say no) 
Just hold on, for the ride! When love is like a roller coaster 
Always up and down, eh 
When love takes over your emotions 
Spins you round and round? (Like a merry go round) 
When you don't know 
when you don't know, when you don't know what you're feeling 
When you don't, when you don't know what is real 
When love is like a roller coaster 
Always up and down 
'Cause it goes back around! Rollercoaster, always up and down 
Up and down, round and round 
spends you like a merry go round baby 
Your emotions spins you
