Close my eyes and dream the time away 
Like the shadows in the night 
Count the hours until the break of day 
There's something missing from my life 
Can you see me as you listen to the radio 
Hope the message carries through 
I can see you waiting, waiting on the other side 
This song I sing is just for you And I think it's gonna be all right 
Sailing into the night 
I'm gonna be flying high, higher than before 
And it seems like an endless flight 
Oh, flying on the wings of love Oh, can you hear me talking down the line 
Way out in the lonely night 
And we both know 
It's just a matter of time 
Till we see the morning light And I think it's gonna be all right 
Sailing into the night 
I'm gonna be flying high, higher than before 
And it seems like an endless flight 
Oh, flying on the wings of love
