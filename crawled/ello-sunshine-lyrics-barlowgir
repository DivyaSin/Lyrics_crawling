Hello sunshine it's been too long 
Since I felt your beautiful warmth upon my face 
And how much have I missed 
'Cause I've been focused on everything wrong 
This road just felt so long 
I forgot to lift my head to see you Oh my lovely shining for me 
Let my eyes see all the beauty 
Oh-oh Hello sunshine since the moment 
That I felt your beautiful warmth 
I knew that I'd do anything 
To keep this feeling of you 
My heart comes alive 
Oh who could add a day to their life 
By dreading every dark sky Oh my lovely shining for me 
Let my eyes see all the beauty 
Oh-oh Fill my dark skies 
Make me see the light 
Life is fine so bring in the sunshine 
Oh-oh Whoa-oh let in the sunshine 
Whoa-oh let in the sunshine 
Whoa-oh let in the sunshine 
Let in the sunshine
