Someone in this room is the right one for me 
But how can it be that I cannot see 
I'm biding my time 
While drinking my wine 
Oh wha' oh I'm gonna be free this weekend, so free. 
I'm showing off my liberty 
Get ready to play 
You making my day 
I'm finding a way But when the night time is all over I'm all alone 
I'm advancing and I'm dancing with myself [Chorus] 
A vision in blue 
Forever young 
A token so true 
My Koh Phangan 
My Koh Phangan 
My Koh Phangan 
My Koh Phangan 
I see you dancing in front of my face 
Your body is moving to the trace of the chase 
I'm flashing for you 
A bright light in the night (for you) I'm gonna be me, myself and I 
Losing the rhythm that's my goodbye 
I'm feeling the heat 
Complete with the beat 
I'm playing discreet But when the night time is all over I'm all alone 
I'm advancing and I'm dancing with myself [Chorus] A vision in blue [Chorus] A vision in blue 
A vision in blue
