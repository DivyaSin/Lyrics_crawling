This human incompetence and it's consequence, 
Sub-human intolerance hitting home. This stupid, old 
Prejudice and it's consequence; civilian rights are 
Not right for ALL deserve rights, large and 
Small. Rise and Fall... each breath could be 
The last-chances have all come and passed. Why can't we just shake the urge to end 
Everything? Property lines slise through the 
Earth. The sadden urge to control our surroundings; 
Money and time now define the WORTHless we rise and we fall. Rise and Fall... each breath could be 
The last-chances have all come and passed. Fighting for land to own... and man will 
Always find reasons for war. Fighting wars yields 
Bitter rewards so let's contemplate what to fight 
For. From the oceans we rise... to the ashes 
We fall. All for one... not one for all. Where do we go when we no longer 
Exist? Apologies are useless, they're nothing, 
They're important. To savour the taste of youth 
And sweet control... Hierarchal classes 
Split the masses - pray your ranking's high. Off - white, low - life, nuisance in a flawless 
Life, ground underfoot like ashes. The world's 
A fucking gas chamber. Populations rise and fall
