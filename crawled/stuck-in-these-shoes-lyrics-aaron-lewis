I'm stuck in these shoes 
And I ain't a hero, or role model material 
Well I'm just a man, that's tryin' to get by 
And I'm stuck in these shoes And they're made for walkin' 
Let my songs do the talkin' 
I'm just not really sure 
How much further they'll go 'Cause sometimes I still feel like I'm losin' 
And sometimes I still feel all alone 
And sometimes I still feel I won't make it through this 
On my own 
'Cause I'm stuck in these shoes 
I got nothin' to lose 
And I've played the fool, I broke all of the rules, and I have to choose 
'Cause I'm stuck in these shoes And I ain't a savior 
And I ain't here to save ya 
'Cause I'm not very good 
At savin' myself
