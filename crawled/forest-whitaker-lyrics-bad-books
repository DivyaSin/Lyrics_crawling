We started a fire; 
That was never supposed to burn out. 
You started a band; 
That was cool for a while but it turned pretty bland. I started a fight; 
With the neighbor next door 
And his pesky wife. 
You started a job; 
That you hate when you're sober 
And hate even more when you're not I know you hate me too, 
Always say you do And you moved to Japan; 
Thought a clean bill of health and a camera 
Could show you the plan. 
I bought a bird that repeats what i say, 
But "I'm lonely" is all that he's heard. You found a guy, 
That is clearly the opposite me 
With a black motorbike 
I digged around, 
But it's just like a movie that's picture 
Is off with the sound I know you hate me too 
You always say you do And you started to write 
It was subtle at first 
But the danger was clearly in sight I don't reply 
Due to a lack of an ego 
And laziness cuts like a knife You say that you're good 
Had a baby with biker 
And named him Forest Whitaker 
I'm laying low 
On the probable chance 
You convince me to give him a home I know you hate me too 
You always say you do 
And I know you that hate me too 
Always say you do.
