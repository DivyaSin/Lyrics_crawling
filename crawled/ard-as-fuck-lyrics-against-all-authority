One day I decided to pray I kneeled down & looked to the sky He turned his back & I started to cry I asked God why is life so hard So I turn my back on you You turn your back on me Fuck your system and fuck you too You're just trying to keep me down You tell me to follow your rules Well how the fuck do you expect me to obey them When you can't even follow them yourself
