[Chorus:] 
Cuban girls Cuban girls 
Puerto Rican girls Puerto Rican girls 
Mexican girls Mexican girls 
Spanish girls Spanish girls 
I like 'em girls, girls 
Latin girls, Latin girls 
Latin girls, what's happenin' girls 
What's happenin' girls, what's happenin'? I like Latin, them Latin women 
An' they love me 'cause 
I'm that man with 
Coconuts and chocolate skin 
I'm that mocha masculine 
Feminines that are Latin 
Call your friends and call your cousins 
Cause I know you got dozens of them 
Marias, Elizabeth, Sonias, and Blancas 
When I see you, you can get boned if you want to 
Yo quiero and I'm sincero 
If you never had an eechee 
Let me be your primo 
We could hit the channel, we can dance the bolero 
Have a shopping spree and you can spend my dinero but 
I wish you was more like J. Lo 'cause 
Love don't cost a thing 
So won't you let this king 
Love the queen of Argentina 
Girl you know you know what I mean 
Cause I like them [Chorus] Que on da quieres con mi 
Mira mucha cha esto para ti 
Latina chichana por mi 
Mas finas me gustan asi 
Mira a, mira a mami 
Esperate, esperate, esperate aqui 
We could connect and act humanly 
Indulge in animalistic swing 
We could have conversation or 
Sexual relation or 
We can explore find out more about 
Things we've done before 
Whether it be kinky thoughts 
I'm gon' make your chonies drop 
Watch mister shorty rock I'll rock your sticky spot 
Hombre lumbre known to make it hot 
I'll make you drip drop 
They call me Cum-a-lot 
I like 'em [Chorus] [Bridge] 
Melody 
Para mi so sera 
Para ti sera para ti 
Empty eyes 
Fue goden trode mi 
Say Latin girls Latin girls Pasa senorita 
You're a brown skin mama 
A yo mama sana wanna take you to Havana 
We could get down every day of the semana 
Dance to the music and follow the guitara 
Come on... 
Dame un mento y lo bevo con un beso 
Take you to Phillip-pines 
Then you don't have to spend a peso 
We got connections like a novel to a reader 
I can relate 'cause Latin girls look Filipina 
Check your history there's no mystery between us 
Destiny made it possible to be us 
I know about your culture 'cause it's mixed with mine 
We go together well just like beats and rhymes 
Tequilas and limes 
So let's combine 
And I'll say it one more time 
I like them... [Chorus]
