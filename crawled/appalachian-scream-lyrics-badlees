We live for the mountains 
'Cause the mountains give us life 
But the pits were too inviting 
And they stripped away our lives If I could holler from this hollow 
For just a little help 
I'm sure the neighbors would come running 
Just to see for them selves And I don't give a damn 
If you don't understand 'Cause I hear the voices calling 
They're sending me a warning about you 
Is it a haunting song from a familiar dream 
Or just an Appalachian scream? We're neighbors, we're not friends 
I don't trust them a bit 
Call it baseless paranoia 
Or the way that we live We're all escaping something 
But we're blind to what it is 
If I'd turn my back he'd kill me 
And I'd do the same to him And I don't give a damn 
If you don't understand 'Cause I hear the voices calling 
They're sending me a warning about you 
Is it a haunting song from a familiar dream 
Or just an Appalachian scream? I built this shit from nothing 
I brought it up with love 
Considering what I got now 
It's still not very much After 20 years, time's forgotten me 
And I wish it all the same 
But they're knocking at my neighbors' door 
And soon they'll call my name 'Cause I hear the voices calling 
They're sending me a warning about you 
Is it a haunting song from a familiar dream 
Or just an Appalachian scream?
