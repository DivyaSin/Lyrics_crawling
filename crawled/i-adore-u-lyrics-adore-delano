[Verse 1] 
This is how it ends, never meant to hurt you 
I'm a pretty mess and I don't deserve you 
I ran out of time and second chances 
Sorry couldn't build your white picket fences [Pre-Hook 1] 
And I-I-I only got myself to blame [Hook] 
Cause every time I see you, it's like all I am is see-through 
We were everything I know it, don't wanna miss it, record it 
I adore you (I adore) 
I adore you (I adore) 
I adore you (I adore) 
I adore you (I adore) 
The falling out was easy, but I hate that you don't need me 
And it gets so hard to speak, every time you get to me 
Cause I adore you (I adore) 
I adore you (I adore) 
I adore you (I adore) 
I adore you (I adore) [Verse 2] 
Everybody says that you're doin' fine now 
Cruisin' for a thrill like I wouldn't find out 
When you turn it back, do you ever wonder? 
If we could have tomorrow, in technicolor? [Pre-Hook 2] 
And I-I-I got so much left to say [Hook] [Bridge] 
And no-o-o-o-o-o, can't you see it 
I adore you 
No, no-o-o-o-o-o, you're mi-i-ine 
(I adore you) [Hook]
