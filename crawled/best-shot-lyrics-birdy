When you're on your own and you feel lost 
When your heart's a mess though you've given your best I'll be here giving it my best shot baby your loves got more then I need 
Here crying from the rooftops 
Nothing can stop us if we believe 
Here giving it my best shot baby I find that we can be free 
When you're here with me When your sky is dark and the earth is shaking your bed 
Your hope is at its end you just need one friend I'll be here giving it my best shot baby your loves got all that I need 
Here crying from the rooftops 
Nothing can stop us if we believe 
Here giving it my best shot baby I find that we can be free 
When you're here with me When you cant find you're way and all around you walks as deep and grey 
The stars fall from above and you're barely holding on my love (on my love) Giving it my best shot baby your loves got all that I need 
Here crying from the rooftops 
Nothing can stop us if we believe 
Here giving it my best shot baby I find that we can be free 
When you're here with me
