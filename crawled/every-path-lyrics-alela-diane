All the back roads, all the highways 
Distance countries that I've passed through 
Every path has lead me back to you 
Every path has lead me back to you Down by the river by the light of the moon 
I feel the echo of your current in my core as I roam 
As I roam, as I roam, as I roam, as I roam Every path has lead me back to you 
Every path has lead me back to you When I'm around I want you near 
Handsome fellow, will you hold me dear? 
I've seen blue eyes and straight white teeth 
Golden minds and sturdy feet But every path has lead me back to you 
Every path has lead me back to you Down by the river by the light of the moon 
I feel the echo of your current in my core as I roam 
As I roam, as I roam, as I roam, as I roam Every path has lead me back to you 
Every path has lead me back to you Put your hand upon my breast 
My little darlin' I know of restlessness 
My little darlin' I know of restlessness
