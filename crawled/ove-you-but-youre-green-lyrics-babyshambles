I was a troubled teen 
Who put an advert in a magazine 
To the annoyance of my imaginary lover 
She doubted my philosophy and this is what she said to me She said, Oh, you, you're green 
You don't know what love means, let me tell you 
Tickles you pink, oh yeah, but it likes to hear you scream 
Fire and damnation, lamentations for the likes of you When she goes, just let her go 
If she says she's going, make sure she goes 
Make sure she goes I was a troubled teen 
Untroubled only in my daydreams 
To the annoyance of somebody or other 
Questioned my integrity and this is what they said to me They said, Oh, you will be where you belong 
But it's only blood from broken hearts writes the words to every song 
There's a beautific smile for the fawners and the servants 
Oh but I, only I, only I I can see the serpent, oh, you, you're green 
You don't know what love means, let me tell you 
Tickles you pink, oh yeah, it likes to hear you scream 
Fire and damnation, lamentations for the likes of you When she goes, just let her go 
If she says she's going, make sure she goes 
Make sure she goes For the likes of you When she goes, just let her go 
If she says she's going, make sure she goes 
Make sure she goes When she goes, just let her go 
If she says she's going, you make sure she goes 
Make sure she goes
