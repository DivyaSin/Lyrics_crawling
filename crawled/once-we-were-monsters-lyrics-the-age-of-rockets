Pilots are flying low 
Searching for life below 
Between the bits of broken earth 
Where the sunlight still hits 
Bodies wash against the shore 
The robots revolt 
Compass needles spin in place We can be happy 
Until the night skies die 
Welcome the moment 
That we feel lost and found (?) Travel the skies 
Never be homesick 
Quietly recall 
Once we were monsters 
Travel the skies 
Never be homesick 
Quietly recall We can be happy 
Until the night skies die 
Welcome the moment 
That we feel lost and found (?)
