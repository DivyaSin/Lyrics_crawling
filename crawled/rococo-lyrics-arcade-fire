Let's go downtown and watch the modern kids 
Let's go downtown and talk to the modern kids 
They will eat right out of your hand 
Using great big words that they don't understand They sing 
Rococo 
Rococo They build it up just to burn it back down 
They build it up just to burn it back down 
The wind is blowing all the ashes around 
Oh my dear God what is that horrible song? They'll sing 
Rococo 
Rococo 
Rococo 
Rococo They seem wild but they are so tame 
They seem wild but they are so tame 
They're moving towards you with their colors all the same 
They want to own you but they don't know what game 
They're playing Rococo 
Rococo 
Rococo 
Rococo 
Rococo 
Rococo 
Rococo
