The time is going to come 
When they will have to admit 
What they had was more than enough 
Enough from you and from me The rain is made of steel 
The bread is made of stone 
When all our words are sealed 
Our dreams will break down the walls Is there a light somewhere around? 
How many lives to save the crown? It looks like we're all living 
with lies around the soul 
I've seen the best wills forgotten 
More than you would know You know that they've been running 
On both sides of the road 
I've seen the wills forgotten 
Enough to stop the show They've done nothing they say 
But they have just done it all 
Behind the green master lord 
They want us to dance to their song It's time for going home 
Tomorrow they'll be here again 
Making the same old news 
That move the same old wheels Is there a light somewhere around? 
How many lives to save the clown? And all the times they're talking 
Is just a waste of words 
I've seen the best wills forgotten 
More than you would know
