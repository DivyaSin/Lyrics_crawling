Hammond-Hazelwood Your father spent his life on a military base 
He made the army his career 
He pinned your pictures up in the officer's mess 
And hoped you'd marry a bombardier But you had a crush on the son of a working man 
I know that made the major sore 
But still he smiled with the utmost self-control 
The day the British army lost the war And they argued over tea 
And they argued over me 
And they sent you to your room and locked the door 
Yes, and they argued over tea 
Haha!, argued over me 
The day the British army lost the war But I know you loved you old man very much 
But then I know you loved me more 
And I loved you more than I even loved myself 
The day the British army lost the war And they argued over tea 
And they argued over me 
And they sent you to your room and locked the door 
Yes, and they argued over tea 
And they argued over me 
The day the British army lost the war The day the British army lost the war
