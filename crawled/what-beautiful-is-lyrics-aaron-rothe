And your eyes 
You should see the way they glow when you smile 
The way your laughter sets the world on fire 
I take for granted all the moments that I'm with you 
I'm with you 'cause your beauty takes my breath away And I love it when I'm asked to stay 
And I'd bring you flowers every day to show you 
It's not your makeup or your hair at all 
It's the girl underneath it all that amazes me 
And you are what beautiful is, what beautiful is And I recall all the times we spent together in the park 
Throwing sticks under the bridges, not too far 
I'd close my eyes and underneath my breath 
I'd say, I'd say that your beauty takes my breath away And I love it when I'm asked to stay 
And I'd bring you flowers every day to show you 
It's not your makeup or your hair at all 
It's the girl underneath it all that amazes me 
And you are what beautiful is, what beautiful is Today was long 
All i thought about was singing you this song 
And how you'd take it if you took it in at all 
And i really just want you to understand 
To understand that your beauty takes my breath away And I love it when I'm asked to stay 
And I'd bring you flowers every day to show you 
It's not your makeup or your hair at all 
It's the girl underneath it all that amazes me 
And you are what beautiful is, what beautiful is 
What beautiful is Yeah, and your beauty takes my breath away And I love it when I'm asked to stay 
And I'd bring you flowers every day to show you 
It's not your makeup or your hair at all 
It's the girl underneath it all that amazes me 
And you are what beautiful is, what beautiful is 
What beautiful is, what beautiful is And you are what beautiful is
