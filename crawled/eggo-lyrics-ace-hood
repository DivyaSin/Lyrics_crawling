Okay my city on the map 
Yea Nigga know Im runnin now 
Ball all day and all night then I run it back 
Need a new Huma, all bitches try to fuckin at 
Told my niggas we gon get this money, I aint lookin back 
Catch me switchin meals in the lobby, now the party at 
Bitches lookin at me cuz they know that where the money at 
Fast lane, fast lane, I be getting mad brain

Swaggin in this bitch, them Loubrettons I got em hard a pair

Sparkle up, sparkle up, they bringin them bottles out

[Chorus] 
Bad bitches already know

I came here to speak, just to turn it up 
Turned up, nigga rolled up

Shouts to the niggas getting money 
Two times, we them niggas who run it

Pull up to the valley, hella swaggin, bitches know whos that 
Hop about to whip my Spanish bitch, she gotta bubble bath 
Outfit cost a couple grand, pockets holdin 40 racks 
Leggo leggo, all my niggas kicked up, flay bo 
Chillin in the VI, they know 
Watch a nigga repo yo ho 
Ok, nigga standin on top of the sofa 
Slidin this bitch with my toaster 
25 bottles of that potion 
So I got them bad hoes open

(Turn up) turn up (turn up) nigga word up 
Still shinin a nigga like Vegas 
Rolex cost me 80

Ride me, who nigga? You crazy 
Cuz Im in this bitch with the goonies 
With the toolies, make movies 
I say some of you niggas try to act up 
We just try to party though 
I be in my section like which one these bitches tryna go 
Penthouse on 8th floor, 30 packs of Trojan go 
Say she downs for the team, so Im likely go leggo 
[Chorus] 
Bad bitches already know 
Real nigga done walk through the door 
Shouts to the niggas getting money 
Two times, we them niggas who run it 
I came here to speak, just to turn it up 
Turned up, nigga rolled up 
Leggo leggo leggo leggo 
Leggo leggo leggo leggo 
Bad bitches already know 
Real nigga done walk through the door 
Shouts to the niggas getting money 
Two times, we them niggas who run it
