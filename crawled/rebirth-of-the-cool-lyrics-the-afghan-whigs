If I stepped it off 
Walked outside your trance 
Crawled inside your mind 
And got my hands into your pants Wouldn't that beat all 
Wouldn't that be great 
And all the things you do to me 
We could exaggerate Now everybody knows 
Or everybody wants to know 
The hows, the whens, the whys 
Of how I said goodbye Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby ooh baby 
Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby ooh baby 
Don't forget the alcohol If I stepped it off 
Walked outside your trance 
Crawled inside your mind 
And got my hand into your pants Don't forget the alcohol 
Ooh baby ooh baby 
Don't forget the alcohol
