If I should write a book for you 
That brought me fame and fortune too 
That book would be like my heart and me 
Dedicated to you And if I should paint a picture too 
That showed the loveliness of you 
My art would be like my heart and me 
Dedicated to you To you because your love is the beacon 
That lights up my way 
To you because with you I know 
A lifetime could be just one heavenly day If I should find a twinkling star 
One half so wondrous as you are 
That star would be like my heart and me 
Dedicated to you To you because your love is a beacon 
That lights up my way 
To you because with you I know 
A lifetime could be just one heavenly day If I should find a twinkling star 
One half so wondrous as you are 
That star would be like my heart and me 
Dedicated to you
