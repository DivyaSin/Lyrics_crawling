I get tired of life, 
What a world I'm living in, 
Now I've got it all, 
I've had enough, I'm giving in The sun is shining 
Melting the clouds away 
Got me some Blue Sky Action! 
I'm breathing today 
I know I'm burning 
This is my final day 
I'm gonna to go out smiling 
A king for a day! A king for a day 
A king for a day Stuck in this toxic town 
It really takes my breath away 
It's either leave or drown 
I'm on a Blue Sky getaway! The sun is shining 
Melting the clouds away 
Got me some Blue Sky Action! 
I'm breathing today 
I know I'm burning 
This is my final day 
I'm gonna to go out smiling 
A king for a day! A king for a day! 
A king for a day! The sun is shining 
Melting the clouds away 
Got me some Blue Sky Action! 
I'm breathing today 
I know I'm burning 
This is my final day 
I'm gonna go out smiling 
A king for a day! A king for a day! 
A king for a day!
