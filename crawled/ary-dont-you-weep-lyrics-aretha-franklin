Oh Oh Mary 
Oh Oh Mary [Chorus] 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn. 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn. 
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep. Well, Satan got mad and he knows I'm glad. 
Missed that soul that he thought he had. 
Now, didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep. [Chorus] Well, one of these nights around twelve o'clock, 
this old town's gonna really rock. 
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep. [Chorus] Cheer up, sisters and don't you cry. 
There'll be good times bye and bye. 
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep. [Chorus: x2]
