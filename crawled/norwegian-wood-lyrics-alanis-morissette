Oh, I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good, Norwegian Wood She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there was not a chair Oh, so I sat on the rug, biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two 
And then she said, "It's time for bed" She told me she worked in the morning 
And started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled up to sleep in the bath, oh And when I awoke, I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I, I lit a fire 
Isn't it good, Norwegian Wood Isn't it good, Norwegian Wood 
Isn't it good, Norwegian Wood 
Isn't it good, Norwegian Wood
