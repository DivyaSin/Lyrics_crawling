Temptation 
Comrades 
People of the world 
We ain't got nothing to lose 
Got them Bourgeoisie Blues 
Mr. IV Lenin, Lenin of love 
Gonna make us feel so fine, with a hit 
Of socialism, in the mainline Bourgeois Parliamentarian 
The highest state of society 
Third world debt, first world exploitation 
What a society we're living in 
Sellin' third world drugs at first world prices 
They say Lenin was wrong, who says? 
It's enough to give me the fucking blues I know you're searching for some new sensation 
Cause I saw you withe the sugar man 
You took a taste of that sweet salvation 
Now you're eatin' out the palm of his hand 
You hear some line from a song that reminds you 
Of a time when you were seventeen 
The memory moves ya but ya feel kinda confused 
Cause now money is your melody Looks like 
Temptations got a hold on you 
She's eating away at your dreams 
You're so hungry for that smell of money 
You been, wasting away for years Yeah you've been tempted brother, 
You been tempted sister too. Here you were hustling with some heavy connections 
Hooked up on those dollars and dimes 
You were looking for thrills and dressed up to kill 
Any motherfucker messing with your goldmine 
Now you walk the line trying to buy yourself time 
You want a honey backed guarantee 
But the bees they are buzzing and the flies they are humming 
Round the holes in your hypocrisy Looks like 
Temptations got a hold on you 
She's eating away at your dreams 
You're so hungry for that smell of money 
You been, wasting away for years What do we want? 
(something about government) 
Larry Love: And what kinda power? 
Soviet power 
It's enough to give me the fucking blues! Socialism, straight in the mainline! 
See you're wasting away now 
See you're wasting away now 
See you're wasting away now 
See you're wasting away now
