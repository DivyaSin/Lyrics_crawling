Up in smoke, this is a joke, isn't it? 
All your fault, you went to far, call it quits 
No one knew or dared to prove, came and went 
Moving on, chance is gone, throw a fit So it's through, nothing's left to lose 
It's lucky too, who needs a tighter noose? You're so weak, beat up a geek, makes you complete 
Not so tough, I've had enough, now we'll leave 
Getting away, one more day, 'til then I'll sleep 
All I need's a chance to bleed, only they fear So it's through, nothing's left to lose 
It's lucky too, who needs a tighter noose? I know who you are 
I know where you're going So it's through, nothing's left to lose 
It's lucky too, who needs a tighter noose? Who needs a tighter noose? 
Who needs a tighter noose? 
Who needs a tighter noose? 
Who needs a tighter noose? 
A tighter noose
