You make me whole 
But we still have places left to go 
But my life, heart and soul 
Is yours for the sharing, let me know With all you've seen 
You still keep your heart set on your dreams 
You're so strong you should rest assured 
Anything in this world you want is yours I don't have a chance with you 
But I'm gonna let you find that all your love is better in my mind 
You don't have the heart to let me go 
I'm gonna let you fly and all the rest 
I'll find on my own This life we lead 
Takes everything you've got and lets you bleed 
But when you see that you're not alone 
It'll open wider than you know
