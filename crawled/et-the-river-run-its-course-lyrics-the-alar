The future deserted waiting there for you and me 
No past is going to stop us blowing down this road apiece 
Why wee come too far, too far to turn back now 
We can just throw it all away when something good goes wrong, oh no 
Nothing has been written which says which way we have to go 
I not looking for commitment written in stone 
No everlasting promise no no Let the river 
Let the river run 
Let the water 
Let the water fall 
Flow down off the mountain 
Into the sea 
Let the river run, run its course Wee stood this ground too long there miles to make up 
Oh it way past the time we found out if wee truly good enough 
There no truth like the truth you dare to let yourself see 
Better face it now there is nothing to fear 
Everything to gain right in here Let the river 
Let the river run 
Let the water 
Let the water fall 
Flow down off the mountain 
Into the sea 
Let the river run 
Let the river run 
Run its course Let the river 
Let the river run 
Let the water 
Let the water fall 
Flow down off the mountain 
Into the sea 
Let the river run Let the river run 
Let the water fall Let the river run 
Let the water fall
