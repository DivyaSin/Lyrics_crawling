Tied off quick, 
Looked around, 
Plunge it in, 
Pull it out. I have found a fast solution to the pain. 
Painted walls, melt away, am I a ghost? 
Decide to stay. 
I am shooting my solution in the rain. We're all dead now! 
Death will make you dream past tense, 
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense. 
(Sleep now, dream forever. Sleep now, dream tonight.) Stay up late, enjoy the view. 
Sing with me, die with you. 
Come make my dreams come true. 
This high up we start to fade and watch the night turn into day. Breaking high, 
We hold forever-changing hearts of gold. 
Injection filled with contempt, 
I was fine when we met. Your reflection hides protected eyes of regret. 
We're all dead now! 
Death will make you dream past tense, 
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense. (Sleep now, dream forever. Sleep now, dream tonight.) 
Sunrise before, as we wash ashore, 
Now take us from this life, walk alone tonight. 
We're all dead now. Death will make you dream past tense, 
Your hopes fly high and your life make sense. 
(Sleep now, dream forever. Sleep now, dream tonight.)
