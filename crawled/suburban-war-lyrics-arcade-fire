Let's go for a drive, see the town tonight 
There's nothing to do but I don't mind when I'm with you This town's so strange they built it to change 
And while we sleep we know the streets get rearranged 
My old friends, we were so different then 
Before your war against the suburbs begin Before it began Now the music divides us into tribes 
You grew your hair so I grew mine 
You said the past won't rest 
Until we jump the fence and leave it behind My old friends, I can remember when 
You cut your hair, I never saw you again 
Now the cities we live in could be distant stars 
And I searched for you in every passing car The night's so long 
Yeah the night's so long 
I've been living in the shadows of your song 
Living in the shadows of your song In the suburbs I, I learned to drive 
You told me we would never survive, 
So grab your mother's keys, we leave tonight But you started a war that we can't win 
We keep erasing all the streets we grew up in 
Now the music divides us into tribes 
Choose your side, I'll choose my side All my old friends they don't know me now 
All my old friends are staring through me now 
All my old friends they don't know me now 
All my old friends they don't know me now 
All my old friends, they
