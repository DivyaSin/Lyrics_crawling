I have my reasons to despise for everything 
I have no weapons to chose sides 
I have my treasons to lie for what it bring 
I have devotions cast and feel Oh my oasis is away from everything 
I let emotions cast away 
Oh my reasons just hanging by a string 
I've been dreaming 
But believe in everything 
I believe it starts tonight I have my reasons you're a saint 
I have a notion cast in fate 
You have a treason to explain 
I have devotions cast in fear Oh my oasis is away from everything 
I let emotions cast away 
Oh my reasons just hanging by a string 
I've been dreaming 
But believe in everything 
I believe it starts tonight My ashes been burned 
I've been waiting 
I've been waiting too long 
My ashes been fallen 
I've been waiting 
I've been waiting too long You have no reason to explain 
I have a notion cast away
