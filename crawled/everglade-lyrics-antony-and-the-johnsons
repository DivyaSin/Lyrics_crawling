When Im floating in the water 
And your eyes are lilies all around 
When Im lying sweetly in my bed 
The sun plays crystal with my eyes Then I stop 
My body stops crying for home 
My limbs stop weeping for home When Im peeping in a parlour of trees 
And the leaves are winking all around 
Im home, my heart sobs in my veins 
But brains they play the softest games Fingers kiss the string 
Mouth taste the blade 
Of everglade (x3)
