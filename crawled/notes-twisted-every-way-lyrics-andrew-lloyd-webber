ANDRE: 
Ludicrous! 
Have you seen the score? FIRMIN: 
Simply ludicrous! ANDRE: 
It's the final straw! FIRMIN: 
This is lunacy! 
Well, you know my views ANDRE: 
...Utter lunacy! FIRMIN: 
But we daren't refuse ... ANDRE: 
Not another 
chandelier FIRMIN: 
...Look, my friend, what 
we have here ... ANDRE: 
"Dear Andre, 
Re my orchestrations: 
We need another first bassoon. 
Get a player with tone - 
and that third trombone 
has to go! 
The man could not be deafer, 
so please preferably one 
who plays in tune!" FIRMIN: 
"Dear Firmin, 
vis a vis my opera: 
some chorus-members must be sacked. 
If you could, find out which 
has a sense of pitch - 
wisely, though, 
I've managed to assign a 
rather minor role to those 
who cannot act!" CARLOTTA: 
Outrage! FIRMIN: 
What is it now? CARLOTTA: 
This whole affair is 
an outrage! ANDRE: 
Now what's the matter? CARLOTTA: 
Have you seen 
the size of my part? ANDRE: 
Signora, listen ... PIANGI: 
It's an insult! FIRMIN: 
Not you as well! PIANGI: 
Just look at this - 
it's an insult! FIRMIN: 
Please, understand ... ANDRE: 
Signor! Signora! CARLOTTA: 
The things I have 
to do for my art! PIANGI: 
If you can call 
this gibberish "art" ! CARLOTTA: 
Ah! Here's our little flower! FIRMIN: 
Ah Miss Daae, 
quite the lady 
of the hour! ANDRE: 
You have 
secured the largest role 
in this "Don Juan". CARLOTTA: 
Christine Daae? 
She doesn't have 
the voice! FIRMIN: 
Signora, please! RAOUL: 
Then I take it 
you're agreeing. CARLOTTA: 
She's behind this ... ANDRE: 
It appears we have 
no choice. CARLOTTA: 
She's the one 
behind this! 
Christine Daae! CHRISTINE: 
How dare you! CARLOTTA: 
I'm not a fool! CHRISTINE: 
You evil woman! 
How dare you! CARLOTTA: 
You think I'm blind? CHRISTINE: 
This isn't my fault! 
I don't want any 
part in this plot! FIRMIN: 
Miss Daae, surely ... ANDRE: 
But why not? PIANGI: 
What does she say? FIRMIN: 
It's your decision 
But why not? CARLOTTA: 
She's backing out! ANDRE: 
You have a duty! CHRISTINE: 
I cannot sing it, 
duty or not! RAOUL: 
Christine ... 
Christine ... 
You don't have to ... 
they can't make you ... GIRY: 
Please, monsieur: 
another note. 
"Fondest greetings 
to you all ! 
A few instructions 
just before 
rehearsal starts: ERIK: 
Carlotta must be 
taught to act ... ," 
... not her normal trick 
of strutting round the stage. 
Our Don Juan must 
lose some weight - 
it's not healthy in 
a man of Piangi's age. 
And my managers 
must learn 
that their place is in 
an office, not the arts. As for Miss Christine Daae ... 
No doubt she'll 
do her best - it's 
true her voice is 
good. She knows, though, 
should she wish to excel 
she has much still 
to learn, if pride will 
let her 
return to me, her 
teacher, 
her teacher ... GIRY: 
Your obedient friend ... 
"... and Angel ..." RAOUL: 
We have all been 
blind - and yet the 
answer is staring us 
in the face ... 
This could be the 
chance to ensnare our 
clever friend ... ANDRE: 
We're listening FIRMIN: 
...Go on. RAOUL: 
We shall play his 
game - perform his 
work - but remember we 
hold the ace ... 
For, if Miss Daae 
sings, he is certain 
to attend ... ANDRE: 
We make certain 
the doors are barred ... FIRMIN: 
We make certain 
our men are there ... RAOUL: 
We make certain 
they're armed ... ANDRE/FIRMIN/RAOUL: 
The curtain falls. 
His reign will end! GIRY: 
Madness! ANDRE: 
I'm not so sure ... FIRMIN: 
Not if it works ... GIRY: 
This is madness! ANDRE: 
The tide will turn! GIRY: 
Monsieur, believe me - 
there is no way of 
turning the tide! FIRMIN: 
You stick to ballet! RAOUL: 
Then help us! GIRY: 
Monsieur, I can't ... RAOUL: 
Instead of warning us ... RAOUL/ANDRE/FIRMIN: 
Help us! GIRY: 
I wish I could ... RAOUL/ANDRE/FIRMIN: 
Don't make excuses! RAOUL: 
Or could it be that 
you're on his side? GIRY: 
Monsieur, believe me, 
I intend no ill ... 
But messieurs, be careful - 
we have seen him kill ... ANDRE/FIRMIN: 
We say he'll fall 
and fall he will! CARLOTTA: 
She's the one behind this! 
Christine! 
This is a ploy to help, 
Christine! PIANGI: 
This is the truth! 
Christine Daae! RAOUL: 
This is his undoing! ANDRE/FIRMIN: 
If you succeed 
you free us all - 
this so called "angel" 
has to fall! RAOUL: 
Angel of music, 
fear my fury - 
Here is where you fall! GIRY: 
Hear my warning! 
Fear his fury! CARLOTTA: 
What glory can 
she hope to gain? 
It's clear to all 
the girl's insane! ANDRE: 
Christine sings 
We'll get our man ... PIANGI: 
She is crazy! 
She is raving! FIRMIN: 
If Christine helps 
us in this plan ... RAOUL: 
Say your prayers, 
black angel of death! CHRISTINE: 
Please don't ANDRE: 
...If Christine won't, 
then no-one can ... GIRY: 
Monsieur, I beg you, 
do not do this ... PIANGI/CARLOTTA: 
Gran Dio! 
Che imbroglio ANDRE/FIRMIN: 
This will seal his fate! CHRISTINE: 
If you don't stop, 
I'll go mad! 
Raoul, I'm frightened - 
don't make me do this ... 
Raoul, it scares me - 
don't put me through this 
ordeal by fire ... 
he'll take me, I know ... 
we'll be parted for ever ... 
he won't let me go ... 
What I once used to dream 
I now dread ... 
if he finds me, it won't 
ever end ... 
and he'll always be there, 
singing songs in my head ... 
he'll always be there, 
singing songs in my head ... CARLOTTA: 
She's mad ... RAOUL: 
You said yourself 
he was nothing 
but a man ... 
Yet while he lives, 
he will haunt us 
till we're dead ... CHRISTINE: 
Twisted every way, 
what answer can I give? 
Am I to risk my life, 
to win the chance to live? 
Can I betray the man 
who once inspired my voice? 
Do I become his prey? 
Do I have any choice? 
He kills without a thought, 
he murders all that's good . . . 
I know I can't refuse 
and yet, I wish I could . . . 
Oh God - if I agree, 
what horrors wait for me 
in this, the Phantom's opera . . .? RAOUL: 
Christine, Christine, 
don't think that I don't care - 
but every hope 
and every prayer 
rests on you now . . . 
RAOUL: 
So, it is to be war between us! But this time, clever 
friend, the disaster will be yours! CHORUS : 
Hide our sword now wounded knight! 
Your vainglorious gasconnade 
brought you to your final fight 
for your pride, high price you've paid! CHRISTINE: 
Silken couch and hay-filled barn 
both have been his battlefield. PIANGI: 
Those who tangle with Don Juan . . . REYER: 
No, no, no! Please. 
Don Juan, Signor Piangi - here is the phrase. "Those who tangle with Don Juan . . ." 
If you please? 
PIANGI: 
Those who tangle with Don Juan . . . 
REYER: 
No, no. Nearly - but no. 
"Those who tan, tan, tan . . ." 
PIANGI: 
Those who tangle with Don Juan . . . 
CARLOTTA: 
His way is better. At least he make it sound like 
music! 
GIRY: 
Signora - would you speak that way in the 
presence of the composer? 
CARLOTTA: 
The composer is not here. And if he were here, I 
would . . . 
GIRY: 
Are you certain of that, Signora . . .? 
REYER: 
So, once again - after seven. 
Five, six, seven . . . 
PIANGI: 
Those who tangle with Don Juan . . . 
CARLOTTA : 
Ah, piu non posso! What does it matter what notes 
we sing? 
GIRY: 
Have patience, Signora. 
CARLOTTA: 
No-one will know if it is right or if it is wrong. 
CARLOTTA: 
Those who tangle 
with Don Juan! 
PIANGI: 
Those who tan . . . tan . . . 
Is right? 
CHRISTINE: 
Not quite, Signor: 
Those who tan . . . tan . . . 
REYER: 
Ladies . . . Signor Piangi . . . if you please . . . ALL EXCEPT CHRISTINE: 
Poor young maiden! For the thrill 
on your tongue of stolen sweets 
you will have to pay the bill - 
tangled in the winding sheets! CHRISTINE: 
In sleep 
he sang to me, 
in dreams 
he came . . . 
that voice 
which calls to me 
and speaks 
my name . . . Little Lotte 
thought of everything and nothing . . . 
Her Father promised her 
that he would send her the Angel of Music . . . 
Her father promised her . . . 
Her father promised her
