With its dawn rides cold oppression 
Foreign armies settle on new shores 
Called to negate insurrection 
Armed enforcers ready to make war Neo-Kosacks in NATO colors 
For the state herding sheep 
Your internment re-education 
Prove you can learn or forever sleep Come on and fight 
Heart is forever 
Lay down and die 
Life's not all you surrender So you're blind say, say your prayers 
As your name turns to numbers 
Blind say, say your prayers 
On the last train to nowhere Look to the sky it foretells your disaster 
Two suns arise so all men shall find 
An earth under Lucifer forever brilliant 
A world trapped in light where the shadow will shine Come on and fight 
Heart is forever 
Lay down and die 
Life's not all you surrender So you're blind say, say your prayers 
As your name turns to numbers 
Blind say, say your prayers 
On the last train to nowhere Hey Come on and fight 
Heart is forever 
Lay down and die 
Life's not all you surrender So you're blind say, say your prayers 
As your name turns to numbers 
Blind say, say your prayers 
On the last train to nowhere Blind say, say your prayers 
As your name turns to numbers 
Blind say, say your prayers
