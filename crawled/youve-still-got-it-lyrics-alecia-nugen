Southern lights and how planes fly 
Some things I'll never understand 
Like me here again tonight 
At your memories command Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine 
I just can't forget the night I lost you 
It's still a mystery after all this time 
Though I've tried, I just don't get it 
You've still got it Turn the page, close the book 
Put it on a shelf and let it be 
That promise made was all it took 
For you to make a lier out of me Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine 
I just can't forget the night I lost you 
It's still a mystery after all this time 
Though I've tried, I just don't get it 
You've still got it
