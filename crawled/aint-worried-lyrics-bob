I 'aint worried 'bout nothing 
Nigga said, 'he aint heard about me shit he must aint heard about nothin'

You allergic to stuntin' 
Both my pockets I stuff em' 
And I don't know what shoes you prefer but these *fur so dont scuff em' 
Got that dank for the weedheads ' 
Got deep thoughts for the conscious 
God damn beat for the aunty 
And I got that D for ya mama

And I 'aint no motherfucker dj.

You look so soft that my fabrics are softenin

Bulletproof flow in a room with 2 hoes, 
she squirt so hard that my living room soaked

On my next check I'm get a new boat
