You got my heart beating 
Beating, beating, beating, beating, beating 
You got my mind to fall over 
Fall over, fall over, fall over, fall over 
Fall over, fall over I gave up my, my pride, why? 
Why, lay over 
My motion says why You got my heart beating 
Beating, beating, beating, beating, beating 
You got my mind to fall over 
Fall over, fall over, fall over, fall over 
Fall over, fall over I gave up my, my pride, why? 
Why, lay over 
My motion says why 
Why, lay over 
My motion says why
