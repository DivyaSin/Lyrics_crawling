I cant stand another night 
Stand another night 
Without you 
Since you've been away 
Everything's don't seem like they used to be 
Between you and me 
Cause I'm missing you (I, I, I, I, I, I) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) I'm missing you (love, love, love) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) Yo, yo, yo 
Everyday everyday that you gone 
I'm singing out that sad song 
If loving you is wrong 
Then I must be wrong 
Even if when I'm gone 
Our love is strong 
You're the one I want 
You're my number one 
And yea my love ain't going out of fashion 
I need to love your passion 
The love is everlasting Since you've been away 
Everything's don't seem like they used to be 
Between you and me 
Cause I'm missing you (I, I, I, I, I, I) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) I'm missing you (love, love, love) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) When I'm out on the road (I'm missing you) 
Rockin' them shows (missing you) 
Up in Monaco (I'm missing you) 
Making go 
What may seem plush (I'm missing you) 
And glamorous (miss kissing you) 
But I miss your touch (I'm missing you) 
Yeah I miss your touch 
I spent all my time (missing you) 
With you and mine (missing you) 
My minds on you 
Cause all I want is missing you (i'm missing you) 
(I'm missing you) 
(I'm missing you) Since you've gone away 
Everything's don't seem like they used to be 
Between you and me 
Cause I'm missing you (I, I, I, I, I, I) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) I'm missing you (love, love, love) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) 
I'm missing you, love (love, love, love) Girl I ain't never had nothin' like this 
When I'm all sprung caught up like this 
Maybe its your face girl maybe its your lips 
Maybe its the way you shake them hips 
Maybe its the way you do what you do 
That got me all love struck on you 
I'll be like an umbrella the way I'm all over you 
I know them other boys be callin' you 
But they just wanna piece, I want all of you 
Take my time just spoiling you 
Cause I know I'm in love with you Please baby don't go 
Needing you now I'm missing you 
I'm missing you, 
I'm missing you, 
I'm missing you, 
Missing you 
I'm missing you, 
I'm missing you, I miss your love girl 
I miss I miss your love 
I miss your love girl 
I miss I miss your love 
I miss your love girl 
I miss I miss your love 
I miss your love girl
