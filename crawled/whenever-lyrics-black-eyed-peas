Love, through the trees, past the sky 
Beyond the northern light 
You're the same, my delight 
Reflecting in your eyes 
And I won't let go, if you wait for me 
Whenever, wherever 
And then you, select the day, selection 
Wherever, whenever We'll go-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Wherever, whenever 
We'll go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. 
I wa- I-wa I wanna love forever, love forever, baby. 
Wherever, wherever you wanna go (One day) 
Do-do whatever, do whatever baby 
Wherever, wherever, forever together I fell asleep, don't know why 
You let me come alive 
You and me, we collide 
Ignite the starry fire 
And you warm me up, and you wait for it 
Whenever, whenever 
And then you, you wake me up, and you wait for it 
Whenever, whenever I wanna go-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Wherever, whenever 
I wanna go-ooh-ooh-ooh 
I wa- I-wa I wanna love forever, love forever, baby. 
Wherever, wherever you wanna go (One day) 
Do-do whatever, do whatever baby 
Wherever, wherever, forever together 
Whenever, whatever, whatever, whatever, 
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
