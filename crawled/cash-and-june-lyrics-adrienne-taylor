You can't walk the line 
If the road twists and turns 
Where black show your sorrow 
You say it ain't me you're lookin' for You've lost sight of the spotlight 
The curtains are all closed 
But I dim the lights down low 
And we can dance real slow I will stand by your side 
I'll be your saving grace 
My hand is yours to hold 
If you lose your way The waters getting rough 
But were still hanging on 
I will stand by you 
Like Cash and June You say I'm not the one you want 
Baby I'm not the one you need 
When you got the blues and you've lost your rhythm 
I hope you think of me 
You got everything I've been looking for 
And I'm reaching for the flames 
I've walked into your ring of fire 
We'll go down in history I will stand by your side 
I'll be your saving grace 
My hand is yours to hold 
If you lose your way The waters getting rough 
But were still hanging on 
I will stand by you 
Like Cash and June And you'll ask me to marry you 
Right there on that stage 
I'll love you til we're gray and old 
With a smile up on my face I will stand by your side 
I'll be your saving grace 
My hand is yours to hold 
If you lose your way The waters getting rough 
But were still hanging on 
I will stand by you 
Like Cash and June
