... I hear{ed} 
whispering of hate 
grant me the power 
{See/seal} your fate [Chorus:] my soul is lost in a deepest {hole} 
{Bethrow} for me my desire Battle against the only god 
None will stand before me 
They gaze into the pits of Hell 
Where unlocked we unite ... be the one 
All the lords of evil 
Nothing remains for embarassed 
{the/for} bastard son of emptyness my soul is lost in a {faithless hole} 
{Bethrow} with me my desire Sacrifice, bleed for him 
Sacrifice, lands of god 
Sacrifice, {turn on him} 
Sacrifice, my soul is lost
