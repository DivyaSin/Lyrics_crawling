WRITTEN BY KEVIN BACON, MICHAEL BACON He was headlining the Lazy Lounge 
And the crowd was growing thin 
It was me and two drunk salesman 
And a waitress named Corine 
He wasn't much to look at 
Drum machine and a bad toupee 
But he brought out a beat-up Strat 
And blew us all away 
He was born to do it 
He was born to play 
Like there was nothing to it 
Like he did it every day 
Not some well-pierced pretty boy 
That you find on every block 
Not Born To Beauty 
Not Born To Beauty 
Born to rock Open mike in a village bar 
All the bands would play for free 
When the drummer took his solo 
I realized he was a she 
Now she was bigger than a houseboat 
She was lucky it was dark 
But you should've seen her hands float 
And she could bite you like a shark 
She was born to do it 
She was born to play 
Like there was nothing to it 
Yeah she did it every day 
Not some skinny pin-up 
She had time like a Swiss-made clock 
Not Born To Beauty 
Not Born To Beauty, yeah Their clothes are out of style 
And the road shows on their faces 
The hair that once lived on their heads 
Has moved to other places 
Maybe they got day jobs 
To support this rockin' jones 
But the rhythm fits them like a skin 
And the blues is in their bones
