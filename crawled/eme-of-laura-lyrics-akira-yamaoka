Stand up for yourself 
Like I stand up for myself 
That's no way to be 
Flat down on your knees 
Friendship's bad side 
Means all the things you need 
Partnership, allied 
Means all the things you stole from me 
You've got everything you need from me 
If that's the way you want to be 
You'll get everything you want, that's all 
I am everything you want, that's all 
You've got to believe 
If you want to succeed 
Believe in yourself 
Try to make up your mind 
Friendship's bad side 
Means all the things you need 
Partnership, allied 
Means all the things you stole from me 
You've got everything you need from me 
If that's the way you want to be
