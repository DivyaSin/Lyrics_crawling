When will this winter end? 
The snow's been falling for months 
The town all dressed in white 
And my skin is burning from the wind A cold sun in disguise 
An assault from the morning light 
My burial, I can't succeed 
Frozen and paralyzed Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter 
Oh winter
