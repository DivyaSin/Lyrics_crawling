My heads been in the clouds lately 
And it's raining on me 
My thoughts have been getting way too heavy 
And now I can't see clearly 
Been keeping things hidden inside 
So scared of what's going on in my mind 
I'm all choked up just writing this 
Can't cope with this I'm loosing it Cos it's hard when you're falling apart it the seams 
Cursed by all those unrealistic dreams 
And you're waiting for the court is be adjourned 
Don't want to watch them watch me crash and burn 
Crash and burn I've lost control I just exist 
I'm just a number on a never ending list 
But it's OK just forget me 
when I go on your head it will be 
you don't care 
But why should you? 
I probably won't see this one through Cos it's hard when you're falling apart it the seams 
Cursed by all those unrealistic dreams 
and you're waiting for the court to be adjourned 
Don't want to watch them watch me crash and burn 
Crash and burn Cos it's hard when you're falling apart at the seams 
Cursed by all those unrealistic dreams 
and you're waiting for the court is adjourned 
Don't want to watch them watch me crash and burn Crash and burn 
Crash and burn 
Crash and burn
