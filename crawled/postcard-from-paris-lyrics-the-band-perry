I remember when my heart caught the fever 
You were standing all alone in the summer heat 
I was with my boyfriend, new boyfriend 
He was as sweet as he could be 
One look at you and I was through 
My heart switched up on me Like a postcard from Paris 
When I've seen the real thing 
It's like finding out your diamond 
Was from her old promise ring 
Coming back from your fortune teller 
She read your cards upside down 
The meanest thing you ever did is come around 
And now I'm ruined 
(I'm ruined) In the evening you can catch me daydreaming 
Did that moment send you reeling just like me 
I should've gone over, right over 
I should've never let you leave 
But it's the never knowing that keeps this going 
And drives me crazy Like a postcard from Paris 
When I've seen the real thing 
It's like finding out your diamond 
Was from her old promise ring 
Come back from your fortune teller 
She read your cards upside down 
The meanest thing you ever did is come around Just when I thought things were alright 
My eyes played tricks on my mind 
Will I ever be satisfied 
'Cause all I ever seem to find Is a postcard from Paris 
When I need the real thing 
It's like finding out your diamond 
Is from an old promise ring 
Come back from your fortune teller 
She read your cards upside down 
The meanest thing you ever did 
The cruelest thing you ever did 
The meanest thing you ever did is come around I am ruined 
I'm ruined 
I am ruined, yeah 
I am ruined, yeah
