I've thought about it, I've analyzed it 
You kissin' me verifies it 
Ooh, there's something goin' on here 
It didn't take too much insistin' 
Baby you can be so convincin' 
Ooh, there's something goin' on here No it doesn't take a genius to figure it out 
We have this connection 
Don't need a psychic to tell us our future's pointed in the right direction 
Well take a spin, so jump on in, let's get this thing in gear 
I'm really thinking 
We got something goin' on here My friends are gettin' tired of hearin' me talk about you 
Oh but honey that's all I wanna do 
I go on and on and on about what's goin' on here 
We're comin' pickin' up speed 
A wildflower growin' from an itty bitty seed 
There's something goin' on here No it doesn't take a genius to figure it out 
We have this connection 
Don't need a psychic to tell us our future's pointed in the right direction 
So here we go, it's an open road, I'm seein' the sign so clear 
I'm really thinkin' that we got something goin' on here
