I just lost my best friend 
I miss you so much I wish my life would end 
I cannot get up from down here 
I cried until dust appeared 
I'm trying to let go 
But it hurts like I've never been hurt before 
And it feels like I'll never smile again 
I cannot sleep without you there 
All I wanted was to be with you everywhere 
Let me quietly fade away 
The best part of me left today 
I'm trying to let go 
But it hurts like I've never been hurt before 
And it feels like I'll never smile again
