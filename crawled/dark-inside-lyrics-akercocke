Drink the blood, shadows cast 
Formless flesh your disguise 
Divine Hell ritual 
Crush your shape, unholy dance The captive angel flailing still 
Inside the dark, the dark inside 
Taste of the necrotic cadaver See the blood, obscene prayer 
Intoxicate seraph pure 
Evil sublime, agony 
Purified by my perversion The captive angel flailing still 
Inside the dark, the dark inside 
Taste of the necrotic cadaver A perfect suggestion 
You understand despite 
The words you can really hear 
My carnal intention 
Unfolds before your very eyes The night is cold and clear 
I cast my gaze to see 
Your voice is warm and near 
But it means nothing to me Sea breeze turns to gale 
It's harder now to see 
Your words are like a veil Hours drip by, time burning 
Your wine spills from 
The glass you barely hold 
Disrobing, sublimely 
Reaching down to claim the prize The night is cold and clear 
I cast my gaze to see 
Your voice is warm and near 
But it means nothing to me Sea breeze turns to gale 
It's harder now to see 
Your words are like a veil 
But they mean nothing at all Breathing 
Scratching 
From the inside Untouchable 
Unreachable 
Uncertainty The night is no disguise 
The darkness is a mirror I was feeling blind 
Everything seemed new to me 
You made up my mind 
Lies were really truth you see See the blood, obscene prayer 
Intoxicate seraph pure 
Evil sublime, agony 
Purified by my perversion The captive angel flailing still 
Inside the dark, the dark inside 
Taste of the necrotic cadaver
