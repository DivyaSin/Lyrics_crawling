Lyrics: winn 
Music: winn So here you come again 
Here you come again through the door 
That was closed to your heart 
In the first round 
And it's the same 
It's the same as the games 
That we started to play 
In the west end 
But you were mean and scheming 
Miss misbelieving 
You dragged me down 
Pulled back again So I'll just let you go 
I hope you don't come back 
I'll just let you go 
I hope you won't be back 
I'll just let you go 
I hope you won't be back 
Anymore There you go again 
There you go again breathing fire 
With your pipes that were blazed 
In the sun's stare 
Crying again 
You come crying with the tears 
Of a child who was raised 
In the wrong home 
Still you come stronger again 
Cursing the grin 
Bleeding your fight to the end 
You drag me down 
You pull back again So I'll just let you go 
I hope you don't come back 
I'll just let you go 
I hope you won't be back 
I'll just let you go 
I hope you won't be back 
Anymore. Let you go
