Verse 1: 
Shuffling my feet 
down the street 
bumps and boozehounds 
increase by leaps and bounds by getting closer 
to the dealers fairground 
sold dreams 
going up in steam Verse 2: 
down to the mart 
walls tear my view apart 
with blinding lights 
to the left and right easy pleasure 
without measure 
cleaning the wallet 
and tearing my soul Chorus 1: 
another monkey business 
leaving another big mess Verse 3: 
rigid statues 
kissed by no muse 
painting pictures 
of habits, a must have won't you sell your ideal 
ideals never come real 
but there's an easier way 
stop, take and pay Chorus 2: 
another monkey business 
leaving a hole in the heart 
Outro: 
another monkey business
