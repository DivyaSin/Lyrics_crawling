Recorded in 1990 for the soundtrack to a french film called 'code pere noel'. lyrics taken from careful listening. Merry merry christmas 
Don't change kids, stay with us 
Stay little jesus 
Hold onto my hand 
It's not a long way 
To fly alone 
Don't fly in vain 
It's so hard anyway 
To become a man Happy birthday christmas 
Welcome holy jesus 
Although you rain on us 
You can't understand 
Why even a child 
Learning the truth 
Always learns pain 
Why does he have to cry 
To become a man? Help me santa claus 
Come close to my heart 
All the doors are closed 
I can't play my part 
I can't play my part
