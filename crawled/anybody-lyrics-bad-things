I get up just to bring you down 
I never loved you so 
don't bleed it out, Just let it go 
And Open up your eyes girl 
Why'd you ever care at all 
Stop, don't talk bitch why you running 
Away you got no where to go oh 
Feelings don't hold me 
Now I see you're 
feeling the same as 
As when I lost the leash 
I can't contain your dreams 
Is anybody here 
Is anybody here 
I can feel it coming 
I've been down 
Down that train 
And my love you've been up for days 
Just to find a way, to open up your eyes 
See we never were at all 
Stop, don't talk shit just bite your tongue 
And let it fall. 
OH you gotta let if fall Feelings don't hold me 
Now I see you're feeling the same as 
As when I lost the leash 
I can't contain your dreams 
Is anybody here 
Is anybody here 
I can feel it coming Is anybody here 
I can feel it coming 
Does anybody care 
I can hear them calling 
Does anybody care 
Is anybody here 
Is anybody here
