I am like the ocean 
Twisted as the tides. 
Up and down emotions 
Playing with your mind. I will hurt you, just to hold you 
Standing in the rain. 
Thorns come with the roses 
And I will bring you pain. [Chorus] 
Oh! 
I'll make you cry now, 
It's better if you know 
I'll break your heart 
a thousand times. 
I'll say good-bye but 
I'll never let go. 
I told you that mines 
A hard hand to hold. Midnight conversations 
Full of allabies. 
Take a lot of patience, 
To much sacrifice. I will crush you 
Just to hear you 
Screaming out my name. 
When your desperate, 
Down and dirty, 
You'll have me to blame. [Chorus] I told you, it's a hard hand to hold 
(Didn't I, didn't I tell you? Didn't I, didn't I tell you? Didn't I, didn't I tell you? 
I told you. 
Didn't I, didn't I tell you?) [Chorus: x2] Didn't I, didn't I tell you? 
I told you it's a hard hand to hold. 
Didn't I, didn't I tell you. 
Don't let go. 
Didn't I, didn't I tell you? 
It's a hard hand to hold
