Your love's infectious like some epic disease 
Your kiss is venom that goes straight to my knees 
My drug of choice is what you're giving to me 
It's not enough 
I need your touch 
Baby, give it to me Ever since I met you on those cold dark streets 
You made my heart pulse to a brand new beat 
And blew my mind with such insanity 
It's just too much 
Caught in your clutch 
You've got a hold on me You're the best damn thing I've ever seen 
I look at you and forget to breathe 
Your history is a mystery 
Our chemistry is blistering 
Like we're covered in kerosene Set me on fire 
You take me higher 
Than I've ever been before 
My one desire 
You broke in and shook my core 
Let's be exclusive 
Don't be elusive 
Come on in and close the door 
(Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire) Your body was made by the devils design 
But I don't care, just as long as you're mine 
Incomparable, you're one of a kind 
Let's have some fun 
Until the sun 
Hits the morning sky Lay back and close your eyes 
Because baby you're in for a surprise 
Get out the camera and turn on the lights 
Put on a show 
Ready, set, go 
Let's get naughty tonight You're the best damn thing I've ever seen 
I look at you and forget to breathe 
Your history is a mystery 
Our chemistry is blistering 
Like we're covered in kerosene Set me on fire 
You take me higher 
Than I've ever been before 
My one desire 
You broke in and shook my core 
Let's be exclusive 
Don't be elusive 
Come on in and close the door 
(Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire)
