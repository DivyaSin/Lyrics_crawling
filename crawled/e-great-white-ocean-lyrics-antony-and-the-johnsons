Swim with me my mama when I dive in the ocean of death 
I will cry if I am not with my family 
You could be my friend eternally Swim with me my sister when I dive in the great white ocean 
We must try, try to find a way that we can see 
See each others faces in the sea Swim with me my sister when I dive in the great white ocean 
We must try, try to find a way that we can see 
See each others faces in the sea
