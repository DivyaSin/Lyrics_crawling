Lord tell me why, 
there's so many ways to die, 
lord tell me why, 
there's so many ways to die.* I'm gonna take me, 
a walk by the river, 
and I'm gonna jump, 
jump right in, 
I'm gonna curse that, 
muddy old water, 
'cause that river knows, 
that I can't swim, 
oh lord, 
the trouble I'm in. And I'm gonna take me, 
oh by the mountain, 
and when I'm way, 
when I'm way up high, 
I'm gonna curse that, 
dirty old mountain, 
'cause that mountain knows, 
that I can't climb, 
oh lord, 
there's so many ways to die. 'Cause last night I had, 
his love in my hands, 
now I can't understand, 
where it's gone to, 
oh but all it was, 
it was over just like that, 
and I can't get it back, 
even though I want to. Oh lord, 
I'm gonna buy me, 
a case of bourbon, 
and I'm gonna drink, 
I'm gonna drink it dry, 
oh but I've cursed, 
every drop that I am drinking, 
'cause I know booze, 
will get me by and by, 
oh lord, 
there's so many ways to die. Oh lord, 
lord tell me why, 
there's so many ways to die, 
I gotta know lord, 
I gotta know lord, 
there's so many ways to die,
