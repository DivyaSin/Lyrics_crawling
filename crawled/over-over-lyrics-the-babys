And when I'm all alone at night 
The things I've done pass through my mind 
The thoughtless words the useless fights 
I guess I'll never learn cause here I go 
Over and over again 
Why why why why 
Over and over again I thought I had it all worked out 
Just what to say and what to do 
So why these fears and all this doubt 
Just sitting in my room thinking it over 
Over and over again 
Why why why why 
Over and over again 
Over and over again 
Over and over again And if I thought that things would change 
I'd say I'm sorry once again ooh 
But this time things feel so damn strange 
I know I'll never love 
Over and over again 
Over and over again
