Wandering child of the earth 
Do you know just how much you're worth? 
You have walked this path since your birth 
You were destined for more There are those who'll tell you you're wrong 
They will try to to silence your song 
But right here is where you belong 
So don't search anymore You are the dawn of a new day that's waking 
A masterpiece still in the making 
The blue in an ocean of grey 
You are right where you need to be 
Poised to inspire and to succeed 
You'll look back and you'll realize one day In your eyes there is doubt 
As you try to figure it out 
But that's not what life is about 
So have faith there's a way Though the world may try to define you 
It can't take the light that's inside you 
So don't you dare try to hide 
Let your fears fade away You are the dawn of a new day that's waking 
A masterpiece still in the making 
The blue in an ocean of grey 
You are right where you need to be 
Poised to inspire and to succeed 
You'll look back and you'll realize one day You are the dawn of a new day that's waking 
A masterpiece still in the making 
The blue in an ocean of grey 
You are right where you need to be 
Poised to inspire and to succeed 
Soon you'll finally find your own way
