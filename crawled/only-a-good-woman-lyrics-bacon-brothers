When I was seventeen 
I asked my daddy 
What does it take to be a man 
He said sit down son 
Let's have a little talk 
I'll try and make you understand 
Then he said years won't do it, tears won't do it 
And sittin down to drink a thousand beers won't do it 
Tattoos won't do it, and booze won't do it 
And puttin little lifts in your shoes won't do it 
I'm gonna tell you the thing that can 
He said you get a good woman and she'll make you a man 
He said only, a good woman can 
That's the only thing, that's gonna make you a man 
He said a scar won't do it fast cars won't do it 
And kickin someone's ass in a bar won't do it 
You aint gonna do it as an army private or 
A captain or lieutenant, no just won't buy it 
Listen son you'd better get yourself a plan 
He said you get a good woman and she'll make you a man 
He said only, a good woman can 
That's the only thing, that's gonna make you a man 
Now I was runnin around all through my twenties 
Just to prove I had the stuff 
Then one day I met this brown eyed girl 
She said to me boy you aint so tough 
She said that walk won't do it, talk won't do it 
And struttin in here like a chicken hawk won't do it 
Or bein a sexist, or drivin that Lexus 
Or tellin people you were born and raised in Texas 
Come over here boy if you think you can 
She said you get a good woman and she'll make you a man 
She said only, a good woman can 
That's the only thing, that's gonna make you a man 
My daddy died when I was thirty one 
And that brown eyed girl gave me a brown eyed son 
And when he comes to me wonderin how you do it 
I'll say now sit down son cause I've been through it 
Drugs won't do it, and hugs won't do it 
And hangin on the corner with the thugs won't do it 
The preacher won't do it and the teacher won't do it 
And stayin up to watch the creature feature won't do it 
Boy just look at your momma and you'll understand 
You get a good woman and she'll make you a man 
Son only, a good woman can 
That's the only thing, that's gonna make you a man 
Eatin snakes won't do it, Body By Jake won't do it 
And puttin a lot of birthday candles on your birthday cake won't do it 
Wearin cowboy boots won't do it, Armani suits won't do it 
Sittin there puffin on that Cuban cheroot won't do it 
Bein rich won't do it, bein poor won't do it 
Playin this song on the radioooo.....might do it 
Actually, that might do it
