Baby take a load off, take your coat off 
Stay awhile 
So It's raining,no use complaining 
Just stay awhile 
Why be alone,make yourself at home 
There's no reason to be a leavin' I think we both realize 
How this is feeling something like love 
Talking 'bout love 
Baby,this love don't need nothin' but time 
And it's ticking,why don't you come in 
Stay awhile It's getting cold out,nowhere to go now 
Stay awhile 
My arms are open,you got me hoping 
That you'll stay awhile I think we both realize 
How this is feeling something like love 
Talking 'bout love 
Baby,this love don't need nothin' but time 
And it's ticking,why don't you come in 
Stay awhile
