Hiding notes in a secret place 
I know it so 
Close my eyes and see aeroplanes 
And so it goes 
Crossing numbers and counting days 
For you to see 
Fingers move and anticipate 
I skip a beat Hand me your eyes 
Oversized 
I can see through 
My disguise I'm with you when I'm by myself 
At least I feel like its true with a little help 
And can you tell; 
My heart beats faster when you speak 
And do you know heaven comes only for a week 
And then it goes Hand me your eyes 
Oversized 
I can see through 
My disguise 
Show me your mind 
Hypnotise 
Cover your mood 
Heavy lies
