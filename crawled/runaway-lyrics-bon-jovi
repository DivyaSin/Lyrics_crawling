On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives 
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint 
A touch of sable in their eyes All your life all you asked 
When is your Daddy gonna talk to you 
But we're living in another world 
Tryin' to get your message through No one heard a single word you said 
They should have seen it in your eyes 
What was going around your head Oh, she's a little runaway 
Daddy's girl learned fast 
All those things he couldn't say 
Ooh, she's a little runaway A different line every night 
Guaranteed to blow your mind 
See you out on the streets 
Call me for a wild time 
So you sit home alone 
'Cause there's nothing left that you can do 
There's only pictures hung in the shadows 
Left there to look at you You know she likes the lights 
At night on the neon Broadway signs 
And she don't really mind 
Its only love she hoped to find Oh, she's a little runaway 
Daddy's girl learned fast 
All those things he couldn't say 
Ooh, she's a little runaway No one heard a single word you said 
They should have seen it in your eyes 
What was going on your head Oh, she's a little runaway 
Daddy's girl learned fast 
All those things he couldn't say 
Ooh, she's a little runaway
