JAMIE: 
No, that one's Jerry Seinfeld 
That one's John Lennon there 
No, the Dakota 
The San Remo is up a few blocks 
Have you been inside the museum 
We should go, meet the dinosaurs 
Cathy Will you share your life with me 
For the next ten minutes? 
For the next ten minutes 
We can handle that 
We could watch the waves 
We could watch the sky 
Or just sit and wait 
As the time ticks by 
And if we make it till then 
Can I ask you again 
For another ten? And if you in turn agree 
To the next ten minutes 
And the next ten minutes 
Till the morning comes 
Then just holding you 
Might compel me to 
Ask you for more 
There are so many lives I want to share with you 
I will never be complete until I do CATHY: I am not always on time 
Please don't expect that from me 
I will be late 
But if you can just wait 
I will make it eventually 
Not like it's in my control 
Not like I'm proud of the fact 
But anything other than being exactly on time 
I can do I don't know why people run 
I don't know why plans fall through 
I don't know how anybody survives in this life 
Without someone like you 
I could protect and preserve 
I could say no and goodbye 
But why, Jamie, why? I want to be your wife 
I want to bear your child 
I want to die 
Knowing I 
Had a long loving life 
In your arms 
That I can do 
Forever, with you JAMIE: Will you share your life with me? CATHY: Forever JAMIE: For the next ten minutes? CATHY: Forever, Jamie JAMIE: For a million summers BOTH: Till the world explodes 
Till there's no one left 
Who has ever known us apart JAMIE: There are so many dreams 
I need to see with you... CATHY: There are so many years 
I need to be with you... JAMIE: I will never be complete CATHY: I will never be alive JAMIE: I will never change the world 
Until I do CATHY: I do JAMIE: I do CATHY: I do BOTH: I do CATHY: Is that one John Lennon? 
That's the San Remo there. 
Isn't that the museum? 
Can we go see the dinosaurs?
