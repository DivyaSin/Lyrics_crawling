Please send some snow 
Some snow for Johnny 
He wants to build 
A big snowman It was a week just before Christmas 
Way down in Louisiana 
A little boy was kneeling by his bed 
In a manner poised and grand I listened as he said his prayers 
His voice came soft and low 
He said, "God tell Saint Nicholas 
To send a little snow" Please send some snow 
Some snow for Johnny 
He wants to build 
A big snowman I'd like to build a snowman 
Like the other children do 
I've got an old top hat and a walking cane 
Got a big long cigar too Yes, everything is ready 
And I'm all set to go 
How can I build a snowman 
When I haven't any snow Please send some snow 
Some snow for Johnny 
He wants to build 
A big snowman Now, early Christmas morning 
Much to his surprise 
Snowflakes by the million 
Were falling from the skies Down the stairs and out-of-doors 
As fast as he could go 
So happy that Saint Nicholas 
Had sent a little snow Thanks for the snow 
The snow for Johnny 
Now he can build 
A big snowman Thanks for the snow 
The snow for Johnny 
Now he can build 
A big snowman Thanks for the snow 
The snow for Johnny 
Now he can build 
A big snowman
