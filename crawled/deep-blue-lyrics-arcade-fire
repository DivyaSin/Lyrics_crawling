Here in my place and time 
And here in my own skin I can finally begin 
Let the century pass me by, standing under the night sky 
Tomorrow means nothing I was only a child then 
Feeling barely alive when 
I heard a song from a speaker of a passing car 
Praying to a dying star, the memories fading 
I can almost remember singing( La la, la la, la la la la) 
(La la, la la, la la la la) We watched the end of the century 
Compressed on a tiny screen 
A dead star collapsing and we could see 
Something was ending 
Are you through pretending? 
We saw the signs in the suburbs You could have never predicted that it could see through you 
Kasparov, Deep Blue, 1996 
Your mind's playing tricks now 
Show's over so take a bow 
And leave it in the shadows (La la, la la, la la la la) 
(Oh la la, la la, la la la la) Hey 
Put the cellphone down for a while 
In the night there is something wild 
Can you hear it breathing? 
And hey 
Put the laptop down for a while 
In the night there is something wild 
I feel it, it's leaving me (La la, la la, la la la la) 
(La la, la la, la la la la) 
(La la, la la, la la la la) 
(La la, la la, la la la la)
