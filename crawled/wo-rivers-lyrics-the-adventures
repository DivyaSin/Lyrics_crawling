They might say we can't go on 
They will try to burn you down 
What they say can make you strong 
But they can't see no reason when I'm talking to you 
Don't let behind the reasons why we've come this far 
You'll feel the pride of what we are 
Two Rivers run to see and catch your falling stars 
In troubled times come to me for shelter 
I'll be running to be with you and... 
I'm willing to make that deal 
Is there a chance to carry on 
If they could feel the way I feel 
They would see the reason 
Why I'm talking to you. 
Don't let behind the reasons why we've come this far 
You'll feel the pride of what we are 
Two Rivers run to see and catch your falling stars 
In troubled times come to me for shelter 
I'll be running to be with you again... 
Don't let behind the reasons why we've come this far 
You'll feel the pride of what we are 
Two Rivers run to see and catch your falling stars 
When the darkest hour surrounds you 
In troubled times come to me for shelter 
I'll be running to be with you again... 
Two rivers run... 
Two rivers run...
