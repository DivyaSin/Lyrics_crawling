(Hook) 
The G. 5 got a lot of fuel 
Yeah but we flash fuck 
But that's the way you stay up, that's the way you stay up 
Good money, good weed 
That's the way you stay up 
Good niggas, real bitches 
That's the way you stay up (Post Hook) 
Yeah x 4 
We just try to stay up 
Yeah x 4 
We just try to stay up 
Hear, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
We just try to stay up x 2 
The G. 5 got a lot of fuel 
That's the way you stay up (Verse) 
Real niggas, real bitches 
That's the way you stay up 
[Yeah x 4 
We just try to stay up] x 2 
Good money, pussy, weed 
That's the way you stay up 
Stay with the bully niggas 
That's the way you stay up 
Yeah x 4 
We just try to stay up 
Smokin' weed out of bags 
That's the way I stay up 
22 pound of cash 
Do the micro waiter 
Still move like a street nigga with my same street nigga 
That Jack son beat my chick niggas 
QP OG flip leakers hustle (Hook) + (Post Hook) 
(Verse) 
Brakin' bread on my niggas 
See that's how we stay up 
You see boy, we the killers 
And that's why we stay up 
Trap house on that hand stand 
Come on and show, I'm the bad man 
Lay it down with some bitches 
Cuz that's how we lay up 
Dollar checkin' out high 
Boy I got fight, put it by the leash and turn it to the sky 
A man to the ballen and you can see why
