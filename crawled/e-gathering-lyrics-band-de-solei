I want you to come with us 
Have a good time with us 
Come sing and dance 'neath the stars 
Come have a laugh with us Come raise your glass with us 
Come and do nothing at all 
We request your presence 
And if you will let us We'll make you feel just like a king 
We've rolled out the carpet 
And sent for the carriage 
Your smile is all that you must bring We're waiting for you to come 
Out of the blue 
We're hoping it won't be too long 
I've a smile you can borrow A bucket for sorrow 
Leave your worries -- come along 
You butchers, you bakers 
You candlestick makers Poets, prophets, and priests 
Consider it mild to come play like a child 
Come one, come all and you'll see 
It's your invitation to come to the Gathering
