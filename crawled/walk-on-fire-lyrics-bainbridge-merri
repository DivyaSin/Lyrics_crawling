I won't talk about tomorrow 
Stay, stay until the dawn 
When all who come to take your place 
Just occupy an empty space 
Time and time again I would not mind 
Cause everyday is like a 
Tide that takes me out to sea 
You're the boat that keeps returning me 
And so I'll walk and I'll walk yes I am walkin on fire 
And I see everyday time slippin away 
And so I'll walk and I'll walk I'll keep walkin forever 
Wake up we've got so much to see 
Leave and take this letter with you 
And hold onto a line so you can 
Find your way back home again 
Through summer snow or pouring rain 
And so I'll walk and I'll walk yes I am walkin on fire 
And I see everyday time slippin away 
And so I'll walk and I'll walk I'll keep walkin forever 
Wake up we've got so much to see 
And anytime that you desire 
I'll walk on water walk on fire 
I'll walk around this world entire 
For you
