Right now gonna take you in my arms 
Hold you closer and tighter than I ever have 
I'm gonna say all the things that I thought could wait 
Now I realize that later could be a little too late Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow 
Live for every moment 
Laugh at least a little everyday 
If we see the sun rise in the morning 
Is impossible to say So let's love like there's no tomorrow 
Today From now on on every time we kiss 
It's gonna mean 
So much more when I touch your lips When I give myself to you 
Baby I won't hold nothin' back 
Cause there's nothin' I wouldn't give 
To make every minute last Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow 
Live for every moment 
Laugh at least a little everyday 
If we see the sun rise in the morning 
Is impossible to say So let's love like there's no tomorrow 
Today Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow 
Live for every moment 
Laugh alittle everyday 
If we see the sun rise in the morning 
Is impossible to say So let's love like there's no tomorrow 
Today
