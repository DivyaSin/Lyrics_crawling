The day, the night, to me are just the same 
I see your face, it burns me like a flame 
And there's something I've got to say 
Yes it's making me feel this way 
Don't you know that I'm going crazy 
Over you One look, a smile, is all you've got to do 
I see your face in everything I do And there's something I've got to say 
Yes it's making me feel this way 
Don't you know that I'm going crazy 
Over you
