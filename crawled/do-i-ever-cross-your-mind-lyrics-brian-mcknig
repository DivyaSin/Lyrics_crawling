I can't remember why we fell apart 
From something that was so meant to be 
Forever was the promise in our hearts 
Now more and more I wonder where you are Do I ever cross your mind? 
(Anytime) 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? 
Do I ever cross your mind? 
(Anytime) 
I miss you Still have your picture in a frame 
I hear your footsteps down the hall 
I swear I hear your voice, driving me insane 
How I wish that you would call to say Do I ever cross your mind? 
(Anytime) 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? 
Do I ever cross your mind? 
(Anytime) 
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you No more loneliness and heartache 
No more crying myself to sleep 
No more wondering about tomorrow 
Won't you come back to me? 
(Come back to me) 
Ooh woo ooo Do I ever cross your mind? 
(Anytime) 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? 
Do I ever cross your mind? 
(Anytime) 
I miss you Do I ever cross your mind? 
(Anytime) 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? 
Do I ever cross your mind? 
(Anytime) 
I miss you
