Gonna take a long time to get over you 
Love's poison addiction offers me no rescue 
Gonna be a hard road back to where I started from 
'Cause you touched the deepest part of me and filled me 
With your song 
And I sang along I believe in you and what you gotta do 
But what you're goin' through is poison, 
Poison to the two of us 
Used to stand so tall 
'Til I took the fall, greatest fall of all 
Was when I fell for you Our cloudy skies held lonely forms 
Your anger familiar thick as air before a storm 
Now lookin' back I know the truth was plain to see 
I built my world around you 'cause I 
I needed to believe 
And I still believe Time and time again we tried so hard to win 
But the pleasures of a foolish paradise 
Is nothing but a sin
