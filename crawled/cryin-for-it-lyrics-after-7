The first time that I saw you, I knew I would fall in love 
You filled an empty space in my heart 
And that was rather special 'cause I never thought someone 
Could make me fall in love from the start Girl, you know the second time I saw you 
I knew that I had been wooed, I could not get you out of my mind 
And ever since that moment girl, I haven't been much good 
I won't rest until I know that you're mine, oh mine, oh mine Don't you hear me cryin for it? 
Don't you see my heart's on fire? 
Don't you feel me dyin' for it? 
Give me my heart's desire The first time that I saw you, I knew that you were the one 
You were everything a man could desire 
And I've always been the kinda man to get just what he wants 
So please, don't make me out as a liar The second time I saw you, I just had to have you girl 
I'd never seen someone look so good 
And ever since that day, I just haven't been the same 
I want you girl and I want that understood Don't you hear me cryin for it? 
Don't you see my heart's on fire? 
Don't you feel me dyin' for it? 
Give me my heart's desire Don't you hear me cryin for it? 
Don't you see my heart's on fire? 
Don't you feel me dyin' for it? 
Give me my heart's desire And I won't be any good if I can't have you now 
If there's any way you could, come to me now 
I'd give you anything and I do mean everything 
And that means anything that your heart desires 
Oh baby, baby Don't you hear me cryin for it? 
Don't you see my heart's on fire? 
Don't you feel me dyin' for it? 
Give me my heart's desire Don't you hear me cryin for it? 
Don't you see my heart's on fire? 
Don't you feel me dyin' for it? 
Give me my heart's desire
