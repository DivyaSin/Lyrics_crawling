When I lay it all out on the table 
Don't know what is stopping me 
From feeling like I might be able 
To enjoy my own company 
Sitting up by my window 
Watching the summer rain 
The world is moving faster 
Than I am in it today Knockdown 
Everybody in the place say what now 
Ya souls feeling shot down 
Lucks out 
But ya gotta carry on 
Speed it up now 
Woo Woo Woo Woo 
Knockdown 
Everybody in the place say what now 
Ya souls feeling shot down 
Lucks out 
But ya gotta carry on 
Speed it up now Oh yeah I got the feeling 
That something could happen now 
Oh I got the feeling 
That something could happen inside my life now 
And have you ever asked why you've been here before 
Cos only you have the power to carry on through that door Knockdown 
Everybody in the place say what now 
Ya souls feeling shot down 
Lucks out 
But ya gotta carry on 
Speed it up now 
Woo Woo Woo Woo 
Knockdown 
Everybody in the place say what now 
Ya souls feeling shot down 
Lucks out 
But ya gotta carry on 
Speed it up now
