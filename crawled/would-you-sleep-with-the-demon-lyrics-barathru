World of mortals ! 
World of demons ! 
Bless the fire ! 
Bless the demon's fire ! 
Look to the sky ! 
And what do you find ? 
A god that rules in a grace of lies ! Chourse : A demon's heart in a world thats black ! A forest in satan that evil as me ! With Demons flying around the beast ! Would you ever sleep with a demon tell me ! A god of lies ! 
A god of fire ! 
Demons serve me well ! 
Become my friend ! 
Fill my enemys heart with shame ! 
With poison that will make theme die in pain ! (Chourse Again) Would you ever sleep with a demon ? Would you ever be its friend ? Would you serve it well ? Or would you be the one that reigns in hell ? (Chourse Again)
