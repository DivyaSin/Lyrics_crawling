A weeping procession moving through the snow 
Silent pale faces, perceptible pain 
Winter silence, terrible tranquility 
Cold eyes starin' far away Mirrors of mourning, nothing else 
Blinded by grief they are everyone 
Awaitin' your final way, watchin' the frozen pit 
And see we've lost reality Mirrors of mourning, nothing else 
Blinded by grief they are everyone 
Awaitin' your final way, watchin' the frozen pit 
And see we've lost reality A field of crystal tears 
The downfall of Heaven, snow softly falls 
Frozen tears from above 
This bitter loss, an angel's funeral A casket filled with beloved flesh 
Cold as the world around 
I can't believe what my eyes see 
Through clouds of icy breath No bird sings in dead trees 
No sound fills the frozen air 
I stand at the angel's tomb alone 
A whole world ending to exist Mirrors of mourning, nothing else 
Blinded by grief they are everyone 
Awaitin' your final way, watchin' the frozen pit 
And see we've lost reality A weeping procession moving through the snow 
Silent pale faces, perceptible pain 
Winter silence, a terrible tranquility 
Cold eyes starin' far away
