Forever alone until I found you and now you're always there 
Voice on the air, scent on my clothes 
Oh, but when the sun exposes all my demons 
Will you stay or run away? I'll help you find your way every moment you're awake 
You know I'll stay even in your dreams 
I'll pull the stars down from the heavens to fill your empty skies 
I'm yours tonight, I'm yours tonight Whenever you go they say I'm bad news when everyone agrees 
Whispers start sounding like screams 
Oh, but I know what you want to say before the words escape your teeth 
Will you trust in me? I'll help you find your way every moment you're awake 
You know I'll stay even in your dreams 
I'll pull the stars down from the heavens to fill your empty skies 
I'm yours tonight, I'm yours tonight My good intentions can leave the hardest hearts 
The harshest scars you've ever seen 
My bad impressions, they will follow me 
Makin' enemies that I can't see Forever alone till I found you 
I know that you'll stay, you won't run away I'll help you find your way every moment you're awake 
You know I'll stay even in your dreams 
I'll pull the stars down from the heavens to fill your empty skies 
I'm yours tonight I'll help you find your way every moment you're awake 
You know I'll stay even in your dreams 
I'll pull the stars down from the heavens to fill your empty skies 
I'm yours tonight, I'm yours tonight
