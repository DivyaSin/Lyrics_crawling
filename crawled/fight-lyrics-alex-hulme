In this life Your ruled by your desires 
Sell your heart your dreams to highest buyers 
Ooh when you gonna grow Bitter angry lost i know you are 
Cold as ice yet hot as summer fire 
When you gonna know That i'm not backing down 
Im through with all my doubts All i want is to be free 
Your hold on me 
Is tight but i wont give up the fight 
I wont give up the fight For too long i've given all of me 
All that i want now is to be free 
Ooh whens it gonna show That I'm not backing down 
Im through with all my doubts All I want is to be free 
Your hold on me 
Is tight but i wont give up the fight 
I wont give up the fight My fears, my dreams, my doubts, my love I won't give up the fight
