Is it my imagination 
Is there something you wanna say 
Cause it feels so strange 
When you look at me that way And I can't deny 
I see the signs 
They only point one way (chorus) 
Do you feel like lovin' me 
Don't let me hear you say 
If you feel like lovin' me 
Say it now, say it now, say my name 
Cause I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you 
So tell me you want me the way I want you Wanna feel your kiss upon my lips 
As sweet as any love 
Raining down on me 
Like honey from above, yeah And I don't know why 
But every time 
This voice inside me says (chorus) Who's walked down the mountain 
They're afraid to fall 
But with you I hear the music 
And it fills my soul I'm waiting for you 
I'm waiting for you 
I'm waiting for you (chorus ad lib) publishing : In A Bunch Music Ltd 1999
