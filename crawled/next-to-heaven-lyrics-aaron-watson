Pinch me I must be dreaming waking up with you and feeling 
The tender touch of your good morning kiss 
No where else on earth is better than being next to you 
Next to heaven, it doesnt get any better than this (Chorus) 
Next to heaven lies my fate, my best friend and my sole mate 
God knows this kind of love only comes from up above 
Youre the answer to my prayers, nothing else compare 
Im next to heaven when I am next to you You look just like an angel tangled in white satin sheets 
Lying there with your hair all in a mess 
I swear you look your best all dressed up next to nothing 
Next to heaven, it doesnt get any better than this Chorus (x3)
