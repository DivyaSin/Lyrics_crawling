Darkness fills the land 
Enshrouding us despite our last stand 
And as Fort Foreman fell 
Douglas flung open the gates of Hell 
Fleeing through the night 
Plotting our revenge to make things right 
The union was unbound 
So we delved into the underground Sirens wail 
Parapets scaled 
And so we must bail to the underground 
In chaos 
Signals crossed 
And so we disband in the underground 
In darkness 
No music 
Will play for the band in the underground 
We languish 
In anguish 
Now that we've been banned to the underground Tripping over logs 
And pursued by android robot dogs 
Fleeing hurt and lame 
Yearning to avenge this loss in George's name Barkley snarled and grinned 
Tattered bed sheets blew in the wind 
Shoelaces were undone 
As Irish devil bats blotted out the sun Fort Foreman (Alas, the Fort) could not be saved 
Now the countryside's enslaved 
And we're hunted like dogs 
Well, we have not lately shaved 
Let our tombstones be engraved 
Cuz we're hunted like dogs 
Yeah, we're hunted like dogs Android dog bit off my leg 
Now I walk upon a peg 
Waiting to hear news of my old friends Safety pot fell off my head 
Bullet grazed my ear and I bled 
Stains cast down upon my best white shirt Barkley's minions hunt me down 
As I press on from town to town 
Staying just a step ahead of death I relive the battle in my dreams 
Now I suffer from weak stream 
No more, no less the man I used to be Living off the bugs I find 
Screams of comrades in my mind 
No memory of the man I used to be Shot a demon, stubbed my toe 
Man it really hurts, you know? 
I swear that Douglas will pay for his crimes Walking down this road of sorrow 
I'll rebuild my strength tommorow 
But for now I'll just try to survive I bruised my arm and now you see 
It's hard to lay down and watch TV 
I swear that Barkley will pay for his crimes (various)
