His eyes are closed his face pale asleep 
On the ground a newspaper reads 
The blood has spilled again 
And you just dream my yellowman 
Yellowman 
The angels burn a torch to keep us warm His lungs are wide awake but he won't breathe 
He spits out the ocean and we dream 
Like goldfish in a bowl 
They think we're free 
Yellowman 
You're tying rocks to clouds to stay above the crowds 
The angels burn a torch to keep us warm the blood has spilled again and you just dream 
Yellowman 
You never see the bloodstains on the battlefield 
The angels burn a torch to keep us warm
