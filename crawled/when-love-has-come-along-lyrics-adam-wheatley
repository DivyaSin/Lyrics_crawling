Oh my Love, where have You gone 
I treated You like an alibi 
I dressed You up with empty words 
And good intentions I wore as my disguise I see my reflection in the crowd 
Brothers, sisters, and enemies 
Oh my Love, we need You now 
You gave Your life, You came to show us how I will lay me down 
Grace how sweet your sound 
Hope will find its song 
When love has come along Oh my Love, what have You done 
You gave me grace to fill my eyes 
You put Your heart within my reach 
Yeah, You put Your heart right next to me I will lay me down 
Grace how sweet your sound 
Hope will find its song 
When love has come along Love speaks louder than I can 
Love speaker louder through my hands I will lay me down 
Grace how sweet your sound 
Hope will find its song 
When love has come along
