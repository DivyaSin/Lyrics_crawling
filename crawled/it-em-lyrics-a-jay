Hit 'em 
Verse 1 
A.jay A. jay, El Kamo, Lets Go 
Some shit blowing up my mind mayne Im a pro 
I'm sick standing on my grind, I lit the dro 
I'm home livin in my zone, I need to bone or bang bleeding chicks and hoes up in my zone 
Coughing up da money like I'm rolling with a genie 
I'm rolling up a spliff and thinking how to get the lucci 
They talking bout skrilla, well I'm talking bout broccolli 
And rap is gettin dark, man its time to make it sunny 
I got this game tight, sweeter than red lips 
The name A. Jay, the mac u ain't messing with 
I got the bad bitch blushing well im fly in that outfit 
Blessed the mike with holy water acting like John the Baptist 
My name up on the list, we gotta lay the facts straight 
Stepped my foot in this game, and competition got erased 
Dem boys talking crap, cruising with all those lames 
But I'm finkin real big, doin like Alkazane 
Big dummy ass, crack fool you 
Whooping ya bloody ass, lyk rap kung fu 
Slitting ya bleeding wrists lyk sucide dudes 
Now I feel lyk I'm king jay spitin of the hook 
Still cooking up the rhymes in the rap kitchen 
You said u real, but I still believe u all fiction 
When it comes to this game, im a lyrical thug 
So rap sick u can't heal me with a miracle drug 
The haters all in hell lyk I burnt dem all 
My name going further, I just fank u lord 
Got the game so bad that I took the spot 
Im so high, I dont know what label I'm on 
I got the game so bad that I took the spot 
Im so high, I dont know what label I'm on Chorus 
A.jay 
Lyk I hit em with the mike, hit em with the bike El Kamo 
Real pissed lyk I pushed them to the side 
Cos I punch real bad lyk I hit em with the mike 
Go slooooooow, when u hit em with the mike 2x 
Cos a punch real hard might take away his life Verse 2 
El Kamo El Kamo, rise to the ranks 
Got a lot of shine, lyk I'm movin thru the mines 
Killin from the start, mayne I'm blowing up their minds 
With the A. Kay, tell a hater, this is no child play 
Killin competition, with my vision on the D-day 
MURDER, I could be doing this lyk all day 
Put me behind bars, I do it again lyk its a replay 
Burning stages, its the Kamoflage with A. Jay 
Stop trippin, message to those who wanna be me 
Recognize fact I'm the dope, whose gotta king me 
Haters strugglin, tryna make it on my team B 
And my flo, still given spin to CDs 
I got the game on another level, on trees, High 
The position that was unlikely, but I'm still placin fings right like I'm Henry 
Yeah, im on dough like a baker, I mean, I'm on stacks like a banker 
The topic for discussion lyk an issue for debators 
Still no competition lyk a camel in the deserts 
Still kill the streets with class, didn't say it, ask mercedes 
Murder everybody, that be braggin with the cities 
Takin u bak to the days like old skul 
You gonna need me real bad lyk O2 
Putting haters aways just like old tools 
When I walk out the door, u ain't got no clue Chorus 
A.jay 
Lyk I hit em with the mike, hit em with the bike El Kamo 
Real pissed lyk I pushed them to the side

Cos a punch real hard might take away his life Verse 3
