[Verse 1:] 
Yes I'm just watching my step, 
Trying not to upset you, 
And I'm just being careful, 
With everything that I say and do, 
I don't wanna do anything if it's not approved, 
Cause you're my gold and my mission, 
My every intention is you... [Chorus:] 
So what I'm gonna do is do, 
What I gotta do to please you, 
If it means giving all myself, 
I gotta do, just to get next to you, 
I gotta do... You know I need to be, 
Want to be, 
Gotta be, 
Closer to you, 
Is this what I need to do, 
I don't know how can I ever say, 
That I'll please you, 
Oh lord it's not about me no more I need to be, 
Want to be, 
Gotta be 
Closer to you 
(It's what you called me to, 
It's what you expect me to) 
I don't know exactly what 
You would do if you were in my shoes 
I'm gonna be closer to you Hmm hmmm closer to you... 
Ooh ooh 
Hmm hmmm closer to you... [Verse 2:] 
As I inch my way 
Closer to your will I can't wait 
(Noo noo) 
It seems the closer I get, 
Father you seem so far away 
(So far away) 
But I will keep pressing cause I have to, 
Crawling cause I want you 
Reaching cause I need you 
(Reaching cause I need you) 
I'm not ever gonna stop cause I love you 
(Oh lord) 
And if I had to 
I couldn't find nobody to replace you [Chorus] [Bridge:] 
Lord I can't go anywhere if you're not there 
Lord I can't speak a word if I don't hear you clear 
I'm just saying 
Lord I want be close to thee, 
Every hour, every day I need thee, 
So draw me near, near to you, 
I gotta be, 
Close to thee, 
Closer than most, 
Cause I need you, closer than close, 
Cause I need to feel you breathe on me, 
Lord, breathe... [Chorus]
