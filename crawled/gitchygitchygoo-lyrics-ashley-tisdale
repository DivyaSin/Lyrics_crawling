Ladies and Gentlemen, the Ferbettes! 
I'm Phineas and this is Ferb, and we're gonna sing a song Bow, chicka, bow-wow 
That's what my baby said 
Mow, Mow, Mow 
And my heart starts pumpin' 
Chicka, chicka, chew-wop 
Never gonna stop 
Gitchee-gitchee-goo means that I love you My baby's got her own way of talking, 
Whenever she says something sweet 
And she knows its my world she's a-rockin' 
Though my vocabulary's incomplete 
I know it may sound confusing 
Sometimes I wish she'd give it to me straight 
But I never feel like I'm losin' it (losing) 
When I take the time to translate 
Here's what I'm talkin' 'bout Bow, chicka, bow-wow 
That's what my baby said 
Mow, mow, mow, 
And my heart starts pumpin' 
Oh, Chicka, chicka, chew-wop 
Never gonna stop 
Gitchee-gitchee-goo means that I love you Well I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do) 
But I think I'm getting through (I think I'm getting through 
'Cuz when I say 'I love you' (when I say I love you) 
She says 'I gitchee-gitchee-goo you too' 
(Gitchee-gitchee-goo you too) 
(Gitchee-gitchee goo you too) 
(Gitchee-gitchee-goo you too) 
Don't need a dictionary Bow, chicka, bow-wow

And my heart starts pumpin'

Never gonna stop 
Gitchee-gitchee-goo means that I love you Bow, chicka, bow-wow
