Stupid cupid, you're a real mean guy 
I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly 
I'm in love and it's a cryin' shame 
And I know that you're the one to blame 
Hey, hey, set me free 
Stupid cupid, stop pickin' on me Can't do my homework and I can't think straight 
I meet him ev'ry mornin' 'bout a half past eight 
I'm actin'like a lovesick fool 
You even got me carry in his books to school 
Hey, hey, set me free 
Stupid cupid, stop pickin' on me You mixed me up but good, right from the very start 
Hey, go play robin hood with somebody else's heart You got me jumpin' like a crazy clown 
And I don't feature what you're puttin' down 
Since I kissed his lovin' lips of wine 
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine 
Hey, hey, set me free 
Stupid cupid, stop pickin' on me
