A Christmas tree with lights turned low 
Kids out of school, praying for snow 
It's the season for counting blessings, as the old year ends 
The crowded streets, the friendly smiles 
At Christmas, everyone's a child 
It's that precious time for family and friends From our house to yours, we send our love 
Straight from the heart, 'cause you mean so much 
From our house to yours, may everyone be blessed 
May this Christmas be the best, from our house to yours Old memories and mistletoe 
Cards signed with love, hang in a row 
That feeling of Christmas fills the air 
The manger scene, the star above 
Reminds us all, God sends His love 
May His spirit follow you throughout the year From our house to yours, we send our love 
Straight from the heart, 'cause you mean so much 
From our house to yours, may everyone be blessed 
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours 
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours 
Merry Christmas
