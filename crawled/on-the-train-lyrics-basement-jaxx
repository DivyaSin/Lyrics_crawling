City got the best of me 
Color so tight, and there's no air to breathe 
Mama gave me dancing legs 
Oh mama my, mama don't cry Sure I got short-changed 
Time I got my aim like "fuck cocaine" 
Check out the boom zoom, I aim stead 
I know you feel the same, I'm not alone [Chorus: x2] 
I'll be straight with you on the train 
They'll never believe it now, we're on our way 
I ain't goin' back again 
I need it like a hole in my vein, a hole in my vein God, he been testin' me 
He'd been down, I just need a cool breeze 
Papa gave me heart and soul 
Oh papa I, papa I try Here no one gives a damn 
Time I got my swerve I'm a reborn man 
I don't belong here, I ain't stayin' 
I know you feel the same, you're not alone [Chorus: x2] I don't belong, I got nothing to prove 
I'm on the train now, I'm making my move 
I don't belong, I got nothing to prove 
But I'm on the train now, I'm making my move Get me on the train 
Baby won't you get me on the train 
Get me on the train 
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out of here I'm on the train, I'm on the train now
