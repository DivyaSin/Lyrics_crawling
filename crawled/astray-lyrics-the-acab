I imagined a picture 
You & me, we could last forever & ever 
We're always like lovers 
But the truth has been always stranger than the fiction 
I remember the colours 
Of the rainbow we watched together, how clear 
Hoped that it'd shine forever 
But like my dreams it faded & disappeared, oh will it reappear? Let's sort this thru, it's only me & you 
Stop running away are the words you always say 
But our love has gone astray 
And in this life or another 
Are we meant for each other? I'm not so sure 
But one thing is assured I'm not running away 
Not running away 
But the games that we play & the lies that we say 
Have only lead us astray 
Did you hear what i said? 
I'm not running away...
