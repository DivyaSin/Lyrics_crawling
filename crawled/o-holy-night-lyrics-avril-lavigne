O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining 
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
Till He appeared and the soul felt His worth A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices 
For yonder beams a new and glorious morn Fall on your knees 
Oh, hear the angel voices 
O night divine 
O night when Christ was born 
O night divine 
O night, O night divine Led by the light of faith serenely beaming 
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand 
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming 
Here came the wise men from the Orient land The King of Kings lay in lowly manger 
In all our trials born to be our friend 
He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger Behold your King 
Before the lowly bend 
Behold your King 
Before Him bend Truly he taught us to love one another 
His law is love and His gospel is peace 
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother 
And in His name all oppression shall cease Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus rise we 
Let all within us praise His holy name 
Christ is the Lord then ever, ever praise we 
His pow'are and glory ever more proclaim 
His pow'are and glory ever more proclaim
