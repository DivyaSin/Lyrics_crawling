He just caught the Jamestown Ferry it's not a hot day in January 
Like he said it'd be if he ever left me 
A case of gone was all he carried as he got on the Jamestown Ferry 
And he said that gone was all he'd ever need 
I didn't think that he'd leave me after seein' how much he needs me 
But the fact still remains I'm sittin' here all alone 
Missin' a lovin' of my baby Lord it's bout to drive me crazy 
He was the sweetest piece of heaven I've ever known 
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry... 
As I walk through his kingdom of honky tonks and bars 
I remember how he'd hold me and comfort me with talk 
He didn't cuss with every breath he had a soothing Southern Drawl 
Made me feel like a lady through it all 
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry... 
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry...
