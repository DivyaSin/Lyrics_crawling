When I walk 
A thousand miles from home 
And when I've lost 
All I used to know It seems that I've got nothing left 
I find that I'm undone 
You are here to break me 
And you've only just begun With open arms 
You came running so far 
To show who you are and who I am 
Only you can change a heart 
Like a shooting star 
You soar through the darkest of nights 
To catch my eyes and guide me to the father's arms When I wonder 
Where you're leading me 
With no direction 
Walking aimlessly Still you're ever faithful 
Still you're ever strong 
Now I can call you father 
You're calling me back home With open arms 
You came running so far 
To show who you are and who I am 
Only you can change a heart 
Like a shooting star 
You soar through the darkest of nights 
To catch my eyes and guide me to the father's arms You're arms they're always wrapped around me 
You're arms they'll never cease to hold me 
Hold Me With open arms 
You came running so far 
To show who you are and who I am 
Only you can change a heart 
Like a shooting star 
You soar through the darkest of nights With open arms 
You came running so far 
To show who you are and who I am 
Only you can change a heart 
Like a shooting star 
You soar through the darkest of nights 
To catch my eyes and guide me to the father's arms
