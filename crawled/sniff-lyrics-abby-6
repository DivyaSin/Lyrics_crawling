Verse 1 
I won't lie, i can't stand for this 
i got to believe but i believe i've been missed 
it's about the line you run your mouth all night 
it's 7:30 and you don't feel quite right 
left home to be with the white ones 
daddys worried because your friends aren't the right ones 
but you've got your head 
and the music's just a toy 
tell me, tell me, where is that boy 
Chorus 1 
short story but his is of an older man 
Kinney Winney was a coker, coker smoker fan 
be he had a son, the government took him away 
a soft spot 
how much does the foster coster 
sniff, sniff, smoke, smoke 
he lost ya 
where is that boy 
Chorus 2 
sniff there goes your self esteem 
boy - there goes your self esteem 
where is that boy 
where did he go 
Repeat Verse 1 
if you won't to ride don't ride the white horse 
she likes me high, she likes me low 
she likes me where i'm going, and i'm going to show 
Chorus 2 
step off the train 
i'll go back there 
where's he at 
where is that boy
