If I Could Tell You How Much I Loved You, 
Then You Would Know I Would Never Be Without You, 
My Only Wish Is To Be There For You, 
Out After Midnight Walking In Moon light, Do you still bowl around after dark 
Blowing your hope and your smoke in the rain 
I lit a little fire off your chimney spark 
And I knew then I would never see you naked again The whole world is our playground 
The whole world is our playground 
Take the night by the hand 
And set it on fire again If I hear this song on the radio 
I swear I'll go out of my mind 
But I try not to think about you every minute or so 
But they, they... sold you as a prize The whole world is our playground 
The whole cell is our playground 
Take the night by the hand 
And set it on fire again I don't know, I don't know, I don't know 
I don't know how to begin 
This song I hide away 
But I know that you know 
And I know that you've been where I've been 
Seen what I've seen that was too far away The kitchen light is too bright 
And the light in your mind is a sin 
It's killing me everyday 
It's healing me everyday
