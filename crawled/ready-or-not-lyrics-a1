There's magic within you, 
There's magic in everything you do, 
Magic me to the place where 
Dreams come true. Sometimes I go crazy 
I get off on the crazy things you do, 
I'm jealous of every guy that 
Looks at you [Chorus] 
So tell me, 
Could you love a boy like me like me 
Tell me could you love a boy like me. Because I need you, 
You're my heart and soul. 
And I'm gonna let you know 
Ain't gonna let you go. Ready or not, here I come, 
You can't hide from me, hide and seek. 
Run away now, or stay now. 
'cause I'll keep searching 
I'll keep searching for love. Could you love a boy like me tonight, 
Come on baby won't you take a bite, The game that you're playing 
Why do you tease me like you do 
You gotta let me down 
Or see it through. You're straight from a movie, 
But baby I'm not from hollywood. 
By stealing your heart 
I'll be your robin hood. [Chorus] All: baby - you can't hide the love inside 
Searching for love 
Baby - you can't hide the love inside [Chorus] Could you love a boy 
Like me tonight, 
Come on baby won't you 
Take a bite Could you love a boy like me tonight 
Oh yeah
