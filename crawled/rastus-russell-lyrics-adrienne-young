It was down in a grove off Curlew Creek 
Mr. Brown went out on her porch to sweep 
Was the Sabbath Day, late July 
The day Mrs. Brown was bound to die Was rumor goin round about money hid 
Not many believed it but Rastus did 
All he had in his hand was a Barlow knife 
Yeah thats what he used to take the first two lives They found the Browns tied to their bed 
When the Crumbs drove up 
The Browns were dead 
Old Rastus said hello with a loaded shotgun 
Never gave the Crumbs a chance to turn and run Rastus Russell born of bad blood 
Raised on misery, murder, and mud 
Only good thing in this whole song 
Is Rastus Russell is a dead and gone Well Sheriff Ted Tucker saw the mob on the street 
Radioed every cop on the beat 
Said no warnings given no questions asked 
Just find this Rastus and find him fast The hounds led em down to the old causeway 
Found him fishing in Dunedin Bay 
Took three strong men to reel him in 
And a fourth to finally put the cuffs on him Rastus Russell born of bad blood 
Raised on misery, murder, and mud 
Only good thing in this whole song 
Is Rastus Russell is a dead and gone Nobodyd every broke out of that Clearwater jail 
Oh but Rastus did and left a bloody trail 
There were red hand prints on a stolen truck 
Yeah Rastus was runnin out of luck Some kind wont stop at anything 
He was diggin up his mama for her diamond ring 
In the graveyard there they laid him low 
And thats a fittin end to this trail of woe Rastus Russell born of bad blood 
Raised on misery, murder, and mud 
Only good thing in this whole song 
Is Rastus Russell is a dead and gone
