Well, some folks like to get away 
Take a holiday from the neighborhood 
Hop a flight to Miami beach or to Hollywood But I'm takin' a greyhound 
On the Hudson river line 
I'm in a New York state of mind I've seen all those movie stars 
And their fancy cars and their limousines 
I've been high in the rockies, under the evergreens oh oh But I know what I'm needin' 
And I don't want to waste more time 
I'm in a new york state of mind oh oh It was so easy livin' day by day 
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues (oh with the rhythm and blues) 
But now I need a little give and take (give and take) 
New York times (and the daily news), the daily news oh oh Comes down to reality 
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide 
I don't care if it's Chinatown (or up on riverside) or up on riverside I don't have any reasons 
'Cause I left them all behind 
We're in a New York state of mind 
Get a New York state of mind It was so easy livin' day by day 
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues (with the rhythm and blues) 
But now I need a little give and take 
The New York times (the daily news) (helps you lose your blues) Comes down to reality 
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide 
I don't care if it's Chinatown or up on riverside (or up on riverside) We don't have any reasons 
We've left them all behind 
I'm in a New York, 
I'm in a New York state of 
We're in a New York state of mind
