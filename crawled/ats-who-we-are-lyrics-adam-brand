Little Brodie Williams plays with little Jimmy Lee 
One comes from Horsham 
One lives down by the sea 
One'll go to uni 
One'll stay on the land 
'Cause we sure need more doctors 
And we sure need the working man 'Cause that's who we are 
That's who we are His papa was Italian 
Came out in '53 
His mother came from Poland 
You should see the family tree 
Fell in love with an angel 
From the land of the rising sun 
He loves his country music 
Cold beers and having fun When the world falls down around you 
And you're feeling two foot tall 
Hold your head up high and proud 
When your backs against the wall 
And show 'em who you are
