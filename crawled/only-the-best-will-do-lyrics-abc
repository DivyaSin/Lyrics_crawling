Elegant faces 
Won`t you stand aside 
I`m only looking for the real ride 
Now`s not the time 
To run away and hide * I`ve got no time for fakers 
Only the best will do 
Looking through my eyes, baby 
It`s such a spectacular view 
Now that these times are changing 
Only the best will do Pale imitations 
Will fade away 
People are talking 
With nothing to say 
I wouldn`t let anyone 
Talk to me that way (* repeat) 
You 
** Ain`t that peculiar 
Neptune`s your ruler 
Awake from your slumber 
Give me your number 
How candid the camera 
That captures the best of you 
Only the best will do (* repeat) 
Only the best will do 
(repeat with following) (** repeat) 
Only the best will do
