What have you done Look at what you've done Screaming words of venom right in your daughters face Take the time to show her that all her thoughts were wrong Shape her in your image just as somebody did to you And if this is how you do it right in front of me-I cannot imange what must go down at home Never got a chance that kid was doomed right at the gate I stand and watch you ruin that poor little girl in the middle of the street And since I cant put a bullet right in your hateful face I turn my back and walk away and hope there is a hell Soon shell know how to use words that cripple like a gun What have you done?
