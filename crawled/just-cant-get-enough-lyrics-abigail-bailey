I just can't get enough 
It's the feeling that I love 
I just can't get enough 
It's the feeling that I love... (Intoxicating) 
I just can't get enough 
(Exhilarating) 
It's the feeling that I love 
(Intoxicating) 
I just can't get enough 
(Exhilarating) 
It's the feeling that I love I've never felt, like this before 
I've never wanted, lovin' more 
I've waited all my life for this 
A simple sign, or a little kiss 
I just want to say I need you 
And it feels good when I'm with you 
Can't you see 
I Just can't get enough 
It's the feeling that I love You make me feel so secure 
It's all I ever, asked you for 
I've waited since a child for this 
A simple life with little things 
I just want to say I need you 
And it feels true when I'm near you 
Can't you see 
I Just can't get enough 
It's the feeling that I love
