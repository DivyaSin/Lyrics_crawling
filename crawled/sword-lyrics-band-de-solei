Your name 
A night without end 
I pray the Lord is keeping 
Two doors 
You stand or you sleep 
I'm still waiting for you to come in 
I can remember 
Your eyes shining 
I hold a handful 
Of your ashes How can you leave me here to 
Dig your grave 
And bury my fear 
Your voice keeps calling to me 
Dig your grave but 
Don't disappear Goodbye 
A sword double-edged 
Swallow and 
I'll stop beating 
Two doors 
You stand or you sleep 
I'm still waiting for you to walk in 
I can remember your eyes shining 
I hold a handful of your ashes How can you leave me here to 
Dig your grave 
And bury my fear 
Your voice keeps calling to me 
Dig your grave but 
Don't disappear 
Shine on 
Shine on 
Shine on
