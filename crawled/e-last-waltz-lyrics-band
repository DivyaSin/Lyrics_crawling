She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi 
Holding a lantern light 
Waitin' for a man who's a riverboat gambler 
He said he'd return tonight They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi 
[Unintelligible; doesn't sound like "Loving"] the whole night through 
The riverboat gambler went off to make a killin' 
And bring it on back to you 
Evangeline, Evangeline, curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen 
That pulled her man away Now, Bayou Sam from South Louisiana 
Had gamblin' in his veins 
And Mama Moo (??) who loves only you 
Why do ya cause her such pain? She went to the top of Hickory Hill 
Stand in the lightnin' and thunder 
Riverboat, it was sinkin?She watched that boat go under 
Evangeline, Evangeline, curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen 
That pulled her man away
