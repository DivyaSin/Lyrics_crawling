[Intro] 
Is this guy serious? Is this guy serious or what? [Hook] 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags [Verse 1] 
Let it out, let it out, let it out 
Boy, what you crying about? 
Every boy got a problem with me 
Don't see things how I see 
I don't know what they asking of us 
Everyone got a question for us 
Can they give a nigga privacy? 
What is that? Where is he? Who is she? 
Where is that? Who is he? What is she? 
Who is that? What is he? Where is she? [Hook] 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags [Verse 2] 
Twenty bags, what it cost to start 
Twenty bags, said this one is gonna flop 
Twenty bags, everyone gonna see 
Twenty bags, don't send for me 
Twenty bags, got me up in the sky 
Twenty bags, got me higher than a kite 
Twenty bags, got me crying inside 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty bags, twenty bags, twenty bags 
Twenty, I don't know what you asking of me 
Caught a nigga going crazy 
Get these white girls out of my home [Instrumental Break] 
The kush rolled in, I'm dead 
Pour some liquor on my head 
Easy, easy 
Pour some liquor on my head 
Easy, easy [Outro: Sample]
