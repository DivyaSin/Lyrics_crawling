You 
You said you'd come around 
Silk stockings can't be found 
On my floor no more 
You 
You're the one I want to see 
You could make me happy 
If you'd come and live with me 
I don't even know that much about losing 
I've had some bad times 
I've had some good times 
I've done ok You could take it all from me if you wanted 
And I'm sure that you'd agree 
Well, I hope that you'd agree 
You 
You opened up my mind 
I'm standing in the rain 
Feeling alright 
You 
You put a grin across my face 
I love the way you taste 
I really want you babe I don't even know that much about you 
You've got that magic touch 
You've really got it down 
I don't even see your face when I want you 
But I hear you come around 
Well, I know you come around 
Oh, babe I want you 
Yeah, yeah yeah ohhhh 
How I want you I don't even know that much about losing 
But you've got that magic touch 
You really got it down 
I don't even see your face when I want you 
But I hope you come around 
Well, I know you come around 
You 
You said you'd come around 
Silk stockings can't be found 
On my floor no more
