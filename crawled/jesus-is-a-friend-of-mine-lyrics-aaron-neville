Jesus is a friend of mine 
He saved my soul 
Renewed my mind 
Jesus is a friend of mine 
Every body say ah oop! When I am weak he makes me strong 
He is my shelter 
In the time of storm 
When I am weak he makes me strong 
Everybody say ah oop! He will never let me down 
He is the best thing 
I've ever found 
He will never let me down A friend of mine (follow director)
