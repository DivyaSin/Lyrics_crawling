It's on fire tonight 
What we gonna do tonight? 
What we gonna do tonight? 
What we gonna do tonight? You know what happened when your girl go wild 
She pop up a month later up on 'Girls Gon' wild' 
Say cheese you on 'Candid Camera' 
And your birthday's soon like a go-go dancer Ain't nothin' funny I ain't Jo-Jo dancin' 
E Ness, puff l's like I promote cancer 
Ain't I ain't gotta kick a pick-up line 
I'm a pimp so you can kiss where the sun don't shine I pull up in that platinum buggy 
Club high-acting lovely 
In the spot where it's packed and jumping 
You can catch me at the cut tryin' to rap the yucky Sticky icky stuff, holla at ya youngin' 
Whoo whoo, I'm back on if the macks on it 
Girls like to touch and put they mack on me 
I don't want to be a man, I'm in the one-night stands 
You know doing it big and straight ballin', eh Is more room in the VIP 
You can come take a seat by me 
(What we gonna do tonight?) 
Get it poppin', makin' a love scene 
Plenty room in the Limousine 
(What we gonna do tonight?) Baby girl, leave it up to me 
I wanna bite through your panty string 
(What we gonna do tonight?) 
'Cause I got sexy things I wanna do 
That'll get you in the mood indeed 
(What we gonna do tonight?) Throat-deep to the club, my truck is packed 
If there ain't enough room lap it up in the back 
Soak through the block, pull up in the parking lot 
We all smell like weed, 'cause we spark a lot Table reserved, chicks stand up when they see me 
Lag down the way to get an apple Martini 
All-night stuntin' doin' it up 
A bunch of best-dye bitches with big-ass butts Could it be the snake skins with gators 
Or throw-back Raiders? 
Every moment is a Kodak for the word 
But tonight I'm no mack when it comes to girl 
The human spatula is attached to her I snatch the uh, pull her real close to the fur 
Gave her a bottle of Chrys, fuck a plastic cup 
Let me know if we gonna bump with ya sassy self 
'Cause the Don got ass to touch holla back Is more room in the VIP 
You can come take a seat by me 
(What we gonna do tonight?) 
Get it poppin', makin' a love scene 
Plenty room in the Limousine 
(What we gonna do tonight?) Baby girl, leave it up to me 
I wanna bite through your panty string 
(What we gonna do tonight?) 
'Cause I got sexy things I wanna do 
That'll get you in the mood indeed 
(What we gonna do tonight?) Is more room in the VIP
