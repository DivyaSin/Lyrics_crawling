You're walking dately and when you hold me this way 
Something tells me you're more than a friend cause I can hear music play 
Maybe in the midnight hours a miracle mighty covers 
You just might fall in love with me and hear the song that you've never heard 
You'll hear the music of love I'll sing it to you every morning and night 
As long as I'm living you'll hear the music of love coming out of your heart 
You'll know I could it play 
And you'll know that I'm in it for you love me and you love 
And the music you'll hear with your heart don't you hear it's the music of love We were never strangers I knew I'd meet you someday 
I knew I'd find somebody like you and now you won't get away 
Can't you feel our hearts beat in two-part harmony 
All through the night the music you'll hear is love's old melody 
You'll hear the music of love... 
It's the music of love it's the music of love the music of love
