Down, down, down, down [repeat] 
Look what you're doing to me 
'Cause I don't want you to leave 
Wish I could stop you somehow 
But you're out of plain now I want you please to come back to me 
(Back to me) 
I need you with me to make it 
(I need you with me to) 
If this is how it's meant to be, boy 
Then I just can't take it [Chorus] 
I'm so down 
When I'm not around you 
(When I'm not around you, baby) 
I'm so down I feel so blue 
When I can't see you 
(When I can't see you) I've got this feeling in me 
And I just can't seem to breathe 
As I look up in the sky 
You never say goodbye I want you please to come back to me 
(Back to me) 
I need you with me to make it 
(I need you with me to) 
If this is how it's meant to be, boy 
Then I just can't take it [Chorus] Why do you hurt me so much, boy? 
You make me feel down 
But I'm hurting and hoping and praying 
That you'll still be around [Chorus]
