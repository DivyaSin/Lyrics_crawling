Not too long ago you said to me 
I believe it's time you set me free 
'Cause I found a woman who knows how to love me right 
And she don't mind if I lay out all night And you said hallelujah this woman sure gets to ya 
I fin'lly found peace of mind 
A singing hallelujah you don't know what good it'll do ya 
Playin' around with love'll do it everytime But then one day she felt like movin' on 
One goodbye and you were all alone 
And it's funny but I could almost hear the sound 
When your whole world came tumblin' to the ground And I said hallelujah that woman socked it to ya 
Just walked away and blew your mind 
A singing hallelujah you've got what's comin' ya 
Playin' around with love'll do it everytime
