Look how the sky's all si-ilver 
Beautiful Montreal 
Out of the sky of si-ilver 
Snowflakes begin to fa-all 
I sit by my wi-indow 
I take my pen in hand 
If I sound a little wi-intry 
You'll have to understand 
So how is California 
How is the weather there 
Where everyday is su-unny 
And where all the skies are fair-air 
Tell me do you reme-ember 
How once upon a time 
We'd sit and watch the snow-ow fall 
Sharing a glass of wine 
Oh that sa-ad old wintry fee-eeling 
I don't really see-eem to mind 
Sad but sweet old wintry fee-eeling 
Oh that wintry fee-eeling 
Somehow it just seems to suit me fine 
If you are never co-old love 
Then who's going to keep you warm 
You'll take the sun for granted love 
If you run from every stor-orm 
But Lord, me and this old guitar 
We've seen a storm or two 
We've seen a million drifters 
These snowflakes and you 
Oh that sad old wintry fee-eeling 
I don't really see-eem to mind 
Sad but sweet old wintry fee-eeling 
Oh that wintry feeling 
Somehow it just seems to sui-uit me fine 
Oh that sad old wintry fee-eeling 
I don't really see-eem to mind
