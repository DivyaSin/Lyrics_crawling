Yeah, that feels sexy right there 
Feel us on this one 
B. McKnight with Tim and Bob 
This is not another love song See, I know what you're thinking 
You're feelin' like a lucky guy 
I was the same way 
'Cause she was hard to come by 
I was on her so hard 
That I almost lost the pussy 
Go head, playboy, do your thing 
Don't be mad if she calls my name [Chorus] 
Walkin' 'round, sportin' her, holdin' her hand 
Doin' it big like you're the man 
But she was my girl 
She used to be my girl 
I must admit that she's a ten 
Bet she didn't tell you 'bout way back then 
When she was my girl 
She used to be my girl See, I know how you're feelin' 
I used to be in your shoes 
So calm down with the attitude 
You just done met somebody new 
You never know how much she's feelin' you 
So be happy that you got her 
Don't know much about you, dude 
Sorry, I gotta break the news She's still thinkin' 'bout me 
And I'll tell you why 
She couldn't even hold her head up when y'all walked by 
Well 
Don't go hatin' on me 
It's just a game 
You want her, you got her 
Take her, you got her 
To me it's all the same [Chorus x 2] Erotic, exotic, you must admit she's got it 
Sexy with talent, built like a stallion 
You got her, so flaunt her 
Know everybody wants her 
'Cause you might not be the only 
So never leave her lonely (She's still thinkin' 'bout me) 
She's still thinkin' 'bout me 
(And looky here) 
And I'll tell you why 
She couldn't even hold her head up when y'all walked by 
Well 
Don't go hatin' on me 
It's just a game 
You want her, you got her 
Take her, you got her 
To me it's all the same [Chorus] She used to be down with me 
She used to be a freak for me 
We used to hold hands 
She used to understand 
She used to get down with me 
She used to take trips with me 
She used to wiggle her hips for me 
She used to lick her lips for me 
She used to... 
She used to... 
She used to... 
She used to... 
She used to be my girl 
She used to be my girl 
She used to be my girl Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Used to be my girl 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Used to be my girl 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Used to be my girl 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Used to be my girl
