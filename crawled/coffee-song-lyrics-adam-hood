She came from the middle of nowhere 
A sleepy Pennsylvania town 
Her mother held her guilty for so long 
She finally put those burdens down 
He spent his whole life on city fare 
His window played the evening sun 
Its hard to believe for a strong man 
He sure was a lonely one She took the morning shift downtown 
Strange to be his favorite place 
After every single customer was cruel enough 
He was the only one to smile and say Thank you for the coffee 
A simple conversation 
Thank you for the light shining in your eyes 
Its taken such a long time to find someone to talk to 
I know it aint much but thank you for your time Its hard to find a kindred soul 
People are so unkind 
Little things can drive you crazy 
And stay locked away in your mind 
And so they say that.Frankie and Johnny were lovers 
Just like Romeo and Juliet 
Time never listens to fairy tales 
And so love had met the bitter end He went back to his city life 
Pennsylvania call her name 
You keep on living and trying to find 
Someone with the time to say Thank you for the coffee 
A simple conversation 
Thank you for the light shining in your eyes 
Its taken such a long time to find someone to talk to 
I know it aint much but thank you for your time
