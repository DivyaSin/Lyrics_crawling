My house is burning, walls are falling apart, 
desolation, and I'm a fool, I'm not gonna 
escape from flames. And why!!! 
The ground scalds and I'm a blockhead 
I'm gonna shout: Help!! 
Breath of the beast on my back 
I'm not gonna shout: help!!! 
And palace cracks, full of suckers 
I'm proposing linch law, a linch law. 
Hell it is a place on earth (x2) 
Vodka grows dear, russian mafia 
clergly irritate me... 
Texcollectors pursue me and I'm a fool 
I'm not gonna hide anywhere, anywhere 
And Belveder cracks, full of suckers... 
Hell it is a place on earth (x4) 
It is a place on earth.
