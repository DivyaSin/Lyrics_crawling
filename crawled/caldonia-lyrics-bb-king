Hey, I'm walking with my woman 
She got great big feet 
Long, lean and angry 
She ain't had nothing to eat 
But she's my woman 
And I love her just the same 
She's a fine looking woman 
And Caldonia is her name 
Now here we go Caldonia Caldonia 
What makes your big head so hard? 
I love her 
Yeah, I love her just the same 
Give me that now 
I'm crazy about the woman 
'Cause caldonia is her name 
Can we do it once more? Caldonia Caldonia 
What makes your big head so hard, oh Caldonia Caldonia Caldonia
