Monday mornin' as I lie awake 
A Starman fell from outer space 
Evil watchin me, was it all a dream 
Hello Boy, you're going insane 
One day we will tolarate the pain 
I'll be here to entertain 
There go all the freaks, they're crowdin' up on the streets 
Paranoid in so many ways *You're the devil in me, I know man, it's true 
I never wanted to be, I'm nobody's fool **Manhattan Martian 
Psycho Kid came down to die and blow us all away 
Manhattan Martian oh oh oh 
One day we will wake up the same 
Then grow old and fade away 
Aliens and me linin' up to see 
Everybody going insane *Repeat **Repeat Twice He plays a Chrome Guitar 
Boy you're gonna be a star 
With your guardian angel watching you 
There's nothing you can't do Manhattan Martian 
Psycho Kid came down to die and blow us all away 
Manhattan Martian
