Check this out 
And a five, six, seven, eight 
Well I never meant to be the greatest 
I only ever wanted to be your baby 
Not a stuck piece in your heart 
Don't ever let me go 
Go anywhere Should I stay, stay away 
I know you been out there tryin' to be my baby 
But God help us, help us all 
Don't ever let me down 
Go ahead and do with it Oh damn, uh huh 
Alright, uh huh, uh huh I stayed, stayed away 
I know you ain't out there tryin' to be my baby 
Dried up, ugly in your soul 
Don't ever let me go 
I can be your one and only
