I'm gonna give 'em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor, 
Like an outlaws boys on the day before. 
Got the pretty girls out there begging for more, 
Gotta give 'em all what they came here for. Doin' my thing singing my song, 
Right on track I'm chugging along. 
I'm here and gone like yesterday, 
Rolling like an old freight train. 
On a wing and a prayer in a glorified greyhound bus, 
Flying down the road running 9-0 and kicking up dust. 
Drinkin' truck stop coffee 
Countin' birds on those telephone wires. Burnin' the midnight oil 
And the tread off these Old Goodyear tires. 
I'm gonna give 'em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor, 
Like an outlaws boys on the day before. Got the pretty girls out there begging for more, 
Gotta give em all what they came here for. 
Doin' my thing singing my song, 
Right on track I'm chugging along. I'm here and gone like yesterday 
Rolling like an old freight train. 
And sometimes my mind is a million miles away, 
I know you're sound asleep at home while I'm on this stage. And I'm missing you 
Wishing I was kissing you everyday. 
But girl I gotta keep rollin', 
Rollin' like an old freight train. And it's a mighty lonesome sound 
When there's not soul around 
To help you ease your pain, 
But you gotta keep rollin'. 
Rollin' like an old freight train. I'm gonna give 'em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor, 
Like an outlaws boys on the day before. 
Got the pretty girls out there begging for more, 
Gotta give 'em all what they came here for. 
Doin' my thing singing my song, 
Right on track I'm chugging along. 
I'm here and gone like yesterday, Rolling like an old freight train, 
Comin' on down the line 
Feel that diesel engine whine 
Smell the smoke stack, hear the gears grind 
Full steam ahead halfway out of my mind 
I'm too far gone to be turning back going 
Clickity clack down the railroad tracks. 
I'm here and gone like yesterday Rolling like an old freight train 
Just like an old freight train. 
Tell me do you wanna ride this train.
