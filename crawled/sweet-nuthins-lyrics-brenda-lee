My baby whispers in my ear 
Mm, Mm, sweet nothings 
He knows the things I like to hear 
Mm, Mm, sweet nothings Things he wouldn't tell nobody else 
Secrets, baby 
I keep them to myself 
Sweet nothings Mm, Mm sweet nothings We walk along hand in hand 
Mm, Mm, sweet nothings 
Yeah, we both understand 
Mm, Mm, sweet nothings 
Sittin' in class or trying to read my book 
My baby, give me that special look 
Sweet nothings Mm, Mm, sweet nothings I'm sitting on my front porch 
Mm, Mm sweet nothings 
Well, do I love you? Of course 
Mm, Mm, sweet nothings 
Mama turned on the front porch light 
And said "Come in darling 
That's enough for tonight" 
Sweet nothings 
Mm, Mm, sweet nothings 
Sweet nothings 
Mm, Mm, sweet nothings 
Sweet nothings
