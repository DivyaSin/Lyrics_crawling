I thought you knew you were mine 
The other night, we sealed our fate in the bed we made 
Couldn't read your mind 
All laid out; a picture of you 
On your bed there was a spread of all you've read 
The poison of truth All the movies and CDs stare at me 
A wall of your life 
And now you're telling me that what you need 
Is so very different from what I am And now you will not stay 
No matter if I should say 
That when I slept breathing the nape of your neck 
It was the only time I felt awake All your tears are sweet like saline 
They streak your face but can't displace all your grace 
You float like a queen All the words we have heard are so absurb 
But I think you believe just a bit 
In love's receipe, there's no guarantee and the warranty 
Expires as soon as you stray And now you will not stay 
No matter if I should say 
That I hoped you'd be the one I would hold 
As we laid and watched each other grow old 
Now my love will be buried untold 
Because I can't let it go
