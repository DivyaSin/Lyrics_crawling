The bloodline traces back to the past from 
Whence the first real Christians came. The 
Racist procreation remains in every God-damned 
rally, riot and rage. Eternal damnation divided by 
nation, fighting for land, language and souls. A 
kick to the face of pride... leave hypnotic control 
behind, how is it that even now, to this day, 
This potion we're born with still runs through 
Our veins? Brainwash young minds - They will learn what 
you teach; practice what you preach. Brainwash 
young minds - breed corruption. Didn't you expect when you built your 
Empire on pillars of cadavers (genocide yields power - 
you built your empire on murder) that it would 
corrode with time? Say, how do you justify systematic eradication 
of the diversity, the foundation, of all humanity? 
Say how do you justify putting words in my 
mouth, blood on my hands, hate in my heart?

An insult to all those who've died 
To all those who've died

Towering over me. 
I lock eyes with the black monolith 
In my reflection I see our 
Name printed far too many times, over and over 
Again. You cannot know the warm toveh of the 
vengeance that calls without the sting of the 
Betrayal that afflicts us all.
