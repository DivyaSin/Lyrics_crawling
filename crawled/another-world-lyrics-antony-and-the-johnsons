I need another place 
Will there be peace 
I need another world 
This one's nearly gone 
Still have to many dreams 
Never seen the light 
I need another world 
A place where I can go 
I'm gonna miss the sea 
I'm gonna miss the snow 
I'm gonna miss the bees 
I miss the things that grow 
I'm gonna miss the trees 
I'm gonna miss the sun 
I miss the animals 
I'm gonna miss you all 
I need another place 
Will there be peace 
I need another world 
This one's nearly gone 
I'm gonna miss the birds 
Singing all there songs 
I'm gonna miss the wind 
Been kissing me so long 
Another world 
Another world 
Another world 
Another world
