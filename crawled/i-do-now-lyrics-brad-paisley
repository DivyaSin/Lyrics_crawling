I never knew how people wound up in a bar 
In the middle of the day 
Broken souls with broken lives 
From the choices that they made 
I didn't know how much I had to lose 
When I threw it all away But I do now, I do now 
Oh, I'd give anything 
If I could just go back in time somehow I wouldn't break your heart 
I wouldn't break those vows 
If I could lift that veil and look you in the eye 
And say I do now Standing before God and all our friends 
In that little church 
Barely listening to a thing that preacher said 
Just repeating every word 
I didn't have a clue what it all meant 
But girl, for what it's worth I do now, I do now 
Oh, I'd give anything 
If I could just go back in time somehow I wouldn't break your heart 
I wouldn't break those vows 
If I could lift that veil and look you in the eye 
And say I do now I wouldn't break your heart 
I wouldn't break those vows 
If I could lift that veil and look you in the eye 
And say I do now
