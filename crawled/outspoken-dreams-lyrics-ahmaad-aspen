Outspoken Dreams 
I here in the night 
Lost lonely love 
Don't be afraid The towers are there 
You will find a way 
Outspoken dreams 
Don't be afraid Just let me come in 
And ease your pain 
The night's are so cold 
The day's are rough [Chorus] 
I've found my outspoken 
I've come this far 
There's no return 
My outspoken dream Shall be no more 
I came this far to close the door 
My outspoken dream in that door 
Don't let it out or there will be no more. The settlers have touch me 
Kick me out of there door 
To fight my own battles 
I'll retake the war [Chorus] 
With my outspoken dreams 
I've made it this far 
There will be no return 
From the land I hail from In my outspoken dreamland 
There is no war, the fighting is over 
My dream put to rest 
The tears flow on down. My outspoken dream (Is Crushed) 
My outspoken dream (Was Demolished) 
My outspoken dream (Has left) 
My outspoken dream is 
Gone.
