That's the place that you ruined, you fool 
What do you mean? 
That's the world you destroyed with your greed 
It wasn't my fault, I couldn't have known Don't you remember what happened back then? 
When we, even we dared to walk among men? 
When even a Phantom could dream 
His dark dreams once again
