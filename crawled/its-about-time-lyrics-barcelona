One more day down these stairs 
His room is cold now and it hurts like hell 
He holds tight, he stares 
It's almost over and it's running through his head 
They don't know me, 
They don't know more than I show She's walking up to him so slowly 
It's about time, it's about time to fly away but wait 
This one is different 'cause she's lonely 
Fold your wings, you'll need them more one day One more smile, one more bed 
Her eyes are dark now and they hurt like hell 
She's so still, she's dead 
She knows it's over, she holds her head and says 
They can't love me, 
They can't love what I don't show He's walking up to her so slowly 
It's about time, it's about time to fly away but wait 
This one is different 'cause he's lonely 
Fold your wings, you'll need them more There have been too many times 
When I've drowned you with these perfect lines 
And you've heard me say that I can cure you 
This morning I woke up with this overwhelming fear of love 
And I'm not sure if I can resurrect you Now I'm walking up to you so slowly 
It's about time, it's about time to fly away but wait 
I swear it's different 'cause I'm lonely 
Fold your wings, you'll need them more one day
