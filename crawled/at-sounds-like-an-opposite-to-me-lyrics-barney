Well, it's getting late, we better start heading home now 
Baby Bop, will you turn off the lights as we leave? Turn on the lights? 
Turn off the lights 
Turn on the lights? Oy, oy, oy, sissy 
Barney said, "Turn off the lights" 
That's the opposite of 'On' 
What's an opposite? Bouncing a ball, bouncing a ball 
What does it do? Let's see 
It goes up, down, up, down 
That sounds like an opposite to me! There is a door, there is a door 
What does it do? Let's see 
It goes open, close, open, close 
That sounds like an opposite to me! If it does one thing 
And then it does the other 
It could be opposite 
As we have discovered I hear a voice, I hear a voice 
What will it do? Let's see 
It sings high, low, high, low 
Hmm, that sounds like an opposite to me! Let's take a breath, let's take a breath 
What do we do? Let's see 
We breathe in, out, in, out 
Well, that sounds like an opposite to me! If it does one thing 
And then it does the other 
It could be opposite 
As we have discovered Do you wanna try, Baby Bop? 
Well, okay, Barney There is a light, there is a light 
What does it do? Let's see 
Oh, it goes on, off, on, off 
Hmm, that sounds like an opposite to me! 
Yeah, that sounds like an opposite to me!
