It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe 
He got a smile that make the lilac wanna grow 
He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh 
When they know little Joe's passing by 
Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare 
Soon he kiss me and its Christmas everywhere 
Trouble fly away and life is easy go 
Does he love me good? that's all I has to know 
Seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe (repeat above) Little Joe, little Joe, little Joe
