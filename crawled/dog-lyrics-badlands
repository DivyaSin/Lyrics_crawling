Dogs are howlin' at my door 
Wild old eagle's got me scrapin' the floor 
Mercy, mercy, down on your knees 
I know somethin' you can't live without 
Dog 
Take your time girl 
I know somethin' 
Telling lies yet 
I don't say it's so 
I know something 
Some think's wrong now 
Tell me like it is sweat little child 
Lost in the midnight hour 
Oh, oh, 
Dog 
I know something 
You can't find out 
Time will tell if you're a telling man 
Lizard man in a lizard suit now 
Just got killed 
I'm across the road 
Lost in the midnight hour 
Oh, oh 
Dog 
Dog 
Dogs are howlin' at my door 
Dogs won't tell me when I take more 
I know somthin' 
You won't change 
I don't love it 
You said I'm all the same 
Lost in the midnight hour 
Lost 
Lost in the midnight hour 
Oh
