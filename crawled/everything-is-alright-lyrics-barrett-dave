Voices land on popcorn alley 
And their scraping 
Their knuckles for flight. 
It's the boy's 
Heading down on 5th and Main, 
'cause they hear there's 
A doubleheader out there tonight. 
And the vender man 
It Hot Dog Stan 
laughing down subway hall in tights 
Singing now that everything is all right 
Everything is all right, 
When the boys come out tonight. 
There's a fairy princess 
in a tenement tower, 
Down on Castle View Way 
She hears the boys 
As their comin' on down the street 
And she says 
"Rescue me, 'cause I'm going insane". 
And they taker her 
On down to the reservoir 
where they have holy 
Services and rights 
She comes up for air 
And everything is all right 
Everything is all right 
When the boys come out tonight. 
They got their best shoes on 
Hear'm play'n. 
Well, the Dean Boys 
Come with a knife 
At their side 
As a sign of last 
Desperate relief. 
And the femmes, 
they are come up 
From Pleasant Hill 
To see if there's anything 
Left for them to defeat 
And the Fat Lip Fairies, 
From upper state 
are laughing their 
Ass's off tonight 
Singing now 
That everything is all right 
Everything is all right, 
When the boys come out tonight 
And the Fat Lip Fairies, 
From upper state 
Are laughing their 
Ass's off tonight 
Singing now that 
Everything is all right, 
Everything is all right, 
When the boys come, 
when the boys come out.
