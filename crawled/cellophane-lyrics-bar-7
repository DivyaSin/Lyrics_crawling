You're just beginning; I've lost my way 
I always thought our love would last for ever and a day 
Sometimes it happens, hearts go astray 
I never wanted to become what I've become anyway Fire to ashes, turn to dust 
Toys in the attic have now turned to rust 
I sift through the ashes; I throw out the pain 
Strapped in elastic, wrapped up in cellophane What was I thinking' what'd I expect' 
Don't take the time to makes sure all is fine; that's what I get. 
Love's all corrections; I can't seem to cope 
Love is a monkey, I'm the junk and now you ain't got the dope Fire to ashes, turn to dust 
Toys in the attic have all turned to rust 
I sift through the ashes; I throw out the pain 
Strapped in elastic, wrapped up in cellophane I can't breathe, I can't breathe I can't breathe, it's something I need 
I don't care how just as long as I'm able to 
Breath, it's something I need 
Long as I'm bleeding I know that I'm breathing now 
Something's gotta give 
I may never forget to keep on livin' now 
Breathe, and it's something I need 
I don't care how just as long as I'm able to 
Breath, all the lovin' I need 
Long as she's lovin' I know that she's suckin' now 
Something's gotta give 
I may never forget to keep on livin' now 
Breathe, I'm breathin' again 
In deep, it's good goin' in 
It's so sweet to just breathe on my own What I remember most of all 
I've tried to trap somebody else within my selfish walls 
But now they crumble, they no longer remain 
It's all the better, 'cause I never want to go there again Fire to ashes, turn to dust 
Toys in the attic have all turned to rust 
I sift through the ashes; I throw out the pain 
Long gone elastic, oh, no more cellophane Fire to ashes, turn to dust 
Toys in the attic have all turned to rust 
I sift through the ashes; I throw out the pain 
Long gone elastic, oh, no more cellophane
