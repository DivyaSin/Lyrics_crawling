Ohohohohoh 
(gregorian chants) 
The bell tolls 
The black plague has struck 
Diseased eyes roll upwards 
As if knowing which direction their souls will travel 
(bring out your dead) 
A woman in black cries 
As the deathly procession passes by 
And monks moan en masse 
Ohohohohohoh 
(gregorian chants) 
The yet clean peasant pounds upon the castle door 
For it is safer inside the walls 
Their knocking pounds a dull tone across the quiet, deserted courtyard 
The bodies of unfortuates bloat in the hot sun outside the castle walls 
And ones ignorant of all facts plunder the diseased corpses for remaining riches. 
(bring out your dead) 
And the bell tolls on 
A man walks around the castle walls on the outside 
The light from his lamp dancing shadows as he moves 
He tends the sick 
Gives comfort to all he can for dying woman and crying man 
But he feels it most for the children 
(unclean) 
Tears glisten on his cheek 
Did man ever deserve this death? 
And not all will die, just the poor 
For the rich are inside the castle walls 
And he knows he could be with them 
And they laugh at this fool of a man 
Through the stone fortress windows 
And the bell tolls on 
(unclean) 
And many deaths and many days later 
Many tears have been cry cried but in vain 
For tears can never erase the pain of death 
Only time has that talent 
His hands are now blistered but this man walks on 
The only element of sanity that the people look to him for answers and he answers all 
And the bell tolls on inside the castle wall 
(bring out your dead) 
The dead are now buried and the plague is at its end 
Life for the people flowers again 
They breathe fresh air like they did once before 
And there is not a sound from beyond the castle walls 
The bell has stopped 
And only silence is heard 
And the peasants outside wonder what happened within 
In their bones they feel something is wrong 
The bell has been silent much too long 
For many days not one soul has stirred from the stone fortress where the rich people live 
No one came and no one went 
Fear can do many strange things 
And even though water ran low 
Their mouths burnt and bellys caked dry 
Not one person put a foot outside 
No one had that much courage 
For they feared the peasants and their world outside 
So they played it safe and didn't move 
But one by one they perished and died
