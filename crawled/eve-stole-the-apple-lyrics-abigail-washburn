Old folks told me you're not coming home 
Old folks told me, gotta move along 
Like a ripe ol' fruit on a borrowed vine 
I hang around, oh Lord, I hang around Eve stole the apple from the tree, good Lord 
I know she could be me, I know she could be me Big brother told me I got something wrong 
Big brother told me sing a different song 
Like a tolling bell in its final hour 
I'll make a sound, oh Lord, I'll make one sound Another man done gone, he sang this song, good Lord 
I know he could be me, I know he could be me 'Round the mountain there's another shore 
'Round the corner there's another door 
Like a bleeding man on his native soil 
I'll stand my ground, oh Lord, I'll stand my ground They nailed him to the cross for no sin, good Lord 
I know he could be me, I know he could be me They nailed him to the cross 
Another man done gone 
Eve stole the apple from the tree, good Lord 
I know she could be me, I know she could be me 
I know she could be me
