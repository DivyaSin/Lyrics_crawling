Recorded in 1991 as a b-side to the 'bitteblue' single. it also found it's way onto the b-side of the 1991 re-release of 'holding out for a hero' (slightly extended version) and the 1993 compilation 'the very best of...', where it was incorrectly billed as 'previously unreleased' . lyrics taken from careful listening. There is a shadow rolling over my heart 
Like a cloud across the moon 
There is a devil on my shoulder 
Spreading his light into my room Broken head and empty heart 
Shattered mind that's torn apart 
I fall, I stumble into the night 
I can't leave your love alone 
I can't leave your love alone A wicked wind beats at my window 
Telling me that I'm no good 
There's no life in this bleak desert 
There's no life, without you Broken head and empty heart 
Shattered mind that's torn apart 
I fall, I stumble into the night 
I can't leave your love alone 
I can't leave your love alone Broken head and empty heart 
Shattered mind that's torn apart 
I fall, I stumble into the night 
I can't leave your love alone 
I can't leave your love alone I can't leave your love alone 
I can't leave your love alone 
I can't leave your love alone 
I can't leave your love alone 
I can't leave your love alone 
I can't leave your love alone
