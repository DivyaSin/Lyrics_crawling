When a star is born 
They possess a gift or two 
One of them is this 
They have the power, to make a wish come true When you wish upon a star 
Makes no difference who you are 
Anything your heart desires, will come to you And if your heart is in your dream 
No request is too extreme 
When you wish upon a star 
As dreamers do Fate is kind, so kind 
She brings to those who love 
The sweet fulfillment of 
Their secret longing Like a bolt out of the blue (like a bolt) 
Fate steps in and sees you through 
When you wish upon a star 
Your dreams come true When you wish upon a star 
Makes no difference who you are 
Your dreams come true 
Your dreams come true
