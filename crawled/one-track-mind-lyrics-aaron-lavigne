Branches blowing up. The sky falls down 
But, the feeling all around 
Sunshine. And, I know you're mine 
It reminds me of the place I want to be where all I see is your 
Sunshine. And, I know you're mine With all this hocus pocus 
Come on babe, let's focus on the task at hand 
I might be the man who's a sucker for you 
But, are you a sucker for me too? I can take it. I can wait for it 
You have found my one track mind 
I love everything you tell me 
Yes, I love all these words 
They flow right through me 
I'm alive and I'm thanking you for this sunshine With secrets kept and secrets told 
Man, these secrets are getting old 
Without you, I've got no one to tell 
So, I'll leave my heart on my sleeve so you can find it 
Baby, just remind it it that its you who puts the fear of God in me 
Me and God? We're doing alright, you see? 
Don't want to force you to feel things the way I see 
So, give the best to me 
'cause I'm gonna give my very best for you I can take it. I can wait for it 
You have found my one track mind 
I love everything you tell me 
Yes, I love all these words 
They flow right through me 
I'm alive and I'm thanking you for this sunshine Here comes the rain. Its falling down on me 
Better run for shelter or just wait it out and see what comes of this love 
With my lover standing right beside me 
It gets me so high Du du du du du du du 
Are you a sucker for me too? 'cause I can take it. I can wait for it 
You have found my one track mind 
I love everything you tell me 
Yes, I love all these words 
They flow right through me 
I'm alive and I'm thanking you for this sunshine Thank God that you and I are alive and 
Everything around us is like sunshine 
Thank God you're mine
