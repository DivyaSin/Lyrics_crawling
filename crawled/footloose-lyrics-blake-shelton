I been working so hard 
I'm punching my card 
Eight hours for what 
Oh, tell me what I got 
I get this feeling 
That times just holding me down 
I'll hit the ceiling 
Or else I'll tear up this town Tonight I gotta cut loose, footloose 
Kick off the Sunday shoes 
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees 
Jack, get back, come on before we crack 
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose You're playing so cool 
Obeying every rule 
Dig way down in your heart 
You're burning yearning for some 
Somebody to tell you 
That life ain't passing you by 
I'm trying to tell you 
It will if you don't even try 
You can fly if you'd only Cut loose, footloose 
Kick off your Sunday shoes 
Oh-wee Marie, shake it, shake it for me 
Woah, Milo, come on, come on let's go 
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose (Cut footloose) 
Woah-oh-oh-oh 
(Cut footloose) 
Woah-oh-oh-oh 
(Cut footloose) 
Woah-oh-oh-oh 
(Cut footloose) 
Woah-oh-oh-oh We got to turn you around 
And put your feet on the ground 
Now take a hold of your soul I'm turning it loose 
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes 
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees 
Jack, get back, come on before we crack 
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose 
(Footloose) footloose (footloose) 
Kick off the Sunday shoes 
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees 
Jack, get back, come on before we crack 
Lose your blues Everybody cut, everybody cut 
Everybody cut, everybody cut 
Everybody cut, everybody cut 
(Everybody) everybody cut footloose
