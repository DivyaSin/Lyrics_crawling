We were twins to be born that day 
But I could never let it be that way 
Mama's life line proved a good noose 
With a taste for killing, I was on the loose My folks hated me for what I did that day 
So I slit their throats, sent 'em to their grave 
I headed for the Smokie's in Tennessee 
Yeah, lot of good killing was ahead of me I'm a killer on the lamb 
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands 
Your life to me ain't worth a damn 
To this killer on the lamb Met a mountain girl from a mining town 
Our first time when the sun went down 
All she wanted was to marry me 
So I cut her where she loved me 
And watched her bleed Her daddy from the holler saw her blood so red 
So I drug him in the river and I drowned him dead I'm a killer on the lamb 
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands 
Your life to me ain't worth a damn 
To this killer on the lamb Wore out my welcome in Arkansas 
Killed a Christian family of the Pentecost 
Georgia Cracker was a talking at me 
So I cut out his tongue, hung from a tree Now the southern law wants to put me in jail 
But I'll still be killing when I'm burning in hell I'm a killer on the lamb 
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands 
Your life to me ain't worth a damn 
To this killer on the lamb To this killer on the lamb 
To this killer on the lamb
