for all the thousands i've killed for all the children i've tortured for all the souls i've burned hear a demons cry you carved into me the darkened lusts of my human sanity why me suffocates the remains this i never desired see me free me unchain me this life eternal is not what you spoke off why this horned, grim face i want to be this cold, black body save me free me unchain me set free i am a demon i serve the wicked now i must return i'm trapped eternally to dimensions of rage - pain - war - -hate where's my god
