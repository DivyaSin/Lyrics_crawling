Put on your yamukah 
Here comes Hannukah 
So much funnukah 
To celebrate Hannukah Hannukah is: the festival of lights 
Instead of one day of presents 
We have eight crazy nights When you feel like the only kid in town 
Without a Christmas tree 
Here's a list of people who are Jewish 
Just like you and me: David Lee Roth 
Lights the menorah 
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas 
And the late Dinah Shorah Guess who eats together at 
The Carnegie Deli? 
Bowser from Sha-Na-Na 
And Arthur Fonzarelli! Paul Newman's half Jewish 
And Goldie Hawn's half, too 
Put them together, 
What a fine looking Jew! You don't need Deck the Halls 
Or Jingle Bell Rock, 
'Cause you can spin a dreidel 
With Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock! [both Jewish] Put on your yamukah 
It's time for hannukah 
The owner of the seattle supersonica 
Celebrates Hannukah O.J. Simpson 
[not a Jew] 
But guess who is? 
Hall of Famer Rod Carew. [He converted] 
We got Ann Landers, 
And her sister Dear Abby, 
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish 
Not too shabby 
Some people think 
That Ebenezer Scrooge is 
Well, he's not, but guess who is -- 
All three Stooges! So many Jews are in show biz 
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is! 
Tell your friend Veronica 
It's time to celebrate Hannukah 
I hope I get a harmonica 
On this lovely, lovely Hannukah 
So drink your Gin and tonica 
And smoke your marijuanica 
If you really, really wannaca 
Have a happy happy, happy happy Hannukah Happy Hannukah!
