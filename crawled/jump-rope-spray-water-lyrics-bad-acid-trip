Alright LA Sports Arena, are you ready to rock? Then lets go! 
Hello all you little fans. Hello all you little kids 
Hello all you little dupes. My children 
Hello all you little fans. Hello all you little consumers 
Before you see the band theres something that you must always remember to do 
Check your wallet, check your funds, and make sure youve got enough cash 
'cause its not about expression and its not about art 
Its all about make those big dollars 
Watching puppets... 
Always remember to buy please (x3) 
Remember to buy 
Before you see the band theres something that you must always remember to do 
Check your wallet, check your funds, make sure youve got enough cash 
Its not about expression and its not about art 
Its all about making those big dollars 
You dont care about what we say. You care less about how we play 
All you care about is how you feel 
Another anthem for you when you murder and cheat, lie and steal 
Screaming 'cause were fucking pissed 
Weve got a lot to say. Talking gets us nowhere 
Gonna try another way and keep on fighting until you hear what we say 
Lets go to the mall so that we can shop at Hot Topic 
Practice our moshing and maybe some spinning kicks 
Its written on a patch right next to the one that says 'fuck the system 
Anarchy through hair dye, Punk rocks just a fashion rebellion 
You dont care about what we say. You care less about how we play 
All you care about is how you feel 
Another anthem for you for when you murder and cheat, lie and steal 
Screaming 'cause were fucking pissed. Weve got a lot to fucking say 
Talking gets us nowhere 
Gonna try another way and keep on fighting until you hear what we say 
Were the puppets, were the puppets, were the puppets, Playing jumprope 
Were the puppets, were the puppets, were the puppets...Spraying water.
