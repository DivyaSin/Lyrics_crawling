Joy, love, bitterness and fame. 
I love to fool around. It's hard to take the strain. 
Shame, Shame.Who's to take the blame? 
It was not me. Please don't call my name. You make me want to cry. 
There is no reason why. 
I don't want want to tell a lie. 
But I'm alone and I'm thinking. 
Would it be that I am just a fool. 
Inside of me. 
You know that I try to play cool. 
Inside of me. (Inside of me. Inside of me) 
Oh no ! Oh no ! Love hate and jealously, jealousy. 
I'm not so sure. Is that really me? 
Living life inside, no place in mind. 
But tell me there is a way I want you by my side.
