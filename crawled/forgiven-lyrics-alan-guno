I am not a man who lights the way 
I am just a man who hides from the day 
Burdened by the drought within my spirit What kind of life would wait for me 
If theres no way to be set free 
But now the thunder roars and I no longer fear it Out of the darkness, Out of the shame 
Rise from the shadows, Fly from the pain 
My eyes begin to magnify this mercy given 
Into the rain and into the sun 
I can now feel my new lifes begun 
And it is here in the water that I am forgiven How can I ever hope to live 
If I dont deserve the gift that you give 
And yet this storm comes to spare my broken life now Out of the darkness, Out of the shame 
Rise from the shadows, Fly from the pain 
My eyes begin to magnify this mercy given 
Into the rain and into the sun 
I can now feel my new lifes begun 
And it is here in the water that I am forgiven Hear the voice the oceans rise to know 
Seek the winds that make the rivers flow 
Feel the water glorify the holiest graces, compassion divine Oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh Out of the darkness, Out of the shame 
Rise from the shadows, Fly from the pain 
My eyes begin to magnify this mercy given 
Into the rain and into the sun 
I can now feel my new lifes begun 
And it is here in the water that I am forgiven Oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh 
Into the rain and into the sun 
I can now feel my new lifes begun 
And it is here in the water that I am forgiven Oh Forgiven, Oh Forgiven
