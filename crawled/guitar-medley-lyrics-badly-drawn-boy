Oooh, ooh 
Oooh, ooh I don't know where this began 
Don't know how it will end 
And another day gone Oooh, ooh If you welcome me to your world 
If you welcome me to your world 
I won't throw it all away Oooh, ooh 
Oooh, ooh Wider than a smile 
The truth can be unkind 
To take the only one 
You thought you were someone No apologies 
I live the life I lead 
I hope you understand 
That none of this was planned If you welcome me to your world 
I won't throw it all away If you need me now, I'd do anything 
If you need me now, it'd mean everything Yes I've seen a rainbow 
And I've felt the rain 
Woke up to a sunrise 
And I felt the pain I've seen it all somehow 
Let's just look at us now 
Let's just look at us now
