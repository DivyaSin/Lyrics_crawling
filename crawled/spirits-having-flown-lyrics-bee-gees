I never fell in love so easily 
Where the four winds blow I carry on 
I'd like to take you where my spirit flys 
Through the empty skys We go alone never before having flown 
Faster than lightning is this heart of mine 
In the face of time I carry on 
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends Be my lover friend 
We go alone never before having flown I am your hurricane 
Your fire in the sun 
How long must I live in the air 
You are my paradise My angel on the run 
How long must I wait 
It's the dawn of the feeling 
That starts from the moment you're there You'll never know what you have done for me 
You broke all those rules I live upon 
I'd like to take you to my shangrila 
Neither here or far away from home Never before having flown 
There I'd like to take you where my spirit flys 
Through the empty skys we go alone 
Never before having flown
