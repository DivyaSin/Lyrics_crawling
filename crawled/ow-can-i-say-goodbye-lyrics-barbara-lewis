(How could I say goodbye?) I was gonna say goodbye to you tonight But then you told me how much you missed me & then you took me in your arms & kissed me Oh how could I say goodbye? Oh how could I say goodbye? 
You're a troubled kind of guy, that's why, that's why Tell me you can't stay for too long in one place Without a word you'll go running off to someplace Oh oh how you made me cry Oh oh how you made me cry 
Till you came back in your own sweet time To kiss away the tears & tell me you're mine, mine 
I was gonna say goodbye to you tonight Tell you "I'm finished, I've had enough of you" Then you walked in, I can't help it if I love you Oh how could I say goodbye? Oh how could I say goodbye? To you, mmm, when you know how much...& fade
