Finally ours, this blessed of days 
Two paths converge to create one new way 
And now you and I before all will prove 
Joy is alive when love says "I Do" See the sun rise, welcoming all 
Each of our friends have now answered the call 
Natural as one heart born from two 
Our hope fulfilled when love says "I Do" Let all creation stand up and behold 
The glory of God in our vow 
Love that is true should be honored with pride 
What God has joined, let no one deny Weve fought so hard, struggled so long 
Holding back noise that once drowned out our song 
We know by faith that Gods gift is true 
And angels will sing when love says "I Do" Let all creation stand proud and behold 
The freedom of love to so choose 
All of us equal in His holy eyes 
What God has joined, let no one deny Come take my hand, in thanks we will pray 
No more will judgment and fear block our way 
Heaven and earth affirm what is true 
Saints will rejoice when love says "I Do" Show me your smile, most blessed of sights 
He who created love grants us this right 
Two simple words, one world that is new 
God He will smile when love says "I Do" And with this ring, we will be wed 
Only one thing still remains to be said 
Now say the words, Ill say them to you 
All will be right, when love says "I Do" All will be right, when love says "I Do"
