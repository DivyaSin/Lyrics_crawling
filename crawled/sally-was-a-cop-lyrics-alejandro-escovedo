Instrumental Opening Sally was a cop, but now she's a soldier 
Another foot deep, another day older 
I used to be on top, now I just roll over 
I used to run hot, now I run a little colder Instrumental Break (2 Bars) They're marching up the streets, people hiding in their cupboards (wo-oh-oh-oh-oh) 
From the crooked politicos to the mercenary lovers (wo-oh-oh-oh-oh) 
The socialites and psychopaths are dancing with each other (wo-oh-oh-oh-oh) 
Sally was a cop, but now she's a soldier (wo-oh-oh-oh-oh) Instrumental Break (2 Bars) Shot in the face in the ditches of their gutters 
Thirty five bodies lying in the highway 
Children forced to dig the graves of their fathers 
Sally was a cop, but now she's a soldier Instrumental Break (2 Bars) They're marching up the streets, people hiding in their cupboards 
From the crooked politicos to the mercenary lovers 
Children forced to dig the graves of their fathers 
Sally was a cop, but now she's a soldier Instrumental Break (5 Bars then fade out)
