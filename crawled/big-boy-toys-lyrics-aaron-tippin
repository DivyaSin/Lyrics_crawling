I hook my wagon to my trac 
And I head across the yard 
To my big sandbox 
Where I work real hard 
Playin' all day 
With my little toy trucks 
Backhoes Bulldozers herdin' in some stuff 
That was my whole life 
When I was a kid 
But when I grew up 
I guess I never really did I like 'em Big Boy Toys 
Motors and lights 
Knobs and switches 
And a four-wheel drive 
Runnin' up the road 
Or crawlin' cross the farm 
And when they break down 
I jack 'em up in the yard 
Pull out my tools 
My pride and joy 
Man you gotta love 'em 
Big Boy Toys Now sometimes baby 
You just can't understand 
The mud on my boots 
And the grease on my hands 
I've tried to explain 
How it makes me feel 
The awesome power 
Of my hands on the wheel 
If I can't find the words 
To set things right 
I just scoot over 
And I let my baby drive She likes Big Boy Toys 
Motors and lights 
Knobs and switches 
And a four-wheel drive 
Runnin'up the road 
Or crawlin' cross the farm 
And when they break down 
I jack 'em up in the yard 
Pull out my tools 
My pride and joy 
Man you gotta love 'em 
Big Boy Toys Yeah 
It's boats and cars 
Tractors and trucks 
Gasoline and diesel fuel 
Are runnin' through my blood I like 'em Big Bpy Toys 
Motors and lights 
Knobs and switches 
And a four-wheel drive 
Runnin' up the road 
Or crawlin' cross the farm 
And when they break down 
I jack 'em up in the yard 
Pull out my tools 
My pride and joy 
Man you gotta love 'em 
Big Boy Toys 
Man you gotta love 'em
