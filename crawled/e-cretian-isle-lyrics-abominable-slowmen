A bit ago in Crete 
Good ol' Theseus pulled off a feat 
Slew the Minotaur got in his car and sped off with a girl so sweet When ol' Minos heard the news 
He quickly flushed out the clues 
And said, "Daedalus, man, you're going in the can and your son is going too" So in the labyrinth's trial 
They roamed a while 
On the Cretian isle They had some candles in their packs 
And they melted them down for wax 
That with feathers and some string they fashioned into wings which they strapped onto their backs And so Daedalus, wise and old 
Told Icarus, young and bold 
"Don't be so damn brash or your *** is gonna crash into a sea green, mean, and cold" Then in single file 
They flew away in style 
From the Cretian isle "I'm flying, Dad, I'm flying 
I'm like a bird, Dad, look at me 
High in the sky like Helios 
I've never felt so ****ing free 
Oh, Dad, my wings are melting 
I'm one sad teardrop drooping towards the sea 
I'm drowning, Dad, I'm drowning 
Trapped beneath the waves I'm history" The moral of the story is to tie your shoes 
Because he who hesitates is bound lose 
One bad egg will spoil the batch 
But don't count your chickens before they hatch 
A friend in need is a friend indeed 
You can't cut a stone and make it bleed 
When the cat's away the mice will play 
And an apple a day keeps the cat away 
Eat your greens, but don't feed the bears 
An escalator can't break, it will just become stairs 
One man's maze is another man's measure 
Don't melt the wax if you can't grow the feather
