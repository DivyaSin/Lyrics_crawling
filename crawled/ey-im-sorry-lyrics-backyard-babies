With my plastic gun like father & son 
I walked in the other day 
Hands up, down on the floor 
If you want to live some more 
Live some more, some more With my shaky legs and a messed up heart 
My plans didn't work out that smart 
I had to drive two blocks more 
So I wouldn't get caught 
Wouldn't get caught, wouldn't get caught, it's not smart! Let's go 
Let's go 
That's right Hey, I'm sorry that you didn't get paid today 
Why don't you come back another day Let's go 
That's right Got rid of my clothes & I cut my hair 
Plan be	was just so unfair 
I got myself to thank for all that spank 
'Cause I left a finger right in the bank Hey, I'm sorry that you didn't get paid today 
Why don't you come back another day Hey, I'm sorry that you didn't get paid today 
Why don't you come back another day I said, hey, I'm sorry that you didn't get paid today 
Why don't you come back another day 
Why don't you come back another day 
You're welcome back another day
