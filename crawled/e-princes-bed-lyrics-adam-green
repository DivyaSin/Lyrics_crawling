If there's a heart inside your eye 
If there's a clock inside your head 
If there's a girl outside your bed 
Put your face in my place My head is falling off my head 
And I don't want to see clear again 
Everyone is talking about Jesus 
Everyone is talking about Jesus 
Everyone is talking about Jesus 
Everyone's fucking my princess Goodnight to my new dead wife 
Goodnight to my Nazi friend 
I'm standing on the tip of my stinking ship Hey princess over there 
Why you sitting over there 
When you've got a warm spot to share 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed
