Girl my pulse, is gone 
The way you lick your lips baby 
That's wrong 
I tried but I can't seem to leave you alone 
Damn you got me sprung, touch me and I'm numb, numb, numb 
Don't know how you keep me cuffed 
Locked up in this chains, of lust, yeah 
Call my name, I'll come, girl you got me dumb, dumb, dumb You're playing with my heart, I'm barely breathing 
You're playing with my heart, can't stop the bleeding 
And my whole world fades to dark 
You're playing with my heart 
You're playing with my heart Impossible to ignore, the pain 
Though it's a mess baby I'm glad, you came 
You got me circling down, your drain 
You're smoking like a, you must be the one, let's go 
Damaging every part of me, (part of me) 
Another dose baby I'm a fiend (I'm a fiend) 
A sexy drug that's all you are, baby you are You're playing with my heart, I'm barely breathing 
You're playing with my heart, can't stop the bleeding 
And my whole world fades to dark 
You're playing with my heart 
You're playing with my heart 
You're playing with my heart 
My, my, my, my heart 
Oho, you're playing with my heart 
Oho, my, my, my, oho Oho, oh yeah, oho, oho, oh baby, oho You're playing with my heart, I'm barely breathing 
You're playing with my heart, can't stop the bleeding 
And my whole world fades to dark (fades to dark) 
You're playing with, you're playing with 
You're playing with my heart, I'm barely breathing 
You're playing with my heart, can't stop the bleeding 
And my whole world fades to dark 
You're playing with my heart 
Stop playing with my heart.
