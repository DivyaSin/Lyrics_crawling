Ahhhh... 
As I stand here in your shadow 
Waiting for you to move so I can see out the window 
I want to watch the children play 
Saw the little girl fall and run away 
Mmmm 
And I'll never understand 
The way that you play with me 
Yeah 
You are almost heaven 
Angel from above 
Tonight I've got a lot of love 
You are almost heavenly 
And I'm dreaming of 
You're not a god of love 
And you're not gonna run from me 
You always seem to laugh when I'm not joking 
When I'm not joking anymore 
And we don't communicate 
Sunrise brought with fate 
And it's way too late 
You are almost heaven 
Angel from above 
But you're not a god of love 
And you are almost heavenly 
I'm dreaming of 
But you're not a god of love 
But you not the god of me 
You are almost heaven 
Angel from above 
But you're into a god of love 
No no 
You are almost heavenly 
I'm dreaming of 
But you're not a god of love 
And you're not gonna run from me 
Like an angel 
Not a god of love 
Not away from me 
You know the kinda love
