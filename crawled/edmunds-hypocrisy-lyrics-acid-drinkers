To weak to exist 
In the gossip press 
But we like your cynical games 
He's too old a slender blond 
Hey, Ed my main man 
You have amazing blow out brain 
Hey, Ed you'll be dead!!! 
If you jump into my bed!!! 
That's no good 
Not that equipment 
Ed is clever 
He knows how and where 
Sweaty hands and red face 
Old stupid Ed 
They got him by his nakes ass 
Hey, Ed you'll be dead!!! 
If you jump into my bed!!! 
You fucker!!!
