From his darkest desires 
From hate caused by his suffering 
From his horde of faithfuls in trance 
From his thirst of blood and death 
Will be born a storm of torpor 
And horror succeeds hypocrisy 
Last judgement will be proclaimed For a long time the executioner waits for them 
He won't have a pity 
The fire of live coals already burn When flames of pureness turn over inquisition 
When flower of evil spreads as a death wind 
When blood pours on last sabbath's a dark altar 
Then he will come back and declare his reign 
And hunt Jehovah's angels from his people's soul. Then christ will return on his cross 
It will be the Holy Trinity's end 
The humiliated prince goes back on his throne 
And story can finally start...
