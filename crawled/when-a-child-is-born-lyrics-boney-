A ray of hope flitters in the sky 
A shiny star lights up way up high 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn 
This comes to pass when a child is born A silent wish sails the seven seas 
The winds have changed whisperin the trees 
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn 
This comes to pass when a child is born A rosy fume settles all around 
You've got the feel you're on solid ground 
For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn 
This comes to pass when a child is born And all of this happened 
Because whe world is waiting 
Waiting for one child 
Black, white, yellow, no one knows 
But a child that would grow up and turn tears to laughter 
Hate to love, war to peace 
And everyone to everyone's neighbour 
Misery and suffering would be forgotten forever
