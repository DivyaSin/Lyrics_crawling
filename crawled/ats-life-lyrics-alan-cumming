Keep me down 
Ill do whatever you say 
Ill just remember that old clich Thats life, you better believe it That's what the people say 
You're riding' high in April, shot down in May 
But I know I'm gonna change their tune 
When I'm back on top, back on top in June 
(Now dont you worry) That's life 
(Thats life) 
Oh, it's funny as it seems 
(Go ahead enjoy it) 
Some people get their kicks steppin' on dreams 
But I don't let it get me down 
(Tell us why you said it) 
'Cause this ol' world keeps right on going around I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet 
A pawn and a king 
I've been up, down and over and under 
And I know one thing 
Each time I find myself flat on my face 
I just pick myself up and get back in the race That's life 
(Thats life, you gotta believe it) 
And I can't deny it, yes I thought of quitting 
But you know my heart, my little heart just won't buy it 
But if I didn't think it was worth a try 
I'd just roll myself up in a big ball and die I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet 
A pawn and a king 
I've been up, down, over and under 
And I know one thing 
Each time I find myself flat on my face 
I just pick myself up and get back in the race That's life 
(Thats life) 
Oh and I can't deny it, yes I thought of quitting 
But I tell you my heart it just won't buy it 
But if I didn't think it was worth a try 
(What would you do?) 
I'd just roll myself up in a great big ball and die Keep me down 
Ill do whatever you say 
(Great big ball and die) 
Youve heard my story 
Thats life
