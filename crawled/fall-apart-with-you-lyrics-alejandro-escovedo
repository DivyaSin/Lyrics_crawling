I feel, I feel like I am fallin', 
And it feels, it feels like its okay, 
Everything's so strange, 
My body doesn't feel the same, 
Its all I want, is to fall apart with you, I first met you, I first met you outside of phoenix, 
It was a foolish, a foolish August moon, 
She said her first love was her last, 
So she cries when she hears Johnny Cash, 
Its all she wants, is to fall apart with me, All I want, is to fall apart with you, All I want, is to fall apart with you, We ain't nothin, we ain't nothin', 
But we are somethin', 
And there's no one, could ever make us feel so bad, 
We know that nothin' ever lasts, 
So we cry when we hear Johnny Cash, 
Its all I want, is to fall apart with you, All I want, is to fall apart with you [Repeat x4]
