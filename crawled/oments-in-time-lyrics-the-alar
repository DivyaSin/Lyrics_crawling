I was born of nineteen fifty nine 
That'll be the day rock'n'roll died 
Far away on a dark and stormy night 
Brought into the new decade 
The sixties and her pearly gates 
A hard rain fell and the times forever changed 
In the back of a car with the wind in our hair 
Speeding down the road going anywhere 
Was it true we were really going nowhere? Sixty eight rang like a ricochet 
The world arose to a nightmare day 
Some people found their voice and a world to change 
One small step for man was one giant leap for mankind 
How I wish that we could walk that way tonight 
On a Woodstock field in the heat of the night 
Rock'n'roll music defined the times 
The sound of generations collide These moments in time 
(These moments in time) 
Live on forever in my mind 
(Live on forever in my mind) 
Even though we've said goodbye 
(These moments in time) 
Live on forever in my mind And the seventies king of rock'n'roll 
In Gracelands lost his throne 
There won't be any comebacks tomorrow 
No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones 
Why they were taken away? God only knows 
We formed a band we were haunted by their ghosts 
I remember it now like it was yesterday 
Playing those guitars at a frantic pace 
Somewhere we got lost along the way These moments in time 
(These moments in time) 
Live on forever in my mind 
(Live on forever in my mind) 
Even though we've said goodbye 
(These moments in time) 
Live on forever in my mind Through the London streets in a taxi cab 
A radio played an epitaph 
Imagine, the dream is over 
Oh I've been silent way too long 
You never thought I knew what was going on 
You probably think that you are in this song 
The tragedies behind the dreams 
Belie the truth and the honesty 
I have seen the dirt and the glory These moments in time 
(These moments in time) 
Live on forever in my mind 
(Live on forever in my mind) 
Even though we've said goodbye 
(These moments in time) 
Live on forever in my mind These moments in time 
(These moments in time) 
Live on forever in my mind 
(Live on forever in my mind) 
Even though we've said goodbye 
(These moments in time) 
Live on forever in my mind
