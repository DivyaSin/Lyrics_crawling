I prayed my heart I was born again 
They said the team lies would not ? a sin 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
I was mad at the world 
And ain't no pain I could take a palm jaga 
Take a swing 
Oh yeah, oh yeah You know I'm frustrated, 
Hot, overrated 
Feel laugh disappearing 
Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah, oh yeah I've been caught it out, ? by dad 
Don't take together one last ride 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
I wanna hold you but you're under run 
I ? but I'm not that dumb 
Oh yeah, oh yeah You know I'm frustrated, 
Hot, overrated 
Feel laugh disappearing 
Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah, oh yeah And jumping ahead and falling behind 
And even don't know don't need a side 
Oh yeah, oh yeah Gotta ? my eye above my step 
Love form the table but I'm not done yet, no 
Oh yeah, oh yeah You know I'm frustrated, 
Hot, overrated 
Feel laugh disappearing 
Oh yeah, oh yeah You know I'm frustrated, 
Hot, overrated 
Feel laugh disappearing 
Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah, oh yeah 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
Oh yeah, oh yeah
