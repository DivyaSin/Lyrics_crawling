Explore the corridors we'll find our restitution Stop. Everybody get wild Music, it's all around and you choose it 
To take control or you loose it

Power, minutes turn into hours 
Now's the time to get louder 
The light is there to be seen your dreamin' no you've gotta Stop. Everybody get wild We've travelled so far to explore the mysteries of life 
And the reality of our youth 
Is overlooked by those who restrict our freedom 
Our freedom to get wild 
This is Aaron 
And this is my world 
And it's yours Stop. Everybody get wild Listen, there callin' but you're missin' 
You're standin' off in position 
A crowded room is in rage 
I'm up on stage fire 
You say you want to go higher up and fly away, you're gone 
Ain't nothin' wrong with standin' I'm commanding you to Stop. Everybody get wild
