---- 
Do you see this children of the streets? 
Have you walked the pavement wher they sleep? 
Do you feel their hand when you give them alms? 
Did you ever give them bread to eat? 
---- 
Have you seen their homes washed by the floods? 
While a mother tightly holds her child 
Do you hear the wind of the raging storm? 
Can you tell them where its coming from? 
---- 
Let us know our love and mercy 
With kindness and humility 
For God's love the weak and needy 
Just like you and me 
----chorus----- 
We are all God's children 
We are all the same 
He is calling us by name to help the poor and lame 
And learn what's life is really for 
It's to know and l0ve and serve the Lord 
---- 
Stand together and do our part 
Hear the voices mends their broken hearts 
Choose to be brave fight for their rights 
Give them back their honor and theirs pride 
----- 
Please do not be blind and just leave them behind 
To struggle in darkness or give them empty promises 
-----chorus----- 
We are all God's children 
we are all the same 
He is calling us by name to help the poor and lame 
And learn what's life is really for 
It's to know and love and serve the Lord 
It's to know and love and serve the Lord 
It's to know and love and serve the Lord
