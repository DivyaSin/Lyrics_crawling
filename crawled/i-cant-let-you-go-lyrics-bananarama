Feels like I've been sleeping 
For a thousand years 
Secrets I've been keeping 
Fill an ocean with tears [Bridge 1] 
But I've found the answer 
To what I'm searching for 
Cause I felt so empty 
Until you touched my soul [Chorus] 
I can't let you go 
Now that you're mine 
I can't let you go 
I want you for all time Filled with such confusion 
I was losing my mind 
Fell for love's illusion 
Time after time [Bridge 2] 
Any my life without you 
Sends a chill right through my heart 
But you made love easy 
From the start [Chorus: x2] [Bridge 1] [Chorus: x2]
