I can't wait 
I can't wait I think of you 
When the mornin' comes and the night time goes away 
All day 
Don't you ever think that we won't be okay 
No way 
There is nothing stopin' me from lovin' you 
Touchin', and rubbin', and kissin' and huggin' you What's this feeling takin' over me? 
Baby, that's love, and it ain't stoppin' it 
I don't as far as the eyes can see 
Pick up the pace, and it ain't no droppin' it 
Always forever I'll be by your side 
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde 
That's the way that it's gonna be 
I'm in love with you, and you in love with me [Chorus: x2] 
I can't wait 
Sit down and talk for a minute 
Go outside and take a walk for a minute, for a minute, for 
You 
And me I can't believe 
That someone like you will love me endlessly 
Forever 
If this goes our way, my love will always be 
Eternally 
You have set my mind, my love, my heart so free 
Together forever, however, just you and me What's this feeling takin' over me? 
Baby, that's love, and it ain't stoppin' it 
I don't as far as the eyes can see 
Pick up the pace, and it ain't no droppin' it 
Always forever I'll be by your side 
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde 
That's the way that it's gonna be 
I'm in love with you, and you in love with me [Chorus: x2] I can't wait 
To have you right next to me here by my side 
I can't wait 
To kiss and caress you, girl, while I'm holding you tight 
I can't wait 
Can't imagine life without you; it just ain't right 
I can't wait 
I got a whole lot of loving 
And you gonna get it tonight [Chorus: x2]
