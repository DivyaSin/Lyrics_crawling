It's uncle Elwyn 
My uncle Elwyn is tall 
My Elwyn is small 
My Elwyn plays a mean basketball He's about 45 maybe 55, 60 
I'm not sure, once he mixed me a drink 
I was about 5 years old It was Koolaid and pop 
I thought that was cold 
Cold meaning good Cold's supposed to be bad 
But I think that I [unverified] would 
Change some things,I change their meanings 
I've been here, I've been demeaning Once, twice, maybe three times 
I asked my uncle Elwyn he's a mime 
Ask uncle Elwyn

E L W Y N that's Elwyn, sing it again
