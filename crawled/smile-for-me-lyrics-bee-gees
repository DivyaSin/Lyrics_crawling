Smile for me 
Don't let me see you crying 
For you must keep on trying 
To pretend that you don't care Smile for me 
If only for a moment 
And even though I'm far away 
My heart will stay with you One moment of sadness 
Brings you gladness 
And you will learn 
While I'm away 
You must pray for my return Smile for me 
If only for a moment 
And even though I'm far away 
My heart will stay with you One moment of sadness 
Brings you gladness 
And you will learn 
While I'm away 
You must pray for my return Smile for me 
Though there's no need for sorrow 
Just wait until tomorrow 
I'm home again 
So, smile for me 
For me 
For me...
