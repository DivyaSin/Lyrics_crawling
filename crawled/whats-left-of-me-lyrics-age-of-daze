It would be easier if I never met you at all 
It would be easier if I hadn't taken a fall 
It would be easy not to call and wither away 
It would be easy to say.... easy to say... You think you're better when your ass is sittin' in his new car 
You think you're better because everybody knows who you are 
I'll feel much better when they figure out just who you are 
I had be better if I... never loved you at all Why am I still thinking of you? 
Why am I? It would be easier to say 
I never loved you anyway 
I want to save what's left of me 
It would be easier that way... that way... It might be easier if I never met you at all 
It might be easier if I hadn't taken a fall 
It might be easy not to call and just wither away 
It might be easy to say.... I never loved you at all Why am I still thinking of you? 
Why am I? It would be easier to say 
I never loved you anyway 
I want to save what's left of me 
It would be easy... I said I'd always love you 
I would never leave you alone But I'm going on without you 
Somewhere I don't even know... I don't know It would be easier to say 
I never love you... Why am I still thinking of you? 
I never loved you anyway 
Why am I still thinking of you? 
Why am I... thinking of you? 
Why can't I stop thinking of you?
