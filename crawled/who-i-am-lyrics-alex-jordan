Listen here 
I've got a story to tell 
about a boy 
who never bought what they sell 
beaten bruised broken 
went through all of this hell 
just to break down the door 
of the music cartel there's a time 
in the back of my mind 
told ya twice 
i'm leaving nothing behind 
i've burned every last dollar 
spent every last dime 
just to make the ascent 
the hardest part is the climb it's all or nothing 
when you got nothing at all 
it's all or nothing 
cause i'm not gonna fall Now Everybody in the club 
wants to know who I am 
be fly like I am 
make the girls say hott damn 
they got cameras flashing round me 
everybody's my fan 
don't you know who I am 
don't you know who I am this is it 
the stars align on the floor 
flashing lights 
people screaming for more 
i got the red carpet treatment 
when i walk through the door 
I'm the headline story 
the biggest score it's all or nothing 
when you got nothing at all 
it's all or nothing 
cause i'm not gonna fall Now Everybody in the club 
wants to know who I am 
be fly like I am 
make the girls say hott damn 
they got cameras flashing round me 
everybody's my fan 
don't you know who I am 
don't you know who I am Now Everybody in the club 
wants to know who I am 
be fly like I am 
make the girls say hott damn 
they got cameras flashing round me 
everybody's my fan 
don't you know who I am 
don't you know who I am hey hey 
you never saw this coming did ya 
hey hey 
want it to last then take a picture 
hey hey 
I'm not backing down 
I've got the keys to the city 
I run this town 
Now Everybody in the club 
wants to know who I am 
be fly like I am 
make the girls say hott damn 
they got cameras flashing round me 
everybody's my fan 
don't you know who I am 
don't you know who I am Now Everybody in the club 
wants to know who I am 
be fly like I am 
make the girls say hott damn 
they got cameras flashing round me 
everybody's my fan 
don't you know who I am
