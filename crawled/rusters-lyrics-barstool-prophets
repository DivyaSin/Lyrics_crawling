I have spent many nights 
Staring at the sky, 
Searching for a sign of something more. 
Teased by flashing satellites 
Trying to trick my eyes. 
They pale beside what I am waiting for. 
I know they're coming back for me. 
But how much longer will they be? 
I didn't mind the summer's heat, 
Or being ankle-deep in snow. 
If the hat was dropped, I was prepared to go. 
All the years of vigilance, 
I've grown weary of the strain. 
The trouble isn't nearly worth the gain. 
I know they're coming back for me. 
But how much longer will they be? 
Am I as absurd as I seem? 
I guess it all was just a dream. 
Just as I rise to leave 
I hear the old, familiar sound 
Of thrusters pounding atmosphere. 
I have spent many nights 
Staring at the sky. 
All the distant stars that shine, 
How I've longed to make them mine. 
All of the wasted years 
Will shrivel and disappear. 
Oh come with me. 
You can come with me. 
Won't you come with me? 
I knew that they'd come back for me. 
To cut me loose and set me free. 
If this is as absurd as it seems 
My whole life was just a dream. 
Just a dream.
