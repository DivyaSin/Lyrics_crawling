One world 
New order 
Illuminati uses you Their jury 
Their justice 
But for the chosen few Who is the great dictator 
Who oils the grand machine 
Who lubes the wheels of progress 
With blood drawn from your veins One world 
New order 
Illuminati poisons you New world 
One order 
Notice? Do you? Satan gave himself a name 
Mason, exposed controls the game Who's reaping 
From ruin 
What is the master plan? Won't matter 
Not to you 
If you are just a man You dragged the stones to Giza 
But they built the pyramids 
On your back shouldered greatness 
Not you just what you did You're reaping 
Your ruin 
This is the master's plan To use you 
Discard you 
As he will every man Satan named himself a place 
Babylon known as the USA [Chorus] 
Illuminati dominates 
You build your place in hell 
You're not aware that you create 
Their paradise, your frozen cell New world 
One order 
Illuminati is machine Your worth 
In ruin 
You pave their streets with dreams With trust you're made the victim 
Atop mass graves they revel 
Free mason buries you 
Free mason buries you
