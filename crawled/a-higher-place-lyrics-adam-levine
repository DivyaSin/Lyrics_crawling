I don't know why I don't see happiness in this town 
Everyone I meet seems so ... they frown 
What good's live in where dreams come true if nobody smiles? 
Everyone's chasing latest star, the latest style Take me to another space and time 
You take me to a higher place so 
I'm about to get out of the race 
I don't mind 
Yeah, all I know is everything's nothing if I don't have you I don't know if I'm the fool who's getting this so wrong 
That's the dream to sing the perfect girl the perfect song 
All I know is I can keep on ...... the sky 
When you're the only one that sees worth within my eyes Take me to another space and time 
You take me to a higher place so 
I'm about to get out of the race 
I don't mind 
Yeah, all I know is everything's nothing if I don't have you You take me to another place 
You take me to another place 
You take me to a higher place Take me another space and time 
You take me to a higher place so 
I'm about to get out of the race 
I don't mind 
Yeah, all I know is everything's nothing if I don't have you I'm about to get out of the race 
I don't mind 
Yeah, all I know is everything's nothing if I don't have you
