Hate Gil, really now 
Hate you because 
Go tippy toe 
Shut off to the world 
Shut off to all, you ghost Early told a lie 
Afraid to be blind 
Now go for a while 
Shut off the world 
Shut off to all 
I'm yours 
I'm yours Helping evil people to say things they show 
Said once before 
I know evil people who say things 
They don't know, oh Begged Gil, really, why? 
Stay through the night 
I'm here for a while 
Shut off to the world 
Shut off to all 
I'm yours 
I'm yours
