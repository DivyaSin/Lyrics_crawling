We've been drifting sadder than ghosts 
Silently building the walls 
Between us 
Parallel lines you know 
They never touch And I see 
All that you are to me 
Through your eyes 
Through your eyes 
I see All these moments slide into years 
Suddenly strangers again 
Please tell me 
We can be close 
Closer than we've ever been And I see 
How much you need me 
Through your eyes 
Through your eyes 
I see And I needed to hear 
That I was getting better 
You needed to hear 
That I love you now more than ever And I see 
How much you love me 
Through your eyes 
Through your eyes 
Through your eyes 
I see
