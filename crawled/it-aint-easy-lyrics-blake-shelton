Easy, easy, easy, easy 
It ain't easy, hmm 
It ain't easy 
Easy, easy, easy Yeah I used to be alright 
Just saying goodnight 
Maybe see you tomorrow 
Yeah, I could go a couple of days 
Just doing my thing 
Whatever I wanted, but now 
Your kisses hit me like lightning 
Can't fight it, girl, you put it on me 
Yeah, you stone me 
When you ain't with me I ain't nothing but lonely It ain't easy anymore 
When I'm walking out your door 
My feet drag across the floor 
And it just about kills me 
I hate picking up my keys 
I hate kissing you goodbye 
No I ain't gonna lie 
With that look in your eyes 
And your arms around me 
Girl, believe me 
It ain't easy anymore 
No, it ain't easy, that's for sure Something different 'bout a Friday night 
And the neon lights if you ain't beside me 
Now I love it when you call me on the phone 
Saying "hurry on home," you got something special on 
And it's just for me 
Damn, you make it hard to leave It ain't easy anymore 
When I'm walking out your door 
My feet drag across the floor 
And it just about kills me 
I hate picking up my keys 
I hate kissing you goodbye 
No, I ain't gonna lie 
With that look in your eyes 
And your arms around me 
Girl, believe me It ain't easy leaving my baby in the bed 
And driving away knowing the last thing you said 
Was "don't go, don't leave, lay here with me" 
Girl, you're making me crazy 
It ain't easy 
No, no, no, it ain't easy 
It sure ain't baby, yeah baby It ain't easy anymore 
When I'm walking out your door 
My feet drag across the floor 
And it just about kills me 
I hate picking up my keys 
I hate kissing you goodbye 
No I ain't gonna lie 
With that look in your eyes 
And your arms around me 
Girl, believe me 
It ain't easy anymore 
No it ain't easy, walking out your door Mmm, no it ain't easy, no, no 
No, it ain't easy 
Walking out your door 
It ain't easy, oh, it ain't easy
