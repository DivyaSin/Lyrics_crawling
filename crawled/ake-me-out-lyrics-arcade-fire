I'm jailed within 
The cell I'm in 
And once again 
You're on my mind 
Trapped inside 
The days go by 
I wonder why 
You're on my mind 
I count the days 
And dream of ways 
To see your face 
You're on my mind 
SOS 
I'm in duress 
Nevertheless 
You're on my mind Take me out 
Dig me out of this hole Tortured and beat 
I'm nearing defeat 
I'm incomplete 
You're on my mind 
I scream and shout 
I can't get out 
Without a doubt 
You're on my mind 
He hid the key 
Away from me 
Break me free 
You're on my mind 
There's no excuse 
For endless abuse 
'Cause this is the truth 
You're on my mind Take me out 
Dig me out of this hole Pictures of you 
A fading clue 
The love I knew 
You're on my mind 
It's you I need 
Not food or drink 
I'm on the brink 
You're on my mind 
He hid the key 
Away from me 
Break me free 
You're on my mind 
SOS 
I'm in duress 
Nevertheless 
You're on my mind Take me out 
Dig me out of this hole 
Break me out of prison 
Before my parole 
Scared for my health 
With no where to hide 
I'd rather be dead and 
Start over with a fresh life 
Take me out 
Dig me out of this hole
