I remember I was sitting in this little cafe 
Some where out in the middle of L.A. 
It was almost Christmas and I was all alone Suddenly He appeared, hungry, cold and tired 
Headed straight for me, He sat down uninvited 
What was on my mind when I didn't say 
'Cause what He said to me, I think of every Christmas day He said that He was Jesus born in Bethlehem 
And that He died for us but somehow we'd forgotten Him 
Maybe He was lying just above my father's tree 
But He said that He was Jesus and I just had to believe I sat there in stunned silence and when His eyes met mine 
I just pushed my plate to Him and He said, "You're mighty kind" 
And I admit I had my doubts but I just couldn't take the chance 
I know the good book says, "You gotta help your fellow man" And He said that He was Jesus born in Bethlehem 
And that He died for us but somehow we'd forgotten Him 
Maybe He was lying just above my father's tree 
But He said that He was Jesus and I just had to believe I may never know if it was Jesus in that chair 
All I really know is that I'm sure that He was there He said that He was Jesus born in Bethlehem 
And that He died for us but somehow we'd forgotten Him 
Maybe He was lying just above my father's tree 
But He said that He was Jesus and I just had to believe Yep, I was sitting in this little cafe 
Some where out in the middle of L.A. 
It was almost Christmas, I was all alone
