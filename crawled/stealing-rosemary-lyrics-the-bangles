If you need me 
I'll be here 
On my knees 
On my knees In the neighbor's garden 
Where the light is growing long 
Stealing Rosemary for you, my love 
It's the tiny lies I tell For you to please 
You to please 
Early in the morning 
When the light is growing strong Stealing Rosemary for you, my love 
I'm Stealing Rosemary 
Flowers crushing on my skin 
Tuscan Blue All for you 
Caught in rain and running 
Home to you 
I'm coming home Stealing Rosemary for you, my love 
I'm stealing Rosemary for you, my love 
Stealing Rosemary
