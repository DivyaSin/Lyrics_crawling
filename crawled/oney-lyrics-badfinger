Money stole my lady 
Fools have a way of making me crazy 
Money buy you freedom 
Rules have a way of making me lazy [Chorus: x2] 
So we grow a little older 
With another tale to tell 
So we grow a little colder 
With another tale to tell 
Money make you feel unhappy 
Fools have a way of making me crazy
