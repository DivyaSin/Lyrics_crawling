We're soarin', flyin' 
There's not a star in heaven 
That we can't reach If we're trying 
So we're breaking free You know the world can see us 
In a way that's different than who we are 
Creating space between us 
'Til we're separate hearts But your faith it gives me strength 
Strength to believe we're breakin' free 
We're soarin' 
Flyin' 
There's not a star in heaven 
That we can't reach If we're trying 
Yeah, we're breaking free 
Oh, we're breakin' free 
Ohh Can you feel it building 
Like a wave the ocean just can't control' 
Connected by a feeling 
Ohh, in our very souls Rising 'til it lifts us up 
So every one can see we're breakin' free 
We're soarin' 
Flyin' 
There's not a star in heaven 
That we can't reach If we're trying 
Yeah we're breaking free 
Oh we're breakin' free Ohh runnin' 
Climbin' 
To get to that place 
To be all that we can be Now's the time 
So we're breaking free 
We're breaking free 
Ohh, yeah More than hope 
More than faith 
This is true 
This is fate 
And together 
We see it comin' More than you 
More than me 
Not a want, but a need 
Both of us breakin' free Soarin'! 
Flyin' 
There's not a star in heaven 
That we can't reach If we're trying 
Yeah we're breaking free 
Breaking free Were runnin' 
Ohh, climbin' 
To get to the place 
To be all that we can be Now's the time 
Now's the time 
So we're breaking free 
Oh, we're breaking free 
Ohh You know the world can see us 
In a way that's different than who we are
