It happens all the time 
You just never realize 
Like miller says 
Just a plate of shrimp 
Happens every day 
But it's never to be seen 
Part of the cosmic unconsciousness 
Do you know what i mean 
Plate of fucking shrimp 
Fucking plate of shrimp 
Dose his best thinking on the buss 
Driving makes you dummer 
You know who to trust 
Fucking plate of shrimp 
Plate of fucking shrimp
