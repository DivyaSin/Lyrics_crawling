Town clock stopped tickin', but it ain't broken 
Got a problem that no one can define 
While that river keeps on a-flowin' 
Hang on children, it's a matter of time Angry child, impatience growin' 
Waits with her father in that unemployment line 
While that river goes on a-flowin' 
Hang on darlin', it's a matter of time Scarecrow watchin' years of growin' 
With floods of asphalt creepin' closer each time 
While that river goes on a-flowin' 
Hang on brother, it's a matter of time Sparrow, she's sleepin' with now way of knowin' 
What's goin' on inside those telephone lines 
Below, that river keeps on a-flowin' 
Hang on sister it's a matter of time Some say God created man, his likeness showin' 
I do believe they've got it backwards this time 
Somehow that river goes on a-flowin' 
Hang on children, it's a matter of time Tainted river flows to the ocean 
That coughs up on the shore its poisonous brine 
Why don't that river just stop a-flowin' 
Hang on children, it's a matter of time
