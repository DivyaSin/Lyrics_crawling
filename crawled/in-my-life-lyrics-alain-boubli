COSETTE 
How strange 
This feeling that my life's begun at last 
This change, 
Can people really fall in love so fast? 
What's the matter with you, Cosette? 
Have you been too much on your own? 
So many things unclear 
So many things unknown. In my life 
There are so many questions and answers 
That somehow seem wrong 
In my life 
There are times when I catch in the silence 
The sigh of a faraway song 
And it sings 
Of a world that I long to see 
Out of reach 
Just a whisper away 
Waiting for me. Does he know I'm alive? 
Do I know if he's real? 
Does he see what I saw? 
Does he feel what I feel? In my life 
I'm no longer alone 
Now the love in my life 
Is so near 
Find me now, find me here! VALJEAN 
Dear Cosette, 
You're such a lonely child 
How pensive, how sad you seem to me 
Believe me, were it within my power 
I'd fill each passing hour 
How quiet it must be, I can see 
With only me for company. COSETTE 
There's so little I know 
That I'm longing to know 
Of the child that I was 
In a time long ago... 
There's so little you say 
Of the life you have known 
Why you keep to yourself 
Why we're always alone 
So dark! So dark and deep... 
The secrets that you keep! In my life 
I have all that I want 
You are loving and gentle and good 
But Papa, dear Papa, 
In your eyes I am just like a child 
Who is lost in a wood VALJEAN 
No more words 
No more words. It's a time that is dead 
There are words 
That are better unheard, 
Better unsaid. COSETTE 
In my life 
I'm no longer a child and I yearn 
For the truth that you know 
Of the years... years ago! VALJEAN 
You will learn 
Truth is given by God 
To us all in our time 
In our turn (Valjean leaves the garden. Marius and Eponine arrive outside) MARIUS 
In my life 
She has burst like the music of angels 
The light of the sun 
And my life seems to stop 
As if something is over 
And something has scarcely begun. 
Eponine 
You're the friend who has brought me here 
Thanks to you I am one with the gods 
And Heaven is near! 
And I soar through a world that is new that is free EPONINE(to herself) 
Every word that he says is a dagger in me! 
In my life 
There's been no one like him anywhere 
Anywhere, where he is... 
If he asked... I'd be his MARIUS & EPONINE 
In my life 
There is someone who touches my life MARIUS 
Waiting near EPONINE 
Waiting here A Heart Full of Love (Marius goes into the garden, leaving Eponine outside the gate) MARIUS 
A heart full of love 
A heart full of song 
I'm doing everything all wrong 
Oh God, for shame 
I do not even know your name 
Dear Mad'moiselle 
Won't you say? 
Will you tell? COSETTE 
A heart full of love 
No fear, no regret M, ARIUS 
My name is Marius Pontmercy COSETTE 
And mine's Cosette MARIUS 
Cosette, I don't know what to say COSETTE 
Then make no sound MARIUS 
I am lost COSETTE 
I am found! MARIUS 
A heart full of light COSETTE 
A night bright as day MARIUS 
And you must never go away 
Cosette, Cosette COSETTE 
This is a chain we'll never break MARIUS 
Do I dream? COSETTE 
I'm awake! MARIUS 
A heart full of love COSETTE 
A heart full of you MARIUS 
A single look and then I knew COSETTE 
I knew it too MARIUS 
From today COSETTE 
Every day COSETTE & MARIUS 
For it isn't a dream 
Not a dream after all. EPONINE(Interjecting) 
He was never mine to lose 
Why regret what cannot be? 
These are words he'll never say 
Not to me... 
Not to me... 
Not to me... His heart full of love 
He will never feel this way...
