[Verse 1] 
Outside we're lonely but we are free 
We're misfits, rebels, we're creeps and freaks 
How come they've got it figured out 
Well we're lost, waiting to be found 
Maybe we need something different now [Pre-Chorus] 
For every broken bone and every lie you've told 
Every time you're lost and you can't find hope 
This is for the ones who always feel alone [Chorus] 
We are outsiders 
Living inside a broken world 
We are outsiders 
And I know sometimes it can hurt 
But it gets better yeah we'll make it through 
We'll stay golden when we're black and blue 
We are outsiders 
But we're not hiding anymore 
This is who we really are [Verse 2] 
Inside the dark about all the plans 
Must be nice to have someone light your path 
But inside their hearts are breaking 
Cause they don't know what they're missing 
Outside we're lonely but we are free [Pre-Chorus] 
For every broken bone and every lie you've told 
Every time you're lost and you can't find hope 
This is for the ones who always feel alone [Chorus] 
We are outsiders 
Living inside a broken world 
We are outsiders 
And I know sometimes it can hurt 
But it gets better yeah we'll make it through 
We'll stay golden when we're black and blue 
We are outsiders 
But we're not hiding anymore 
This is who we really are [Bridge] 
For every broken bone and every lie you've told 
Every time you're lost and you can't find hope 
This is for the ones who always feel alone [Chorus] 
We are outsiders 
Living inside a broken world 
We are outsiders 
And I know sometimes it can hurt 
But it gets better yeah we'll make it through 
We'll stay golden when we're black and blue 
We are outsiders 
But we're not hiding anymore 
This is who we really are
