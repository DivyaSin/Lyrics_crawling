Have you been to the desert? 
Have you walked with the dead? 
There's a hundred thousand children being killed for their bread And the figures don't lie they speak of human disease 
But we do what we want and we think what we please Have you lived the experience? 
Have you witnessed the plague? 
People making babies sometimes just to escape 
In this land of competition the compassion is gone 
Yet we ignore the needy and we keep pushing on 
We keep pushing on This is just a punk rock song 
Written for the people who can see something's wrong 
Like ants in a colony we do our share 
But there's so many other fuckin' insects out there 
And this is just a punk rock song 
(like workers in a company we do our share 
But there's so many other fuckin' robots out there) Have you visited the quagmire? 
Have you swam in the shit? 
The party conventions and the real politic 
The faces always different, the rhetoric the same 
But we swallow it, and we see nothing change 
Nothing has changed 10 million dollars on a losing campaign 
20 million starving and writhing in pain 
Big strong people unwilling to give 
Small in vision and perspective 
One in five kids below the poverty line 
One population runnin' out of time
