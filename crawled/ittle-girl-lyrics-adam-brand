Darling one day you will know 
Why it is that you must go 
Why tomorrow you will be 
So far away from me 
Maybe then we'll understand 
how easily The time between 
the sweetest love and bitter tears 
Can be measured in your tender years Some would say the world is lost 
In court rooms as the details 
Of the custody and court costs 
Are read aloud to the parties 
I believe my world is saved 
By a little girl watching her daddy shave Standing there without a care 
Watching daddy through your hair 
Suddenly I recognise 
What used to be your mother's eyes
