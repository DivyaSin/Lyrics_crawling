Ok lets go... 
Cops try to stall me 
People wanna brawl me 
Tough stay outta my way 
Shes such a different girl in the middle of the world 
But i love her anyway 
it doesnt make a difference 
make a difference what they say 
'cause in the very end im fuckin loaded every day 
im fucking loaded 
but i still love the way we fight 
because i know it 
she sent a letter out tonight 
because i like it 
the stars are shinin out so bright 
dont tell us where to die 
rock stars don't get cought 
its ok 'cause shell make you part of her plan 
run, shoot, steal the loot 
? american skin 
hey hey keep her in the pit 
be careful what you say 
'cause in the very end im fuckin loaded every day
