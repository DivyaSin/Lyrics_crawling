Days are gone 
Days are long and youre 
Youre looking older 
Over your shoulder Youre never wrong 
Carry on and youre 
You want your baby to want you 
Now youre stuck in a corner, yeah Your oceans drying out 
Dont let your sun go down Made a start 
With the holes in your heart and youre 
Youre feeling much stronger 
Your baby she wants you Youre always the same 
Youre always to blame and youre 
You pray for the weekend 
Now in at the deep end, yeah Your oceans drying out 
Dont let your sun go down Sunday mornings, gone away 
Theyll be back someday Your oceans drying out 
Dont let your sun go down 
Your oceans drying out 
Dont let your sun go down Sunday mornings, gone away 
Theyll be back someday, yeah, yeah 
Sunday mornings, gone away 
Theyll be back someday
