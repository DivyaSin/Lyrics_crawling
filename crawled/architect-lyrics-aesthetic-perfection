im standing here in this place alone 
i often wonder will there be an ending to this 
one by one i watch them fall 
to dust to rise and then collapse again decide 
is this my lifes design 
the only reason to believe it 
is to watch how the common come 
waiting for their lives to burn out although some things collapse with time 
we still stop to stare back at the ashes 
as structures burn and statues fall 
ill still be standing here for now...
