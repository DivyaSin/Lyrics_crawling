*All cuts by DJ Revolution* "This is a revolution shoot" "Let me show ya exactly how it's properly done" 
"Sit back and learn" 
"Let me show ya exactly how it's properly done" 
"And yes ya'll" "This for your own concern" 
"Let me show ya exactly how it's properly done" 
"Class is in session so you can stop guessin" [KRS-One] 
"Let me show ya exactly how it's properly done" 
"Lights, camera, action!" [Ahmad] 
They tryin to get us off the bat like heavy hitters 
But my squad ain't goin for it, Charlie the Rainer is you wit us? 
We upset it how you did us, laughin at em tryin to kid us 
And vow to tear it up like Home Alone without the sitters 
So the first one steppin up will be the first one I'm gettin rid of 
While you fakin Al Capone, I make the hits like Frankie Nitta 
Ya'll rappers gon' remember me, of course you can't forget, I'm from the west 
Where we be battle-rappin off a doo-ah-ditta 
Even Sway and Tech admit-a 
Wake Up Show and skills, I never sleep, I never quit-a 
The dopest, don't be bitter 
Adopted a new motto: No retreat and no surrender 
I'm the champ and I been lookin for the number one contender, like that *Cut up* "The Wake Up Show" [Chali 2na] 
No longer of thugs and pimps and style 
What we continue the tension like the Simpson Trial 
Wake Up Show, come to class just to pass the test 
Or be on your deathbed, givin last request 
Sway and Tech keep you listenin 
Bringin hip hop discipline 
Makin it hot, takin the plot from Lake Michigan 
Fisherman been mature, suckers who miniature 
That be faker than Cabbage Patch dolls without the signature 
Witness your destruction, when I bust ten 
Men die while the ink from my pen dry 
Tryin to make ends by words not crack rocks 
If raps are plane crash, my rhyme's the black box, like that [Kurupt] 
Raw dog for sure, paw core 
Supposed to know that 
Golden paw, wha what wha what what! 
Sway and Tech, wha what wha what what! 
Yo, try me *nigga*, the new millennium came 
I'm invincible wit my abdaminium frame 
Deminigon, tenagon poetical pentagon 
None silence, *mothafuckers* unbalanced 
Get ya calicos, WAR? SURE 
I heard a million MC's, ain't none raw 
Kurupt spit brimstone, fire and magma 
Magnums and multi-minis in multi-cities "Let me show ya..." 
"Let me show ya..." 
"Let me show ya exactly how it's properly done" [Mos Def] 
Forward on the 2G's, yo I don't ease 
My style's so deep it make the police freeze 
Seize domestic and land overseas 
From the hard Brooklyn to the breeze in Belise 
Ya gotta give me mine, no "Can I applease" 
Sway and King Tech keep green like palm trees 
Transmitted globally, I'm Mos Def, you hopefully 
Calm, ain't sayin much, they catchin nuts like a ovary 
WAKE UP!!! [Crooked Eye/Tech N9NE] 
Light em up, blow em out, light em up 
Sway and Tech, rider, Sway and Tee-zay 
Crooked Eye's the don-datta 
No worries, hacuna matata 
A couple of verbal shots to hit your medula ablingalla 
I'm Donald Goines character Kenyatta 
On the Wake Up Show, beatin these rappers like a Tiajuana pinata 
My ish, flip and kick like Jim Carter 
From Bambatta to Crooked Eye, hip hop never die like Madonna 
My rap receital is fact receital was Kane and Abel 
Rock a rapper's cradle, even the ones signed to my label 
Get broken, I'm open like the eyes of insomniacs 
Standin on the corner, in big game hunters in Dodger hats "Let me show ya exactly how it's properly done" 
"Sway and Tech" [Guru] 
"And of course" 
"On production and the scratch" "DJ!" "Revolution" 
"It's the Wake Up Show" "You SUCKAS!!!" [KRS-One]
