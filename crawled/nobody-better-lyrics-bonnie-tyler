I guess that you could say experience is mine 
It's the only way to know where to draw the line 
On what you really want and what you feel ain't good enough And when I get something good I never let it go 
And you're the one I want, I got to let you know 
You got it all, no one could ask for more Nobody can love me like you do 
Nobody can touch me like you do 
When it comes to love 
There's nobody better than you It's not the way you move, it's not the way you talk 
It's not the way you look or the way you walk 
It's something in you eyes makes me feel satisfied Oh, when you came into my life you set my heart on fire 
And if I said, I'd loved before, you know I'd be a liar Nobody can love me like you do 
Nobody can touch me like you do 
When it comes to love 
There's nobody better than you 
Nobody better than you Nobody better 
(Nobody better) 
Nobody better 
(Nobody better than you) 
Nobody better 
(Nobody better) 
Nobody better 
(Nobody better than you, oh yeah) I can't get enough, I must confess 
I can't believe my luck and I know it's gonna last And nobody can love me like you do 
Nobody can touch me like you do 
'Cause when it comes to love 
There's nobody better than you 
Oh, nobody better Love me like you do 
(Nobody better) 
Touch me like you do 
When it comes to love 
There's nobody better than you 
(Oh, nobody better than you) Nobody better 
Nobody better 
Nobody better
