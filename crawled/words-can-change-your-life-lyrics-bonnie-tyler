Words are all that we can say 
They change your life or just a day 
It all depends upon the way 
We say them Words can sparkle like a star 
In a letter from afar 
It doesn't matter where you are 
They touch you Words dancing in your head 
Words you'd wish you'd said 
When you hod the chance 
To say them Words whispered in the night 
Makes the world seem right 
When you're looking 
For the answers Words, when the day has gone 
Sometimes linger on 
And haunt you like a love song Words, words we mean to say 
Somehow slip away 
Tell me why they stay 
Behind our lips Words can be the sweetest song 
The kind that makes you sing along 
When everything is going wrong 
Around you Words, words can change your life 
Cut you like a knife 
Even though he really loves you Words, when the day has gone 
Sometimes linger on 
And haunt you like a love song Words, words we mean to say 
Somehow slip away 
Tell me why they stay 
Behind our lips Words, when the day has gone 
Sometimes linger on 
And haunt you like a love song
