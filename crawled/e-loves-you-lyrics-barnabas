Well, take a look around; tell me, what do you see? 
The world's fallin' apart like one, two, three 
Or maybe you think everything's all right 
You ain't got no need to "see the light" 
Well, no matter who you are 
A bum in the gutter, or a rock n' roll star 
He loves you Now you might wonder if we're talking to you 
Because God wouldn't want you with the things you do 
But that's not the way that Jesus is 
He loves us all, and what a love He gives 
Hey, no matter what you've done 
Or what you do, you can be His son 
He loves you Well, you don't have to change your ways 
Just give your life to Him and you'll be amazed 
If we could be good we wouldn't need Him 
That's why He died; to pay for our sin 
Just ask the Lord to be your friend 
He'll give you peace and forgive your sin 
He loves you
