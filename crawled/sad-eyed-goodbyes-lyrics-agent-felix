this wont hurt I swear 
but please dont close your eyes 
as i climb out of them 
to see your face again darling 
wont recover from the fall 
wont bother to try 
cause there is no reason to 
when the fall was in to love with you we'll fall asleep when the street lights come on 
wake up at 3 a.m. hey baby come on 
walk to the beach 
watch the sun rise from the sea 
new light will swallow the stars 
painting pictures straight from dreams i'll turn out the light 
and leave you with a kiss 
i hate these rooms apart 
even though its not very far but still 
goodnight is like goodbye 
you say don't leave i say i wish 
another lonely night 
i had to leave you with sad eyes sometimes our dreams dont seem so far 
but then i wake up and i just can't seem to reach 
but when i leave you know i'm not that far 
so many lessons life has yet had time to teach
