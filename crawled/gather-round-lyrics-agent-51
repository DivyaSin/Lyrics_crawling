You're right, I should fight 
And jump around tonight 
But got no will left, this place took it all 
Win, lose, take a walk in my shoes 
Tell me, which side would you end up on? 
Gather round - won't let 'em stomp us to the ground 
It's just another fantasy - gather round 
Gather round - ya better get up or stand down 
It's just another fantasy - gather round 
Don't you even try to tell me 
What's goin' on around me 
I got my own eyes I can see 
No time for discrimination 
No racial segregation 
No right, no wrong, just you and me 
Been tryin' to find a reason to live my life 
It's only gettin' harder now just to get by. 
But I know if we gather round it'll be all right 
You see the only way to get things done 
The only way to do it is to act as one 
So get up now! 
The battle's begun
