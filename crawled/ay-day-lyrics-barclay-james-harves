The rock on which I stand is slowly sinking in the sand 
The sheer realities of life are rushing by 
I am looking out at life and I don't know what's wrong or right 
And I can't even see the bright side of the moon I stopped a man in the street today 
And I asked him "Sir, is it night or day?" 
He just stared (smiled) in disbelief 
I asked again but he walked away 
He said "Don't you know?" 
I said "Can't you say? Is there something inbetween? 
Is it something I've not seen? 
Did it change so fast or was it just a dream?" Time and time again I've tried to recreate the past few days 
Evaluate the constants from the haze 
But every time I think I'm right, they say I'm wrong 
"This day is night and night is day - 
It's there in black and white" 
Night is light and dark is day 
If I disagree they say I'm insane 
And the treatment will begin 
If I say that the day is light 
They just point my eyes to the blinding night, saying 
"We can't set you free if you always disagree, 
So the State is going to pay your doctor's fee" They put me out in the pouring rain 
To enjoy the sun or to feel the pain 
Of the nightmare life's become 
I asked a man in the street today 
Or was it yesterday or the day before? 
"Is there something I've not seen? 
Is there something inbetween? 
Did it change so fast or was it just a dream?" The rock on which I stand is now beneath the ever-flowing sand 
The sheer realities are here to stay 
I'm looking out at life and now I know what's wrong and right 
It's what you hear and what you read and what they say I saw a man in the street today 
Ask another man "Is it night or day?" 
He just stared (smiled) in disbelief 
He said "Friend, it's your lucky day 
I'm a party man, won't you step this way?" 
I've got something you've not seen 
Now I know it's not a dream 
It just came so fast, that something inbetween
