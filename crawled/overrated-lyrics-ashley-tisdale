Yeah, oh 
I passed my reflection, It's someone else 
I see your invention and not myself 
I turned into your perfect girl, a total stranger 
Now I see and I don't want to Be you and it's all just an act 
And it's overrated 
The truth is I'm wanting me back 
Cause I can't take this 
I gotta be who I am underneath 
Who I gave up so you'll believe 
Me and you and it's all just an act It's overrated, so overrated I let you control me, oh so you thought 
Don't think that you're perfect, just don't misstep 
I hid away the best of me, too scared you'd notice 
Now I do and I'm not going to Be you and it's all just an act 
And it's overrated 
The truth is I'm wanting me back 
Cause I can't take this 
I gotta be who I am underneath 
Who I gave up so you'll believe 
Me and you and it's all just an act It's overrated Changing for a guy (overrated) 
Living in a lie (It's overrated) 
Always asking why (so overrated) Oh, oh 
The mirror is shattered, I'm finally free Be you and it's all just an act 
And it's overrated 
The truth is I'm wanting me back 
Cause I can't take this 
I gotta be who I am underneath 
Who I gave up so you'll believe 
Me and you and it's all just an act Oh, it's overrated, yeah
