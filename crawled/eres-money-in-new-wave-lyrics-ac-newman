Someday things will be familiar streets 
All the half built houses gone to home. 
You will know what no one teaches you 
Now well see that kids need learning 
Hoping that I have some good advice. 
Something you could win with something true, 
Not exactly sure just what Id do. 
You think its rock and roll or something, 
I know what to tell you. 
That theres many in new way 
That I hope you know I love you 
We wont have to go home pretty again. Someday things will be familiar streets, 
All the other things turning in your head. 
Whistling through your life and wave that wing 
What currently called science fiction, 
I dont want to tell you that theres many new way 
And I will deserve the blind stare, 
We wont have to go home pretty again, 
I dont want to tell you 
That theres many in new way 
And I will deserve the blind stare, 
We wont have to go home pretty again. Its the break out, its brand new, open wide, 
Break out, brand new, open wide. 
Break out, brand new, open wide.
