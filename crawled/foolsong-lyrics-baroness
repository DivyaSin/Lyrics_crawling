That fool who digs his own grave 
Im still trying to find my way out! 
But if its the long way 
Ill sleep in this bed Ive made. The kids have fallen on blades 
Its too late to figure out 
Its too late for babies to beg for their beds Its too late to ignore the storm up ahead 
Its too dark to see my way out 
Now all I can do about anything wrong 
Is dig further down 
Further down When we finally awake 
Well burn our bodies on stakes 
A tower of ashes and sawdust will lie 
Where our castles were made
