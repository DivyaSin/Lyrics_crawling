Hey kids, we got a new white devil 
And it goes in your fucking nose 
That's right, we got a new white devil 
This is how the story goes 
Story goes Watch out! Glorify, glamorize 
Try to forget your sunken eyes 
Your dead fad is a disaster 
Your fashion is my fucking cancer 
Not so fun when your nose is sore 
Bloody Kleenex all over the floor 
But don't worry, who gives a shit? 
All your friends will think you're really hip Your dead fad is a fucking disaster Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in, yeah [Repeat: x7] Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in this year Looks so good 
Convulsing on the floor, ya sugar! 
And the blood from your nose 
Matches your lipstick shade Look what you have become 
White devil, white devil, white devil [Repeat: x3] White devil [Repeat: x8]
