[Snoop Dogg] 
Shabba-dabba-doo 
Bad Azz,this is another Dogghouse experience 
Uh,feels good in here Baby 
Yoo-haa,ha-ha [Chorus] 
If a busta ran up on you 
Bad Azz tell me what would you do 
We get Ready 2 Bang 
That Dogghouse Gangsta Gang,ahh ahow 
Psycho like no Dogghouse niggaz 
So fire up the doo-doo 
We get Ready 2 Bang 
That Dogghouse Gangsta Gang,Westcoast [Verse 1] 
Holla at a playa when you see me in the streets 
I'm often traffic tryin' to get it 'cause a nigga gotta eat 
We can holla if it's 'bout fillin' my plate 
I feel like killin' somebody when a nigga ain't late 
It's about weight,when you workin' smart shit it don't flip right 
Put the wrong ties and dees it won't slip right 
Get the wrong blunt for the weed it won't hit right 
And money don't grow on trees so what I look like 
Make moves,can't lose if I do it that way 
Fuck a fight,ain't nobody fin' to put they gat away 
That's fast lane,lil' kids here to blow your head away 
Holla at a playa when you see me in the streets 
Who got the cell phones for sale,who got it crackin' with the heat 
Who got the club with the top shop and parks for cars 
The Ese homies do the paint and body shop in the yard 
Who got the hook-up with the burned out 2 way pagers 
Can you give me a vest or a infrared laser 
See me,I'm just a smart brother everything made for [Chorus]
