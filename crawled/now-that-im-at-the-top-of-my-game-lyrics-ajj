There was a time 
When I would unravel 
And drown in the snow 
There was a time 
When getting murdered 
Would feel like a joke 
But I'm Alive 
Don't let me die 
Now that I'm at the top of my game There was a time 
When I'd apologize 
When I should have been saying 'Thank You' 
Times when I'd be filled with shame 
Over things that everybody goes through 
But now I'm free 
I like being me 
Now that I'm at the top 
Now that I'm at the top 
Now that I'm at the top of my game I get stronger 
With every punch 
And every kick 
And every rock that hits my back 
And every time that I get sick 
Oh I get stronger too There is still times when I feel sad as hell 
And there are times I downright scare myself 
Times when the rage inside me swells 
Into a big black tidal wave 
And I feel like an idiot 
But I know I can deal with it 
Now that I'm at the top 
Now that I'm at the top 
Now that I'm at the top of my game
