Good eats smells tickled my nose 
In the morning as the sun rose 
Had a great big bite of green tail 
But I couldn't chew through those tough scales 
So I called up el Vaca de Spacio 
He taught me cow, so I finally know 
How to say "moo" on the moon Heart beats fast in my caffeine dream 
I can't sleep in my caffeine dream 
Palms get wet in my caffeine dream 
Open up my eyes, caffeine dream! They told me that it could not be done 
But I made headlines when I froze the sun 
And sold scoops of it for $9.99 
Yeah it's spicy but the taste's divine 
It was so cold we set the moon on fire 
Through the icy air came the angel's choir 
Singing "Hey who burned the cheese?"
