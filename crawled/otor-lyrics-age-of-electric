All the bad weather in our veins 
Comatose in strobe who complains 
Take the edge off too uptight 
Bored and loose from bitter spite 
What starts your engine, Do people 
Buy their way in for the ride? 
Motor, Motor, I'd be lost at any other speed 
Motor, Motor, In my space is the place for me 
People try to tell me what's best 
Drive by weakness in their myths 
I haven't driven it this far, By 
Jumping on every star * 
We can't grow untwisted, Everyone 
Has their opinion, I wish they'd keep 'em 
Motor, Motor, I'd be lost at any other speed 
Motor, Motor, In my space is the place to be 
In my space is the place for me
