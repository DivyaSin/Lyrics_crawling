Patient anticipation 
Up 'til now I be hurry up and waiting 
At a bus stop in independence licking an ice cream cone 
I've been kicking I've been scheming 
This is as close as I've been to leaving 
Five blocks away, a stone's throw away from home 
But I'm as good as gone I gotta get gone, gone, gone 
Shooting like a gun, a gun, a gun 
Skipping like stone, stone, stone 
Far as I can run to where freedom is free 
There's a road like a long gray ribbon far as I can see 
And it's pulling independence out of me Emancipation or paper chasing 
Leaving with question marks and Momma's blessing 
I put her picture in my pocket along with her rosary 
Some say I'm crazy, a little loco 
And most of my friends will live and die in this zip code 
It might be for me but until I go 
How am I supposed to know? I gotta get gone, gone, gone 
Shooting like a gun, a gun, a gun 
Skipping like stone, stone, stone 
Far as I can run to where freedom is free 
There's a road like a long gray ribbon far as I can see I'm busting out of independence 
Independence is busting out of me 
I'm busting out of independence 
Independence is busting out of me I gotta get gone, gone, gone 
Shooting like a gun, a gun, a gun 
Skipping like stone, stone, stone 
Far as I can run to where freedom is free 
There's a road like a long gray ribbon far as I can see 
There's a road like a long gray ribbon far as I can see 
And it's pulling independence out of me. 
Independence.
