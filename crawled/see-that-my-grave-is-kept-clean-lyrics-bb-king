Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you 
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you 
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you

Did you ever hear them church bells tone 
Means another poor boy is dead and gone Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold 
And, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold 
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold

And there's one last favor I'll ask of you
