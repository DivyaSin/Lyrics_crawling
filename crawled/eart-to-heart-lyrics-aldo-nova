There's a girl in the street 
You should see the tears in her eyes 
'Cause she weeps, for a man who told her lies 
And the man that she loved 
Left here for somebody new 
And the girl, she dreams 
That if only they could've seen Heart to heart, oh, Eye to eye 
Love is a lie 
Heart to heart, oh, Eye to eye 
Love is a lie 
One day he's gonna pay There's a man down the street 
You can't see the pain in his heart 
And he weeps, for a love that he has lost 
And the man left a love 
To go and ind somebody new 
Like the girl in his dream 
Now if they only could've seen Heart to heart, oh, Eye to eye (A) 
Love is a lie 
Heart to heart, oh, Eye to eye 
Love is a lie 
One day she's gonna pay 
One day she's gonna pay
