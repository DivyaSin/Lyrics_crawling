Catch me if you can 
When I come your way 
Catch me if you can 
I'm falling like the rain 
Everyday I see you 
But you're so far away 
Every way I love you 
Don't you know I love you so 
I would never ever let you go 
I am yours 
Whenever you want me 
I am yours whenever you need me 
All I do is dream of you 
All through the night 
Will I ever hold you 
Don't you know I love you so 
I would never ever let you go
