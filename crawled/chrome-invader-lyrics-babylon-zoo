I'm wired for weird and I'm on attack 
My life tastes delicious 
Somebody told me I was Asian trash 
Man I'd like to listen to the words you had to say 
It's like a bullet lodged in my head 
Time to listen, what you're missin' 
I'm just a rock'n'roll superman 
Do you know who you are, who you are 
I'm a laser-guided superstar 
Who you are, who you are 
I'm a juvenile in a cage 
A cosmetic boy insane Return of the Chrome Invader 
Asian kid with eyes electric blue 
There's nothing he can't do, oh oh 
Calling the Chrome Invader 
Cosmic kid with all the latest moves 
He's a crazy dude, oh oh oh 
I'm a King Kong Groover on an ego trip 
With atomic vision 
Somebody told me I was fortunately hip 
Man I'd like to listen to the words you had to say 
It's like a bullet lodged in my head 
Time to listen, what you're missin' 
I'm just a rock'n'roll superman 
Do you know who you are, who you are 
I'm a laser-guided superstar 
Who you are, who you are 
I'm a juvenile in a cage 
A cosmetic boy insane Return of the Chrome Invader 
Asian kid with eyes electric blue 
There's nothing he can't do, oh oh 
Calling the Chrome Invader 
Cosmic kid with all the latest moves 
He's a crazy dude, oh oh oh Hidden in his eyes is the love that's no surprise 
But are we all too young to die, 
Are we all too young to die 
Hidden in his eyes is the love that's no surprise 
But are we all too young to die, 
Are we all too young to die
