Hey driver, where we're going? 
I swear my nerves are showing 
Set your hopes up way too high 
The living's in the way we die Comes the morning and the headlights fade away 
Hundred thousand people, I'm the one they blame 
I've been waiting long for one of us to say 
Save the darkness, let it never fade away Ah, ah, the living daylights 
Ah, ah, the living daylights All right, hold on tight now 
It's down, down to the wire 
Set your hopes way too high 
The living's in the way we die Comes the morning and the headlights fade away 
Hundred thousand changes, everything's the same 
I've been waiting long for one of us to say 
Save the darkness, let it never fade away Ah, ah, the living daylights 
Ah, ah, the living daylights 
Ah, ah, the living daylights Comes the morning and the headlights fade away 
Hundred thousand people, I'm the one they frame Ah, ah, the living daylights 
Ah, ah, the living daylights 
Ah, ah, the living daylights Set your hopes up way too high 
The living's in the way we die
