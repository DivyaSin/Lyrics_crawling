Bust a move with what you can 
Dead phone machine piled on the table 
Disappointment is a feather in your cap 
You want the truth 
Not when it's unplanned There's no map 
That could tell you where you are 
You're in between things 
That only go halfway 
You want the best 
You want contests 
Where everybody loses on purpose by mistake
