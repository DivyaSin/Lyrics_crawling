I find it hard to speak sometimes, my words are broken lines. 
Your heart is patient and so is mine. That's not enough to make it through the winter oh no. 
I wish I had a way with words. 
The words i've built up, i written page after page. 
I can't get enough, so stay won't you stay with me. My heart and my head don't always agree. 
My head will say to walk away, but my heart just won't leave. That's not enough to make it through the winter oh no. 
I wish I had a way with words. 
The words I've built up, I've written page after page. 
I can't get enough, so stay won't you stay. 
My heart won't let me, I can't decide, I can't decide. 
It tries to protect me, I can't decide, I can't decide. And you can't trust my heart, cause it will always let you down. 
Get over these feelings, or get out of this town. 
So I guess I'm left, to clean up the mess when you're gone. When you're gone. The words I've built up, I've written page after page, I can't get enough, so say won't you stay won't you stay. The world I've built up, I've written page after page, I can't get enough, so stay won't you stay. My heart won't let me, I can't decide, I can't decide. IT tries to protect me, I can't decide, I can't decide.
