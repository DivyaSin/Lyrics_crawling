combat depression rules the world (and its killing you) 
you'll live more life without anxiety ridden hidden pain 
gotta get in gotta get out gotta get what's coming back to you 
its time to reinvent, 'cause what you got is all whacked and in an alcoholic driven car, 
you know you drive yourself mad 
just like you frightened away, 
the only love that you had 
you're so green to confidence 
you're so blue to happiness 
you're so on my nerves you dumb silly bitch 
its time for you to stand up and say, 
damn i just want to be heard! 
(at 33 1/3!) welcome to the revelation revolution my friend you've got the best advice around (but do you follow it) 
got your two-cents to buy the world (but your short some) 
got a gift got a back got so many goddamn people watching you 
but you're so saddy-wad, you make me so sick... don't let them see you cry 
dent let them watch you fall 
if you're supposed to be the rock 
then you're supposed to cover it all welcome to the revelation revolution my friend
