You think the world will melt if you whistle 
There's a certain spring in your stride 
You face the future like a heat-seeking missile 
You've got yourself a smile a mile wide (Yes, you have) Viva love 
Viva love, viva love, viva love 
Viva love 
Viva, viva 
Viva love When lightning strikes you don't look for shelter 
You're floating free, gravity defied 
It's hell for leather on a helter skelter 
Just steel your nerves for a bright white knuckle ride Viva love 
Viva love, viva love, viva love 
Viva love 
Viva, viva 
Viva love 
Viva love, viva love, viva love 
Viva love 
Viva, viva 
Viva love In the battle of the sexes 
Victory's denied 
I'm charging your tanks 
With slingshots and knives My troops they retreat 
And run for their lives 
I'm facing defeat 
But somehow love survives Viva love 
Viva love, viva love, viva love 
Viva love 
Viva, viva 
Viva love 
Viva love, viva love, viva love 
Viva love 
Viva, viva 
Viva love Viva love
