Don't think you could stop it now 
I'd like to see you try somehow 
Realize that it puts it all on you 
There's nothing you can do Right now you're sick and tired 
You're feeling sad, you're feeling uninspired 
And the clock just won't slow down 
Like it gets it kicks pushing you around, you around Maybe in the morning it won't be 
Quite as bad as it seems But the fact that you can't change 
The speed of sound, the rate of age 
Is an understatement to 
A state of mind your not used to, used to You'd be forever known 
As the boy who stopped the world and made his own Right now you're sick and tired 
You're feeling sad, feeling uninspired 
So I pray for you my friend 
That you'll fall down, you'll give in, you'll give in
