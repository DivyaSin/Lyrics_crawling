There's a spirit floating on the water 
There's a shadow lying down by the shore 
Wasn't he there a year before? 
A sacrifice for the coat he's wearing 
A 'paradise' for the lady who dare's 
Colour him red upon the shore 
We carry the burden upon our shoulder 
We carry their lives in the palm of our hand 
Don't you care about the state you're in 
Or don't you understand? 
See the spirit floating on the water 
See the shadow lying down by the shore 
Wasn't he there some years before? 
We carry the burden upon our shoulder 
We carry their lives in the palm of our hand 
Don't you care about the state you're in 
Or don't you understand?
