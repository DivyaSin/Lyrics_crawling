Yo, you Eddie check this out here...) 
Why is it everytime I see your face 
It's only when I got gas in my Chevy? 
There's something strange about that... 
What's up!!? (It's just a...) Hook: 
Missunderstanding I'm not so demanding 
Never will you play with my heart 
Missunderstanding I don't know 
What you're planning 
Never will you tear me apart I know I must be dreaming, 
All these brand new friends 
And I've never seen such clever ways 
To make amends 
You never know who's scheming... 
...Is she out for self? 
Nowadays you've got to be protected 
And it's not for health Don't you know she drives me crazy... 
...Does she like my walk 
Or maybe all she knows is that money talks 
(Money, money, money!) 
It's a shame the way it is, 
I really like her smile 
I'd like to get to know her 
'Cause she drives me wild! Bridge: 
Can you tell me why (hey) you need diamonds, 
You need pearls 
And I gotta buy 'em, oh I've got to buy 'em 
Don't you know (don't you know) to be my lady 
(To by my lady) 
Drive my Mercedes (Drive my Mercedes) 
Start giving me that lovin' hey Hook (repeat) Can't you read between the lines? 
I never go for self 
Should I try to sleep the lady 
And misuse my wealth? 
I don't know the times have changed, 
I can't sell out 
I grew up doing right and I won't throw it out! Bridge (repeat) Hook (repeat) Yo Eddie F. are you in here? (Yeah!) 
Ha ha ha yeah I thought so 
Sounding swell you know what I'm saying? (Yeah!) 
You know what time it is now right? 
Nevelle...get funky!!! 
Missunderstanding, missunderstanding 
Missunderstanding, that's all it is Hook (repeat)
