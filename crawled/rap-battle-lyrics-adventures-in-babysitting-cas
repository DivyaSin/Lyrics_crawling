Jenny: 
Hello, my name is Jenny Parker and these kids are my crew 
We're in a lot of trouble and I'm not sure what to do 
See it all started, when our phones made a switch. 
Lola lied to the parents, she's been a real witch. 
Kid snuck out, the kitchen caught fire, 
The car got towed, all because she's a liar. Bobby: 
Now these bad guys are chasing us. Katie: 
We almost just died. Emily: 
I got a tattoo. Lola: 
Can you let that one slide? Jenny: 
This girl is ruining my life, my job, my reputation 
And if we ever get home, I'm gonna need a vacation. 
But no matter what, I won't be a quitter 
Gonna care for these kids, cause I'm a ba-by-sitter. Everyone: 
She ain't no quitter 
She's the babysitter 
(Repeat x4) Lola: 
Hold up just a minute, that's not the straight scoop. 
This girl's so uptight, she's all tied in a loop. DJ: 
Ooh, looks like we have ourselves a battle of the babysitters. Lola: 
Uh, let's rewind this movie an hour or two. 
The kid snuck out, I didn't have a clue. (Trey: Yeah, That's true) 
Okay I admit it, I don't follow rules 
I'm not good with kids, I'm not good at school. 
It wasn't my plan to steal a car, 
Or end up in jail or take it this far. 
It's true, I lied, but nobody's died 
And these kids are having an incredible ride. Jenny: 
You think you know it all, but you don't know me. 
See I'm more than just, Miss Spelling Bee. Lola: 
Wanna be a real artist: Take pictures, get gritty, 
On your first night out in the big, bad city. 
You're a cool girl Jenny, but I'm pretty cool too. 
In fact, I'm just as great a babysitter as you, HA. Jenny: 
She's right. I'm smart and I do follow rules, 
I work real hard, and I care about school. 
There's a time for fun, to let go and climb trees, 
But I am a real artist, everybody say "Cheese." Everybody: 
We're ain't no quitters 
We're the babysitters 
We ain't no quitters 
We're the babysitters 
We're the babysitters 
(Repeat x3) 
We ain't no quitters 
We're the babysitters
