Switchback 
The scent is in the air , you can feel it every were it's switchback. 
It's getting thirsty now , out on the stage and take a bow and switchback. 
CHORUS: 
Cause my dreams turn into nightmares, 
everytime you call my name. 
There's no way to really tell ya, 
that we'll never be the same , oh the same. The ocean breeze is cold , this love is growing old so switchback. 
You can run and hide , take a step to the side and switchback. 
CHORUS: 
Cause my dreams turn into nightmares, 
everytime you call my name. 
There's no way to really tell ya, 
that we'll never be the same ,oh ,oh , the same. All that remains , are reminders of pain so switchback. 
The sand on the beach , the lessons you tried to teach and switchback. 
Switchback to another time. 
CHORUS: 
Cause my dreams turn into nightmares, 
everytime you call my name. 
There's no way to really tell ya 
that we'll never be the same, 
and no one is to blame, switchback to another time, 
Switchback to another time.
