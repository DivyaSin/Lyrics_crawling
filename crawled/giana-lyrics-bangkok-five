You thought you'd be 
The one they'd see 
You thought you'd shine 
A front page headline But you were sinking like a stone 
Yeah you were sinking like a stone On the decline 
I thought that you were fine 
How could've know where you were going? 
How could I have known? They let you die 
Over and out 
They let you drown 
Sinking like a stone 
Yeah you were sinking like a stone 
Etc. Headlights trying to find you 
All night trying to find you 
Slow down there's nothing behind you 
Over and out They let you die 
Over and out 
They let you drown They let you die 
They let you die
