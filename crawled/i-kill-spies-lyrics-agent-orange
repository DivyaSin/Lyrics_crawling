You've never seen my face before 
You will not recognize my voice 
I am the perfect law to end these wicked crimes 
I am a man without a past 
I face a world without a future 
And I've done it all at least a million times 
I'm the eyes that read between the lines 
I devise the rumors - and vicious lies 
I do everything I can to hide the truth 
But can you see it in my eyes? 
I kill spies As I walked into the room 
I couldn't help but feel the tension 
I can hear your thoughts - I can read your mind 
I've been through this all before 
By persistence - by intention 
I just do my job and leave the past behind 
Once there was a time when I believed 
Anything could happen - at any time 
I've been waiting for this moment all my life 
And now at last - the pleasure's mine 
I kill spies
