I ain't got a heart of stone 
I'm hurtin' more now than I've ever known 
If you mean the things you said 
I'm gonna wind up outa my head 
Can't sleep alone at night 
I just can't seem to get it right 
Damned if i do 
Damned if i don't but i love you 
I don't want to tie you down 
Don't need a reason to have you around 
But each time you walk away 
Don't be surprised if i ask you to stay 
Can't sleep alone at night 
I just can't seem to get it right 
Damned if i do 
And I'm damned if i don't but i love you 
I said I'm damned if i do 
And I'm damned if i don't cause i love you 
I ain't got a heart of stone 
You haven't left me a mind of my own 
But it's got such a hold on me 
I don't think i could ever be free 
How can i survive 
I'm fighting to keep myself alive 
I'm damned if i do 
Damned if i don't but i love you 
Can't seem to see the light 
I've done everything but i can't get it right 
Damned if i do 
Damned if i don't but i love you
