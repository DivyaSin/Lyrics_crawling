Seems to me, the time has come 
Party's over, you sit by the 'phone 
Through the daytime, you're gonna be all right 
But when the night time comes 
You're gonna be alone [Chorus:] 
Even though your heart is breaking 
I see it in your eyes 
Even though there's no mistaking 
I see there's no disguise [Bridge] 
Waiting for the right time 
To call out your name 
Oh, the right time 
To see you again 
Oh, the right time 
To reach out and touch your face We said goodbye in the morning 
Streets were empty and pouring rain 
All the worries, all the bad times 
Will simply fly right out of here 
When I speak your name [Chorus] 
Even though your heart is breaking 
I see it in your eyes 
Even though there's no mistaking 
I see there's no disguise [Bridge] 
Waiting for the right time 
To call out your name 
Oh, the right time 
To see you again 
Oh, the right time 
To reach out and touch your face
