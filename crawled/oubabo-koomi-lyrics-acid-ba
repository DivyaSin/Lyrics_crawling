We wanna see some blood, we need a new whore 
We don't give a fuck we just want some more 
We want blood 
I'm gonna fuck the hole in Kennedy's head 
Revolt deface resist 
Push the button legalize freedom 
Let's shoot the president 
Rape the queen 
And feel the flowers breath again 
Inside this dead machine 
I'm wading into nowhere thrill kill avenue 
Cuttin' her slowly liberty, she crawled to me 
The lines that define begin to gray and fade now 
Shove it inside her spectro-trippin' on 
I slept the last mile on our way to Endsville 
Spread your legs, don't look at me 
Cut me, rape me, make me free 
Breeders screaming dreaming loveless 
For the bloodless 
White sound, oceans of dreams 
I won't be another number on the screen 
Shhh, I wanna hear you scream 
I won't be another number 
White sound, dead black scream 
Vomiting this cold mass of hate 
I'm gonna push my love 
Thru her skull 
I have heard abortion 
Stories from the leather nun 
Holding hands with dead girls 
Hiding from the sun 
The lines that define begin to gray and fade now 
We shoot out the lights and swallow razor blades 
I feel nothing for the meat that came before 
Liberty, she crawled to me playing the whore
