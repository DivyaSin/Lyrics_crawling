You want to rock and roll 
It's been your big dream 
You ought to celebrate 
Girl, you're only sixteen Ignore your mom and dad 
And do what you feel 
You gotta be yourself 
And follow your dreams Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Don't let them say, say that you're bad 
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Just follow your dreams, you'll never be sad You ain't a kid no more 
Adolescence behind 
You're looking good these days 
Believe me, girl, I'm not blind Now there's no turning back 
Baby, you've made up your mind 
It's time to stand your ground 
You know that you've turned the tide Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Don't let them say, say that you're bad 
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Just follow your dreams, you'll never be sad Life's too short, you gotta realize 
The days go by, turn into years 
Rock and roll, it's just a way of life 
It's here for me, for me and you It's time to party now 
Enjoy what we've missed 
Screw everybody else 
And raise up your fist Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Don't let them say, say that you're bad 
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Just follow your dreams, you'll never be sad And listen 
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Don't let them say, say that you're bad 
Don't let them say that 
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Just follow
