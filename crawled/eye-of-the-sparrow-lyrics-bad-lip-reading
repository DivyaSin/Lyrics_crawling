I'm jumping into a pimento shower 
I wanted the music first 
In the tragic square of the Fresh Prince 
There went a perfect brown baby (Mmmmmmmmm) The guards can see we're all out of weapons, no machetes 
Lotion raw bruises (2x) Drink or sip 
A wench in our hotel 
Wolf government, anchovies 
When they laugh at you, you'll drown
