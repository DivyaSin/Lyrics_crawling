fourteen miles 'til i break you down 
time to realize i can make you frown 
my soul is free so step up on it 
to see past the faded sign can't stop the tide, it flows 
(can't stop the pain inside, 
can't stop to make it hide, 
can't stop to open wide, never mind) 
can't stop the pain inside up to now it's been irrelevant 
brought back to life through your dreamt up event 
with your sad eyes, you sent me on my way 
dreamt as you lied that it's ok can't stop the tide, it flows 
(can't stop the pain inside, 
can't stop to make it hide, 
can't stop to open wide, never mind) 
can't stop the pain inside fourteen miles 'til i break you down 
time to realize i can make you frown 
my soul is free so step up on it 
to see past the faded sign can't stop the tide, it flows 
(can't stop the pain inside, 
can't stop to make it hide, 
can't stop to open wide, never mind) 
can't stop the pain inside
