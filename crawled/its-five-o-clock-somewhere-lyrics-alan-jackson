The sun is hot and that ol' clock is movin' slow and so am I 
Workday passes like molasses in wintertime but it's July 
Gettin' paid by the hour, older by the minute 
My boss just pushed me over the limit 
I'd like to call him somethin' but think I'll just call it a day And pour me somethin' tall and strong 
Make it a hurricane before I go insane 
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care 
It's five o'clock somewhere This lunch break is gonna take all afternoon and half the night 
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be here to pay, hey, but that's all right 
I ain't had a day off now in over a year 
My Jamaican vacation is gonna start right here 
If the phone's for me you can tell 'em I've just sailed away And pour me somethin' tall and strong 
Make it a hurricane before I go insane 
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care 
It's five o'clock somewhere I could pay off my tip 
Pour myself in a cab and be back to work before 2 
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder 
What would Jimmy Buffett do? I say, pour me somethin' tall and strong 
Make it a hurricane before I go insane 
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care Pour me somethin' tall and strong 
Make it a hurricane before I go insane 
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care 
He don't care and I don't care, it's five o'clock somewhere
