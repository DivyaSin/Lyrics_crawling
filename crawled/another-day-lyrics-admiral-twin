It's just another day 
Just another day 
It's just another day 
Just another day A critical word's a betrayal 
But the judge won't state my crime 
When I find myself on trial 
I always end up doing time Another day on the track 
Another day on my back The sky looks blue 
And all but I'm tied to the track 
She pretends that 
She can't hear me falling apart Listen to me now 
'Cause all I need is you 
To let me off my bed of nails It's just another day 
It's just another day 
It's just another day 
It's just another day
