Black River deep and still 
In the summer sun 
A promise rise she will 
Walk on before she runs The evening dream awakes 
Honeysuckle sweet 
By day the levee breaks 
Surround her like a wreath I'm not in love 
(Black River deep and still 
In the summer sun) 
I'm not in love 
(a promise rise she will 
Walk on before she runs) She tried to hold the moon 
Still the river rose 
Autumn yellow wanes to soon 
Goodbye to all she knows
