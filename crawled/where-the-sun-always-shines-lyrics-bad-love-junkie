A beautiful girl swings on her front porch 
Dreams of a place she's never been before 
Mississippi Delta blues 
Run deep as the river is wide 
She's so tired of living here 
She wants that California high 
Where the sun always shines God smiles on some and laughs at the rest 
It all depends on just who you ask 
Snake oil salesmen selling dreams 
That no one can afford to bye 
California here they come 
They read it on bill board sign 
Where the sun always shines Where the sun always shines 
It's just a place in your mind 
Take a good look around you 
Happiness is knocking on the door 
Where the sun always shines 
Is it so hard to find? 
When somebody loves you 
Just open up your heart and them in 
Where the sun always shines 
The sun don't always shine in California 
It's not where you lay your hat but leave your heart 
The sun don't always shine in California 
It's not where you lay your hat but leave your heart
