In time all clear 
I'm alone with the thought of it 
high outside 
it's there and it's gone again 
counting it fast and keeping it slowly 
time all clear 
I'm alone with the thought of it When we see you 
we believe it in the end 
all things go 
When I see it 
I believe it in the end 
all things go Oh some things get lost 
get lost and go missing 
wandering off in time 
counting too fast 
keeping things slowly 
slowly in time When I see it 
I believe it in the end 
all things go 
When we see them 
we will believe them in the end 
all things go
