There's a rumour goin' round that it's lookin' like splitsville between us 
But all that talk's just talk 
So don't you believe it 
'Cause I just got a call from my baby 
And she was all, guess what? We're makin up 
Our on again off again is on again 
Were makin up 
She really wants to make it work 
I'm still so in love with her 
Forget about everything you've heard 
Were makin up Well I'm the first to admit that the road's been a little bit bumpy 
But don't you think for a moment that she don't love me 
Take your nosy little nose and get a whiff of these roses on the seat of my truck Maybe we argue a little too much 
Maybe we broke up more than once 
Ah but this is the part I love
