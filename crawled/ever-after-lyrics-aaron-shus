I hate to be the one to break the news 
To let you down 
But I can't lie to you 
There's things about the world I wish weren't true 
I guess by now, you must have had a clue 
It seems you're growing up fast 
I tried my best to push back Would you believe me if I told you There's no such thing as Peter Pan? 
No such place as Never Never Land? 
I wish we all could have those tiny magic wings 
But we live in a world with wars 
It's not like it was before 
We won't find our happy ever after here 
There's no such thing I've dreaded this talk for so long 
I knew someday, you'd wonder what went wrong 
We get to be the story of it all 
For the Glory of it all 
And so we move along 
This is not where it ends 
It's just where it begins Would you believe me if I told you There's no such thing as Peter Pan? 
No such place as Never Never Land? 
I wish we all could have those tiny magic wings 
But we live in a world with wars 
It's not like it was before 
We won't find our happy ever after here 
There's no such thing It's not where we belong 
And if it's feeling wrong 
Oh you must stay strong 
'Cause it was here 
That I first saw your face 
Every night I pray 
That you'd believe the same There's no such thing as Peter Pan? 
No such place as Never Never Land? 
I wish we all could have those tiny magic wings 
But we live in a world with wars 
It's not like it was before 
We won't find our happy ever after here 
There's no such thing There's no such thing I hate to be the one to break the news 
To let you down 
But I can't lie to you
