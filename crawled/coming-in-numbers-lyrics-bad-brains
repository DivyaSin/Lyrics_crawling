It was a plot to take over 
to diveid and conquer was the plan, 
but there was one thing that they overlooked 
the masses and multitudes across theis land. Chorus: 
Woe unto babylon, 
we're comin in numbers, in numbers. 
Woe unto babylon, 
we're comin in numbers, in numbers. 
Fight for your rights living in babylon 
and don't believe when they tell you this world is just for you. Weak abandoned by your leader. 
Now you stand alone. 
Loser in a war waged against right. 
Wasn't even a fight, wasn't even a fight. Chorus: 
Woe unto babylon, 
we're comin in numbers. 
Yes, in numbers. 
Woe unto babylon, 
we're comin in numbers, in numbers. 
Fight for your rights living in babylon 
and don't believe when they tell you this wrold is just for you.
