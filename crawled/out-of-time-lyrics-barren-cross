(Keep coming in from all over the globe, confirming it as true, 
To say the world is in shock this morning, 
Will be to under state this situation, 
The event has taken) Why did you wait? 
Why did you hesitate? 
We treed to warn you, 
Now you're out of time, 
You chose your way, 
Now you gonna pay, 
The party's over, and 
You've been left behind, 
We tried to show you god's love, 
But you said I don't need, 
We tried to help you to see, 
You said his not for me, (Don't wait, 
Like thief in the night, 
You better turn on your life, 
He might come back tonight, 
Don't wait, 
Like thief in the night, 
You better turn up your life, 
He might come back tonight) Why do you run? 
When god give his only son, 
So you might have everlasting life, 
Before it's to late, 
There a choice you got to make, 
If you receive him, 
You won't get left behind, 
Let Jesus consume your fighting on the living way, 
You will live forever, if for your in heaven or in hell, (Don't wait, 
Like thief in the night, 
You better turn up your life, 
He might come back tonight, 
Don't wait, 
Like thief in the night, 
You better turn up your life, 
He might come back tonight) He's coming back; it's a matter of fact, 
But we don't when; he's coming, again We tried to say God's love, but you said I don't need, (Don't wait, 
Like thief in the night, 
You better turn up your life, 
He might come back tonight, 
Don't wait, 
Like thief in the night, 
You better turn up your life, 
He might come back tonight)
