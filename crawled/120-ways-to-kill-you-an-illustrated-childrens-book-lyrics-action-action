Wait, I really don't have the guts for this 
It must have been abstracted with my appendix 
Or maybe it grows with my wisdom teeth 
Wait, it might be such a stretch, it's not my fault legally 
I'll dial the doctors now, you're right I never was a man for the law 
Please don't walk away in defeat, please don't walk away Wait, I haven't lost my courage on the rocks 
I haven't quite found the words to use 
I'm not sure they make the cards to break this ice 
Wait, please wait until our socks are bitterly soaked 
Until we have to roll up our pants 
Until the giraffes flee to row boats Please don't walk away in anger darling 
Exit gracefully like the evening's sunset 
Enter the scene starting with a dial tone 
Tightrope over these razorblade complications Cutting myself, almost everyday 
Let it feel so real, let me taste the pain 
One day we'll live in igloos on the Galapagos 
'Till then let's remember the Atlantic air in-between our hands The worms are moving, the grass is growing 
Flowers are blooming, the leaves are dropping 
The birds are chirping, clouds are forming 
The sun is burning, self medication never ends I taught you how to hate, you taught me how to love too 
This is how I lost my mind on you 
I taught you how to hate, you taught me how to love too 
This is how I lost my mind on you I taught you how to hate, you taught me how to love too 
This is how I lost my mind on you 
I taught you how to hate, you taught me how to love too 
This is how I lost my mind on you I taught you how to hate, you taught me how to love too 
This is how I lost my mind on you 
I taught you how to hate, you taught me how to love too 
This is how I lost my mind on you This is our final dance 
You taught me how to love and I taught you how to hate 
Everything is based on you 
Isn't it funny how we lost control or how I lost my mind on you? This is our final dance 
You taught me how to love and I taught you how to hate 
Everything is based on you 
Isn't it funny how we lost control or how I lost my mind on you? This is our final dance 
You taught me how to love and I taught you how to hate 
Everything is based on you 
Isn't it funny how we lost control or how I lost my mind on you? This is our final dance 
You taught me how to love and I taught you how to hate 
Everything is based on you 
Isn't it funny how we lost control or how I lost my mind on you? This is our final dance 
You taught me how to love and I taught you how to hate 
Everything is based on you 
Isn't it funny how we lost control or how I lost my mind on you?
