I was standing by my window 
On a cold and cloudy day 
When I saw the hearse come rolling 
To carry mother away Will the circle be unbroken 
By and by, Lord, by and by? 
There's a better home awaiting 
In the sky, Lord, in the sky I said to the undertaker 
"Undertaker, please drive slow 
For this lady, you are hauling 
Lord, I hate to see her go" I will follow close behind her 
Try to hold up and be brave 
But I could not hide my sorrow 
When they laid her in her grave Went back home and home was lonesome 
Since my mother, she had gone 
Found my brothers, sisters crying 
What a home so sad and lone Will the circle be unbroken 
By and by, Lord, by and by? 
There's a better home awaiting 
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
