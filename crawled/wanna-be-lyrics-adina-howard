()Wanna be 
You just a wanna be 
Know that's a wanna be 
Over here tryna be a thug and shit I'm so tierd 
Of all these nigga tryna play like they thugs 
I really can't sow them so love 
I learn how to spot them from a mile away 
And let me tell you how Staying at home with your momma don't count 
Borrowing a car to go out it don't count 
Yea you got money in your pocket no doubt 
But I found out you've been fakin the amount So how... 
How you get to the club? 
Did you come on dubs? 
And when you got inside did they show you some love? (no) 
Up in V.I.P was you poppin the bub You ain't come on dubs [yea I did] 
And they ain't show you no love [yea they did] 
I seen you at the bar you ain't poppin no bub [what?] 
Sippin on that henni like a wanna be thug ('cause yous a) 
Wan-na-be,wa-nna-be,

Wan-na-be, wa-nna-be There really ain't a need 
And no askin ya 
'cause when you pulled up to the club 
You was a passenger 
Actin like a champ 
When you a challenger 
And all the shit 
That you been poppin 
It just ain't adding up (no no) 
I think you missed your call and 
You really shouldent be around these players 
While they ballin 
While your tryna to come up 
You steady fallin 
You need to find somethin else to put your all in 
'cause it won't be me How you get to the club?
