Trading my car for a submarine 
To set my sights on sights unseen 
Jump start off a trampoline and just go Trading my car for an escalator 
The speed is low but the height is greater 
Hand rail's there to make it safer to go Trading my car for a pogo stick 
Gonna ride it high, gonna do a trick 
And land clear out in Reykjavik when I go Trading my car for an elephant 
Gonna rip the road, gonna break cement 
And you know I'll feed him peanuts 
I'll pack him lots of peanuts when we go
