Travel long on this dusty road just to find another lost dead end 
Whiskey fueled on another load 
On this trip there aint no time for games 
Kick one back if you cant attack 
Aint a thing that I've regret over tears 
I got no fear 'cause im sitting here 
And there's nothin like a riot when its kickin into gear 
We are American rock n' roll, here we go 
I bleed this disease down in my soul 
Oh i know 
And if you say its bad for me take your money and your feet 
Everybody's gotta feel it low 
And if you aint comin in with the shots and pivit 
Then well take it on down to paradise city 
I wanna ride down a different side 
It's been too long to give up now 
Walk this way on a crazy train 
I aint too old to play it loud 
Time is right till the death i fight 
Ain't no tellin when the time is near 
I bleed this disease down in my soul 
Here we go 
We are American rock n' roll
