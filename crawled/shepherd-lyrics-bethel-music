In the process 
In the waiting 
You're making melodies over me 
And your presence 
is the promise 
For I am a pilgrim on a journey You will lift my head above the mighty waves 
You are able to keep me from stumbling 
And in my weakness 
you are the strength that comes from within 
Good shepherd of my soul 
Take my hand and lead me on You make my footsteps and my path secure 
So walking on water is just the beginning 
Cause my faith to arise, stand at attention 
For You are calling me to greater things You will lift my head above the mighty waves 
You are able to keep me from stumbling 
And in my weakness 
you are the strength that comes from within 
Good shepherd of my soul 
Take my hand and lead me on
