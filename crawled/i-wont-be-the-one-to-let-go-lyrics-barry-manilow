I have dreams for you and me 
And wishes that will last 
And live beyond eternity Summer's gone, winter's on 
Can we weather everything 
Our eyes have yet to see? As the years go by 
I promise you that I I will be the one to run to 
When the nights are long 
I'll be there when winds begin to blow 
Even when it seems 
That everything is going wrong This I swear I swear I won't be the one to let go Life gets tough Ooh Roads get rough Ooh Who knows what awaits us round the bend Count on me, faithfully 
Though everything we have could never end It could never end And through rain or shine 
And every cloudy sky I will be the one to run to 
When the nights are long 
I'll be there when winds begin to blow 
Even when it seems 
That everything is going wrong This I swear This I swear I won't be the one to let go I'll be there I'll be there Anytime you need me 
You'll know where I am You'll know just where I am 
And everywhere Everywhere Anytime you're lost 
Just turn around Just turn around And take my hand and. I will be your light in the night 
And I promise 
That even when it seems 
That everything is going wrong This I swear This I swear I won't be the one To let go. To let go. 
This I swear I swear I won't be the one to let go To let Go
