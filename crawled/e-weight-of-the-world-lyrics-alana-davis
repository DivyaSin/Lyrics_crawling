Each day, I say that today won?t be like yesterday 
But it stays this way 
Today and everyday 
I pray 
That today will feel a different way 
But it stays this way The weight of the world has fallen 
And the rubble is at my feet 
The voice of a girl is calling 
I can hear her 
But she?s buried so deep 
All of my truths are broken 
They?re fragments of love and hate 
The words that remain are a token 
Of honesty that came too late Here 
In the midst of madness 
Washed up by the tides of war 
Try to resist this sadness 
But the pressure is hard to endure Yet we begin again 
Still playing our games 
And everyone?s innocent 
Just victims of change Wearing a mask of freedom 
And hiding behind a smile 
Playing the role of a leader 
Pretending for just a while 
Everything seems an illusion 
Echoing around my brain 
Trapped in a vast seclusion 
Where the images fall like rain And we begin again 
Still playing our games 
And everyone?s innocent 
Just victims of change 
Living in sin again 
With no one to blame 
And everyone?s innocent 
Just victims of change Each day, I say that today won?t be like yesterday 
But it stays this way 
Today and everyday 
I pray 
That today will feel a different way 
But it stays this way
