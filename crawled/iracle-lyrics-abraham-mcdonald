Where does it go when it's gone 
All of the love that we had 
I wish I could make you remember, oh no 
The rock that we built this upon 
How could it just disappear, like it never mattered 
I don't know how to watch you leave 
but there's nothing left to say, It's easier to walk on water 
It's easier to part the sea 
Then to live another day without you 
And just forget about what you mean to me 
It's easier to reach the heavens 
Then for us to work this out 
I haven't prayed in so long 
But if it brings you back somehow 
I guess I need a miracle right now, right now Eyyy, I'm stranded at the end of the line 
With no way left to get home 
But i'm not ready to surrender, oh no 
I'm still willing to fight 
But it seems like changing your mind 
Is harder than ever, 
I don't know how to watch you leave, 
When there's so much to say It's easier to walk on water 
It's easier to part the sea 
Then to live another day without you 
And just forget about what you mean to me 
It's easier to reach the heavens 
Then for us to work this out 
I haven't prayed in so long 
But if it brings you back somehow 
Then I guess I need a miracle right now, right now... Ooooohhh 
Almost nothing is impossible 
Our love can open any door 
But it's impossible to let you go, It's easier to walk on water 
It's easier to part the sea 
Then to live another day without you 
And just forget about what you mean to me 
It's easier to reach the heavens 
Then for us to work this out 
I haven't prayed in so long 
But if it brings you back somehow 
Then I guess I need a miracle right now, 
I need a miracle right now, ohhhhhhh yeah
