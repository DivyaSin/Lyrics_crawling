(Instrumental) 
In April weather 
When the meadow was bloomin' 
We walk together 
To the top of the hill 
Upon the clover 
When the meadow was bloomin' 
We dreamed together 
Just us true lovers will 
But summer flies on 
Far across the horizon 
And winter lies on 
Over the valley and hills 
Do you remember 
When the meadow was bloomin' 
In bleak December 
Do you think of me still 
But summer flies on 
Far across the horizon 
And winter lies on 
Over the valley and hills 
Do you remember 
When the meadow was bloomin' 
In bleak December 
Do you think of me still 
Do you remember 
Just as I always will
