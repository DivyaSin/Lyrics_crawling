Gonna paint a picture 
Gonna put it in a frame 
So I can show you how I'm feeling 
Without having to explain 
And you can hang it from your ceiling 
In your safe and happy home 
When you come to understand it 
You'll know you're not alone 
Once upon a time 
We could speak our minds 
Now I don't believe you Gwendolyn 
I don't believe you're all that strong 
I don't believe you know the dangers 
Of this road you're travelin' on 
You're always asking questions 
That you know the answers to 
Tell me please 
What do you want from me 
Gonna write a song 
Gonna tell it like it is 
And if you recognize yourself 
I know yoou're going to be pissed 
And if you call me on it 
I'll deny it through and through 
Just like Woody Allen would 
If he were in my shoes 
Once upon a time 
I could speak my mind 
Now I don't believe you Gwendolyn 
I don't believe you're all that strong 
I don't believe you know the dangers 
Of this road you're travelin' on 
You're always asking questions 
That you know the answers to 
Tell me please 
What do you want from me 
Gonna write a letter 
Gonna a mail it to myself 
Sincerely and forever 
You and yours can go to hell 
And I'll put it in my pocket 
So when this all comes crashin' down 
I'll have a way to show you 
How long I've been wearing down 
Once upon a time 
We could speak our minds 
Now I don't believe you Gwendolyn 
I don't believe you're all that strong 
I don't believe you know the dangers 
Of this road you're travelin' 
You're always asking questions 
That you know the answers to 
Tell me please 
What do you want from me 
Tell me please 
What do you want from me 
Tell me please 
What do you want from me
