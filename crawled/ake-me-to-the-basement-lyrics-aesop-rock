Take me to the basement 
let me count the holes in your foundation 
ancient ridicule system alert, kissing my lurk 
the perch of rare grimace on iron mask 
i remember science class 
if chemistry could silence the lions laugh I'd be fine 
(i fail tah) molindone up 
adrenaline trades the leaves that walk the plank 
before the crimson struck a match this season 
meridian carpal will jolt your logic 
when the burn earned its self normalcy for 20 plus 
run a muck or sink, swims not an option 
she applied the lipstick slow 
slow enough for me to bask in 
fast enough for me to wish it lasted 
past my alarms cackling 
the front line of its mystique's geek 
doubled my proposals,bargains 
for the ogers who prefer the roller coasters 
(i prefer the roller coasters) 
well that'll sip the blood of merry men 
that'll grace holiday carols when the merry ends 
barrel past the auto craft, exhale into final raft 
and pirate your local rain puddle torturous 
try to shake pilot fish off your dorsal fin 
lets dive through the archives, synax on frantic ? 
stamp it with a noteable brand to reek the profit 
see i don't know hell but I've read about it often 
sounds like a dope concept gone wrong 
(note to caution) Take Me to the basement 
lets zoom into that war paint sensation 
Take Me to the basement 
lets dis-sable the cause rotation 
sayin, if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with 
so make some noise for all your predecessors reppin dirty grill-age 
Take Me to the basement 
lets deny the nervous rooms of pacin 
Take Me to the basement 
lets review the hearts ramifications 
sayin, if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with 
so make some noise for all your predecessors reppin sturdy grill-age Take me to the basement 
lets remove the costume you escaped in 
hold up your legacies,I'll tell you which ones my favorite 
hold up your elacerative innocence 
I'll teach you about the perks of patience in seminar format 
I've worn that hat for seven years 
that's why its discolored,ragged and shitty 
i ain't about to toss when its been through all these dream wars with me 
ima undercover profit,thrift shop god 
i rather starve then sit inside this gridlock till it parts 
this tailor made rutiny ain't suitin me 
it's tied around my neck like 13 loops rafter an apple box 
heartless harvest of mine,I'm tired of pissin benediction 
maybe it ain't healthy,but sometimes i rather burn then let you help me 
it's getting brisk, brisk as fuck 
my skin ain't thick enough ,these icicles ain't civil 
how many freezer burn victims can one society on tilt manufacture 
prior to hire,being intervening just to release last laughter 
and every tree trunks made of third rails with tourniquet branches 
and i learned to walk with an anchor in my back pocket 
and man i read palms during even the most brief handshakes 
and man i ain't alive to pull the weeds around the spotlit 
well I'm wallowin, followin my little lost princess to the promise land 
hollerin my potent slogan,hell if Nostradamus can 
conquering these open roads with throttle pin to floor 
cause Ima win right after i finish these chores Take Me to the basement 
lets zoom into that war paint sensation 
Take Me to the basement 
lets dissable the cause rotation 
sayin, if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with 
so make some noise for all your predecessors reppin sturdy grillage 
Take Me to the basement
