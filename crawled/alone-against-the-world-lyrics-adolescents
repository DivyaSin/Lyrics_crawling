He left home at 16, the days go by like years 
He didn't get much schooling but he learned a lot on the road 
He knows one thing, not to trust no one but himself 
He hopes and prays but he knows his days are numbered Well, he hits the bottle to wipe out his fears 
But no one's there to wipe away those whiskey tears 
He's alone against the world He wonders if his girl back home is missing him at all 
He'd like to listen to her voice but he's too poor to call 
He told her that he's send for her if he could get ahead 
By now she's probably given him up for dead Night after night, he's all alone 
Each step he takes, he's farther from home 
There's no one to help him, his parents don't care 
He stumbles through life on a wing and a prayer He boards a bus in L.A., winds up in New Orleans 
Bums a couple of cigarettes from a sailor in the depot 
Steals a couple of purses and buys himself a dingy room 
No matter where he stays, he knows his days are numbered Well, he slams the needle to wipe out his fears 
But there's no one there to wipe out those junkie tears 
He's all alone against the world He wound up in Raleigh with a bullet in his leg 
"You should have seen the other guy", that's all he had to say 
Two bits away from help but he's afraid they will reuse his call 
He knows his days are numbered Stranded in the Midwest and he don't know where to go 
The West Coast cops are on his tail, the east is full of snow 
He thinks, "4, 5, 6 more years of this, I'll lose my head 
And a few more years of crazy, I'll probably end up dead 
Oh god, I wish I was back home in my bed" Night after night he's all alone 
Each step he takes is farther from home 
There's no one to help him, his parents don't care 
He stumbles through life on a wing an a prayer He's crying, he's dying It was only last year that he turned seventeen 
Now this ain't the life that a young boy should lead He's alone against the world
