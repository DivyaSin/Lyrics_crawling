Gold around those fingers shown 
Bound for to carry home 
Fond of the flattest field 
But you know there are bones buried deep down below Tatted lace frail figure graced 
That has since been torn and stained 
Tatted lace frail figure graced 
That has since been torn and stained 
And put, and put so far away, oh, so far away Novels we don't write 
Hearts been lost in flight 
Skin in the black of night 
Love is a sinking kite Tatted lace frail figure graced 
That has since been torn and stained, oh 
Tatted lace frail figure graced 
That has since been torn and stained 
And put, and put so far away, oh, so far away Gold around those fingers shown 
Bound for to carry home 
Suitcase filled with stones 
Snow keeps me alone Suitcase filled with stones 
Snow keeps me alone, all alone 
All alone, all alone 
All alone, all alone, all alone
