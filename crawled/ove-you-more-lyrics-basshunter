You can make the sea turn purple 
You can make the sea turn infertile 
But you know you can never make me love you more 
You can turn wine into water 
Turn sadness into laughter 
But you know you can never make me love you more [Chorus] 
Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown 
So you know you can never make me love you more 
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry 
So you know you can never make me love you more You can make the sea turn purple 
You can make the sea turn infertile 
But you know you can never make me love you more 
You can turn wine into water 
Turn sadness into laughter 
But you know you can never make me love you more [Chorus: x2]
