Everyone in this room has been associated with Whitey 
Either through basketball or the mall or various odd 
Jobs he does around town for free or at most a dollar 
And I'm guessing 99% of you have either laughed in Whitey's 
Face or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or voice or sister 
Or shortness when he wasn't looking 
But the next time you'd see him he'd still go out of his way to 
Smile and wave at you and ask you about your mother's 
Operation or something like that because he, unlike us, 
Actually cares about someone other than himself The reason I bring this up to you is because I was the worst 
Offender of all 
My life was simply going nowhere 
Then a tiny little man rushed to my side 
He should've gotten a big thank you 
Instead he got a Porta-Potti ride I was such a shithead 
But he never quit on me 
'Til I told him he was useless 
And his sister was freaky 
Once when we were watching Sunday football 
A fuzzy screen was all that we could see 
Whitey came over with a hanger 
And spent the game atop our T.V. And when the lightning struck him 
He let out a wicked, loud yell 
But we just turned up the volume 
And ignored the burning smell 
We should all rot in hell
