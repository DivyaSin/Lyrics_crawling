Do you think you?re up for this? 
Are you ready to get undressed 
Undressed in your evening best besides 
Every heart is like a house on fire with escape 
Routes in every room 
These are the trials of our youth But this charade is never going to last 
So pick the poison and pour yourself a glass 
I still feel the same 
No one's to blame I will be waiting outside if you're ready to go 
Your sundress reflects in the headlight glow 
Besides, every heart is like a house of cards 
When the walls break down on you 
These are the trials of our youth These are the fast times 
These are the fast times These mistakes are just a part of the ride 
And if we choke on the next tongue that we tie 
I still feel the same These are the fast times
