Please call me your baby baby baby 
Look how long that you have kept me waiting 
I'm all in, look at all that I have given 
Oh, I know your love before I kissed you 
And now you have only made me miss you 
Come get me 
Come love me, baby come love me 'Cause I'm lovesick 
And I ain't even ashamed 
And I'm hard up, for some time in your sheets 
Would you be down to spend all your time with me?
