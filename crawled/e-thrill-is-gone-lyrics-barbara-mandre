(Lew Brown - Ray Henderson) The thrill is gone 
The thrill is gone away 
The thrill is gone, baby 
The thrill is gone away 
Well, you know you done me wrong, baby 
But you'll be sorry someday The thrill is gone 
It's gone away from me 
The thrill is gone 
It's gone away from me 
Although I'll still live on 
You know so lonely I'll be The thrill is gone 
It's gone away for good 
The thrill is gone, baby 
It's gone away for good 
Some day I'll be over it all 
Just like I know a good woman should You know I'm free 
Free from your spell 
I'm free, baby 
Free from your spell 
And now that it's all over 
All I can do is wish you well The thrill is gone 
The thrill is gone away 
The thrill is gone 
The thrill is gone away 
Well you know you done me wrong, baby 
But you'll be sorry some day
