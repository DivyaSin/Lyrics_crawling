If I told you a secret 
Would you understand? 
Could you promise that youd keep it? 
Keep it in your hand I dont know 
Where we go from here We keep spinning round in circles 
Are we going nowhere? 
I cant see the future 
Are we already there? I wanna laugh like I used to 
Cry like I could with you 
I dont know where 
We go from here Come lay down beside me 
And Ill tell you a story 
Lay your head upon your pillow 
Look outside your window 
Ill be the stars 
Ill be the stars Weve had a lot of weather 
You and me 
Nothing is forever 
The winds are calling me You know I wanna know what peace is 
But I pulled it all to pieces 
Now we need all the kings horses You know I wanna know what peace is 
But I pulled it all to pieces 
Now we need all the kings horses Come lay down beside me 
And Ill tell you a story 
Lay your head upon your pillow 
Look outside your window If were saying goodbye 
Ill see you in the night sky 
Ill be the stars 
Ill be the stars 
Ill be the stars, be the stars
