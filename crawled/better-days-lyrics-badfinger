I'm just a good boy, working hard to get my pay 
A little time, a little trouble, a better day 
I see no reason as for why it cannot be 
A little time, a little trouble, a better day You bury your head in the things you said, that's fine 
But the days go by and you know it's getting dark at nine 
You give all you want, but you take away what's mine 
We can make it better, baby, so much better all the time Just a good boy 
Looking hard to see my way 
A little time, a little trouble, a better day I see no reason as for why it cannot be 
A little time, a little trouble, a better day Well, you bury your head in the things you said, that's fine 
But the days go by and you know it's getting dark at nine

We can make it better 
Baby, so much better all the time Just a good boy 
Looking hard to see my way 
A little time, a little trouble, better days. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
