(Verse 1) 
If I told you that I love you 
Would you tell me that you love me to 
You see I'm giving it all I got 
But whether you say or not 
The choice is up to you (Verse 2) 
Time's gone by 
So fast 
On the nights that we 
would give everything 
To make it all seem, 
Like this would last 
'Cause girl... (Chorus): When you smile, 
yeah 
Thoughts blow through my head 
like a hurricane 
And every single night, 
I think you and that will never change 
You, you 
You, you My heart is telling me that this is real 
It's everything you do, 
I can't explain the way you make me feel... 
You, you 
You, you (Verse 3) If I got you this diamond ring 
Would you tell me that you'd marry me 
See, I'm giving you all I got 
And I know that you'll take the shot 
to spend your life with me (Verse 4) 
And I know that we'll, 
Go so far 
All this bad weather, is gonna get better 
No nothing will spread us 
as long as I'm with you 
'Cause girl... (Chorus): 
When you smile, 
yeah 
Thoughts blow through my head 
like a hurricane 
And every single night, 
I think you and that will never change 
You, you 
You, you My heart is telling me that this is real 
It's everything you do, 
I can't explain the way you make me feel... 
You, you 
You, you (Verse 5) 
And all I need is just 
A little bit more, of your company 
'Cause of every single dream I dream 
It's you I see 
You're everything, to me (Verse 6) 
And all I need is just 
A little but more of your company 
'Cause of every single dream I dream 
It's you I see 
You're everything, to me (Chorus): 
Thoughts blow through my head 
like a hurricane 
And every single night, 
I think you and that will never change 
You, you 
You, you My heart is telling me that this is real 
It's everything you do, 
I can't explain the way you make me feel... 
You, you 
You, you
