He's got a holster 
Filled up with grief 
I wouldn't want to cross his line 
I'd end up underneath He's got an angry look of action 
Shoot off both your knees 
His gun was smokin' 
Recently pleased You don't wanna cross wits 
You better not try 
You couldn't learn his limits 
And you don't have the mind Loser in a fight 
Loser in a fight 
Better learn to run 
Winnin' days are done Loser in a fight 
Loser in the night 
Better learn to run 
Winnin' days are done He's a thinker, you can see it 
Sometimes the eyes don't lie 
And if your head is empty 
He'll make your body die Don't need his aggravation 
I'm better than the rest 
You better shut up or stand up 
'Cause soon will come the test You don't wanna cross wits 
You better not try 
You couldn't learn his limits 
And you don't have the mind Loser in a fight 
Loser in a fight 
Better learn to run 
Winnin' days are done Loser in a fight 
Loser in the night 
Better learn to run 
Your winnin' days are done 
Done, done This would be the one guy to ignore 
If you wanna save your face 
From hitting the floor 
So now would be the right time I wouldn't wanna cross wits 
Better not try 
You couldn't learn his limits 
And you don't have the time Loser in a fight 
Loser in a fight 
You better learn to run 
Winnin' days are done Loser in a fight 
Loser in the night 
Better learn to run 
Your winnin' days are done Loser in a fight 
Loser in a fight 
Better learn to run 
Your winnin' days are done Loser in a fight 
Loser in a fight
