She's back 
It's that girl again 
Saying - all is good and well 
But why is she looking so pleased 
After all that has happened 
And yet she has the time of her life 
Forcing us to smile 
To be kind and glad 
To welcome bad weather 
We know better 
How life really is 
She's demanding too much it's that girl again 
Preaching how to love 
What's more 
She suffers fools gladly, 
God knows why, 
And annoying us all 
But has the time of her life 
Never scared (it's so unrealistic) 
To live (it's too idealistic) 
This is so (quite impossible) naive forcing us - it's that girl again 
To smile - it's that girl again 
To be kind - it's that girl again 
And glad 
To welcome bad weather 
We know better 
How life really is 
She's demanding too much 
She welcomes bad weather 
Who knows better 
How life really is 
She has the time of her life
