This Vehicle is breaking down 
Someday I'll stop 
Can't get these tired wheels to go round 
Back in the shop 
A month of treatment for the wear and tear 
Then fall apart 
Cross the state border disappear 
Back in the shop again Admitted, acquitted 
Admitted, acquitted 
Back on the road neither here nor there Vessel devoid of ambition 
Sputter and crawl 
Propelled by faulty transmission 
Likely to stall Admitted, acquitted 
Admitted, acquitted 
Back on the road as the sun goes down This Vehicle is breaking down 
Someday I'll stop 
Propelled by faulty transmission 
Back in the shop 
Non-stop No breaks for my mistakes 
Admitted, acquitted 
Admitted, acquitted 
Back on the road as the sun goes down
