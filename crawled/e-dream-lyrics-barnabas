As the sun is forced to exile, in a blaze of bloody fire 
Disturbing visions mystify when conscience thought retires 
I heard a tattered echoing from voices long since dead 
Another night of wonder in the moonscape of my bed I dreamed I was in Israel two thousand years ago 
A festive flair was in the air; the great Passover show 
Every pew was taken, and we wore our Sabbath best 
As we partied long into the night, on a skull-shaped hill of death Jealousy was dressed to kill, with Vengence at her side 
While millions of tiny lies cavort in shiny white 
At first this all seemed strange to me, then suddenly I knew... I killed Jesus Christ 
Yes I did, its true 
I killed Jesus Christ 
And you were with me, too
