I sang loud 
My voice cut through the crowd 
As if I was anybody that might have something to say 
Standing tall I seemed to know it all 
But the only thing I know is that I've never known someone like you 
I'm gonna figure out how it is I got you 
I got you babe 
I held you 
And I lost you Time stood still 
And I had my fill 
Of all the things we did 
And all the things we could have done 
Looking back would you 
Cut me some slack 
For all the times I left you when I should have stayed right by your side 
I'm gonna figure out how it is I got you 
I got you babe 
I held you 
And I lost you
