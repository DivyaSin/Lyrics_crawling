Your lost for miles near the western sky, 
And the sun is going down 
The buzzards and the vultures are the only life around 
And out from the cold and dusty site 
There comes a frightening sound 
You know you don't stand a chance 
When it's sun down in zombie town The creatures start to stir and grown 
Like a dead west horror tale 
Fear engulfs you to the bone 
Like Frankenstein from hell 
And the devil is knocking down your door 
As you stumble to the ground 
You know you will not escape 
When it's sun down in zombie town Shoot em' high and cut em' low 
Gouge there eyes the blood will flow 
This is the end of the life you know Your reaching for your six-shooter 
From the holster that you've worn 
They're creeping closer quicker now 
Cause your blood will keep them warm 
And everything seems hopeless 
As you fire another round 
You know you will not escape 
When it's sun down in zombie town 
Oh no you will not survive 
Sundown in zombie town
