Said and done, concede, he won 
Simulate your blessing and move on 
I lost in the south, I opened my mouth 
All I know is anyone can lose 
And it's hard to dissect the truth, come to be the living proof 
Tolerate and compromise, love the things you once despised 
All I see is when I'm blind 
All I know is anyone can lose 
Lying here I'm completely clear, it's not going anywhere 
Sleep in its pretending arm 
Some sort of friend whom you mean no harm 
Incomplete you ache knowing she will be forsaken 
It's a temporary pill, for the hole 
She'll never fill 
All I know is that I'm stoked 
All I want is another second chance 
Another dead romance
