She said live young and leave a wake of beauty, 
It's all I ever could have asked 
Should have asked from you, 
And I won't forget to write you 
When I get there soon 
'Cause you'll be lying dead 
From stab wounds to the 
Neck and chest again, They found you covered up in blood, 
Covered head to toe in blood 
Face first in a tale of awkward love, 
They found you covered up in blood, 
She' bleeding she's bleeding Gone with the stitching in her heart 
Left out a silhouette that just won't 
Heal and dying in your arms tonight This dream, we die, 
Locked away, 
With this blood, and this knife 
This dream, we die, 
Locked away, 
With this blood, 
And this knife I know it's all 
Just a bad dream now So now midnights here 
You're all alone 
They use this fear 
It's all just a bad dream 
And I can't seem to Wake up from this [2x] 
In my dreams, we die, 
With this blood, and this knife 
In my dreams, we die, 
With this blood, and this knife now I know it's all just a bad dream now 
(i know it's all just a bad dream now) 
It's all just a bad dream now 
(I know it's all just a bad dream now) 
It's all just a bad dream now 
(I know it's all just a bad dream now) I say 
This is the last time that 
I'll ever get to see your face alive, 
They found you covered up in blood, 
Covered head to toe in blood 
And I know that everyday's a new day 
And my dreams will never die, 
They found you covered up in blood, 
Covered head to toe in blood She said live young and leave a wake of beauty, 
It's all I ever could have asked 
Should have asked from you, 
And I won't forget to write you 
When I get there soon 
'Cause you'll be lying dead from dreaming (nightmares) So now midnights here 
You're all alone 
They use this fear 
It's all just a bad dream 
And I can't seem to 
Wake up from this 
Wake up from this 
Wake up from this
