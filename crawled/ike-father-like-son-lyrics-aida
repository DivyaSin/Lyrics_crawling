Don't come on so cocksure boy, you can't escape your genes 
No point in feeling purer boy, your background intervenes 
Listen good and listen straight, you're not the master of your fate 
To this you must be reconciled, you'll always be your father's child 
At times acclaimed, at times reviled 
You wind up doing just what I've done Like father, like son 
Like father, like son Don't assume your vices get handed down the line 
That a parent's blood suffices to condemn the child's design 
I've done wrong, I can't deny, but at least I know that I 
Shouldn't blame that on my stock, this may come as a quite a shock 
I'm no chip off any block, I wouldn't wish those words on anyone Like father, like son 
Like father, like son He's lost all sense of reason, and why some filthy slave 
That is the road called treason that winds up in the grave 
Just like me, he's found out a flesh, can excite but will it mesh 
Watch me rid him of this blight, once this Harlot's out of sight 
Then I think he will see the light 
He won't walk back to daddy, he will run Like father, like son 
Like father, like son 
Like father, like son
