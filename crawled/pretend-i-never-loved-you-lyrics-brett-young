I wish you packed your things and cursed my name, 
and slammed the door behind you. But instead you took my hand and tried to help me understand. 
How dare you? There's really nothing more to say. So I'm going to smoke anything that burns, 
drink everything they serve. 
Set 'em up and knock them down, 
just to forget you. I'll go numb to all this hurt. Drown the memory of what we were, 
at the bottom of this bottle if I have to, 
I'll pretend I never loved you. Sitting in this corner booth where I met you, 
just acting like I don't miss it. I never wanted this but now I wish our first kiss never happened. Lord I just need to put the past away. So I'm going to smoke anything that burns, 
drink everything they serve. 
Set 'em up and knock them down, 
just to forget you. I'll go numb to all this hurt. Drown the memory of what we were, 
at the bottom of this bottle if I have to, 
I'll pretend I never loved you. I'll pretend I never loved you. Ooooh I'll pretend I never loved you. 
You make it look so easy, 
getting by without me. 
Like you never missed a beat. I'm going to smoke anything that burns, 
drink everything they serve. 
Set 'em up and knock them down, 
and just forget you. I'll go numb to all this hurt. Drown the memory of what we were, 
at the bottom of this bottle if I have to, 
I'll pretend I never loved you. I'll pretend I never loved you. Ooooh I'll pretend I never loved you. Oh baby, 
I'll pretend I never loved. I'll pretend I never loved you.
