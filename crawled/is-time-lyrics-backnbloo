You've hurt me for the last time 
These dreams we had are not mine 
They never ever ever were It's funny how you couldn't see 
All the things that I could be 
And you never ever ever will Don't tell me it's okay 
Your deviant innocence 
I did things your way 
Now wise up to circumstance This time I'm gone 
This time, I'm not pretending anymore 
aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhooooooooooooo Forgiveness won't be easy 
You've always had a hold on me 
Now you never ever ever will The wait is finally over 
No more crying on a shoulder 
That was never ever ever there Don't tell me it's okay 
Your deviant innocence 
I did things your way 
Now wise up to circumstance This time I'm gone 
This time, I'm not pretending anymore 
Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhooooooooooooo
