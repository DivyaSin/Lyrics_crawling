Coney isle 
Glistening and glimmering 
Rising bright 
Drenched in light 
See it smile 
Beckoning and shimmering 
All a-gleam 
Like a dream 
Every fantasy set free 
Summer rising by the sea 
Wonders and astonishments for your delectation 
Phantoms and automatons for your fascination Marvels undreamt since the dawn of creation 
Coney isle miracle on miracle 
See the sound burning round 
Mile by mile 
Loud and lewd and lyrical 
Dream on dream never seen 
Welcome one and welcome all 
Welcome to the master's hall 
Welcome to the 
Welcome to the 
Welcome to the
