[Verse 1] I open up another bottle 
Another wine I cannot name 
The connoisseur can taste the difference 
But to me it's all the same [Chorus] A kind of wine that gets me through the night 
A kind of wine to ease my thoughts of you 
Cuz another night without you baby 
Is another glass of wine [Verse 2] I take a slow sip and I breathe it 
Let it linger like a sin 
An initial hint of some loneliness 
And the dark currants deep within [Chorus] A kind of wine that gets me through the night 
A kind of wine to ease my thoughts of you 
Cuz another night without you baby 
Is another glass of wine [Bridge] I'm living on vino tinto 
On a red eye to Santiago 
For someone I can't see 
But it's always like a dream 
I've been staring at a screen 
For months 
And now I'm on the cusp [Chorus] It's another night without you baby 
It's another night without baby 
It's another night without you baby 
So, it's another glass of wine [Outro] And I say, "yes sir, I will take one more" 
I'll have another glass of wine
