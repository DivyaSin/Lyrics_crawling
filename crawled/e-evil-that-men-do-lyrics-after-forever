Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade 
Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with 
The slaughter of innocence 
But will pray for her I will call her name out loud 
I would bleed for her 
If only I could see her now Living on a razors edge 
Balancing on a ledge 
Living on a razors edge [Repeat: x4] 
The evil that men do lives on and on...
