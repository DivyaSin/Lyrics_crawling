the search has begun, this is page one 
men meet your maker, i give you the author 
he may seem familiar because he looks like your mirror 
you've lied like a lawyer, but don't deny it 
when you're face to face with demons 
dancing off mirror images, reflecting all that you wanted 
so far from perfect 
onward, we will strive 
take it for what it's worth 
this truth that you've realized 
you're not who you thought you were 
it's time you see the other side of what you have become 
nothing but your single serving selfish chapters 
of sacrificial moral standards 
no stranger to apathy in bold situations 
take your time to make it happen 
leave your mirror and spare your excuse as a self-serving actor 
so close to perfect 
it's all the same, no face or complexion 
you're not worth what you're spending 
when you're screaming "danger, danger!" don't stop 
go on alone 
desperate endeavor, you've got to take it or leave it, if you will 
not so convincing that you're the only one here who can't be like me 
the search has begun, leave your letters but it won't matter 
take back what is left before your death 
but is it really you that they suspect 
you take shots, who's the figure before the flame 
it's not hard to spark, but it's hard to master 
so look for the answer 
single serving selfish chapters on your condition 
lust and liars 
so get out, stop dreaming, if you're one for breathing 
sacrificial moral standards of two reflections 
truth and fire 
something you'll live for 
so close to perfect 
it's all you've got, one chance for conviction 
lies fuel fires, and your suspect won't walk 
you're screaming "danger, danger!" don't stop 
go on alone 
desperate endeavor, you've got to take it or leave it, if you will 
not so convincing that you're the only one who could be like me 
from this point on, the way you thought it would all work out 
but we've hit autumn, just follow the story 
the fall of the author 
just one more year, and you'll cease to regret 
one on one to repent, all eyes are fading 
sleep alone
