I know I said I wouldn't complain 
When the weight became too much to bear 
But that was before I felt all the strain 
Of the work involved in getting where 
I want to be Steady me 
Help me plant my feet 
While I grit my teeth 
Help me find my voice 
It's lost in all this noise 
Come and set me free 
Help me find my peace 
While I work my hands to the bone I know, I said I wouldn't complain 
When the going started getting rough 
But now that I sit here gripping the reins 
I begin to feel I've had enough 
Of all this up and down Steady me 
Help me plant my feet 
While I grit my teeth 
Help me find my voice 
It's lost in all this noise 
Come and set me free 
Help me find my peace 
While I work my hands to the bone Please don't leave me 
Down and out and crawling back for more 
I need a hand 
I found out I can't do this on my own 
Trying to has left me here alone 
Has left me on my own Steady me 
Help me plant my feet 
While I grit my teeth 
Help me find my voice 
It's lost in all this noise 
Come and set me free 
Help me find my peace 
While I work my hands to the bone
