Top this I'm hot 
And when I'm not 
I'm cold as ice 
Get out of my way 
Just step aside 
Or pay the price What I want I take 
What I don't I break 
And I don't want you 
With a flick of my knife 
I can change your life 
There's nothing you can do I'm a problem child 
I'm a problem child, yes I am 
I'm a problem child 
And I'm wild Make my stand 
No man's land 
On my own 
Man in blue 
It's up to you 
The seed is sown What I want I stash 
What I don't I smash 
And you're on my list 
Dead or alive 
I got a .45 
And I never miss Oh I'm a problem child, yeh 
I'm a problem child, owh 
I'm a problem child 
Desperate and wild Just watch you step Every night 
Street light 
I drink my booze 
Some run 
Some fight But I win they lose 
What I need I like 
What I don't I fight 
And I don't like you 
Say bye bye 
While your still alive 
Your time is due 'Cause I'm a problem child, owh 
I'm a problem child 
I'm a problem child 
I'm a problem child 
Problem child 
I'm a problem child, my mother hates it 
I'm a problem child, oh he 
I'm a problem child 
Hey yeah problem child Whoa problem child 
Problem child 
Problem child
