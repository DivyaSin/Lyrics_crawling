(Remember, remember our heart) Can't believe my eyes 
Could it really be so 
Drink it up buttercup, take it slow 
And remember (remember) our heart It's so weird to feel high 
When a second ago I was feeling oh so low 
And remember, remember your heart Remember remember my heart 
Now hey mama don't forget though we're apart 
Hey mama take us from winter to summer 
And remember, remember our heart 
Now remember, remember your heart 
Now hey mama don't forget though we're apart 
Hey mama take us from winter to summer 
And remember, remember our heart It's so weird to say "bye" 
When I don't wanna go 
Got me feeling oh so low 
I remember remember your heart In a world so wide could it really be so? 
Only one way to know 
Remember remember our heart 
Remember remember my heart 
Now hey mama don't forget though we're apart 
Hey mama take us from winter to summer 
And remember, remember our heart 
Now remember, remember your heart 
Now hey mama don't forget though we're apart 
Hey mama take us from winter to summer 
And remember, remember our heart
