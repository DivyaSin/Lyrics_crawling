This is the final act 
Please take your seats 
This is the moment that you've been waiting for 
This is gonna be a wild ride Your telltale heart is beating, unstable minds descend 
I'm through trying to reach you, I am the emptiness 
Our love will nevermore attach your soul to mine 
You don't understand, time is on my side now baby 
And time is running out Do not believe in imitations 
We have to crave a masterpiece beneath the ink 
We're falling for the fiction 
There's more than meets the eye The end is dawning 
The sun is setting on a silent mourning 
Our stars aligning as universes shatter time 
I'm resisting reality I remember when, my love 
You could stop time with just a smile 
Save it for tomorrow, my love 
I'll regret those words forever more I danced with our accuser, murderer from the start 
Climbed out of Tartarus for one last night with you 
You don't understand we are poetry now, baby 
But time is running out Do not believe in imitations 
We have to crave a masterpiece beneath the ink 
We're falling for the fiction 
There's more than meets the eye The end is dawning 
The sun is setting on a silent mourning 
Our stars aligning as universes shatter time 
I'm resisting reality I remember when, my love 
You could stop time with just a smile 
Save it for tomorrow, my love 
I'll regret those words forever more The end is dawning 
The sun is setting on a silent mourning 
Our stars aligning as universes shatter time 
Have you ever actually seen yourself without a mirror I must be dreaming 
I drop the knife 
Turn and see you 
You can't be me 
I can't be you Oh my God, where am I 
Let me go, let me go 
Save me from this nightmare 
Annabel, I can not be lying there My 'Bel, you know you're the cause of this 
If you had not left me then he would not have lost his mind 
If you're seeking forgiveness you have come to the wrong place The compass spins 
What's that feeling in your stomach 
First a flutter now a shudder 
Creeping up your spine and now you know that something's not right 
Something lurking something peering inching closer inching closer 
Trying not to think about it trying not to think about it 
It's here Foregrounds burst to nothing 
As symmetry explodes 
The artist screams and beauty dies, his canvas rends 
While his easel burns 
He's lost everything in but one cruel instant existence swept away 
Did man even notice as he was erased
