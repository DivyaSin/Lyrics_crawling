Is it just me or am I stuck in a place 
floating 'round in outer space 
putting out a signal of distress Is it just me, or is there no one around 
Brave enough to fly on down 
Didn't anybody get my S.O.S? Is there anybody out there who can hear me? 
Is there anybody out there who can hear me? 
Is there anyone who's open-minded near me? 
Said is there anybody out there at all? I got no baggage no carry-on 
Beam me up and bring me home 
I know I must be one of your kind 
'Cause I found love and then I lost it again 
A human being, alien
