Twenty dollars out of mumma's purse bought us a tank of gas 
And a pack of tobacco when we were just teenage kids 
Me and Jack and Danny we'd go driving around 
If there was trouble to be found then we found it quick Chuckin' doughnuts in the field 
'Till old man Smith would call the cops 
He'd come running out with a shotgun 
'Cause we were running down his crops 
And I reckon he's still wondering who that was 
But that was us Now some of those local boys moved on but we never changed a bit 
Never had a scrap of sense, least that's what some folks said 
Then we finally turned old enough to buy our own beer 
Don't remember much about that year, just lucky that we're not dead 'Cause somebody said they saw some boys 
With a ute looked just like mine 
Trying to pull down that old water tank 
That sits out by the railway line 
And people wonder why it leans the way it does 
Well that was us Seems like small towns never change 
But things get tough when times get hard 
And they said when he got sick 
That old man Smith would have lost that farm 
'Cause he was getting way behind on all his bills 
'Till someone came and brought his crops in from the fields 
Yeah and folks 'round here still don't know who that was 
That was us Chuckin' doughnuts in the fields 
'Till old man Smith would call the cops 
He'd come running out with a shotgun 
'Cause we were running down his crops 
Somebody said they saw some boys 
With a ute looked just like mine 
Trying to pull down that old water tank 
That sits out by the railway line 
That was us 
That was us
