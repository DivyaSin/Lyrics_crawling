Someone to love. Someone to love. Deep in my heart is a feeling. 
A feeling that keeps me awake at night. 
Heaven's your kiss and I'm dreaming. 
That you're gonna stay for the rest of my life. Someone to love. 
Someone to hold to. 
The lucky star inside your eyes. 
Someone to love. 
A heart of gold. 
A heart forever till the end of time. Whenever you call I come running. 
I comfort your soul when you're down and blue. 
Meltng the ice by the fire. 
And color my world everyday you do. 
Two hungry hearts are hungry for love. 
They gonna win all the time.
