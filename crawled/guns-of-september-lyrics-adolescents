Ten years have passed 
Ten years have passed 
Since the guns of September 
Ten years have passed Don't cry, don't cry 
Don't cry, it's thunder 
Don't cry, don't cry 
Don't cry, it's thunder 
Outside, outside 
This world of wonder 
Don't cry, don't cry Ten years have passed 
Since the guns of September 
Tanks in the street 
Do you remember? 
Fire in the night, smoke in the sky 
We had to hide Guns, guns 
Guns, guns 
Guns of September Outside my window 
The world's a disaster 
It's who we are 
Not how things should be 
I look in your eyes 
And see the potential 
Who we are 
And how things should be Don't cry, don't cry 
Guns of September
