Knock on my door, boy come home 
You stay in my head 
Lay in my arms, why won't you? 
It's been way too long, what you waiting on? 
'Cause I've been here, learning what the memories won't do 
See, I need you and baby I need to 
Let down my guard and give you my scars 
Open up my heart We could be stars 
We could be stars 
We could be stars Rap on my window, come home 
It's been a while, so stick around, why don't you? 
Till the end of time, say that you'll be mine 
An uphill climb, fighting what the heart really wants to do 
See, I need you and sometimes we need to 
Shed our facade and be just who we are 
All broken and torn, then we could be stars Oh, we could be stars 
We could be stars 
We could be stars Piercing lights in the dark make the galaxy ours 
Kingdom right where we are 
Shining bright as a morning, you'll never be lonely 
Just promise you'll love me, I'm never too far 
And we'll never part 
And we could be stars Oh, we could be stars 
We could be stars Oh, we could be stars, just find way to get home 
There's space in my heart, open arms for you to run to 
Baby, close your eyes and take the leap to make-believe in fairytales 
I'll meet you there, oh yeah, I'll fall too 
See I've wanted you here, all along but my fear 
Just keeps haunting, me won't let me go 
So it's hard to say I love you We could be stars 
Oh, we could be stars 
We could be stars 
We could be stars
