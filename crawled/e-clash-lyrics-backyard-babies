My mistake to make the stakes a little higher 
No, nothing's ever gonna be alright 
And we invade because of your invite Far out B.Baby

The clashes don't come one in a million Did you believe to leaving me without no reason? 
Your mistakes, I'm taking you out of season 
Nothing really matters anymore 
Only the sound of glass across the floor Far out B.Baby 
Couldn't stay away, baby 
The clashes don't come one in a million Here I say, be A.S.A.P 
Wouldn't bet a dime on me 
The clashes don't come one in a million Yeah, an' I like things that you might copyright

That you don't like 
What we don't like 
There's no one like us Far out B.Baby 
You couldn't stay away, baby
