What's the use of all this talking 
I can hear you as you walk away 
Your in my room 
That's where I'll be 
In my room After all you're so excited 
By all the (?) you get invited to 
But now I know you mustn't change 
I won't go back 
'Cause you don't want me [Chorus] 
I miss you already 
I miss you already 
You see, it all got so heavy 
I miss you already I'm so afraid 
That I wake up 
All alone with the door shut 
In my room 
There's where I'll be 
In my room 
She's in my room
