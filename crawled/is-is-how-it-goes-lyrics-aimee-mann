This is how it goes 
You'll get angry at yourself 
And think you can think of somethinge else 
And I'll hear the clanging of the bells 
Cause I can't stop you baby 
Cause I don't have the bribery in place 
No bright shiny surface to my face 
So I won't go near the marketplace 
With what I'm selling lately 
Cause this is how it goes 
Cause it's all about drugs, it's all about shame 
And whatever they want 
Don't tell them your name 
This is how it goes 
One more failure to connect 
With so many how could I object 
And you, what on earth did you expect 
Well I can't tell you baby 
When this is how it goes 
Cause it's all about drugs, it's all about shame 
And whatever they want, don't tell them your name 
So I try to hold on 
While you try to let go 
You won't tell me it's gone 
But baby I'll know 
Baby I'll know 
Baby I'll know 
Baby I'll know
