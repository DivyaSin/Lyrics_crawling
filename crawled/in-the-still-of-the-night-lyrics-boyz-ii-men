(Shoo-doop, shooby-doo) 
(Shoo-doop, shooby-doo) 
(Shoo-doop, shooby-doo) 
(Shoo-doop, shooby, whoa) In the still of the night 
I held you, held you tight 
Oh I love, love you so 
Promise I'll never let you go 
In the still of the night 
(in the still of the night) I remember (I remember) that night in May (I remember) 
When the stars (I remember) were bright up above (I remember) 
I hope (I remember) and I pray (I remember) 
To keep (shoo-whop) your pre-(shoo-whop)-cious love So before the light 
Hold me again 
With all of your might 
In the still of the night 
(in the still of the night) So before the light 
Hold me again 
With all of your might 
In the still of the night 
(in the still of the night) In the still of the night (Shoo-doop, shooby-doo) 
(Shoo-doop, shooby-doo) 
(Shoo-doop, shooby-doo)
