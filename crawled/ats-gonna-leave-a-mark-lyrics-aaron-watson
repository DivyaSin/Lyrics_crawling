First kiss I thought I died and gone to heaven 
There in parking lot of that old 7/11 
I filled up a truck, 
I went in to pay, when I walked out 
She was with him smilin' as she drove away 
I know that's gonna leave a mark 
Just like a tattoo on my heart 
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl, 
Is gonna tear my world apart 
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame 
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name, 
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark. If you play with fire you're bound to get burned 
You would think by now that I would've learned 
But she's lookin so hot, so what can I say 
My mama said don't but I did it anyway 
I know that's gonna leave a mark 
Just like a tattoo on my heart 
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl, 
Is gonna tear my world apart 
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame 
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name, 
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark. I wish you didn't look so dang good 
I wish you wouldn't smile at me that way 
There's an exit light shinnin' brighter than the sun 
Like a sign from above tellin' me to run away 
I know that's gonna leave a mark 
Just like a tattoo on my heart 
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl, 
Is gonna tear my world apart 
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame 
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name, 
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark. 
And like a tattoo on my heart I know she's gonna leave a mark.
