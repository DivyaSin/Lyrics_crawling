You say we'll work it out 
Then you say you're having doubts 
Tell me walk away 
But then you'll go insane Calling me day and night 
Saying he don't treat you right 
Then you always turn around 
And give him one more chance Baby, you know it isn't fair 
You'll send me to be there 
But we'd never get no where I've got one foot out the door, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
I'll make along so we shall, time to make up your mind, girl 
No more back and forth, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
If I'm not what you want I don't wanna hear no more Stop telling me you need more time 
Tired of the same old line 
Better make a move or you are gonna find Are you taking it 'cos you know it's wrong? 
Better let him know it's time to go, your moving on 
Baby, you don't know how close I am to being gone Really known you long enough 
I can only take so much, tell me if I have you heart 
(How do you really love) Baby, you know it isn't fair 
You send me to be there 
But we never get no where I've got one foot out the door, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
I'll make along so we shall, time to make up your mind, girl 
No more back and forth, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
If I'm not what you want I don't wanna hear no more (I don't wanna hear no more) 
If your sure that you really love me 
(I don't wanna hear no more) 
Out the door if you still don't know I'll be there for you 
And you know it's true you belong to me 
What you go and do 
(I don't wanna hear no more) I've got one foot out the door, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
I'll make along so we shall, time to make up your mind, girl 
No more back and forth, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
If I'm not what you want I don't wanna hear no more I've got one foot out the door, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
I'll make along so we shall, time to make up your mind, girl 
No more back and forth, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
If I'm not what you want I don't wanna hear no more I've got one foot out the door, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
I'll make along so we shall, time to make up your mind, girl 
No more back and forth, I don't wanna hear about him no more 
If I'm not what you want I don't wanna hear no more
