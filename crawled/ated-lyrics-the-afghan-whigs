I smoke a pack a day 
I hit the pipe sometimes 
And drink my pay, screw my friends 
Understand my need to offend Come home and smack the woman around 
Tried to apologize 
She deserved it that I know 
Strangled with her pantyhose What's with the flowers, can't you smell me 
I buried you and still you kill me 
With all your cryin' I can tell 
That your disease will make me well Twist your head so I can witness 
Come and crawl inside my sickness 
And I'm hated, undisguised 
Never known why
