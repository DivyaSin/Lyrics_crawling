When I was a child 
I spent hours in the back of a Dark Greyhound bus. 
When I was a child 
I heard ma father curse the witch 
The neighborhood punchboard. 
I squeezed my eyes shut really tight 
Whenever I drove by the cemetery at night 
But during the day I drank whiskey and smoked cigarettes 
In the same cemetery that scared the shit out of me at night. When I was a child 
Afraid to go in the basement 
Scared of what was hiding in the dark. 
When I was a child I had a father 
Who never knew me or saw me grow up.
