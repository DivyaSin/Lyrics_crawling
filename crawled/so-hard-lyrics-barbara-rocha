So hard to find somebody who completes you whole 
So hard to find a man 
who conquest you with a word 
And I found this "word" So hard to breath 
when a desire hold you tight 
So hard to breath 
if I needed and I could not treat you kind 
Treat you kind But I had you in my life 
And I had you by my side Chorus 
I feel guilty, wrong 
I did not want to lose you, baby 
I feel ashamed 
It wasn? t my wish hurt you So hard to find somebody who completes you whole 
So hard to find a man 
who conquest you with a word 
And I found this "word" But I had you in my life 
And I had you by my side Chorus 
I feel guilty, wrong 
I did not want to lose you, baby 
I feel ashamed 
It wasn? t my wish hurt you I should confess 
It wasn? t my intention, I swear 
Look around 
There? s no one like me 
Who did everything to you 
Who take the moon and bring for you 
Forget the past 
And let it go 
Sorry, I feel bad 
Sorry, I beg you 
Give me a chance, please listen my heart 
I know 
I Know you, you know me 
So now you know you have to come back "We" 
But "we were"... "we went" 
sorry, baby, I can't 
Don't look back 
Just walk and take my hand 
I need you, I miss you 
I need you, I miss you My heart, my arms 
Miss you, baby 
My eyes, my mind 
Miss you honey
