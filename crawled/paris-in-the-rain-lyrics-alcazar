I've been searching every nightclub from Marais to Montparnasse 
Clouds above are crying I'm a stranger you can trust 
Heartaches I'm escaping love that's gone insane 
Fountains heal the heartache, Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain Where I love to love you 
Where I love to love you 
Where I love to love you 
Where I love to love you Catwalk something gaultier looking sharp in a mcqueen 
Dior Galliano share the glamor of the scene 
But seasons have an ending and the glamor was in vain 
Fountains heal the heartache, Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain Where I love to love you 
Where I love to love you 
Where I love to love you 
Where I love to love you Smiling through ovations at a fashion year?s awards 
Then she's crying to the airport from place De La Concorde 
It?s a city built on romance love that's gone insane 
Fountains heal the heartache, Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain Where I love to love you 
Where I love to love you 
Where I love to love you 
Where I love to love you Paris in the rain 
Where I love to love you 
Paris in the rain 
Where I love to love you Paris in the rain 
Where I love to love you 
Paris in the rain 
Where I love to love you Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain
