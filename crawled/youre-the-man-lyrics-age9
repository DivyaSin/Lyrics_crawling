You question my innocence when you know I'm pure. 
You question my innocence when you can't prove yours. 
You know I'm a good man and you know you're not, 
but you can't just change that 
because you're a fucking cop Change that! 
You got no morals, 
you got now friends. 
You got a gun and you'll use it just because you can. 
You''re not respected, 
you're not even a man. 
You''re just a public nuisance with a gun and badge. 
You''re the man! 
You''re the man with gun in your hand. 
You''re the man with that nice shinny badge. 
You''re the man, 
you're the lowest form of shit. 
You''re the man, 
deal with it.
