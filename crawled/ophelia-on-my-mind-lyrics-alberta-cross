When it chimed 
You got away with my mind 
Hard to give 
You got my heart in a twine 
Try to know I can't believe it 
You gotta stay strong 
Inside a heartache 
You gotta live on Ophelia 
You put a wake to my time 
Hard to live 
You walked away with my mind 
Try 
Say no I can't believe it 
You gotta stay strong 
Inside a heartache 
You gotta live on I can't believe it 
You gotta stay strong 
Inside a heartache 
You gotta live on Live out your needs 
Live out your needs I can't believe it 
You gotta keep on 
Outside a heartache 
You gotta live on I can't believe it 
You gotta stay strong 
Inside a heartache 
You gotta live on
