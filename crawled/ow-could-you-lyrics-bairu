Tonight Sorrow fills my heart 
Tearing our love apart 
Catching those tear drops in 
my hands Deep inside It's killing me 
Maybe we're not meant to be 
But I still see you in 
my dreams CHORUS: 
How could you break my soul and 
leave?You've ruined me ,I cant 
Forgive.But all our memories still 
Survive How could the silence be so 
loud?I'm slowly falling from the 
Cloud. And no one can make me feel 
Alive Verse 2: 
Loneliness is killing me 
Begging you, set me free 
Pull me into your arms 
And say That True feelings never die 
It's a Rumor,it's a lie 
In my eyes you see the flame 
Of love CHORUS: How could you break my soul and 
leave?You've ruined me ,I cant 
Forgive.But all our memories still 
Survive How could the silence be so 
loud?I'm slowly falling from the 
Cloud. And no one can make me feel 
Alive I'm Walking on broken 
Glass.Oh,Now my life is 
a mess because 
Of you Should wipe away all my 
Tears.And overcome all these 
Fears.I've cried 
Enough
