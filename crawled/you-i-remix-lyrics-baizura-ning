Time don't let me wait too long 
Been searching high and low 
Waiting for the love 
You promised me 
And I believe with all my heart 
That you'll come back to me 
We'll fall in love once again 
[chorus] 
You and I 
We can make it if we give love a try 
You and I 
We'll have brighter days 
We'll love through the night 
You and I 
There's no way that we can fall 
We can have it all 
If you believe in you and I 
Now I can't wait another day 
To hold you and to say 
The words that you've been longing to hear 
So try and look into my eyes 
The secrets deep inside its locked away 
You hold the key 
[chorus] 
[bridge] 
And we can climb any mountain 
And shout out to the world 
For all to see 
That there's no greater love song 
That this song in our heart 
So won't you sing with me 
[repeat chorus]
