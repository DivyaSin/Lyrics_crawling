Everybody calls me wayward 
No map, no morals, no good 
Lost boy always headed nowhere 
Doin' things that they never would They all think they know what's true 
But I got news for you I found my way, I found my own path 
And it ain't straight, And yeah I know that 
My life's my own, I'll write this one song 
I'll walk the road, that I am on I found my way, I stand resilient 
Don't say I'm lost, just cuz I'm diff'rent 
I can't forget, I'll get there someday 
The course is set, and that's my way 
I found my way No, I ain't wayward 
I found my way People that would call me wayward 
No shame, no compass, no good 
Hate cuz I ain't thinkin' like them 
Livin' life like they never could I don't care what words they use 
Cuz I got my own truth I found my way, I found my own path 
And it ain't straight, And yeah I know that 
My heart's my own, I'll sing this one song 
I'll walk the road, that I am on I found my way, I follow my rules 
And I ain't wrong, cuz I'm not like you 
So that's my plan , I vow as I say 
My dream will stand, I'm on my way 
I found my way No, I ain't wayward 
I found my way Yeah, I'll stay and fight 
Though you may think that the way I live ain't right 
But here in my song 
Is the voice that will always guide my life I found my way, I found my own path 
And it ain't straight, And yeah I know that 
My life's my own, I'll write this one song 
I'll walk the road, that I am on I found my way, I stand resilient 
Don't say I'm lost, just cuz I'm diff'rent 
I can't forget, I'll get there someday 
The course is set, and that's my way I found my way, I found my own path 
And it ain't straight, And yeah I know that 
My heart's my own, I'll sing this one song 
I'll walk the road, that I am on I found my way, I follow my rules 
And I ain't wrong, cuz I'm not like you 
So that's my plan , I vow as I say 
The dream will stand, I'm on my way 
I found my way No, I ain't wayward 
I found my way
