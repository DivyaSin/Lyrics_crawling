Why didn't we just try 
To hold on one more time You maybe think that I don't care 
But the tears are falling down 
I can hardly breathe in this rain of sorrow Remember we walked the beach at night 
Then we made love in the moon light 
And you looked into my eyes Why didn't we just try 
To hold on one more time 
Why, was it all a lie 
Let's try it on one more time Life goes on and time goes by 
But every day I wonder why 
Was it meant to be this way 
Is this how you want it I might not be the perfect guy 
But baby, I'm worth one more try 
Don't let me wait another day Why didn't we just try 
To hold on one more time 
Why, was it all a lie 
Let's try it on one more time
