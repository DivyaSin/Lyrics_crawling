Sometimes I hear your whistle as I walk the dogs across the skateboard park, 
And though I know you've gone uptown I look for you in every doorway on St Mark's, 
Cause even though I'm not a canine, and my bark is usually benign, 
Whatever I'm sniffing I'll drop and come running for you. 
I once said that "I'm not an alcoholic. There's just always something to be celebrated". 
Well true to form I'm pretty woozy this morning, cause last night I was inebriated. You're next to me so everything must be alright, 
You're next to me so I must have made it home last night, 
It can't have been too mortifying, though I do remember trying a handstand against a mirrored wall. But "Oh I love, you let me", 
And didn't then forget me 
But took me home so tell me did I fall? You're next to me, so nothing really matters anyway. 
You're next to me, and I feel like I'm on my holidays And I mean that the British way like lying on a beach sipping through the alcohol, 
Not the American way which involves religion and is absolutely no fun at all. 
Not that I mean to demean your lovely nation after all it made you and you're a sensation. 
The jubilation of our present situation could make me lose the urge for any form of masturbation 
It's sensational; that you are next to me, so everything must be alright. You are next to me, so I must have made it home last night. 
You are next to me, so nothing really matters anyway. 
You are next to me, and I feel like I'm on my holidays. Im amazed that you are next to me.
