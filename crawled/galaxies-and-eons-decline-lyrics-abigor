Hail you forgotten gods 
Sleeping the step of death 
Return to blood soaked power 
To fierce tyrants reign 
They somnambulate on burning foots prints 
Haunting black infinity 
The shadows beyond the stars 
Unholy flesh of shoggots distorting time and space 
Black tentacles atrocious - mouldery slimy trace 
Recover the lands of an eons lasting dream 
To enslave all mortal life 
And bring madness over men 
Hail you forgotten gods 
Sleeping the step of death 
Buried you dwell in R'lyeh 
Receive my words - chaos... arise! 
Winds of time chase my prayers 
Through the depths - resurrect! 
Wake the dead dreaming gods 
Cthulhu thee who lurks beyond the threshold 
Buried under black withered megaliths 
Under cold and bare distant desert planets 
In abyssmal depths beyond blinking stars 
Fleshless bodies dream of a new return 
Drunk now is my blood, opened is the path 
Ancient Ones return, cosmic wrath unleashed 
Shub Niggrath bleat! Your Sothoth arise! 
Voices chanting pain - scream from a thousand mouths 
Forces raising dead mountains of flesh 
Protoplasmic waves spilled from outer space 
Transformed is my flesh, blackened now my heart 
Fallen my disguise - shoggot forces mine! 
The triumphatic rise of the Ancient Ones 
Invading land, sea and sky in their lust for chaos... 
An age of occult worship 
ph'nglui mglw nath Cthuluhu R'lyeh wgahnagl fhtagn... 
To flesh turned fear in grey disguise 
Has lead it's trail for eons long 
And eons more it will lead on until the galaxy declines 
Yet Luna splits her gruesome rains 
Of light over a world in fright 
And while the tides of time pass by 
The grey still walks these haunted planes...
