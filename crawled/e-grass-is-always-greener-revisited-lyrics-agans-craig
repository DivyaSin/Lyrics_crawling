Where have you wandered since the last time I saw you? 
To what god now do you pray? 
We sat in those treetops in those warm afternoons 
passing that slow time away 
And the crickets chirped and mosquitos bit the way we knew they would 
and back in those days sitting there away.. it seemed so good.. 
You could never figure a scheme you could fit in, 
your plight was about the same as mine 
An answer then you showed me too late upon the road 
for then it seemed like it would be a crime 
However long it takes you, to do the things you should 
all those days of strugglin' away.. it seems so good.. 
You'll never return there tho, neither will I 
It's a life we both have outgrown 
Our characters there have played their roles and said all they can say 
and it's too late, our covers have been blown 
Besides things there are different now, it turned out like we thought it 
would 
and today more than ever away.. it seems so good.. 
What it was you were thinkin' of, I thought I understood 
Away the doctor said must be the cure 
I guess the away you set your sights on was a bit too far for me 
but unlike me you had to know for sure 
Happiness may be given to you if you meet Robin Hood 
People they read fairy tales because away.. it seems so good.. 
Fate can play a stranger game than I could ever guess 
Like wisps of smoke lookin' back behind 
And if you made it this far babe then you'll know what I mean 
there is always a new hill to climb 
And even if it's out of a pit that's filled with your own blood 
You know that you'll make it because away.. it seems so good.. 
I've seen confusion pass this way over many a face 
It can spread like some contageous disease 
Rendering victims judgmentless, fearing for their pride 
waiting for the day of their release 
This home we now live in, of plastic, steel, and wood 
We are living here today because away.. it seemed so good..
