Just the mentioning of, such a simple phrase 
Are we passengers on separated trains? 
Take the mask off, when you speak to me 
And I'm alright to go on, it's the little things But anymore, you've become 
Ethereal to everyone 
To everyone I'm reeling in the long day getting behind 
Why didn't i think what in the world? 
It really took a tall one to see it 
Two to believe it 
Three to just get in the way All your life to think of, what a mess you made 
Dig a hole in the ground, for your wedding ring 
Rainmaker call, throw your hammer down 
And everything that I know, can't remember now Anymore, you've become 
Inherent of another one 
Another one I reeling in the long days, getting behind 
Why didn't I think,what in the world? 
It really took a tall one to see it 
Two to believe it 
Three to just get in the way
