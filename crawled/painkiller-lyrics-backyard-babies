I see your phone's been cut off again 
Did you shoot all your troubles 
Up the vein 
Someone saw you 
Said you were deadly pale 
Another night in hell 
Another night in jail [Chorus] 
Looks like the Chinaman's reeling you in 
Looks like the horse is gonna win 
Looks like the monkeys 
Are holding on tight 
Say hello to darkness 
Goodbye light 
Painkiller And as obscurity beckons the call 
It seems oblivion 
Is the only thing to cushion your fall 
I believe that 
Everything is gonna be too late 
It all sinks along with the ship you chose too hate [Chorus] Now you sold all your possessions 
And not only your own 
There's miles to go yet 
But you're at the end of your road 
So you finally surrender 
To the needless sleep 
Found dead the next mornin' 
With your life at your feet [Chorus] Sail into darkness goodbye light [Repeat x3] 
Yea-eah 
Say hello to darkness 
Goodbye to light 
Say hello 
Goodbye 
Yea-eah 
Goodbye light
