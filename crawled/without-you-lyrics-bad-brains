I called your name out loud but you were too far to hear me crying. Can you see the rain outside my window falling like tears. You're so far away and the telephone won't do. Won't you save me if you can I can't Take another day like this without you here beside. Without you here with me. I really need you here with me. You know I don't mean to cry but sometimes the tears can wash away the time. It's just I never thought I'd fall in love again cause it was so bad before but you came and made it right. You came into my life you came and made it right. So I need you here tonight won't you save me if you can. I can't take another day like this what am I gonna do. Can't live without your love. Without you here with me I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I called your name out loud... without you here beside me without you here with me.
