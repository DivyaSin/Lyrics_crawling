I cut off my red hair 
You need me 
Entertain my friends 
They hate you This little breath on yours 
Don't touch me 
We are strangers 
But your jacket, face, shoes are not Chorus: 
I said boy, oy , oy 
I said boy, oy, oy 
(Boy) 
Let your sweet eyes invite me 
The color just strikes me I said boy, oy , oy 
I said boy, oy, oy 
(Boy) 
Let your sweet eyes invite me 
The color just strikes me Get easy on my feet 
Flying high 
Moving closer, I can't breathe 
Stay this time (stay this time) Chorus
