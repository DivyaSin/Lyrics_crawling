Dead at 17- Dead at 17 
Life is so obscene and no it aint a dream 
When your 17 Everyday is a holiday, All the way is the only way 
TNT and a side of fries, Insanity can't be sanitized 
There's other things that I'd rather do 
Fuel to burn and I'm coming through 
I let the fumes go to my head 
Either way I think I'm dead at 17 Dead at 17- Dead at 17 
Life is so obscene and no it aint a dream 
When your 17 Dead at 17- Dead at 17 
Lost in between and no it aint a dream when you r 17 I'm at war with humanity, Live in this world of stupidity 
I'm so annoyed with everything, I growing into a big nothing 
I don't care about the state in, A snot-nose punk who just can't win 
An angry misfit that's seeing red, But either way I think I'm dead at 17
