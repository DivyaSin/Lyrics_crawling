its only the end of the world again 
down by the ocean 
the frogmen are surfacing 
but the beast beneath the skin 
has been whispering, wondering 
wondering, whispering 
its only the end of the world again 
rise and sing 
shedding his ocean skin 
deep green awakening 
and something like a woman screams 
screams to me 
screaming 
its only the end of the world again
