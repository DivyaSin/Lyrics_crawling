Midnight 
I stare out the window from my room 
I hear the dogs it's going to be dawn soon 
I wonder where you are In my mind's eye 
I'm floating alone in the night sky 
The treetops, the buildings beneath me 
I feel my heart beating So I try to find anything 
To kill the time 
To quiet my mind (Chorus) 
There's got to be something 
There's got to be someone Else still awake in this city 
I can't take another night 
I can't stay 
I've got to break and break and break 
These chains away, away Bars closed 
We stumble around through the echoes 
Hiding our past in some old clothes 
Like its some dirty secret And I see a face 
In the passing light 
It's so good tonight 
I'm tired of putting up this fight (Chorus) 
There's got to be somewhere 
There's got to be someone Else still alive in this city 
I can't hide another night 
I can't stay 
I've got to break and break and break 
These chains away, away 
These chains away, away We lean into the wind 
Riding our nerves and choking engines 
Built for a time not 50 years old 
I can hear the whispering at the door 
When I'm alone in this cell 
With 10,000 words and nowhere to go 
And I wish you could know 
How much I still need you The spell of this town, the graves on the hill 
Lit up like a crown 
The names on the signs 
I can't even say 
Have to break and break and break 
These chains away, away 
These chains away, away 
These chains away, away 
(Awayyyyy) Sometimes I feel the pain 
At the heart of this ember 
All these ashes I choke on 
Does anyone remember 
Where we came from, where we came to 
A place with no center and no edge 
And no end
