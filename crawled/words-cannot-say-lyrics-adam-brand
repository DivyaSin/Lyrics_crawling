Words cannot say 
What I want them t say 
To show how I feel 
That my love is real 
To hold you my love 
Is all I can do 
To make you see 
You're the world to me 
I would climb every mountain 
I would sail every sea 
There ain't a woman alive who could satisfy 
The way you satisfy me 
You're the source of my constant joy 
And you work so tirelessly 
I could never leave and I don't know how 
To repay your loyalty
