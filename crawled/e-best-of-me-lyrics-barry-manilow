So many years gone still I remember 
How did I ever let my heart believe 
In one who never gave enough to me? And so many years gone, love that was so wrong 
And I can't forget the way it used to be 
And how you change the taste of love for me [Chorus] 
You were my one more chance I never thought I'd find 
You were the one romance I've always known in my mind 
No one will ever touch me more and I only hope that in return 
I might've saved the best of me for you And we'll have no ending, no, no, if we can hold on 
And I think I've come this far because of you 
Could be no other love but ours will do [Chorus] No one will ever touch me more and I only hope that in return 
No matter how much we have to learn 
I've saved the best of me for you
