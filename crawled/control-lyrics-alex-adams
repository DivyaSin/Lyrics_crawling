Control 
 
When I make a step, you say make two 
With every breath, I'm breathing you 
I'm reaching out, but no one cares 
Like a little boy, so unprepared 
I've got to keep my feelings up above the ground 
My body will explode if I don't scream it out 
Wanna take my time, but the hands are yours 
And they stay closed, behind your door 
 
Oooh ooh left me feeling low 
Oooh ooh now I'm taking control 
 
Coz I'm a fighter 
A heartbeat left in a cold war 
Breaking out of my own thoughts 
I will be the one in control 
Coz this is my time 
I'm standing on the front line 
Body bleeding I'm so high 
I will be the one in control 
 
Ever felt the fear, that everything you do 
Don't make no sense, even to you 
And you're feeling tired, so you close your eyes 
But it don't sleep, it burns inside 
I've got to keep my feelings up above the ground 
It's burning through my sole and I can't put it out 
I want you to go, but you don't leave 
So I guess you are, just a part of me 
 
Oooh pooh left me feeling low 
Oooh ooh now I'm taking control 
 
Coz I'm a fighter 
A heartbeat left in a cold war 
Breaking out of my own thoughts 
I will be the one in control 
Coz this is my time 
I'm standing on the front line 
Body bleeding I'm so high 
I will be the one in control 
 
Coz I'm a fighter 
I'm in control 
Say it all 
Say it all 
Coz I just can't keep this to myself anymore 
 
Coz I'm a fighter 
A heartbeat left in a cold war 
Breaking out of my own thoughts 
I will be the one in control 
Ooh this is my time 
I'm standing on the front line 
Body bleeding I'm so high 
I will be the one in control 
I will be the one in control
