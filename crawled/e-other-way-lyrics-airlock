I am small but I can see 
I am weak but I can feel 
You do what you want to do 
You say what you want to say 
And then when the times are bad 
You're down upon your knees 
Is it too much to empathize 
Just realize And he will break through you 
And he will break through you 
To go to the other end 
He will follow you Who's telling me 
Who's telling me 
Why tell me 
To look the other way Who's telling me 
Who's telling me 
Why tell me 
To look the other way We seem to talk far too much 
And I find myself asking where has all the love gone 
You know so well how to hate 
You know so well how to complicate Who's telling me 
Who's telling me 
Why tell me 
To look the other way Who's telling me 
Who's telling me 
Why tell me 
To look the other way And he will break through you 
And he will break through you 
To go to the other end 
He will follow you Who's telling me 
Who's telling me 
Why tell me 
To look the other way Who's telling me 
Who's telling me 
Why tell me 
To look the other way I am small but I can see 
I am weak but I can feel I am small but I can see 
I am weak but I can feel I am small but I can see 
I am weak but I can feel
