She met him on Friday night 
Underneath the flashing lights 
And I don`t understand what she sees in him 
He`s got a face for radio 
Still livin` at his parents` home 
Why oh why she left me and now my 
Head is spinnin` like a broken record 
My Baby Left Me For A DJ 
I Just don`t get it but the big bass got her 
My Baby Left Me For A DJ 
And it`s crazy 
My Baby Left Me For A DJ 
My Baby Left Me For A DJ He thinks that he`s a superstar 
He dosen`t even play guitar 
I practice everyday 
And he`s just pressin` play 
And he`s so far from Rock`n`Roll 
He`s got no heart he`s got no soul 
It`s such a mistery that she`s not missin` me Oh now my 
Head is spinnin` like a broken record 
My Baby Left Me For A DJ 
I Just don`t get it but the big bass got her 
My Baby Left Me For A DJ 
And it`s crazy 
My Baby Left Me Someday she`ll figure out 
What DJ Romeo is all about 
She`ll give up that four on the floor 
And come back 
Come back - Come back - Come back 
She`ll come back 
And knockin` at my door Music Head is spinnin` like a broken record 
My Baby Left Me For A DJ 
I Just don`t get it but the big bass got her 
My Baby Left Me For A DJ 
It`s so crazy 
My Baby Left Me For A DJ... Oh my baby left me
