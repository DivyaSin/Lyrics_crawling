(giorgio moroder/ tom whitlock) 
Producer for bonnie: giorgio moroder I remember times like this 
Memories you can't dismiss of paradise 
Looking for a way to start our love again 
Every night and every day 
We can find a better way to live all our lives 
We can be as one again 
Finally find a way to say that we know the truth 'til the end of time we love 
Reaching for the higher ground 
'til the end of time we live 
Giving all we have to give Children of another time 
We lay it all upon the line 
To say I love you 
Every night and every day 
We can find a better way to say 
I love you 'til the end of time we love 
Reaching for the higher ground 
'til the end of time we live 
Giving all we got to give 
Giving all we got to give 
Giving all we got to give 'til the end of time we love 
Every night and every day 
Reaching for the higher ground 
Reaching for the higher ground 'til the end of time we live 
Giving all we got to give
