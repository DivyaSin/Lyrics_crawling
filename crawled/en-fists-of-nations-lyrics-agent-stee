Create the hate, cause the cancer 
Siphon life and paralyze 
Enforce the peace, give medication 
Convincing man to compromise A modern Christ, a new Messiah 
Born of war from blackened sand 
Anointed Lord by my disciples 
Ten fists of nations, I command There'll be no golden future 
Though they are trained to strive 
Only enough to sate them 
To keep the herd alive Soon you shall know, I'll be revealed 
You'll see the light behind my eyes 
To touch the flame, to trust my presence 
Make you feel safe inside my lies And I'll speak the promise 
And I'll bend your mind 
And while I offer solace 
I kill you from inside Ten fists of hate, ten tongues of lies 
Rising child of Zion when two suns shine in the sky 
Thy kingdom come by my command 
Let the eye of Giza drive your souls into my hands 
Ten fists of hate, ten tongues of lies My kingdom calling you, my will for all of you 
Ten fists of nations call, I feel it dragging you down And as the wealth of nations gather 
And the cattle don their reins 
In complete consolidation 
One move to end the game With agony a symphony 
With thunder at my hand 
Send a message to our fathers 
That the earth is now in their command And with no more hesitation 
I let the comet fly 
By my hand the earth awash with light 
The end written in the sky Ten fists of hate, ten tongues of lies 
Rising child of Zion when two suns shine in the sky 
Thy kingdom come by my command 
Let the eye of Giza shine
