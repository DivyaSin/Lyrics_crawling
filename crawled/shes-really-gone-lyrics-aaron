I wish I had the chance to give my heart back . 
Before you left like that . 
The thing that hurts the most , never said good bye . 
Dont understand why . 
I wish I could hear your voice once again . 
You didn't gave god the chance to show you his plan . 
Gave it up so soon . 
I didn't know you felt alone . 
Now you're gone . 
(Chorus) 
She's really gone gone gone x3 I wish I could've known what made you angry . 
You never open up to talk to me . 
You come around with the smile on your face . 
I didn't know your pain . 
Maybe I didn't pay attention to the signs . 
But was it that I couldn't see as I was so blind . 
Can't believe you left me to wonder what was wrong . 
Now you're gone . 
(Chorus) 
She's really gone gone gone x3 Why didn't you let me in . 
I can't reach out of my hand and now I'm standing here hurting . 
Cause I lost my very bestfriend . 
I dont know why you would go away and leave me all alone ! 
And I'm so sad girl . 
She's gone gone gone . 
She's really gone gone gone x2 
I wish I could've known what made you happy . 
Why did you leave me , this way ? 
You didn't talk to me . 
I would've listen to you . 
There are so many people that miss you . 
I miss you too . 
I see you crossed over . 
Some might pieces still . 
Cause now you're here . 
But I wish I could've known what made you happy .
