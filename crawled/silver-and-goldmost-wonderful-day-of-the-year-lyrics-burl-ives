Silver and gold, silver and gold 
Ev'ryone wishes for silver and gold 
How do you measure its worth? 
Just by the pleasure it gives here on earth Silver and gold, silver and gold 
Mean so much more when I see 
Silver and gold decorations 
On ev'ry Christmas tree For millions of girls and for millions of boys 
When Christmas Day is here 
The most wonderful day of the year!
