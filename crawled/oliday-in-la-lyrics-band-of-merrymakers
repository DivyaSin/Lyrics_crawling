Sun is rising on the porch 
december looks like july 
candy canes are hanging red and white 
from the hollywood sign We wanna see snow 
we go to The Grove 
cause every day's a movie 
All your wishes come true With sun in our face 
convertible sleighs 
are cruising down the freeway 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh Cause it's a holiday (wo-oh) 
in LA 
it's a holiday (wo-oh) 
in LA 
where the sun never sets 
we surf and we celebrate 
our holiday in LA Lords a leaping out on venice beach 
there's ain't a cloud in the sky 
jack frost nipping at a sunburned nose 
it melts him everytime We surf on our boards 
and carol in shorts 
and sing with brian wilson 
mistletoes in the dunes We jingle the bells 
in beverly hills 
eat gingerbread at gelson's 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh Cause it's a holiday (wo-oh) 
in LA 
it's a holiday (wo-oh) 
in LA 
where the sun never sets 
we surf and we celebrate 
our holiday in LA Let it ring in 
Everbody's singin' 
When we get that feelin' 
Then we know
