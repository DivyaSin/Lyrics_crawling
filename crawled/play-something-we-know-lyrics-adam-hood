I saw you walk in here with that guitar in your hand, 
I thought I might ask you what you might be playing. 
Just one more question, well I know you got to go, 
Me and my friends are drinking and we was wondering if you know... Any Lynard Skynard, or American Pie, 
Willie and Waylon, or Magic Carpet Ride. 
How about Marshall Tucker, or David Allen Coe. 
Play something we can sing to. Play something we know. I know how it is, Dude, I used to have me a band. 
Til our drummer, Ronnie, got on down at the plant. 
The singer got a girlfriend, you know how that goes. 
So play something we can sing to, play something we know. Do you know any Buffett, or any Pink Floyd. 
How about some Dead, dude, or how about The Doors. 
Do you know any Beatles, or any Rolling Stones. 
Play something we can sing to, play something we know. Man, if you want me to I'll sing a song with you. 
I used to sing the high parts. 
My brother Donnie is sitting at the bar, And he plays a mean guitar. Well, what are you looking at, you don't want me to play? 
Well, you're about to get your ass whipped if you keep looking at me that way. 
Man, I really don't mean it, you don't have to call security. 
I was only hoping that you'd sing a song for me. Do you know Hank Jr., or any Steve Earle. 
How about the Joker, or Brown Eyed Girl. 
Sweet Home Alabama, or Curtis Lowe. 
Play Something we can sing to, Play something we know.
