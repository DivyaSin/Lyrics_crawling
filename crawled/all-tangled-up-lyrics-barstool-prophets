I never wanted anything 
I could just as soon do without. 
But then again, I've never had 
So many things I cared about, 
And simply couldn't do without 
They say it pours when it rains. 
I guess I'd have to agree. 
Swimming in a sea of options, 
Decisions are drowning me. 
So I guess I would agree. 
I can't seem to decide. 
I can't make up my mind. 
I just can't make up my mind. 
I'm all tangled up inside. 
There really isn't one good answer. 
There's always going to be some doubt. 
One wins, the other loses. 
It's the only thing I'm sure about. 
At least, I think I'm sure about. 
You ask me to decide 
But I can't make up my mind. 
I just can't make up my mind. 
I'm all tangled up inside.
