"This song was written by John Lee Hooker 
About his wife, her name is Maudie 
Everytime he has an argument with her 
He has to write a new verse to keep her happy 
He was over here at London a short while back 
And he taught me this song ......." Oh Maudie, baby, I love you 
Mmm, baby, I love you 
Yeah, you've been gone so long 
Girl, I miss you so 
Oh Maudie, why did you hurt me? 
Mmm, Maudie, I said why did you hurt me? 
You know I need your sweet lovin' like a flower needs the rain 
Sometimes when they'd have an argument 
He'd take her by the hand and say, 
"Maudie, you know I love you 
You know I need you 
And I got just one thing to say baby - ho!" 
Hey Maudie, baby don't you know I love you 
Oh, Maudie, I said baby don't you know I love you 
I've been gone so long, God, I miss you so much 
Sometimes Johns old lady 
She'd turn around to him and say, 
"John, if you don't quit your messin' around baby, 
I'm gonna walk right outta that door 
With my bag in my hand." 
John would say, "Hey!" 
Well, Maudie, sweet little girl, baby, 
Oh Maudie, be my sweet little girl, baby, 
When you touch my hand 
My head is all in a whirl now baby 
I love you Maudie 
I said I love you Maudie 
Oh, love you Maudie 
Ooh, love you Maudie 
You know I need, I need, I need, need, yeah 
I said Maudie, baby, I love you 
Oh Maudie, baby, I love you 
I love you Maudie 
You've been gone so long, 
How I've missed you too much 
I love you.
