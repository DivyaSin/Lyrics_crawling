It's so quiet on this wind whirl day 
The city's lights, it's golden rays 
Sunlight on a subway'a tracks 
Are you mad again?? 
If you like 
I'll take it back 
They're just your feelings 
I wasn't looking at her hands 
Oh do you mean it?? It's so lonesome 
In "this happens" stance 
If you ask me.. 
Yes, I'd like to dance 
Just show me a glove-covered hand 
A perfumed dress is more than I can stand.. 
You are poetry with your hollow hearted hand 
And you tell me: 
"It's not silver lights 
It's not fair to me 
The blues, the grays, the olive greens" 
I'll take you far away from me The girls in their summer dresses see 
Though you don't notice 
They all look back at me 
Is this on purpose?? Oh no, no, no.. 
Oh no, no, no.. 
Oh no, no, no.. May offer to you 
This, my olive branch 
It's not as though they're always so keen 
And we're both just the victims of circumstance 
Do you understand, 
Do you know what I mean?? Oh no, no, no.. 
Oh no, no, no.. 
Oh no, no, no.. 
Oh no, no, no.. I'm a husband first 
I'm a childless curse 
I am faithful man 
With a face that's rich 
I plan to stay with you 
And please don't sigh 
I try to explain 
But you would cry, 
And cry, and cry, and cry 
And you hate me 
When I ask the reason why 
You'll trade me a dollar for some sense 
But don't blame me 
I was only making sense 
Oh I'm so sorry 
I was only making sense
