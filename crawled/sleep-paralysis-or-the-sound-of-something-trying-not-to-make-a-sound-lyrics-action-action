It was somewhere around Sheffield where my conscious concedes 
Fiction halts, the drugs began to wear thin, oh 
Colored obvious, the world slid off it's tilt 
Waking up each night from the gravitational pull 
What is the sound of something trying not to make a sound? So sick of all the same old shit, so spent on being sick 
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late? 
Ghost wrote in the middle of the night, chocking and obvious 
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late? Always afraid, afraid of what the truth may bring, oh 
The last horse has finally crossed the finish line, yeah 
Long and clever titles doesn't bring a clever song 
This show has been going downhill since season one 
Just an open book reading itself to sleep So sick of all the same old shit, so spent on being sick 
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late? 
Undone in the middle of the night, stinkingly obvious 
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late?
