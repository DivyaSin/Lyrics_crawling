Now I cry for daylight 
Daylight and the sun 
Now I cry for daylight 
Daylight everyone 
Daylight in my heart 
Daylight in the trees 
Daylight kissing everything 
She can see There was no light 
Only the white night 
First born when the sun 
Screamed her eyes open 
Daylight in the fields 
Daylight mountains 
Fire kisses the floor 
Of the lakes and makes shadows Now I cry for daylight 
Daylight and the sun 
Now I cry for daylight 
Daylight everyone 
Daylight in my heart 
Daylight in the trees 
Daylight kissing everything 
She can see Ooh your dream 
Here on the water 
Warm the sand 
The seagulls calling 
Kissed by kindness x4 Ooh your dream 
Here on the water 
Warm the sand 
The seagulls calling 
Kissed by kindness x4 You gave me this 
Your fire becomes a kiss 
You gave me this 
Your fire becomes a kiss
