The end's not near 
It's here 
Hallelujah 
Spread the cheer 
And watch the millenarians 
Throw a party for a thousand years You won't see the pious praying 
They'll be too busy flaying 
All the martyrs with better ways 
To stop the world decaying If you call me I won't be home 
I'm hiding from the kingdom come 
They can't see everything on earth 
With the satellites and the roving drones This is why hell is underground 
Like a reclaimed bad part of town 
We don't want to lose our souls 
We're the saints who don't want to be found
