I come to You, oh God 
In the stillness of my heart 
I need Your healing and Your voice 
In the stillness of my heart So speak to me and show me who You are 
Rescue me with Your unfailing love and mercy 
Speak to me and show me who You are 
Hold me tightly in Your arms and never let me go I hear You calling out my name 
In the stillness of my heart 
Your grace is given me again 
Now, I open my heart So speak to me and show me who You are 
Rescue me with Your unfailing love and mercy 
Speak to me and show me who You are 
Hold me tightly in Your arms and never let me go I remember singing praises to Your name 
Everyday with all my might 
How I long to sing to You again Speak to me and show me who You are 
Rescue me with Your unfailing love and mercy 
Speak to me and show me who You are 
Hold me tightly in Your arms and never let me go Speak to me and show me who You are 
Rescue me with Your unfailing love and mercy 
Speak to me and show me who You are 
Hold me tightly in Your arms and never let me go 
Hold me tightly in Your arms and never let me go
