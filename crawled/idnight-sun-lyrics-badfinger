Oh no 
Oh no 
I think it's time for me to run 
Well I've been working all the summer 
Waiting for the winter to come 
And if you feel like reminiscing 
Well come into the midnight sun Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 
I think I've been away too long 
Well I've been coming and I'm going 
All the time is growing with fun 
And if you feel like something's missing 
Well come into the midnight sun Never be a gooseberry for gooseberries should never see it 
Drop the one who's looking at you 
Looking at the one who's seeing you be it Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 
I think I've been away too long 
Well I've been waiting all the summer 
Counting all the trophies I've won 
And if you feel like reminiscing 
Well come into the midnight sun
