We die one thousand deaths 
They held us close to taste the flames 
A sacrifice 
To pacify the gods they've made The stench of stagnant blood 
Collects in pools of misery 
They drained from us and stained 
Themselves in blasphemy We are the sacrifice 
Your tainted offering 
We are the sacrifice 
Now you will share our suffering We steal a final breath A tattered veil averts our eyes 
From their hypocrisy 
Their cruel intent hidden by lies 
The silence lingering 
Like the condemned waiting to die 
In darkest red 
Reflecting black beneath the light We are the sacrifice 
Your tainted offering 
We are the sacrifice 
Now you will share our suffering In the eyes of our father 
From the tears of our mother 
In the eyes of your father 
From the tears of your mother 
In the eyes of your father 
From the tears of your mother's shame 
Shame! We are the sacrifice 
Your tainted offering 
We are the sacrifice 
Now you will share our suffering
