High, low, here we go 
Hear the word 
That floats upon the air above 
Reach up, touch the night 
Catch a light 
That's falling on the only ones 
The only ones And the way you see your life 
A case of "do or die" 
Returns us to the way 
It used to be before 
And the future lies 
In the years of sacrifice 
You'll open up your eyes 
And wake to see it 
Standing at your door Right time turn it on 
Touch a heart 
That's waiting for the only one 
Night time, can't go wrong 
Open up and sing the song 
For everyone And the way you see your life 
A case of "do or die" 
To preserve your sanity 
When others lose control 
And the years we spent 
Heaven blessed or heaven sent 
Sang where kings and presidents 
Could change the world 
Just standing at the wall! Why, tell me why, don't you know 
Do you believe in dreams? 
Tell me where did they go? 
Why did they leave us? If you ask me I don't know. 
Where did the music go? 
After all is said and done 
Same chance for everyone If you ask us we can't say 
When did the music go away 
After all is said and done 
Same chance for everyone Why, tell me why, don't you know? 
Do you believe in dreams? 
Tell me where did they go? 
Why did they leave us?
