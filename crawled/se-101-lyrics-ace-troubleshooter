These four walls and late nights brooding 
Never changing, never moving 
It seems, it seems momentum's at a crawl The ants are in the kitchen 
The mice are in the walls 
This noise in my head 
Could make this building fall, yeah I've got to get out of here 
And I gotta get out, now, before I crack Mac and cheese and minute rice 
And instant pleasure's always nice 
It seems, it seems 
Real things take much too long And I say now's the time to take a stand 
And sit back down, hasty young man 
Did you really think the world and all that it's offered 
Could have done you so much wrong? Oh, yeah I've got to get out of here 
And I gotta get out, now, before I crack South East, 101 forever 
South East, 101 till I die 
South East, 101 forever 
South East, 101 till I die I've got to get out of here 
And I gotta get out, now, before I go
