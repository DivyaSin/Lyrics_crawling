Another child born to the house - I hate children 
Raise him right so he won't be a mouse - I hate children 
I hate it when they make lots of noise - I hate children 
And i broke my neck tripping over their toys - I hate children [Chorus] 
Shut your mouth you stupid little brat 
what you need's a smack smack smack 
If i had my way i'd give you all away I hate the crying that they make - I hate children 
Screaming and whining for a piece of cake - I hate Children 
I hate getting up late at night - I hate children 
To Check and see if the crying baby's alright - I hate children [Chorus] 
Now you're had you little monstrous kid - i hate children 
It's of you that i'll be rid - I hate children 
Do you see this toy it's called a gun - I hate children 
And if you want to live you'd better run - I hate children
