Do you really want to know me 
Do you care what's inside 
Can you ever really show me 
There's no secrets I must hide If I bare my soul can you accept it all 
My darkest corner's safe behind a wall Do you really want to know me...at all 
I can't accept the pain 
My brain screams like a runaway train 
Trying to keep my heart on track 
The embers turned to flame and I want you back 
But I can't trust a memory 
I can't trust a memory 
No I can't trust me Do you really want to know me 
Do you know what makes me smile 
Can you ever really promise me 
This time it's not a lie I'll believe it's true when you're standin' at my door 
I'm always here for you and I'll open it once more [Repeat: x3] 
Do you really want to know me 
Do you really want to know me 
At all
