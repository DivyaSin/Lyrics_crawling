And so the time has come, 
To fight for right and wrong. 
There is no one to save us from ourselves. 
Along the troubled road, 
A story will unfold 
Of fantasy born any age of innocence. I can see the rain begin to fall, 
Watch as the wind blows, 
Can you hear this voices when they call ? 
Yesterday's heroes. A game of consequence, 
We have to take the chance 
And do our best 
To keep the past alive. 
Soon we will return, 
A lesson to be learned, 
By those who try to keep 
The flame from burning. I can see the rain begin to fall, 
Watch as the wind blows, 
Can you hear this voices when they call ? 
Yesterday's heroes. Here we're helplessly searching for truth 
Is it me ? Is it you ? 
Will our lives just crumble away ? I can see the rain begin to fall 
Watch as the wind blows. 
Can you hear this voices when they call ? 
Yesterday's heroes.
