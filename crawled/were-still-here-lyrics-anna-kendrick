Good times and bum times, I've seen them all 
And, my dear, I'm still here 
Plush velvet sometimes 
Sometimes just pretzels and beer, but I'm here I've run the gamut, A to Z 
Three cheers and dammit, C'est la vie 
I got through all of last year, and I'm here 
Lord knows, at least I was there, and I'm here 
Look who's here, I'm still here
