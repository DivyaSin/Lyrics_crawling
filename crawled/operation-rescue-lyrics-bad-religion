It is an S.O.S. sent out telepathically 
Signs of our distress don't allow complacency 
We need restoration now of our integrity 
And a drastic bold reminder of our morality The rectifying troop is here, the ones we've needed all these years 
To stop the heinous wrongdoings and verify our moral benevolence as a people Operation, Operation Rescue 
They're here to right our fall, they've heard a troubled call 
Operation, Operation Rescue 
You wonder where they come from, but I just wonder why they're here at all 
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya 
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya 
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya 
Ya-ya-ya-ya Life ever-after is what they're in business for 
See them brandish the key to their kingdom's door 
It's persuasive, it's a part of you and me 
But it's not overwhelming as they wish it to be If no one believed in fairy tales, there's nothing they could do but fail 
Yet everywhere we look someone is trying to reassure our 
moral benevolence as a people Operation, Operation Rescue 
They're here to right our fall, they've heard someone's troubled call 
Operation, Operation Rescue 
You wonder where they come from, but I just wonder what compels them all Operation, Operation Rescue 
Operation, Operation Rescue 
You may wonder where they come from 
But I just wonder what compels them all 
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya 
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya 
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
