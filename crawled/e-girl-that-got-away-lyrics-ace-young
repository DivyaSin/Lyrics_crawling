I ran into you 
Like a deja vu, but I've never seen your face 
When I heard your voice above all the noise 
I felt so out of place 
It was make or break why did I hesitate 
I didn't know just what to do (i had) one chance 
(i had) one shot 
I should've walked right up to you [Chorus] 
I didn't even know your name 
Why did I look you in the eyes 
And now ill never be the same 
It was an ordinary day 
Was it my loneliness inside 
That put you deep into my mind 
Now I cant forget, the girl that got away It was the month of may 
Its been a year today 
Since you ran off with my life 
Going through my head, 
The notes I could've sent, 365 goodbyes (i had) one night 
(i had) one touch 
Oh, should've tried to make you mine [Chorus] To whom it may concern, 
Would you please return, 
I've got so much more to say 
If I got it wrong, can you pass it on 
To the girl that got away [Chorus]
