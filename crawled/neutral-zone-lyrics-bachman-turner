Neutral Zone 
Fred Turner If you listen you can hear me 
Lord I need someone to show me 
I'm not alone, take me from this neutral zone When the king of this illusion 
Spreads his heartache and confusion 
I know, I'm gonna get out of this neutral zone It used to be such a good time 
But then blood comes to a boil 
Soon come the lies as they scramble to hide 
What's gone down, all around When they lose the real perspective 
And those losses aren't subjective 
Oh no, they're going to send us to the neutral zone 
Oh no, they're going to send us to the neutral zone Oh no, they're going to send us to the neutral zone 
Oh no, they're going to send us to the neutral zone I keep right on going, and though I'm working hard 
I see the gypsy wince as she reads the cards, life is hard When they lose the real perspective 
And those losses aren't subjective 
Oh no, they're going to send us to the neutral zone 
Oh no, they're going to send us to the neutral zone 
Oh no, they're going to send us to the neutral zone 
Oh no, they're going to send us to the neutral zone
