Blue days, aching to my bones 
I love you, baby don't you know 
Heartache like this I've never known 
I need you like I've never needed before [Chorus] 
How long to wait til I'm round that crooked bend 
Don't want to hate what I can't have in the end 
Too many roads that dead end straight ahead 
And now I know that it's over, it's over Dark clouds, just another day 
No sunshine, I don't care if it rains 
Sweet dreams are all that's left to claim 
Could be I'll never love again [Chorus] Just wait until tomorrow 
You'll know that's it's over [Chorus] Just wait until tomorrow 
You'll know that it's over
