Can you hear me calling into the night 
Screaming at the skies 
And calling out your name 
Can you see me standing so close it hurts my eyes 
And I realize 
How your really so far away Im here today 
Gone tomorrow to yesterday 
Wishing I were with you 
Remember when 
It was you and me and what couldve been 
Im wishing I was still with you *chorus* 
Tell me am I dreaming 
Is this a fantasy 
It seems like it was never meant happen 
And like you never wanted it to be I know that this will never bring you back 
I don't even know if I would want it to 
What we had is gone I know, 
Days went so fast and nights so slow 
Nights filled with dreams of you
