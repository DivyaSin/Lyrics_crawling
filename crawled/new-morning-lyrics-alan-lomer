Baby don't cry 
Its all right 
Don't be sad got to hold on Butterfly 
Travel alive 
Its easier said than done Tighter the chord 
So much to wait for 
We can start all over again 
All over again hmmm... Its a new morning 
hmmm... yeah yeah yeah ... 
hmmm... Its a new morning 
we can start all over again Dry your eyes 
Realize 
I may fool you to be known Breathe again 
Dream again 
Let the nightmare end Face the wall 
Soften the wall 
We can start all over again 
All over again hmmm... Its a new morning 
hmmm... yeah yeah yeah .... 
hmmm... Its a new morning 
We can start all over again
