V1 
Just wait and it'll creep in 
Sit an hour 
Sip your glass 
And slowly let it begin 
This time 
Don't you think we'll be fine? I cannot tell if it's your eyes that have changed 
You've always seen right through me 
But it's never felt strange 
Until now 
While the room spins around Ch 
I try breathing in 
Breathing out 
(But it's still no good) 
Close my eyes 
And block out the sound 
(But it's still no good) Your face begins to change 
And the room is rearranged 
I heard the things you've said 
But your voice is not the same 
I've been here before, but I won't come back again 
Old friend 
It's time to find my way out 
Time to find my way out V2 
I can feel us sinking 
The lights have got so dim 
And I am running out of reasons 
It's time 
I didn't think that you'd mind 
We got used to being so lonely right? BR. 
Fix eyes 
Walk straight 
Don't look lost Tune out 
Talk shit 
Take them all Duck down 
Don't blink 
She'll be cross We're cool 
Keep calm 
Casket calls Ch 
I try breathing in 
Breathing out 
(But it's still no good) 
Close my eyes 
And block out the sound 
(But it's still no good) Your face begins to change 
And the room is rearranged 
I heard the things you've said 
But your voice is not the same 
I've been here before, but I won't come back again 
Old friend 
It's time to find my way out 
Time to find my way out
