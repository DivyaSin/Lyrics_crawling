I've been around the world 
And baby I know 
I'm in another land far from home 
I feel I must be dreaming 
Or am I just insane 
There's one thing I remember 
It's burning in my brain 
Live free or die 
I can't remember when 
I felt so small 
Handcuffed all stitched up 
Against the wall 
I've got a strong suspicion 
Somethings going on 
Something that's got nothing 
To do with right or wrong 
Live free or die 
Live free 
Free or die
