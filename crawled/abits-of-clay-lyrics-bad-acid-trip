To each their own but you should listen to me 
Sometimes youve got to fight to be free 
But Ill stifle the hope and Ill fight the sorrow 
Always seeking unity for a better tomorrow 
Its so easy to give up on all of your dreams 
To become distracted by all the little things 
Before you know it, youve gotten quite old 
Its time to hope that youve got a soul 
And if you do you hope that they will see 
Not to judge you by all your apathy 
Another human afraid to live 
Quick to take, reluctant to give 
Teaching your hate 'cause loves harder to give 
Its all about me and Ill kill you to live 
I keep on fighting these habits of clay 
It just gets more painful every day 
Feel like youre sinking into a tar pit 
Youre an infant, reclaim your tit 
Apathetic I want more of the same 
Getting good at playing this bullshit game 
I Dont want to die, it scares me a lot 
If god is a lie, am I going to rot? 
Another human whos afraid to live 
Always quick to take, but reluctant to give 
Teaching your hate 'cause loves harder to give 
Its all about me and Ill kill you to live
