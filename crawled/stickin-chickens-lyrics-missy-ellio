[Aaliyah and Missy Elliott] 
Uh, uh (yeah, yeah) 
Uh, uh (yeah, yeah) 
Ninety-nine, uh, uh (yeah, yeah) what you got, boo?) I was in love wit' you (yeah) 
And you couldn't do no wrong in my eyes 
When I found out the scoop on you (yeah) 
It was still too hard for me to realize 
That I needed to be through wit' you (yeah) 
'Cause you're the reason I can't eat or sleep (yeah) 
All the girls you runnin' through (yeah) 
Used to be best friends, down wit' me [Chorus:] 
When I'm gone, you're alone 
You stickin' them chickens till I get home 
When I'm home, you're wit' me 
Kissin' on my ass, tryin' to be wit' me 
Well, it's done; this I know 
Seen it for myself; I'm a let you know 
You don't play games wit' me 
But before I go, better leave my dough [Missy Elliott] 
I'm a fool for you (yeah) 
But you seem to think my love's a joke (It ain't a joke, boo) 
I get no love from you (yeah) 
Like all these times I did before 
I think I'll pass on you (yeah) 
Because of the way you been actin' lately 
I get no cash from you (yeah) 
If you want me to stay, you must be crazy [Chorus] Dedication 
It was just a bad relation (yes, it was; yes, it was) 
When I think, it cuts my insides 
The tears 
They fall deep down from my eyes 
Dedication 
It was just a bad relation (yes, it was; yes, it was) 
When I think, it cuts my insides 
The tears 
They fall deep down from my eyes [Aaliyah & Missy Elliott] 
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo (what say what, uh uh uh) 
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo (Da Brat) [Da Brat] 
I want it all from the motherfuckin' house, down to the dogs 
You trickin' off with these chickens; I thought you ain't have no flaws 
Keep yo dick in they jaws; Peter should've stayed in his drawers 
Now I'm out the door, and you can't claim me no more 
The loss is yours 
How you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit' 
Went to grade school wit'? Couldn't pay me to believe you hit it 
To think I footed all the bills and now you breakin' 
Stop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in 
You wasted my valuable time; there's money to make 
Scared to set foot in another relationship 'cause of the heartache 
Heartbreak Hotel; no, not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney 
No, it's Brat, Aaliyah and Missy 
You miss me 'cause we finished 
I'll just keep the keys to the 20-inch rim ride with the TVs in it 
You don't need it, beat it: it's mine 
Kiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass) 
Keep stickin' them chickens 
Send Peter straight to the clinic, nigga [Missy] 
See, I'm a give you your props though 
You like a bad ass motherfucker 
Runnin' two bitches at one time 
When I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in 
Sayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game 
Who the fuck you think I am 
Willy Limpdick or somebody? Forget you, man 
That's why us bitches gonna stick together 
Bitch
