Under the flag of honor 
Marching towards the front 
For God and the nation 
Facing the battle storm Young men join the colors 
Heroic deeds in mind 
The idea to kill the enemy 
Drives them really mad For God and the Nation 
Win the day 
Don't surrender till the battle is won 
But they're falling one by one Roaring guns and aircraft 
Destruction still remains 
Horrors of trench warfare 
Shattering their brains Stumbling over corpses 
How long will you survive? 
You came to fight for glory 
Now you're left to die For God and the Nation 
Win the day 
Don't surrender till the battle is won 
But they're falling one by one
