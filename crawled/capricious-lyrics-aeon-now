Capricious, oh Capricious 
lonely as the wind blows 
jump the tracks between us 
they're twisting up tornados 
from the deepest darkened bellows 
to the highest aspiration Capricious, oh Capricious 
beauty at the window 
break the ties that blind us 
we're losing all our rainbows 
to chaos and the storm 
like some unwelcome guest ever since we were breathing 
since the morning we were born 
fed love and evil from all sides 
till the morning when we learn 
how to laugh and cry in strides 
how to grow then watch it burn Capricious, oh Capricious 
from your mean green walls of memory 
all hidden deep within your chest 
long lava roads lay between us 
but the cross roads 
sends back its best 
with a river to remind us Capricious, oh Capricious 
just how lost a lover gets 
without a river to remind her 
she's likely to forget 
and just roll on past tomorrow 
like some unwelcome guest ever since we were feeling 
since the evening we were one 
fed love and evil from all sides 
till the morning when we learn 
how give and take in strides 
how to grow then watch it burn
