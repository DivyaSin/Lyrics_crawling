Everybody dies 
Everybody dies [Jamie Madrox] 
Patchwork, sewn together from dues to dirt 
From earthgrown and weather conditions of the desert 
And everyone's a part of it, some more then others 
Sons, daughters, and brothers, laywers, accountants, and even grandmothers 
New comers and old faces, people of any races, and familiar places 
Parents and teachers, prostitutes and preachers 
Throw ya hands to the sky and pray that he can see us 
Living how we got to live, and doing what we got to do 
Praying for another day so we can fight and make it through 
Some of us are designed for crimes, some of us designed for rhymes 
Still we congregate in unemployment lines 
One of a kind, and still kinda strange, same book, same world 
Just we on another page. (one more time) 
One of a kind, and still kinda strange, same book, same world 
Just we on another page... [Chorus x2] 
Come on, we on another page 
(Everybody dies) 
Come on, we on another page 
(Everybody dies) [Monoxide Child] 
Once I lit a smoke off a bitch I fried 
And I ashed it in her face when she died 
Who you bitches you calling regular when you out of my zone? 
Like a celluar phone that's stuck on roam, now get ya mind blown 
That's me and my man at your door, and we looking for a reason to start the war 
You should of never tried to take a stab at us 
And you never should of rapped on us 
We see the game from way the others hurried and rush 
We broke them down, rolled them up, sparked the flame and smoked them all in the dust, what? 
You couldn't touch me bitch, not even if you wanted when it's supposed to 
Bitch I'll have your whole block haunted 
Flaunt us like the beans in your chilli, we all know the really really 
Monoxide slap your girlfriend silly 
Big Willie get your throat cut and left bleeding 
While my homeboy's banging your girl, while ya leaving [Chorus x2] 
Come on, we on another page 
(Everybody dies) 
Come on, we on another page 
(Everybody dies) [Bushwick Bill] 
What ya looking at, where ya bitch at? 
I'll make her bounce on till the back's up 
Thinking you're something that your other playas tap off 
Holes in your stomach, till your whole waist snap off 
Pour on some 'nac, bite the bottle cap off 
Hate it with a passion when a bitch nigga act off 
Ride on ya hood everyday and never slack off 
Never let it get squash, never let it slide 
Die mothafucka, die mothafucka, die [Anybody Killa] 
Flip through a couple pages, looking into my background 
All you see is the dead around 
Daddy always said there'd be days like this 
Now daddy's dead and gone cause he was granted his only wish 
I can't believe all the drama when it comes to death 
Ain't nothing you can do but pay respect 
Slip into the afterlife, feeling light as a feather 
Everybody dies, so quit acting like you livin' forever [Chorus x2] 
Come on, we on another page 
(Everybody dies) 
Come on, we on another page 
(Everybody dies)
