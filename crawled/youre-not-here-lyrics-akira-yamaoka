Blue sky to forever, 
green grass blows in the wind, dancing 
It would be much better a sight with you, with me, 
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby, 
I never felt so lonely, then you came along, So now what should I do? I'm strung out, addicted to you, 
My body it aches, now that you're gone, 
My supply fell through, You gladly gave me everything you had and more, 
You craved my happiness, 
When you make me feel joy it makes you smile, 
But now I feel your stress, 
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no 
And who has time for tears? 
Never thought I'd sit around and cry for your love, 
'till now.
