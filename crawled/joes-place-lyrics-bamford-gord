(Gord Bamford / Mike Dekle) There's a place called Joe's 
Where some of us go 
When the hard working day is through 
In the neon and smoke 
We laugh and tell jokes 
And throw down a cold one or two 
The jukebox is full of records 
By Willlie, Haggard and Jones 
There's pictures of Elvis and ol' John Wayne 
Hanging side by side on the wall Chorus: 
Down at Joe's place It's still the old way 
Pickled eggs in a jar 
And a blue ribbon sign 
Ol' boys and bankers 
Sitting side by side 
Down at Joe's place 
Down at Joe's place Along about midnight 
A few hangers on 
Are still hanging out at the bar 
If the telephone rings 
It's an understood thing 
Old Joe don't know where they are 
At a table in the corner 
There's a young man and an empty chair 
His head in his hand, tears in eyes 
And his girlfriend's ring lying there
