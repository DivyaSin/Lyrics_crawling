All I want is to be mesmerized 
And you know what does those things to me hypnotized? 
Look deep into my eyes 
Look deep into my eyes and you will see That I'm the one who walks the tightrope up above 
The heads of many who would love to see me fall 
But when I'm feeling right, the music never stops 
I'm breaking bones, but I can feel, no pain at all I know that This is all I need this is all that I desire 
I'll tell you this I'm coming right down to the wire again 
This is all I need and this is all I need to know 
I'll be lost until the music takes control It seems to me there must be more to life you know 
Than racing up and down these dead end streets 
I've got to try out here it's do or die 
And I'll be leaving nothing incomplete
