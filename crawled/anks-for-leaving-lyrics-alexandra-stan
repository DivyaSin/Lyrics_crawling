We crashed & burned 
A lesson learned 
We fell head first, 
Silly us, SO STUPID 
Our lines got blurred 
We walked into the fire 
Knowing we'd get burned! But now my LOVE has turned to HATE 
And I won't spend another day with you inside my head 
I know that we all make mistakes 
'Cause you're the biggest prize I've paid 
And now I'm paying off that debt, ooh Go on! sent your packing 
So long! you've been slacking 
We're so out of reasons 
THANK YOU FOR LEAVING 
My heart's been re-listed 
You have been evicted 
You're out, I'm spring cleaning 
So thank you, and 
THANKS FOR LEAVING! I broke my rules 
Let you play me fool 
Thought I was so cool 
Silly me, SO STUPID 
How could you be so cruel 
Turned me into be a LIAR 
Things I said I'd never do But now my LOVE has turned to HATE 
And I won't spend another day with you inside my head 
I know that we all make mistakes 
'Cause you're the biggest prize I've paid 
And now I'm paying off that debt, ooh Go on! sent your packing 
So long! you've been slacking 
We're so out of reasons 
THANK YOU FOR LEAVING 
My heart's been re-listed 
You have been evicted 
You're out, I'm spring cleaning 
So thank you, and 
THANKS FOR LEAVING! Every CRACK in the wall it reminds me of 
All the hundred million reasons I put down my gloves 
I can't believe this was REAL! 
And the picture that still sits by the fire place 
Every time I had to see your little stupid face 
I don't think I can DEAL Go on! sent your packing 
So long! you've been slacking 
We're so out of reasons 
THANK YOU FOR LEAVING 
My heart's been re-listed 
You have been evicted 
You're out, I'm spring cleaning 
So thank you, and 
THANKS FOR LEAVING!
