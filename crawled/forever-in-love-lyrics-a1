Love leads to laughter 
Love leads to pain 
With you by my side I feel good times again Never have I felt this feeling before 
You showed me the world how could I ask for more And although there's confusion 
We'll find a solution to keep my heart close to you And I now 
Yes I know 
If you hold me, believe me 
I'll never never ever leave And I know 
There's nothing that I would not do for you 
Forever be true 
And I know 
Although times can be hard we will see it through 
I'm forever in love with you Show me affection in all different ways 
Give you my heart for the rest of my days With you all my troubles are left far behind 
Like heaven on earth when I look in your eyes And although there's confusion we'll find a solution 
To keep my heart close to you And I now 
yes I know 
If you hold me, believe me 
I'll never never ever leave And I know 
There's nothing that I would not do for you 
Forever be true 
And I know 
Although times can be hard we will see it through 
I'm forever in love with you No need to cry 
I'll be right by your side (right by your side) 
Let's take our time 
Love won't run dry 
If you hold me, believe me I'll never ever leave And I know 
There's nothing that I would not do for you
