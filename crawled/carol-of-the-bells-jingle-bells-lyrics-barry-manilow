The bells of christmas 
Are ringing in the night 
The children string there lights upon the tree 
The bells of christmas 
They sing to me tonight 
Bring back thoughts of you and me Central Park 
Sliding round in the snow 
And then after dark 
Filling the fires burning glow The bells of christmas 
They ring of what could be 
For the bells of christmas 
They ring for you and me 
Sunday walks watching ships in the bay Midnight talks we voul 
We never let love slip away 
The bells of christmas 
They ring of what could be 
For the bells of christmas 
The bells of christmas 
The bells of christmas 
They ring for you and me
