Evan: 
Tell her, you've thought about what happened. 
Tell her, you haven't slept at night. 
Tell her, although you made a huge mistake, 
you want to make it right. 
Tell her, you know you aren't perfect. 
Tell her, you've waited way to long. 
Tell her you're sorry. 
Tel her you mean it. 
Tell her you just, were wrong. Patrice: 
Tell her, she shouldn't have ignored you. 
Or dissed you in front of all the school. 
Tell her, the minute she got out of touch, 
you felt, like such a fool. 
Tell her, that studying together. 
Was so nice, you prayed it wouldn't end. 
Say you forgive her 
Say you were jealous. 
Ask if she'll be your friend. Evan and Patrice: 
Tell her that people get things wrong. 
'Cause people are afraid they won't fit in your world or in your life. 
But things will work out fine, if she will only listen. Patrice: 
Tell her that all you ever wanted. Evan: 
Tell her that all you ever wanted. Patrice: 
Was maybe Evan and Patrice: 
A smile or a glance. Evan: 
Tell her you're sorry. Patrice: 
Tell her you mean it. Evan and Patrice: 
Ask for another chance 
Tell her you just want, 
another, 
chance.
