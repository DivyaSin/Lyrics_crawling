Her throat is soft, her lips are red 
Her thighs are white, her heart is dead 
Jezabell 
Red rope burns around her wrists 
Her blood is cold a serpent's kiss 
Do you love your whore? I like to hear you beg 
She's crouched down in the corner with her hands between her legs 
Jezabell 
Broken glass and dirty needles 
Soul erosion truth 
Electric god our superman 
Found dead in a telephone booth 
Shards of teeth ice pick abortions 
Orgasmic death, so warm 
Let's die screamin' black goat semen 
I can't hear you whisper "conform" 
Hearts will stop and brain cells pop 
Apocalyptic sunshine high 
She screams bloody murder as they chop off her fingers 
So this is how it feels to die 
But its O.K. 
She was screamin' bout conspiracy 
Talkin' bout talkin' sides 
I was masturbating just contemplating 
The cold love of suicide
