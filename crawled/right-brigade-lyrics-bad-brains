You can't disappear anymore. I see your face lurkiing outside the window. You say your a trife, I'm a bore. You touch yourself put your face in the pillow, but the funny thing about you is you remembered to leave it behind. The funny thing about me is. I'm a member of the right brigade. Makes no difference to me what side you choose, what side will lose. All their is to perceive is what I want. And I know how how to get it. But the funny thing about you is, you remember to leave it behind. and the funny thing about me is, I'm a member of the right brigade.
