So I just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain 
And maybe you will never see the 1000 tears you gave to me 
And if the rain should go away then in my lonely room I'll stay 
So that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go away So I just live a life of hope pretending that I could not care 
But if you find you cannot cope just call my name and I'll be there 
If I could live my life again I still relive those precious times 
Although I know there will be pain it felt so good while you were mine Be mine be mine So I Just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain 
And maybe you will never see the 1000 tears you gave to me 
And if the rain should go away then in my lonely room I stay 
So that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go
