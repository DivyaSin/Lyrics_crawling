There you go, 
Our name in stone forever 
You built your walls to 
Keep your heart safe 
Well, I know we had our 
Share of storm weather But I wish time could erase 
What time's taken away And I'm sorry if I wasn't what you needed 
And I'm sorry for the words I didn't say 
You now I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah 
That I let you slip away 
You know I'm sorry Our pages fit together 
We chase to find a book 
Is never bound 
Oh, it's a bitter world 
Full of sweet surrender Maybe time can erase 
What time has turned 
Upside down And I'm sorry if I wasn't what you needed 
And I'm sorry for the words I didn't say 
You now I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah 
That I let you slip away 
You know I'm sorry 
Well, you know I'm sorry Try to read between the lines 
And meet on the other side 
So I can take your hand 
And bring you home And I'm sorry if I wasn't what you needed 
And I'm sorry for the words I didn't say 
You now I'm sorry for the love 
I'm sorry for the hate 
And I'm sorry that I ever 
Let you slip away
