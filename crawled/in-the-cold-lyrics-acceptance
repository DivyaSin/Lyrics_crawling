And the words they take their meaning (It's all you said) 
And the flame, it loses color (It's all you said) 
Take take take a while, take a while (It's all you said) Knowing that it's far from over 
This one belongs to you Time shows us that all that ever mattered 
All that ever mattered leaves us in the cold 
If you ever believe this what you need 
It will spin around and shatter 
Throw you to the floor 
As it leaves us in the cold And the dream you think I'm making 
While the house I built is breaking 
Take take take a while, take a while (It's all you said) Knowing that it's far from over 
This one belongs to you Time shows us that all that ever mattered 
All that ever mattered leaves us in the cold 
If you ever believe this what you need 
It will spin around and shatter 
Throw you to the floor 
As it leaves us in the cold I remember the train you came in on 
Everything I want kept calling 
I remember the chill that came over 
Everything I love went falling Time shows us that all that ever mattered 
All that ever mattered leaves us in the cold 
If you ever believe this what you need 
It will spin around and shatter 
Throw you to the floor 
As it leaves us in the cold
