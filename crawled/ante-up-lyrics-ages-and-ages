I see whites in the eyes of the lawless 
Creeping in through the cracks of my fence 
I wanna shake 'em off, I'm gonna pay 'em their dues 
'Cause after me, they're coming after you But I don't know if I can wait till then 
Where I'm at, I'm gonna be until the end 
And with a little unrest, they're sure to turn around and go 
'Cause they don't believe what they pretend to know And the ones who relate 
Are the ones who will take it up I got a life in the breeze and the branches 
Shake the leaves to make my presence known 
Well, it's a curious path to be had by a few 
But it's enough for me, if it's enough for you And the ones who relate 
Are the ones who will take it up Ante up, won't you ante up 
Come and lay your future in this earth and mud 
Ante up, won't you ante up 
Leave it all behind and stay for good Ante up, won't you ante up 
Come and lay your future in this earth and mud 
Ante up, won't you ante up 
Leave it all behind and stay for good Ante up, won't you ante up 
Come and lay your future in this earth and mud 
Ante up, won't you ante up 
Leave it all behind and stay for good And the ones who relate 
Are the ones who will take it up
