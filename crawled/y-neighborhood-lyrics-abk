[ABK] 
My neighborhoods full of drama, killas and thugs 
Everybody's representing by throwing em up 
With a quick hi, hello, or beat down baby 
Even the cops know the blocks that it's all time crazy 
It's alright cause it's home sweet hood 
Even though half of us is up to no good 
You gotta love it when you born and raised 
In place full of problems that you gotta face 
I'm a native in the city of these Detroit streets 
With a warrior mentality that won't at ease 
Tomahawk in one hand, blunt in the other 
So I can just get high and swing at motherfuckers 
That's how it is, I protect my shit 
On my front porch serving up free fat lips 
So come and see me if you down to hang 
But when you visit in the mix you can't be acting strange [Chorus x4] 
My neighborhood ain't what it's all crack up to be 
So much drama [Boondox] 
H-double o-d-c-o-v in the double 7-0 is where you finding me 
With that front porch living got that lawn chair high 
But don't mistake this lifestyle for a reason to try 
Cause it's a reason to die, we straight country folk bangin 
Them dirt road junkies know them country folk slangin 
Got that hard, that soft, that prescription for your mentals 
My neighborhood homies got them backwoods credentials 
Two 4 door chevies, one's on blocks, the other pumped out 
Bad ass kids leaving grown folk's punked out 
Trailer park cooking serving up that ass 
City folk's cars swerving when them hoes walk past 
Because them cornbread booties got em hypnotized 
Spending college tuitions just to grip them thighs 
My neighborhood to some might seem worlds away 
But this is where I stay, Red clay, G-A [Chorus x4] [Female] 
My neighborhood 
[ABK] 
Is on lock cause we like it that way 
[Female] 
My neighborhood 
[ABK] 
Is a place where the gangsta's play 
[Female] 
My neighborhood 
[ABK] 
Can see right through you if you don't belong 
[Female] 
My neighborhood 
[ABK] 
Can defeat all the weak and build up the strong 
[Female] 
My neighborhood 
[Boondox] 
Is on some shit like you ain't never seen 
[Female] 
My neighborhood 
[Boondox] 
Red dirt roads full of thugs and fiends 
[Female] 
My neighborhood 
[Boondox] 
Country fucking mouths ain't never heard of no blocks 
[Female] 
My neighborhood 
[Boondox] 
Is so far out, don't bother calling no cop [Chorus x4]
