I've got a cold, cold feeling 
It just like ice around my heart 
I've got a cold, cold feeling, yeah, yeah 
It just like ice around my heart 
I know I'm gonna quit somebody 
Every time that feeling starts You treat my like a prisoner 
Because my hands are tied 
Everything you do to me 
Is stackin' up inside It's a cold, cold feeling, yeah 
You're just like ice around my heart 
I know I'm gonna quit somebody 
Every time that feeling starts There's a change in me, baby 
Once I was blind but now I can see 
There's a change in me, baby, yeah, yeah 
Once I was blind but now I can see 
I'm gonna put everybody down, baby 
That ever made a fool of me
