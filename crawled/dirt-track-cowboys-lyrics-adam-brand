Strap yourself in 
Hang on for the ride 
Dirts gonna fly 
Grounds gonna shake tonight 
You don't have to look far 
"Cause it's right here in your back yard 
There's a hundred tracks across our land 
They call home this fearless band of dirt track 
Dirt Track cowboys Dirt tracking Cowboys 
Mudslinging Outlaws 
This ain't no Hollywood star wars 
It's the real deal open wheel 
Dirt Track cowboys There ain't nothing like 
A big angry field 
Tearing down the back straight 
Wheel to wheel 
He's got a big V8 underneath that hood 
When the lights go green 
Rushy's gonna scream 
The wildest boys you ever have seen 
They're dirt track, dirt track cowboys Dirt tracking Cowboys 
Mudslinging Outlaws 
This ain't no Hollywood star wars 
It's the real deal open wheel

Mudslinging Outlaws 
This ain't no Hollywood star wars 
It's the real deal open wheel 
Dirt Track cowboys Dirt tracking Cowboys 
Mudslinging Outlaws

It's the real deal open wheel 
Dirt Track cowboys Dirt track Cowboys
