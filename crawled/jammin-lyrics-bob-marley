[Bob Marley (MC Lyte)] 
We jammin' (Bob Marley, Bob Marley) 
I wanna jam it with you 
We jammin' (Bob Marley, Bob Marley) 
I hope you like jammin' too [Bob Marley] 
In rows or around, we can jam it anyhow 
I'n'I, I will see you through 
Everyday we pay the price, with a livin' sacrafice 
Jammin' 'til the jam is through [Bob Marley] 
We jammin', to think that jammin' was a thing of the past 
We jammin and I hope the jam is gonna last [MC Lyte] 
We jammin' on the for the daughters and sons 
The struggle is not over until the battle is won 
Hip-Hop is life but it ain't all to me 
Now where would we be if they take our mics from we. 
Or better yet strip on might itself 
We done it before so I sit by the door 
Those that claim but don't really know the game 
Bob Marley, learn the man behind the name [Bob Marley] 
Oh Holy Mount Zion 
Oh Holy Mount Zion 
Oh Holy Mount Zion 
Oh Holy Mount Zion 
We see it in Mount Zion 
And Rules all creation [Bob Marley] 
Were jammin' [Repeats] 
Hope you like jammin' to [Repeats] [MC Lyte] 
J-A-Double M-I-N 
We be jammin' from Brooklyn down to Kingston 
We be jammin' in the name of the Lord sweet Allah 
We no the blessings from above I and are be no rap star 
Exodus when i bust, 
See the struggle i must, 
Realizing the just but whats next on the cusp 
All soldiers of war steadily ignore 
Still we ain't sure what the battle is for 
Years ago when we toured 
Ready to explore 
Entered through back doors 
Treated like stank manure 
Spoke up for rights, we were cracked in the jaw 
Elvis made a bundle while we remained poor 
We remained poor 
but we be jammin' I'n'I will see you through [Repeat: x2] MC Lyte] 
Come along way but we're still not there yet [Bob Marley] 
I'n'I will see you through 
Jah knows the mighty cry, the truth it cannot hide 
To keep you satisfied 
Love that does exist, is the love i cant resist 
So jam by my side We jammin' 
and we're jammin' in the name of the lord 
we're jammin' [Repeats] 
we're jammin right straight from york 
holy mount zion I'n'I will see you through [Repeats]
