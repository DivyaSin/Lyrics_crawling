And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world 
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl 
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything 
No, no, no not anything 
And you Yeah, I got a brand new benz 
Crazy right, brand new benz 
Got less miles on it than I do friends 
Remember when we laid at you at pay's crib 
Was there so long I coulda paid rent 
Remember when we couldn't get shit? 
Best thing bout being broke is you don't spend shit 
Remember that Christmas, we had a wish list 
We couldn't afford nothin' but we still get shit ironically 
Those were the times I felt the richest 
All those times that we spent by the pool girl 
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl 
Maybe its because I had you girl 
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris 
And gave each other times that we cherished 
Remember when you saw the Eiffel tower 
And you got so drunk threw up, yup you were so embarrassed 
See those are times I can't let go, I can't let go 
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs 
So you sipping on XO 'til I snatch you up like "let's go" And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world 
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl 
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything 
No, no, no not anything 
And you, can't nobody do it like My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets 
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep 
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep 
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful distasteful yeah I know You're not supposed to have cake and eat too 
Crazy how these hos always kept my plate full 
What about the emails you hacked in? 
I know we hate to live in the past-tense 
It's been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D. 
And ain't came back since 
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city 
That's about the time that you left for the city 
You and all your girls moved to NY, 
I shoulda' known now how you watch sex and the city 
I know we ain't close but, I gotta focus on blowing up 
I know I promised that I'd be there, and really did I ever show up? 
I know I wasn't honest to you girl 
Almost broke every promise to you girl 
Brought problems to your world 
And you said "how could you just lie to me? I thought you'd die for me?" 
I was scared you'd find somebody you was supposed to 
You the type niggas get close to, and then propose to 
And when thanksgivings come around 
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma 
So it's back to the drama 
"No I don't know that number" 
"Why the hell you text it?" 
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in 
Young and living reckless And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world 
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl 
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything 
No, no, no not anything 
And you, can't nobody do it like I can't imagine myself without you 
I need a whole lot of help without you 
Me and my granny both a pretty 
Damn you're such a G I'll hold you down forever And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world 
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl 
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything 
No, no, no not anything 
And you, can't nobody do it like My bad for those long long nights, long nights
