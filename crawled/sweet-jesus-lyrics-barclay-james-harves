Where's the lady and the time I used to know 
I think that I've been on the road too long 
Scenes of better days are pictured in my head 
And haunting me those old familiar songs 
Oh sweet Jesus hear me cry 
Let me see a clearing sky 
For tomorrow I may be back home again 
So take the shadow from my eyes Sunday morning comes I'm feeling kind of down 
I can't see back to where it all began 
And I know you'd help me if you only could 
I don't know why or where or who I am Oh sweet Jesus hear me cry 
Let me see a clearing sky 
For tomorrow I may be back home again 
So take the shadow from my eyes 
Take the shadow from my eyes
