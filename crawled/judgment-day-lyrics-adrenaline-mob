Give to me 
What I want 
I want to hear you say 
What I need 
This is a last chance circumstance 
Time to pay the big advance 
So while you're down on your knees Now you better listen up 
What I say you better give it up 
Time to pay 
You're gonna bite the bullet feel the bat 
Be begging for a heart attack

It's time to say goodbye "Forgive you not... Yea you've sinned.

And I'm taking you to your grave." No one can save you
