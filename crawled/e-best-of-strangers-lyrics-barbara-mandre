The best of friends, the best of lovers 
That's what we used to be 
I just wish we'd ended up the way we started out From one little room where we loved each other 
To this big two story house 
We wanted the best I'm afraid that's what we've got now We're the best of strangers 
(The best of strangers) 
No one could do it any better 
We live here separately together We're the best of strangers 
(The best of strangers) 
We share a ceiling and a floor 
But there's no feeling anymore 
We're the best of strangers We go to bed, we turn out the light 
We stare at different walls 
And most of the time we don't even say goodnight I don't touch you, you don't touch me 
Except passing in the hall 
And then when we do we both apologize We're the best of strangers 
(The best of strangers) 
No one could do it any better 
We live here separately together We're the best of strangers 
(The best of strangers) 
We share a ceiling and a floor 
But there's no feeling anymore 
We're the best of strangers We're the best of strangers 
We're the best of strangers
