We never saw them holding hands 
Or kissing all that much 
They must have loved each other 
Huh, there were 6 of us 
Mama held the fort down 
Dad he went to work 
We never thought about what she meant to him 
Or what he meant to her 
Sometimes on a Saturday 
They'd crank up that stereo 
Grab a stack of old 45 records 
We'd watch 'em put on a show When the needle, hit the vinyl 
Mama's hair came down 
Dad he came unwound 
In their own world 
Just a boy and girl 
We couldn't believe our eyes 
How they came alive 
When the needle hit the vinyl Six kids on a worn out couch 
We didn't say a word 
Dad would put on "My Girl" 
And sing it right to her 
Mama she was glowing 
Dad he made the perfect moves 
Neither one of them seemed like 
The mum and dad we knew 
They both looked younger 
As they went round and around 
Under the spell of that popping cracking sound 
Then something happened 
When they danced to the slow ones 
They got this funny look then said 
"Okay kids it's time for bed"
