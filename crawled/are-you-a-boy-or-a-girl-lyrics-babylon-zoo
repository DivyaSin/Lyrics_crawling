*Never sell your soul (ah ah) 
Never sell your soul (ah ah) 
Never sell your soul Life is a nipple for millions of people 
Hangin' around on the town, are you a boy or girl 
Mirrors an' poses, we powder our noses 
Struttin' around in a gown, are you a boy or girl Anybody, does anybody care 
Walkin' around, you're the talk of the town 
We're no more then trash 
But after today (the whole world knows my answer) 
After today (the poison tastes much better) 
And when you're a boy (the whole world knows my answer) 
And when you're a girl (the poison tastes much, poison tastes much better) Bigger then Jesus, a pleasure to meet us 
What's going out on the town, are you a boy or girl? 
Make up and poses, glam lookin' closer 
Color the town with the sound, are you a boy or girl? We got dinosaur's feet, diggin' holes in the street 
Jackin' up on the beat 
The young dudes you're in with me oh yeah, oh yeah 
But after today (the whole world knows my answer) 
After today (the poison tastes much better) 
And when you're a boy (the whole world knows my answer) 
And when you're a girl (the poison tastes much, poison tastes much better) But after today (the whole world knows my, the whole world knows my answer) 
After today (the poison tastes much better) And when you're a boy (the whole world knows my answer) 
And when you're a girl (the poison tastes much, poison tastes much better) *Repeat
