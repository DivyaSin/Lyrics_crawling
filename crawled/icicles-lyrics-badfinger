Isn't it nice when the rain comes falling 
Turns into icicles, melting, mourning 
Isn't it good when a friend comes calling 'round? Isn't it good when you need somebody 
People will help you not be lonely 
Then you find someone who loves ya, only you [Chorus] 
But never take a love for granted 
Give a little in return 
Try to be understanding, live and learn Isn't it good when the sun comes shining 
Giving us warmth, see the children smiling 
Just the reflections of love around their heart
