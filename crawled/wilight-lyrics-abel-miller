When twilight slowly lets her curtain down 
And pins it with a single star 
The sleeping memory awakes inside of me 
And takes my heart to where you are In meditation you are mine again 
I kiss your lips and softly pray 
This magic moonlit mood, 
This twilight interlude 
Will bring you back to me to stay!
