I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen 
You wore it to the disco, where everyone was in jeans 
But you were just a rich girl, and only having fun 
Your worn out dresses, got stares from everyone 
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? You left for London, when you were nineteen 
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams 
A man in the bright lights took all that you own 
Now he's taken your freedom for a date unknown But you were just a rich girl, hardly having fun 
Your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone 
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long 
And now little rich girl, I wrote this song 
Hey, little rich girl my love for you is gone 
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong At your dad's office party all the movies were blue 
You caused him so much heartache, because the screen star was you 
You left for London, when you were nineteen 
Had to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams You were a rich girl, and only having fun 
But your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone 
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? 
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
