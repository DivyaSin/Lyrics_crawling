Wish I would have noticed sooner 
All that crazy in your eyes 
Do you practice in the mirror 
On that tempt and crooked smile Like the serpent in the garden 
You came crawling back to me 
Twice I ate that poisoned apple 
Made me sick of being Eve I'll admit that I was wrong 
You said I miss you 
Oh yes I do 
Honey I miss you being gone I saw that floozy you've been wooing 
On your ex-best buddies arm 
And I knew you'd soon be slinkin' back 
Turning on the charm Yea well, cupid ain't a bruiser 
And I'm tampered throwing darts 
Do you think I walk around 
With a bulls-eye on my heart Well, I'll admit that I was wrong 
You said I miss you 
Oh yes I do 
Sugar I miss you being gone I miss you like 
Drama queens and cat fights and braces on prom night 
I miss you like 
Boy bands and cheap cologne our song as chaperons and probably other things that I've outgrown Well you know you've got the mojo 
But it ain't working me no more 
And I swear I won't be checking you out 
When you walk out my door I'll admit that I was wrong 
You said I miss you 
And boy you got issues 
Honey I miss you being gone Being gone 
Being gone, being gone 
Thank God you're gone
