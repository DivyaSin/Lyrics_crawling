I turned my head up and the sky was empty 
I wasnt looking for paradise 
And when I asked for comfort from the land of plenty 
I came to realize. . . 
You have taken this for granted 
Please dont take it all away 
Feel the light of day. Feel it fade away 
Walk the line between the righteous and the wicked 
And tomorrow Ill be gone. . . 
I thrust my hands in til the nerves all went cold 
I tasted silver and I tasted gold 
And when the bandage lifted, our scars were newborn 
We still felt everything. . . 
I have taken this for granted 
Please dont take it all away 
Feel the light of day. Feel it fade away 
Walk the line between the righteous and the wicked 
And tomorrow Ill be gone. . . 
Feel the light of day. Feel it fade away 
Walk the line between the righteous and the wicked 
And tomorrow Ill be gone. . . 
And tomorrow Ill be gone. . .
