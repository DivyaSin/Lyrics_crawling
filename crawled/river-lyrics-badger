Well I never had much money 
I am not a rich man's son 
I came up the hard way 
Looking out for number one You know I've been a lot of places 
Travelled hard and long 
I've seen different faces of places 
Trying to find where I belong There is a river between us 
You know I gotta get across 
I gotta make it to you 
Or all is lost I gotta get across 
Get across 
You know i got to get across Full of doubt and suspicion 
I had to fight to keep my spirit alive 
I was lost a-ramblin' without love 
Learning only how to survive But I was so full of hatred 
Bitterness and greed 
But love gave my life a purpose 
Showed me what I really need There is a river between us 
If I could only get across 
I gotta make it to you 
Or all is lost I gotta get across 
Get across 
You know, I got to get across You know I've been a loner for so long 
It's so difficult for me 
To open my heart to anyone 
And it's the only way that I can be free I can see you in your garden 
I can't make it past your gate 
Oh, Lord, I want only to love you 
I only hope that I'm not too late There is a river between us 
If I could only get across 
I gotta make it to you 
Or all is lost Oh, yeah 
I gotta get across 
Get across 
Get across 
I gotta get across I wanta get across 
I wanta get across 
I wanta get across...
