I got your letter, read that mom was gone 
(Mom was gone) 
I never thought that dad would ever lose his mind 
(Lose his mind) 
I haven't slept it seems like all week long 
(all week long) 
And I've prayed a thousand times To a god who doesn't take request 
And all I hear is kid become the dream 
Become the dream 
You said it once I've heard it twice 
You'll always make mistakes in life 
Become the dream I held this letter in my hand 
And start to shake 
Then wonder is the end 
Is this the end? 
I took for granted 
All the things you've given me 
I say this is the end I'll raise my fist 
Shout and scream 
I won't resist this life 
Become the dream 
Become the dream
