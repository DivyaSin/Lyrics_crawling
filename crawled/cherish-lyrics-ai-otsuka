Since when have we lost 
The wonderful things that we need somewhere? 
I fear the connection to [your] heart 
And I burned myself with my body 
Even in those routine days 
when I hesitated 
You were already in my heart If we both have deep feelings 
even if time ends here someday 
I will go on loving you 
Feeling as though we're holding hands Love is such a scary thing 
That's why we run away as we search for it 
It no longer has anything to do with being an adult or a child This feels just like it's my first love 
So much so that I feel like it must be fate 
Not even in my dreams do I feel 
The way I do when we hold each other 
If we hadn't met we wouldn't have laughed this much 
The happiest thing I've had this year 
was being by your side
