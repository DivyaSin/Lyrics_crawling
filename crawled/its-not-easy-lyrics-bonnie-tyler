I don't question the light that shines from your window 
And i don't want to hear what the people might say 
The think it's only lust, that's hidden in your shadow 
But i know different, and that's okay 
They've been abused and they're so confused 
It's no wonder, they'll take what the can and run 
They spend their life in the doorway 
The doorway of a lifetime 
And their aching arms give no reprise 'Cause they don't understand 
It's not easy 
Never has, or ever will be 
Take this loving from me, and you will break my heart 
It's not easy 
Never has, or ever will be 
Take this loving from me, and you will break my heart Maybe the day will come 
When the streets ain't full of everyone 
Just trying to hang on to what the can 
And you might find when you wake up 
The break of dawn has come 
And all the sisters of sin are awaiting you 
They're waiting to wrap their empty shells 
Around your warm, warm and loving heart 
And to clutch at your breast with a hand of ice 
So pray the winds of change 
And don't let them bring you down 
To that no good, no good, cheap-talking crowd 'Cause they don't understand 
It's not easy 
Never has, or ever will be 
Take this loving from me, and you will break my heart 
It's not easy 
Never has, or ever will be 
Take this loving from me, and you will break my heart 
It's not easy 
Never has, or ever will be 
Take this loving from me, and you will break my heart 
It's not easy 
Never has, or ever will be 
Take this loving from me, and you will break my heart... [Repeat until fade]
