How do you sleep at night!? 'cause I lie awake 
and burn inside when I think of all the shit 
you've done when I think of all the times I've 
tried to understand your motives but they 
are not justified because you're only thinking 
of yourself but your choices affect all our lives 
Justify your actions How does it fell to always 
think you're right? you're never wrong it's 
not your fault well... who's gonna take the blame 
tonight? I'm lost again on I-10 but it feels like 
home to me I don't know where I'm going but 
I know where I want to be
