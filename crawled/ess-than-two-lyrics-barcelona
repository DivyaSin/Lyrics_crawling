Today I realized as I went walking 
Hurried past the dark, far away from where I live 
You are all I know and understand now. 
I'm fearful of the night and the things I cannot see 
I can't lose tonight, just watch me fall in line, for you What are we going to do? 
When all we said was true? 
But if feels like fading love 
is nothing new 
A choice is all we have 
Will we hold it back 
When it feels like something less than two Falling through the air, I was smiling 
Not because of love, but the loss it made me blush 
Safe and sound with you, it felt like weakness 
Strength is found in nights, all alone with no caress 
But I won't lose tonight, don't touch please, not for me, for you What are we going to do? 
When all we said was true? 
But if feels like fading love 
is nothing new 
A choice is all we have 
Will we hold it back? 
When it feels like something less than two
