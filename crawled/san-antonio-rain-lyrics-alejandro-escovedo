Seems like everybody's trying to sell me something I don't need, 
Might be a half-pound of cocaine, quarter pound of Mexican weed. 
But the last thing I need is something that'll dull my pain, 
I've walked from here to San Antonio just to taste the cool tongue of the rain. The rain ain't gonna come (ooh the rain ain't gonna come) 
The rain the don't wanna come (oooh-ooh). Gimme something strong I think I've felt enough of this 
I ask the bartender for doubles, the bartender his eyes shouldn't wait. 
Once I could find a friendly face on every corner of this town, 
when you don't recognize a single soul what's the use in hanging around? The rain ain't gonna come (ooh the rain ain't gonna come) 
No, the rain the don't wanna come (oooh-ooh). 
The rain ain't gonna come (ooh the rain ain't gonna come) 
No, the rain the don't wanna come (oooh-ooh). 
No I put my fingertip pulls you whispered something pretty in my ear, 
I just laid down to rest my eyes when I woke up there was nobody there. 
I hear ocean calling, calling like a long lost friend. 
Think I'll go back to California but I don't think they'd let me in. The rain ain't gonna come (ooh the rain ain't gonna come) 
No, the rain the don't wanna come (oooh-ooh). 
The rain ain't gonna come (ooh the rain ain't gonna come) 
No, the rain the don't wanna come (oooh-ooh). 
No, no, no, no. Think I'll go back to California but I'm not sure they'd let me in.
