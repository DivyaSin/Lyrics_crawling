Abraham took Isaac's hand 
And led him to the lonesome hill 
While his daughter hid and watched 
She dare not breathe, she was so still 
Just as an angel cried for the slaughter 
Abraham's daughter raised her voice Then the angel asked her what her name was 
She said, I have none 
Then he asked, how can this be 
My father never gave me one And when he saw her, raised for the slaughter 
Abraham's daughter raised her bow 
How dearest you, child, defy your father 
You'd better let young Isaac go
