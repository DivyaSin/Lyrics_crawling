The writing on the walls says this town ain't ours no more. So, we'll paint the streets with fire. The writing on the walls... those city signs, headlines like deadlines, so come on... This town is ours tonight... So light it up like a midnight sunrise. You know we own this town... Just in time to burn it down. Let's go, we'll paint the streets with fire. We roam these streets of a hollow shell like ghost town rebels, so come on. This town is ours tonight... So light it up like a midnight sunrise. You know we own this town... Just in time to burn it down.
