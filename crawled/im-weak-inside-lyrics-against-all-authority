"I'm Weak Inside" Another day in this broke down place 
The towers grow and the skies are slowly replaced 
With the cold gray structures that lay to waste 
Everything that stands in the way 
Stare at the ground as I walk on by 
You make me sick and I hate what I feel inside 
As I lobby for acceptance, you know I've tried 
Another life for you to nullify 
I'm weak inside because I see the shape of things to come 
I'm weak inside because I don't change what's begun 
I'm weak inside because I hate what I've become 
I'm feeling empty as I struggle with my thoughts each day 
Just a drone who contributes to his own decay 
An apathist who's sweat and blood grease the wheels for pay 
Just a whore for the puppeteer to whom I obey 
And nothing changes...No nothing changed today 
I close my eyes and keep my mouth shut 
Why am I afraid to stand up and knock them down 
When I've been betrayed 
You've been conditioned to accept everything they say 
So I walk on but I start to stumble 
Through the ruins of a life that's troubled 
By the expectations I'm conditioned to struggle for 
My possessions leave me self-absorbed 
So many bombs I've left unblown 
The streets are crowded and I feel so all alone 
Stacking bricks that to this day remain unthrown 
Yet I'm the one to cast the first stone
