It was a long hard road 
It was all uphill 
We nearly lost our way 
We nearly lost our will So we clung to the rocks 
Oh where the cold winds blow 
'Till love gives us strengh to finally let go 
We climbed that mountain And we got so high 
Then on the wings of an angel 
We took to the sky 
Out here on the edge Love dared us to try 
Baby,some people fall,some people fly 
Many they fall 
For passions kiss And many they say 
Is this all there is? 
Well it never was easy 
To rise above To look into the eyes of love 
We climbed that mountain 
And we got so high 
Then on the wings of an angel We took to the sky 
Out here on the edge 
Love dared us to try 
Baby,some people fall,some people fly And baby love has no fear 
Leap and a net will appear 
We climbed that mountain 
And we got so high Then on the wings of an angel 
We took to the sky 
Out here on the edge 
Love dared us to try Baby,some people fall,some people fly 
Some people fly 
Some people fly
