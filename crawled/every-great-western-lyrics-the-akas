They say every great western has it's cowboy. The say every cowboy has his gun. Wouldn't you know, another showdown going down at sunrise. There go those boys with their toys of mass-destruction. Hey! Won't you say... lay down your guns? Hey! Can you see... peace signs with crosshairs in our eyes? I hear good guys always dress in white. I hear might makes right so who wants to fight? White doves love the smell of smoking guns. Peace signs with crosshairs in our eyes. White doves love the smell of smoking guns. Peace signs in our eyes. White doves love the smell of smoking guns.
