I've never been scared of love before now 
But I've never been this much in love 
With you it happened so fast that I'm afraid it won't last 
And I don't wanna lose what my dreams are made of I don't think I'm ready for you 
There are too many heartaches I've already been through 
But this feeling inside is getting harder to hide 
Until I know that you feel it too 
I don't think I'm ready for you Right on the edge of out of control 
Trying hard not to let what's in my heart show 
One of your kisses, my will to resist is all gone 
Cos I love you, but baby I know I don't think I'm ready for you 
One heart on the line's not enough, it takes two 
And it wouldn't take much 
Just three words with that touch of yours 
To tell me, but until you do 
I don't think I'm ready for you
