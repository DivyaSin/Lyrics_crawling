Your face has taken over all my 
thoughts again. 
It's been a year of silence 
you've be distant. 
And mentally far from me. Oh, blue Christmas, oh. I hope you remember that 
I won't wish you one merry December. 
For I have lost it all, all of the spirit that Christmas. 
That damn Christmas used to bring. I won't disguise the bitter with ribbon 
red bow ties. 
The memory of our happiness in those 
twinkling lights. 
Decieving me, glistening. Oh, blue Christmas, oh. I hope you remember that 
I won't wish you one merry December. 
For I have lost it all, all of the spirit that Christmas. 
That damn Christmas used to bring. I won't recall us happily when we'd kiss 
by that plastic tree coz that's over, that's over now. Oh, blue Christmas, oh. I hope you remember that 
I won't wish you one merry December. 
For I have lost it all, all of the spirit that Christmas. 
That damn Christmas used to bring. oo-oo. do do
