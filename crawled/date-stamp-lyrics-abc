This heart`s up for sale 
Yeah, this heart`s on the stand 
Mix and match and melt in my mouth 
Nothing ever goes quite as planned 
You fly north and I`ll sail south So redevelop product 
Redesign this package 
Still refuse to reach in your pocket 
Everything is temporary written on that sand 
Looking for the girl that meets supply with demand Love has no guarantee 
(Yes I`m date stamped) 
Promise me eternity 
(Guess I`ll fade away) 
Even with a pedigree 
(Yes I`m date stamped) 
Love has no guarantee That heart`s on display, yes, that heart`s off the rails 
A ship in the harbour with wind in its sails 
Chain up love inside the chain-store girl 
Chain up love and exchange it Is Monsieur a connoisseur or just short-changed? 
Off the rack or custom-fit it all seems the same 
Look but don`t touch in paradise 
Don`t let them catch you damaging the merchandise Love has no guarantee 
(Yes I`m date stamped) 
Promise me eternity 
(Guess I`ll fade away) 
Even with a pedigree 
(Yes I`m date stamped) 
Love has no guarantee I get sales talk from sales assistants 
When all I want to do girl, is lower your resistance 
Everything is temporary, written in the sand 
Looking for the girl that meets supply with demand Love has no guarantee 
Brings out the woman in me 
Even with a pedigree 
Love has no guarantee No chance of subtlety 
No promise of eternity 
Even with a pedigree 
Love has no guarantee
