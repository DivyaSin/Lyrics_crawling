I was throttled to the ground 
I was locked inside a basement 
the guards went on vacation while I plotted my revolt 
I was tired and confused 
doesn't look like that is changing 
I'm a hallucination of myself at 3 years old 
goodbye, oh goodbye you were perched atop my shoulder 
you were pecking at my head, 
and if I had a hole to crawl in I would be there and be dead 
you were spilling all my will out 
I was bleeding my last brains 
it's nothing like the nothingness that normally numbs ones pain 
goodbye, oh goodbye 7th grade was hard enough 
if someone thought that they knew me 
if I stay in bed long enough 
they'll go to church without me 
if I move away enough 
they won't outrun me 
goodbye, 
oh goodbye (x9)
