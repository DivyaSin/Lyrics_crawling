In a time, where magic spells and Gods ruled 
In a time, where Wotan held his hand above us 
Welcome in a time, in which we can live as once 
Spread your wings, spread your wings and fly Life in the dark you open the wrong door 
Life in our Asgard we know it's our endevour I, I don't tell you lies 
Close, close your eyes and hear 
Follow me into a time where father and son go on journey 
To teach to fight, to learn to kill Life in the dark you open the wrong door 
Life in our Asgard we know it's our endevour Three trials must be passed 
Fight, kill without fear 
When the son would be pass 
(As a warrior) 
Fight, kill without fear In a time, where magic spells and Gods ruled 
In a time where Wotan held his hand above us 
Welcome into a time, ruled by Wotan 
Sooner or later you must understand
