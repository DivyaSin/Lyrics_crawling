Waiting here alone in loneliness 
Feels like I'm in outta space 
Now I'm drowning without your love 
Fading I'm in the dark Waiting here looking through the window 
Ticking clock is all I hear 
I lie awake my eyes are open 
But I can't see you anymore Reff 
For those years I'm waiting for nothing 
'till my brain's aching and my heart's closing 
Why it takes so much time for me to realize that 
You'll never back to me 
You'll never back to me I just wanna stop loving you 
But I don't know what to do 
I know our love is tragedy 
That's why I should let go
