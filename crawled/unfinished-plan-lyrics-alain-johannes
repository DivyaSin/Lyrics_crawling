Out of nothing and back 
In just one day 
Stars suns and moons 
Paint the sky 
And give it away, give it away 
Tried to quench the thirst 
Of deserts damned 
Held your shape against the kiss 
Of impossible aches, impossible aches 
Oh you were not afraid of letting go 
So I am not afraid of letting go 
Laughing with God at this unfinished plan 
Watch it all go in flames and waves 
Erasing the sand, erasing the sand 
You almost got the truth out of the lie 
Then folded into the weave 
To never say bye 
No, never goodbye 
Oh you were not afraid of letting go 
So I am not afraid of letting go
