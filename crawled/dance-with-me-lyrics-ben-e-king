Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me, dance with me Dance with me, oh-oh hold me closer, closer and closer 
Much closer while the music plays, oh my little darlin', won't ya? 
Dance with me, oh-oh hold me tighter, tighter and tighter 
Much tighter while the rhythm sways Put your lips to mine while the music plays 
We're no longer strangers 
Now we're more than friends so Dance with me, dance with me closer, closer and closer 
And maybe we'll be lovers when the music ends Doot-doot, dance with me

Doot-doot, dance with me Dance with me, dance with me closer, closer and closer 
And maybe we'll be lovers when the music ends Doot-doot, dance with me
