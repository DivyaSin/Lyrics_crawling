[Kanye West (Ace Hood)] 
In the night I hear him talk 
The coldest story ever told 
(I'm going all the way in on this one right here boy) 
Somewhere far along this road 
(Yeah, Gutta) 
He lost his soul [Ace Hood] 
To a nigga so ruthless 
How could you be so ruthless? 
(What up Kanye?) 
How could you be so ruthless? Well in the mind of a gangster 
Bitch nigga man up 
You can play the pussy and get fucked up with this handgun 
Laugh at a nigga ass, blast at his loved ones 
Sister, brother, motherfuck them, even get his grandson 
Bad talking real niggas, this is what can happen 
B-b-blast at his ass, plexiglass smashing 
Skully mags, body bag, after that trash them 
Donald Duck sucker, Taz dragon a Magnum Swag with a stallion 
Puerto Rican, Italian 
Love fly niggas so come kick it with the Jet Blue 
First class ass beat it like an 808 do 
Pussy whack in the trash like some paper plate food 
Strictly on that Rosay, you can keep the Grey Goose 
Steal it from me bitch, get cut hoe take two 
Ha, and I'll be back with some great news 
I'll send a jet to pick the best in a swim suit And I'm the best but you never seen it in clear view 
These hoes pay me they late when the rent due 
I split them open like the cocktail shrimp food 
Ace Hood, Mister-Buy-Never-Rental 
I am the future so pussy nigga who you? 
Sweetened ass niggas turn you into Froot Loops 
Bleed motherfucker blood like suuwoo 
Red pill or the blue nigga you choose 
I'm the game eat you rappers like Seoul food 
Making bad moves send your momma bad news 
Grind hard everyday what a thug do 
And I'm heartless, nigga, you knew [Kanye West] 
In the night I hear him talk 
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road 
He lost his soul [Ace Hood] 
To a nigga so ruthless 
How could yoi be so ruthless? 
How could you be so ruthless?
