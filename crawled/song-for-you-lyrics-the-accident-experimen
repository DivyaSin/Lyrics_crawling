i don't know where i should go since you've been gone 
i search planets just to find where i belong 
i'm unmending, pretending you can hear me screaming out my song 
I STILL HANG ON TO YOU. 
I SING THIS SONG FOR YOU. i felt whispered rain fall on my face today 
i felt everything begin to slip away 
my sunrise keep falling 
rhythms of your voice keep calling 
inside arenas in my mind i sing for you to hear me say...
