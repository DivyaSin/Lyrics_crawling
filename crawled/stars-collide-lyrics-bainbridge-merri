We can now make the stars collide 
If we really want to 
And turn the whole thing upside down 
Through endless days eternal night 
We could last forever 
Or just until we hit the ground 
Time goes by 
But together you and I 
We could see the end of a century 
Walking by the light 
Of the milky way tonight 
By the light 
Of the milky way tonight 
So many people left behind 
Still we seem to be here 
It's just a wave we have to ride 
And all the pieces in your mind 
Just like stars colliding 
So bright they almost burn my eyes 
Time goes by 
But together you and I 
We could see the end of a century 
Walking by the light 
Of the milky way tonight 
By the light 
Of the milky way tonight 
If we fall too far 
We might never see the stars 
If we climb too high 
I won't see you by the light 
Of the milky way tonight 
By the light 
Of the milky way tonight
