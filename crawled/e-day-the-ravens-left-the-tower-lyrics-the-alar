I've swept the floors of all my kings 
I've opened doors and let the tourists in 
Days of wine and roses 
Prime ministers, red robes 
These days are gone I've stood on guard as my Queens were born I've cut the grass on many English lawns Of strawberries and ice cream 
Of cricket and cold beer These days 
London Tower's burning. Parliament's ablaze 
Buckingham Palace has gone 
Somewhere in the distance my darling she's a crying 
I should be by her side This is the day the ravens left the tower 
This is the day the ravens fly away Fly away, fly away. 
Fly away, fly away. 
Fly away I've stood on the Changing of the Guards 
To the Bloody Tower watching the Crown Jewels 
A penny for the guy sir? 
Will you vote left or right? 
These days London Bridge is falling. 
St. Pauls Cathedral bums 
The tower blocks are gone 
Somewhere in the distance my darlings she's a crying 
I should be by her side. This is the day the ravens left the tower This is the day the ravens fly away Fly away, fly away (fly away) 
Fly away, fly away (fly away) 
Fly away, fly away (fly away) 
Fly away, fly away And if I live to see the dawning of the day 
I hope I'm in your arms as we get swept away Oh darling I will be home soon 
Darling I will be home soon (Ring a ring a roses, a pocket full of posies 
Atishoo, Atishoo, we all fall down)
