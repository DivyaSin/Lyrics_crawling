When I'm called home 
I will bring a book 
That tells of strange and funny turns 
And of the heart it took 
To keep on living in a world 
That never was my own 
A world of haunted memories 
Of other worlds unknown. 
I'll tell them of the trouble here 
When they call me home. 
When I'm called home 
I will sing a song 
And tell them of a beggar's life 
Where everything goes wrong 
Where everybody's hopes and dreams 
Are shattering by the wind. I'll tell them of a ghostly world 
Of us and they and him. 
I'll tell them how the shadows fall 
When they call me home. 
When I'm called home 
I will tell the stars 
Of the battles that were lost 
In a world of wars. 
I will tell the rivers 
Of the children lost at sea 
Of a how a soul is bartered 
And what it costs a spirit free. 
Hallelujah tell a story, oh, 
When they call me home.
