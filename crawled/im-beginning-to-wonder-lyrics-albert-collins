I begin to wonder, baby 
What's goin' on when I'm not at home 
I begin to wonder, baby 
I know you ain't there all alone Every time I have to leave you, woman 
I wonder who's takin' my place and turnin' you on I begin to wonder, woman 
Why I worry everyday 
I said, I begin to wonder, woman 
Wonder why I feel this way I be home early Tuesday evenin' 
Better hide your part-time man away I begin to wonder, woman 
Why we wasted all this time 
I begin to wonder, baby 
Wonder why we didn't see the signs What we did, we've now forgotten 
What we had, we've left behind
