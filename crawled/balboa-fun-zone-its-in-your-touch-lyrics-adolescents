Something went on last night 
You were fine at the Fun*Zone, now something isn't right 
Something went on last night It's in your touch 
It's in your stare 
I'd hurt half as much 
If I thought you still cared 
Well I watch the ocean hit the sand 
With troubled heart and empty hands 
I feel the summer turn to fall 
And wonder why I cared at all 
You're feeling like the summer gone 
But our memories at the Fun*Zone linger on It's in your touch I'm at the Fun*Zone all alone 
All my friends have headed home 
Trying to forget the past 
But keep the feelings, and make 'em last
