Who am I, but just one man 
with a chain around his heart and cuffs on his hands 
who am I, but another one of you 
With a blind before my eyes and an appetite for two who am I (who am I, who am I), but a soul inside a skin 
on the verge of breaking out, but still locked deep within Who am I, but a thought behind a plan 
That even if I tried, I will never understand Ain't I just a man in this world, ain't I just a man 
What can I do to make it better, just with these two hands? 
I got two, two, hands 
What am I gonna do with two hands? 
I got two strong hands 
What am I gonna do with two hands? Who am I, but an anonymous face 
with a number and a mark to connect me to my place 
who am I (who am I, who am I) 
but a voice in the crowd, that whispers all the time 
'cause it's too afraid to shout Ain't I just a man in this world, ain't I just a man 
What can I do to make it better, just with these two hands? I got two, two, hands 
What am I gonna do with two hands? (tell 'em what am I gonna do) 
I got two strong hands 
What am I gonna do with these hands? That's how I see it (put 'em to work) (8x) 
Gotta get them out of my pocket (put 'em to work) 
Get your hands dirty (put 'em to work) 
take off the jewelry (put 'em to work) 
put on your gloves (put 'em to work) 
That's how I see it (put 'em to work) 
Gotta stretch a little better now (put 'em to work) 
Take off the jewelry (put 'em to work) 
Put 'em to work (put 'em to work) (6x) 
Take off the jewelry (put 'em to work) 
Put 'em to work (put 'em to work) 
get your hands dirty (put 'em to work) 
Put 'em to work (8x) I got two, two, hands 
What am I gonna do with two hands? 
Put 'em to work 
Put 'em to work 
I got two strong hands 
What am I gonna do with these hands? 
Put 'em to work 
I got two, two, hands 
What am I gonna do with these hands? 
Said I got two strong hands 
What am I gonna do with these hands? That's how I see it (put 'em to work) (8x)
