I want you for myself 
I don't want to have to share you with nobody else 
I want you, baby 
Come to me Let me give you all the lovin' that you need 
I want to touch your body 
Feel your arms around me 
I want to be your fantasy, your dream come true I want to need your loving' 
Make you my only woman 
I want to love you, love you, love you, baby 
I belong to you [Chorus] 
Until I feel your heartbeat pounding next to mine 
I've got work to do 
'Til every single star up in the sky 
Knows that I belong to you I want you satisfied 
Anything your heart desires 
Let my love provide 
I want you baby 
Only you and I swear 
I'm gonna make you want me too I'm gonna touch your body 
Wrap your arms around me 
I'm gonna be your fantasy 
Your dreams come true I'm gonna taste your lovin' 
Make you my only woman 
I'm gonna love you, love you, love you 
Baby, I belong to you [Chorus] I want you satisfied 
Anything your heart desires 
Let my love provide 
I want you baby 
Only you and I swear 
I'm gonna make you want me too [Chorus] One more time [Chorus]
