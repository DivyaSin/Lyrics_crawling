Nights so dark 
Nights so loud 
Nights so high 
Night forever 
Feel your love 
And baby, like a breeze You're in my mind 
You're in my heart 
You're here, you're with me 
You're here, you're with me now 
Feel your love 
Baby, like a breeze I hold it for a minute 
A minute lasts an hour 
I know that I can change it 
I know that I can still 
I kno-o-o-o-ow Feel for you 
I feel for you 
I feel for you 
I feel for you I hold it for a minute 
A minute lasts an hour 
I know that I can change it 
I know that I can still 
I kno-o-o-o-ow Feel for you 
I feel for you 
I feel for you 
I feel for you How... 
Why you got through 
How... 
Why you lay your bar so low Feel for you 
I feel for you 
I feel for you 
I feel for you
