Chorus - 
Dear babe I'll always love you and every night I think of you 
'cause baby our love is strong 
Dear babe you're constantly running through, through my mind 
I promise in my heart you'll find, baby Verse 1 - 
It doesn't seem a big surprise to me 
How I fell in love with such a queen 
I would give her everything she needs 
'cause deep inside my heart she is everything 
I try my best to keep the love alive 
And in the end she's turned away and cried 
Love is crying and my heart is true 
I have one thing to say and that is I love you baby Chorus Verse 2 - 
I'm thanking you for the times we shared 
For every moment that you said you cared 
I didn't tell you but it meant a lot 
To know that you loved me no matter what the cost 
I guess I'm tryna say that in the end 
All I really wanted was just a friend 
I'll always be calling you baby boo 
'cause in reality I'm still in love with you baby Chorus Bridge - 
When we fell in love my heart just fell apart 
'cause I knew I couldn't live without you next to me 
I need you right by my side so you can feel my honesty 
Dear babe I'll always love you down in my heart Chorus
