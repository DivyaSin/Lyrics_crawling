Spin, spin, spin, spin mi yeh eh ay VERSE I: 
I don't want no CD, no MP3 
Don't want no love to come download me 
So fed up with technology 
Computer lovin' is not for me 
Let's take it old school like '83 
Put mi pon ah tip like a record spin mi 
I wanna feel your needle baby 
Scratch it, scratch it, scratch it, scratch it, scratch it for me CHORUS:

(Repeat) VERSE II: 
Put me on wax oh yeh, I want that 
And then you press me and I'll press back 
Love when you set me all in your rack 
I know that I'm at the top of your stack 
And you can pitch it if you wanna go slower 
And you can mix cuz you've got the power 
Just when you thought it was gonna end 
You wheel me, wheel me, when I come again yeh CHORUS BRIDGE: 
Twist me, twist me, turn me like crazy 
Winin' on you can't stop this no way 
I'm the record, you are my DJ 
Play, play, play, {play}
