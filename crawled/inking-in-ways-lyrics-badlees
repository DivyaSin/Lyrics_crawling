When I die, call this number 
Unencumber yourself from the details 
The whole thing's bought and paid for 
The box, the viewing and one more ride Bought a plot by some azaleas 
They never fail to impress in the brochure 
See me off at sunset 
I hope it's glorious outside I am thinking in ways 
That I never have before 
I am counting the days 
That I never have before Of course the breakfast will be dinner 
Your choice of a couple of entrees 
You'll meet some real characters 
Some even I haven't seen in a while I am thinking in ways 
I never have before 
I am counting the days 
That I never have before I need you to distribute 
Everything that I have written down here 
They are bits and pieces 
Of all who made me what I am Drink a few, get to know them 
Don't forget to tip your waitress 
Through them you'll know me better 
And life is really worth a damn I am thinking in ways 
I never have before 
I am counting the days 
That I never have before
