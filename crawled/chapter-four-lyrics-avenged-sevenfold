(Give me your hand 
Blood is spilt and man will follow 
Infernal man, punishment too great to bear) 
Conceived and born was one of light 
Rain and dark, the other born black night Raise your head and taste the courage 
(The one of light) 
Fall from grace, unholy night 
I've come here to kill you 
Won't leave until you've died 
Murder born of vengeance 
I closed my brothers eyes tonight It's cold tonight as the clouds turn gray 
And from my hands to my brothers grave 
You took his side, you took his gift 
Feel the power of a fallen man, crestfallen man Far away in this land I must go 
Out of the site of the One 
A punishment sent from his hand 
A hardship no one should know 
Now go out of the site of the One 
Away in this land you must go
