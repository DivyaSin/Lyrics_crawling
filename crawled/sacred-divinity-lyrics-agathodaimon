In peaceful silence she lies there and sleeps 
Dreaming of secrets concealed in the deeps 
Ohh, of our long forgotten history 
Those who are devoted to her know that she keeps 
Ohh, in her pure soul the key, ohh, to our identity I will guard your ancient dreams 
Protect my lovely sleeping beauty 
I would give my life and love 
For my sacred divinity Now the winter sun paints her in shining gold 
Smiling she wakes up and asks me to hold 
Ohh, her gentle hand in mine 
Her graceful white body trembles in the cold Ohh, she knows today the forces will align 
Ohh, forces hating the divine I will save you from their blind 
And unreflecting treachery 
I will guard your soul and life 
My sacred divinity I will always stand by your side 
Save you from their tyranny 
Or I will die for my love 
My sacred divinity Hear the storm blowing, see the skies darkening 
On marketplaces and in churches crowds of them are gathering 
Here they come marching, betraying and lying 
To take our love and our souls, to destroy everything They do not care for your soul and your purity 
Nothing do they feel for you except of everlasting envy 
Neither do they know nor understand your biography 
They hate your beauty, hate all beauty and fear your ascendancy After this cold day of sadness and grief 
She is left without any hope or belief 
Ohh, in a day after this night 
Will she in death find at last a relief? Ohh, a place of silence and light 
Ohh, where everything is alright? I broke down and cried in sorrow 
In despair and misery 
I cried for my love and passion 
My sacred divinity All I tried to do was stand there 
Helplessly in agony 
I watched them dishonoring 
My sacred divinity
