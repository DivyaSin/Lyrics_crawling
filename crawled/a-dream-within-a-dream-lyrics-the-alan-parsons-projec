For my own part 
I have never had a thought 
Which I could not set down in words 
With even more distinctness 
Than that with which I conceived it There is however a class of fancies 
Of exquisite delicacy, which are not thoughts 
And to which as yet I have found it 
Absolutely impossible to adapt to language These fancies arise in the soul 
Alas how rarely, only at epochs 
Of most intense tranquility 
When the bodily and mental 
Health are in perfection And at those weird points of time 
Where the confines of the waking world 
Blend with the world of dreams 
And so I captured this fancy 
Where all that we see or seem 
Is but a dream within a dream
