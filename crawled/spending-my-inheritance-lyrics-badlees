I was just a young boy, barely 17 
A regular poster child for the American dream 
I spent some time in college, tried to learn that system well 
Left a problem drinker and cynical as hell CHORUS They say there's two kinds of people 
Those who have and those who don't 
Some of us will benefit 
And there's some of us that won't Some people spend a lifetime 
Trying to get over that fence 
But I'm just on the corner 
Spending my inheritance I guess Old Father Time's put on one hell of a show 
'Cause the older that I get it seems the less I know 
I found the road to riches was just a private drive 
Owned by politicians waving from inside CHORUS There's nothing wrong with me still I have to wonder why 
Another day, another family tree lifts it's branches to the sky Dined on good intentions, nearly starved to death 
I gave the world my last two cents and now I live on what is left 
There's never any medals, there isn't much reward 
You gotta find your peace of mind in what you can afford CHORUS Well I'm back where I started, spending my inheritance
