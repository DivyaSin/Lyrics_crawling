It's so nice to be rich, rich, rich, rich... 
You are viewing lyrics of It's So Nice To Be Rich by AGNETHA FALTSKOG from the album UNKNOWN at LyricsAndSongs.COM 
Young, smart, handsome, and rich, rich, rich, rich... 
To dress up in the mink again 
And swim in the pink champagne, 
Oh how I loathe old age, stupidity, and hunger, 
I prefer to be full, cleverer, and younger, 
Oh you old dumb bum in the ditch, snitch, snitch... 
And get rich, rich, rich, rich... 
Get rich, rich, rich, rich... (REPEAT)
