I'm standin' on the bridge 
I'm waitin' in the dark 
I thought that you'd be here, by now 
There's nothing but the rain 
No footsteps on the ground 
I'm listening, but there's no sound Isn't anyone tryin' to find me 
Won't somebody come take me home? It's a damn cold night 
Tryin' to figure out this life 
Won't you take me by the hand? 
Take me somewhere new 
I don't know who you are but I 
I'm with you, I'm with you I'm lookin' for a place 
I'm searchin' for a face 
Is anybody here I know 
'Cause nothin's goin' right 
And everything's a mess 
And no one likes to be alone Isn't anyone tryin' to find me? 
Won't somebody come take me home It's a damn cold night 
Tryin' to figure out this life 
Won't you take me by the hand? 
Take me somewhere new 
I don't know who you are but I 
I'm with you, I'm with you, yeah Oh, why is everything so confusing? 
Maybe I'm just out of my mind 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah It's a damn cold night 
Tryin' to figure out this life 
Won't you take me by the hand 
Take me somewhere new 
I don't know who you are but I 
I'm with you, I'm with you Take me by the hand 
Take me somewhere new 
I don't know who you are but 
I'm with you, I'm with you Take me by the hand 
Take me somewhere new 
Don't know who you are but I 
I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you
