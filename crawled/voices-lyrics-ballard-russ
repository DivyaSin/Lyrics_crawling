If you could see my mind, if you really look deep, then maybe you'll find 
That somewhere there will be a place, hidden behind my comedian face 
You will find somewhere there's a house, and inside that house there's a room 
Locked in the room in the corner you see A voice is waiting for me, to set it free, I got the key, I got the key 
Voices, I hear voices In my head the voice is waiting, waiting for me to set it free 
I locked it inside my imagination, but I'm the one who's got the combination 
Some people didn't like what the voice did say So I took the voice and I locked it away, I got the key, I got the key 
Voices, I hear voices, voices, I hear voices Chorus: 
Don't look back, look straight ahead, don't turn away, then the voice it said 
Don't look back, yesterday's gone, don't turn away, you can take it on (Solo) Voices, I hear voices, voices, I hear voices (chorus repeats 3x) Voices, voices, voices, voices - don't look back 
Voices, voices (chorus repeats 2x)...
