Well, I'm starin' at my Sony, a-drinkin' Kirun beer 
I had a nickel in my pocket when it all came clear 
I hopped into my Honda, it's a little bitty car 
And I'm drivin' down to meet you at the Sushi Bar 
But don't tell me I'm crazy until you hear my plan 
I'm gonna buy two tickets and move to Japan I'm gonna move to Japan 
I'm gonna move to Japan So if you've got no job and runnin' out of dough 
And they moved the factory down to Mexico 
Just pack your bags and don't forget your Kimona 
And you'll be followin' me, honey, all the way to Yokohama We're gonna move to Japan 
We're gonna move to Japan Tokyo's got the neon 
I put a pot of green tea on 
Akira Kurosawa 
Sapporo Okinawa 
Girls with almond eyes 
Eatin' seaweed and rice 
It's the land of tradition 
But I'm a man on a mission When we get to Japan we're gonna do our part 
We're gonna love Japan with all of our heart From the unemployment line I see lots to be done 
And they're taking all hands in the land of the risin' sun 
And I love my mom and my apple pie 
But sayonara Uncle Sam, hello Samurai We're gonna move to Japan 
We're gonna move to Japan 
We're gonna move to Japan 
Hey, we're gonna move to Japan 
The home of the working man It's rolling
