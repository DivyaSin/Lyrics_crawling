Walking south along my mouth 
Through the heart that's hard to start 
I know it's nothing the woman cried 
So you're leaving you did not lie 
The broken light bulb that's glowing still 
The morning after the sickness pill And i feel that it will change 
It will change 
I think it's going to rain today 
And i hope that it will change 
It will change 
Washing all of my blues away The old drunk man who once had plans 
No one left now to hold his hand 
Priests are calling no happy bells 
Can't make a difference from life to hell He was trapped in a desert 
Waiting for his friends 
He was trapped in a desert 
With no defence 
And when his will to live had all but gone 
He found some water to carry on
