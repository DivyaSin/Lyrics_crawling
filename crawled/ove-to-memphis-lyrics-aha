Walked around no one around 
You were the one who taught me better 
This old town brings me down 
You were the one who told me you've got to 
Move to Memphis 
That's what I'll do 
Move to Memphis and follow you 
Trace that highway down to your doorway 
Move tho Memphis and be with you On the day you walked away 
I was the one who said 
You'd better stick around stay in town 
You were the one who told me you've got to 
Move to Memphis 
That's what I'll do 
Chase the shadow that follows you 
Trace that highway down to your doorway 
Move to Memphis and be with you That's what I'll do 
Move to Memphis to be with you 
I'm gonna be with you
