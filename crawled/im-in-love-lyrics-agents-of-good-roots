(chorus): 
I'm in love with a girl and she's in love with me 
When i look to her mind i can only see tears 
If she'd blow me a kiss i would wait for years 
I'm in love with a girl she's in love, with... If we wait for church now 
Can we see diekirche? 
Broken china on the bull platter 
Time bomb tick-tickin' on 
She's a foxy little thing now 
I like the way she makes me swing 
Like the sound of the sunday prayer 
She got no time for the marble chatter I wait by you 
Feel the fire 
Searching for the 
Taste 
Touch 
Feel 
Bite 
Boom 
Time (chorus) 
Judas set me free 
This shit is killing me now 
We got a buzz from the white water 
Time bomb tick-tickin' on 
My heart is pumpin' like a sieve, girl 
Feel the bone chip from the strain 
I think we'll wait a little longer now 
Time ticks like a freight train I wait by you 
Feel the fire 
Searching for the 
Taste 
Touch 
Feel 
Bite 
Boom 
Time (chorus) 
Me... 
You... 
Me... 
You... 
Me... 
You... 
Me... 
You... 
(chorus)
