It's so hard to watch you struggle.. 
Even harder when I have to see you stumble. 
Short tempers, harsh words that humble.. 
Watching the world.. Watching the world around me crumble. I wont fight back.. 
Can't give in.. 
Wont stay here forever like this.. 
Overwhelming my senses.. 
..Again. Like a brother.. Like a sister. 
Something like a family.. 
I was so lonely but you saved me. 
Insecurities race through my heart.. 
New situation - Realizing my part.. 
The needles change like seasons.. 
We're fighting our own addictions. Patience brings.. Heartaches.. 
Anger flies - Still we try.. I wont fight back.. 
Can't give in.. 
Wont stay here forever like this.. 
Refusing consciousness.. 
To drown in - To cope with.. 
Inebriate.. 
To find when waking.. 
That nothing has been chaaaanged! Take.. One more drink.. You can't live without it! 
Take one more drink! 
Take.. One more drink.. Or drown without it! 
Take one more drink! So hard to talk about it..! 
How did I know that you lie about it!? 
Stand there and watch you sink without it! 
Losing sleep at night - I still dream about it! I wont fight back.. 
Can't give in.. 
Wont stay here forever like this.. 
Refusing consciousness.. 
To drown in! 
To cope with! 
Inebriate..! 
To find that nothing has chaaaanged!
