Simply put I'm satisfied just to hear you speak 
And holding on to what you said last time, here with me 
I remember listening to passing cars, on our backs staring at the stars 
And I survive by these memories, these memories of you So I'll press my face against the pane 
Of the window as I watch you drive away 
The glass is still stained in my bedroom 
Where you wrote 'I Love You' with your lipstick 
And once again I'm left here fighting tears away The glass is still stained in my bedroom 
Where you wrote 'I Love You' with your lipstick 
And once again I'm left here fighting tears away The glass is still stained in my bedroom 
Where you wrote 'I Love You' with your lipstick 
And once again I'm left here fighting tears away
