It's time to celebrate 
It's time to open up 
Throw your cares away 
And get them bottles up Lift your hands high 
No more crying ... 
Music all around 
Dancing to the sound Don't let problems get you down 
Let ... move around 
No matter who you are 
You're a star So get ready Everybody in the place 
If you're ready to have a good time 
Put your hands in the air 
Let's go 
Let's go 
Come on Are you ready for a good time? 
Are you ready for a good time? 
And if you're ready sing along with me Are you ready for a good time? 
Are you ready? 
Are you ready for a good time? 
And if you're ready sing along with me It's time to raise your hands 
It's time to scream and shout 
Party all night long 
And let your problems out Get into this groove 
Make your body move 
Dj play that song 
I need to get it on Don't let problems get you down 
Let ... move around 
No matter who you are 
You're a star So get ready Are you ready for a good time? 
Are you ready? 
Are you ready for a good time? 
And if you're ready sing along with me Are you ready for a good time? 
Are you ready? 
Are you ready for a good time? 
And if you're ready sing along with me Are you ready?
