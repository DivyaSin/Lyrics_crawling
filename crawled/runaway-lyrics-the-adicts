I hear people talk 
I see people walk 
They seem so out of touch 
I wanna get away so much All the clockwork toys 
Are making too much noise 
It's the machinery 
It's breaking down, oh can't you see Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me 
Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me The picture doesn't change 
It's just a frozen frame 
I wanna break the ice 
I wanna go to paradise There is nowhere to hide 
I'll take you for a ride 
But not if you kiss and tell 
I don't mean on a carousel Won't you run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me 
Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me One day I'm to say my 
Three wishes came true 
Till then I pretend I'm 
Escaping with you, you, you, you Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me 
Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me 
Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me 
Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me 
Run runaway, run runaway 
Run runaway with me
