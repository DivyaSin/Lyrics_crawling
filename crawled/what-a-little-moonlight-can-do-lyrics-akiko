Ooh, ooh, ooh 
What a little moonlight can do 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
What a little moonlight can do to you 
You in love 
Your heart's fluttering all day long 
You only stutter cause you for sure 
Just throw that out of the way 
I love you 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
What a little moonlight can do 
Wait a while 
Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through 
He'll get bored 
You can't resist him 
All you'll say 
When you have kissed him is 
Ooh, ooh, ooh What a little moonlight can do 
Ooh, ooh, ooh
