Loud loud loud loud loud. 
And they play really bad music. 
Why can't they play some Donovan? 
They're students of course, 
And they have no respect for authority 
If i was the Vice-chancellor 
I'd put up against a wall and slap them with a 
salmon 
Damn that student radio 
Damn that student radio 
They bug me with their coloured hair 
Damn that student radio 
Turn off the power
