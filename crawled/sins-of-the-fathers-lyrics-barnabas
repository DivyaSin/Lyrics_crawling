Timeless, on the edge of any city 
A field of weathered stones 
Watching, all alone 
Marks the fitful resting place 
Of silent, stirring bones 
Some that pass before us 
We, in guilt, cannot let go An old man runs his hands through tattered memories 
Of dreams that wouldn't wait 
The future; much too late 
One foot caught in yesterday, the other near the grave 
Conveniently removed from sight 
With little fight, he fades away So many things remain unsaid 
So many signals never read 
Behold the unenlightened truth 
Of blind, unfeeling youth Growing up, a child is surrounded 
Towering above, so rudely pushed and shoved 
By those who've lost the child-heart 
Demanding, without love 
Limping into parenthood 
The son becomes what father was So many things remain unsaid 
So many signals never read 
Behold the pitiful results 
Of unfulfilled adults The rivers of our lives run 
Under many bridges burned 
No river runs forever 
Is a lesson sorely learned So little time for things unsaid 
So little time before we're dead 
Behold life's bright and fragile flower 
So easily devoured Timeless, on the edge of any memory 
A figure stands alone 
A knife-blade, keen and cold 
That wounds the heart of every man 
Who's love was never told 
Some that pass before us 
We, in guilt, cannot let go
