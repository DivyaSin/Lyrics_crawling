lyrics: G. Gross, C. Capek 
music: G. Gross, C. Capek, G. Raschke You think that you're a hotshot lady drivin' everybody crazy 
And the problem with it is that you're right, so baby maybe 
Can you tell me if you're just a friend lookin' for someone to talk to 
Or a lover to walk to. It would be okay if you say that your day was bad 
And that you're happy 'bout the friendship we have and all that. 
It'd also be nice if I could hold you tight during the night, 
Make it right till the broad daylight. Can you tell me if it's love that you want, 'cause I don't know, 
Is it friendship that you're dreamin' of, 'cause I don't know, 
Are you seethin' or leavin' or cheatin', cause I don't know, 
And don't tell me to take it slow, 'cause I'm takin' it slow. And now I'm thinkin' that I've been here before, been here before, 
And I'm thinkin' that I've done this before, done this before, 
I'm thinkin' that I'm livin' for more, livin' for more, 
So baby maybe tell me if I'm crazy but do you want more? Refrain: (2x) 
Will you be livin' this life, baby, dreamin' of me 
Or will you spend your days with no feelings for me 
Or might it be that every minute you'll be seethin' for me, 
Breathin' for me, grievin' for me, you're cheatin' on me You know you're drivin' me insane with all the things that you're sayin' 
And then you're drivin' me insane with all the games that you're playin' 
It ain't a game and I'm not impressed, I want nothing less than to know, 
Is it for real or just show? If it's real, then I'll take you to the top, never stop, 
Like a top notch, hot shot girl, I'll give you all that I've got, 
If it's not and we're just friends, 
Then tell me, before the friendship ends. And now I'm thinkin' that I've been here before, been here before, 
And I'm thinkin' that I've done this before, done this before, 
I'm thinkin' that I'm livin' for more, livin' for more, 
So baby maybe tell me if I'm crazy but do you want more? Refrain 4x
