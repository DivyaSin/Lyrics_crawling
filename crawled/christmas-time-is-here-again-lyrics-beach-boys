It's that time of year again 
That Christmas time feelin' is here again 
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again 
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again, ahh, ahh, ahh I see snow flurries comin' down 
Paint a pretty party scene all over town 
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again 
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again, ahh, ahh, ahh Lots of mistletoe hangin' everywhere 
Plenty of free gifts and so don't despair 
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again 
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again, ahh, ahh, ahh She's so pretty but I'm so young 
When I'm sixteen I'm gonna have some fun 
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again 
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again, ahh, ahh, ahh All the little children of this great big world 
Are waitin' for the season's biggest thrill 
I wonder if I'll ever be able to get to sleep again 
'Cause the Christmas time thrill is in the air again, ahh, ahh, ahh Been tossin' and a-turnin' all through the night 
I'll be wide awake until broad daylight 
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas Eve is here again 
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again, ahh, ahh, ahh Old Saint Nick'll be stoppin' in 
To see the lady of the house again 
I wonder if he'll ever go and try to kiss mommy on the cheek again 
'Cause the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again, ahh, ahh, ahh 
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again, ahh, ahh, ahh
