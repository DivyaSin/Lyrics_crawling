I wrote some words the other day, and they all came out like the kids I fucking hate. I came to burn any tried and true bridge you build in front of me. This is what I do, it's what i've always done. Maybe it's just me? Maybe you're fucking right. These friendships don't mean anything. They never fucking last, we never fucking win. Twenty-five years, and i've never seen one make it through. Fuck your broken hearts, fuck your broken razors. Fuck your same old tunes about the girl who was never there. Regret is for the ones I know, the ones who thought that I'd change someday. So when their close ties all become a noose, and their dreams all hit the fucking dirt, I told them keep fucking walking.
