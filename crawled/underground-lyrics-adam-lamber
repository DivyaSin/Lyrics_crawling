When you're gone, when you're gone 
It's like I'm in one second in time, I'm frozen 
When you're gone, when you're gone 
It's like I lost one half of my mind, stolen 'Cause nobody feels you like I do 
Nobody kills me like you do 
Nothing I take can ever cut through 
I'm in trouble 
I look at myself and I don't know 
How I'm stuck to ya like velcro 
Can't rip you off and go solo 
I'm in trouble 
I'm hooked on how you made 
Me hooked I'm gonna say it straight 
I want you I need you 
I want you to take me underground 
I'm hooked I can't cut ya off 
In my blood I'm gonna say it now 
I want you I need you 
I want you to take me underground 
I'm hooked on how you made 
Me hooked I'm gonna say it straight 
I want you I need you 
I want you to take me underground 
I'm hooked I can't cut ya off 
In my blood I'm gonna say it now 
I want you I need you 
I want you to take me underground When you go, when you go 
It's like I put my life on the line it's so hurt 
When you go, when you go 
I'm trippin' but I'm pretending I'm fine, so dumb 'Cause nobody feels you like I do 
Nobody kills me like you do 
Nothing I take can ever cut through 
I'm in trouble 
I look at myself and I don't know 
How I'm stuck to ya like velcro 
Can't rip you off and go solo 
I'm in trouble 
I'm hooked on how you made 
Me hooked I'm gonna say it straight 
I want you I need you 
I want you to take me underground 
I'm hooked I can't cut ya off 
In my blood I'm gonna say it now 
I want you I need you 
I want you to take me underground You got me hooked on you now 
I'm in trouble, trouble, trouble yeah I'm hooked on how you made 
Me hooked I'm gonna say it straight 
I want you I need you 
I want you to take me underground 
I'm hooked I can't cut ya off 
In my blood I'm gonna say it now 
I want you I need you 
I want you to take me underground I'm hooked on how you made 
Me hooked I'm gonna say it straight 
I want you I need you 
I want you to take me underground 
I'm hooked I can't cut ya off 
In my blood I'm gonna say it now 
I want you I need you
