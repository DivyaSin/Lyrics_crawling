Belligerent and bruised, stumblin' behind you 
Shallow and bent, 
Full of contempt twisted around and rude 
So kiss me, kiss me, kiss me or I will cry 
Dented and dulled, my heart strings pulled 
How near may I sit to you 
I'm wanted, I'm wilted through, 
Paid in full all my dues 
Someday feeling won't feel at all 
Someday feeling won't feel so strong 
Someday feeling could smother us all 
Someday feeling will stop my heart 
Unless you kiss me
