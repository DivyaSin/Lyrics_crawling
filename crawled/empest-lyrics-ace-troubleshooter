Don't touch this 
Just look and feel your way through 
Can't tough this tempest just yet The hopes and fears 
In the sirens sounding 
Beating hearts, tears 
As the rain starts pounding Comfort in stereo sirens warning 
Still fighting, white lightning 
Blinding, storming It's not in me 
But I'll recover it 
It's not in me Go run and hide 
As the storm comes in 
I'll be alright and I won't let it in Standing ground 
Standing with sirens waking 
Firmly rooted, ever bending 
Never breaking It's not in me 
But I'll recover it 
It's not in me Go run and hide 
As the storm comes in 
I'll be alright and I won't let it in Go run and hide 
As the storm comes in 
I'll be alright and I won't let it in It's not in me 
But I'll recover it 
It's not in me Go run and hide 
As the storm comes in 
I'll be alright and I won't let it in Go run and hide 
As the storm comes in 
I'll be alright and I won't let it in 
I won't let it in
