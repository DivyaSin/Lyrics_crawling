Producer for bonnie: steve hackett 
Recorded in 1990 as a charity single against	the repatriation of the vietnamese boat people. lyrics taken from careful listening. I am sailing, I am sailing 
Far away, across the sea 
I am sailing, stormy waters 
To be near you, to be free I am flying, I am flying 
Like a bird, across the sky 
I am flying, passing high clouds 
To be near you, to be free Can you hear me? can you hear me? 
Through the dark night, far away 
I am dying, forever trying 
To be with you, who can say? We are sailing, we are sailing 
Far away, across the sea 
We are sailing, stormy waters 
To be near you, to be free 
To be near you, to be free 
To be near you, to be free 
To be near you, to be free 
To be near you, to be free I am flying, I am flying 
Like a bird, across the sky 
I am flying, passing high clouds 
To be near you, to be free Oh lord, to be near you 
To be free 
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me? 
Through the dark night 
Far away 
I am dying, forever trying 
To be with you, who can say 
To be with you, who can say
