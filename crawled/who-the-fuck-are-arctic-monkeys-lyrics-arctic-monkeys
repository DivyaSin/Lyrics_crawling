We all want some one to shout for 
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore 
But your heroes arent what they seem 
When youve been, where weve been Have I done something to trigger 
The funny looks and the snigger? 
Are they there at all 
Or is it just paranoia Everybodys got there box 
And doing what theyre told 
You push my faith near being lost 
But well stick to the guns Dont care if it's marketing suicide 
We wont crack or compromise 
Your derisory devides 
Will never unhinge us Theres a couple of hundred 
Think theyre Christopher Columbus 
But the settlers had already settled 
Here long before you Just because were having a say so 
And not lining up to be play doh 
In five years time will it be 
Who the fucks arctic monkeys? 'Cause everybodys got there box 
And doing what theyre told 
You push my faith near being lost 
But well stick to the guns Dont care if it's marketing suicide 
We wont crack or compromise 
Your derisory devides 
Will never unhinge us All the thoughts that I just said 
Linger round and multiply in the head 
Not that bad to start with 
Im not angry, Im just disappointed It's not you it's them that are wrong 
Tell 'em to take out their tongues 
Tell 'em to take out their tongues It's not you it's them that are wrong 
Tell 'em to take out their tongues 
Tell 'em to take out their tongues 
And bring on the backlash It's not you it's them that are wrong 
Tell him to take out his tongue 
Tell him to take out his tongue It's not you it's them that's the fake 
I won't mess with your escape 
Is this really your escape?
