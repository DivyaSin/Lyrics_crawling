Kiss away kiss away guess that's all that's left to say 
Please come back and kiss these tears away 
Smile again let me smile again make my life worthwhile again 
Please come back and kiss these tears away Only you can change these sad and blue days 
Only you can make them I-love-you days 
So kiss away kiss away still there's nothing left to say 
Please come back and kiss my tears away 
Only you can change
