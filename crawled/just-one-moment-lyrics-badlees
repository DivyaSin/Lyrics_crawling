Quote: A man is rich in proportion to the things 
he can afford to let alone (Henry David Thoreau) 
SONG LYRICS: 
Hypocrisy as it oughta be, that's called good business 
Sometimes it really bothers me how I got in this 
Took this job a-thinkin' I'd be movin' up someday 
Been too busy drinkin' to be carin' either way 
The wife she ain't been workin' 'cause her time is growin' near 
But the IRS ain't takin' no sabbaticals this year 
Been working on commission against weekly guarantees 
This soldier's on a mission but it ain't for charity 
CHORUS: 
Give me just one moment with the wheel between my hands 
Just one moment, I'll make you understand 
Don't confuse all the games you lose with failing as a man 
Just one moment, I'll show you who I am 
Went in to see the boss man to ask him for a raise 
Never did quite understand all the reasons that he gave 
His 8" x 10" of Jesus had turned it's back to me 
I guess mortal men can't comprehend that dense morality 
So I bought my wife some roses, and tied them with a bow 
Called the boss up at 3 AM and I told him where to go 
Now we're driving down the highway back to where we first began 
With me back in the driver's seat and her holding my hand 
Repeat Chorus 
END
