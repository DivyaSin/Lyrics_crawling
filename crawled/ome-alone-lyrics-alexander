[Verse 1:] 
I'm not gonna argue, I'm not gonna start a fight 
I just wanna make everything according to my mind 
You can try like you want to, but you're not gonna succeed 
Cause what you really want, babe, is what you really need 
But I can tell you right now, you're not gonna get far 
You think it's what you want to be, but you already are [Chorus:] 
You can try, you can cry, you can kneel, you can heel 
But you won't get far, girl, you're not the main star 
You can beg, you can moan, break your cellular phone 
But you're just gonna sit at home alone 
You can punch, you can kick, how about you can sit 
You can take a break, cause you know you're just fake 
You can beg, you can moan, break your cellular phone 
But you're just gonna sit at home alone [Verse 2:] 
This is not where it ends, but it's not where it begins 
So stop with all the jokes, and stop with all the grins 
We know that it's not right, but we do it anyway 
We like to be satisfied, we like to have our way 
So pick up the pieces, and fix your cell phone 
You can call me all you want, but you'll sit at home alone [Chorus]
