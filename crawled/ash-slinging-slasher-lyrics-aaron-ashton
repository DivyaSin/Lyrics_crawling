The sun is falling 
The night is coming 
You better watch behind your back His eyes are red and 
His look of death and 
Now he's emerging from the black You take out the trash and you go outside 
Accepting a taste of the night 
Your hearts beating faster and you're running back 
You're filled with fright, alright Here comes the hash slinging slasher 
He comes in the darkness of night 
Here comes the hash slinging slasher 
You better be ready to fight The lights will flicker 
The phone will ring and 
There will be no one on the line The bus has pulled up outside 
You feel like you want to cry 
There couldn't be another sign You take out the trash and you go outside 
Accepting a taste of the night 
Your hearts beating faster and you're running back 
You're filled with fright, alright Here comes the hash slinging slasher 
He comes in the darkness of night 
Here comes the hash slinging slasher 
You better be ready to fight 
Don't call him the crash dinging masher 
That's not his name it's just not right 
Here comes the hash slinging slasher 
You better be ready to fight Terror has over come you and you don't know what to do 
Terror has over come you and you don't know what to do 
Terror has over come you and you don't know what to do now 
You better run now
