Be yourself I want no one else 
And if you're sad 
Just let it out By your side and still you hide 
Hide it all 
Just let it out Moved me like a wind 
And shook me when you blew in 
All winds someday change 
Before they blow in cold and strange Laugh it off, if you're feeling soft 
Then let me in 
And let it out
