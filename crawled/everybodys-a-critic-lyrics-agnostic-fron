Call me a sellout, call me a fake 
How much do you have at stake? 
It's nothing but lies, outrageous cries 
A cry for help, look at yourself So you talk it, do you walk it? 
Or do you police the scene? 
Those who talk shit are really something 
Lying to themselves hiding something Watching everyone, watching you 
Watching me, fuck you
