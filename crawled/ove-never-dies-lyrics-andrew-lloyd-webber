Who knows when love begins 
Who knows what makes it start 
One day it's simply there 
Alive inside your heart It slips into your thoughts 
It infiltrates your soul 
It takes you by surprise 
Then seizes full control Try to deny it 
And try to protest 
But love won't let you go 
Once you've been possessed Love never dies 
Love never falters 
Once it has spoken 
Love is yours Love never fades 
Love never alters 
Hearts may get broken 
Love endures 
Hearts may get broken 
Love endures And soon as you submit 
Surrender flesh and bone 
That love takes on a life 
Much bigger than your own It uses you at whim 
And drives you to despair 
And forces you to feel 
More joy than you can bear Love gives you pleasure 
And love brings you pain 
And yet when both are gone 
Love will still remain Once it has spoken 
Love is yours Love never dies 
Love never alters Hearts may get broken 
Love endures 
Hearts may get broken Love never dies 
Love will continue 
Love keeps on beating 
When you're gone Love never dies 
Once it is in you 
Life may be fleeting 
Love lives on 
Life may be fleeting Love lives on
