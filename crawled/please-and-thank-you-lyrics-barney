There are lots of things, we can do to be nice 
Sometimes they're hard to remember 
But there are two little things 
You should never forget 
From January through December He's talking 'bout 'Please and Thank you' 
They're called the magic words 
If you want nice things to happen 
They're the words that should be heard Remember please and thank you 
'Cause they're the magic words Use 'em in the morning, at noon and night 
'Cause it's a great way to be polite 
'Please and thank you' 
They're the magic words We're talking 'bout 'Please and Thank you' 
They're called the magic words 
If you want nice things to happen 
They're the words that should be heard Remember 'Please and Thank you' 
'Cause they're the magic words 
Use 'em in the morning, at noon and night 
'Cause it's a great way to be polite 'Please and thank you' 
They're the magic words
