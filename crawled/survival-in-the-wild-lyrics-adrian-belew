Underneath a burning sky 
The tenants of the fire 
Sit in silence as they ponder 
Survival in the wild With our love to keep us up 
There is nothing in the world 
That can knock us down 
We can take whatever comes 
If we face it hand in hand 
We can stand our ground Just a couple of kids with clouds in our heads 
Trying to swim upstream, trying to make it good 
But it happened so fast, when disaster came 
That a river of teardrops couldn't wash it away How do we now view ourselves, 
Sitting victims in a shelter needing help? 
How do we now regain control 
Over the remnants of our life without a home? If a bomb had hit us, nothing less would remain 
Not a wall to lean on, not a fork or a plate 
But at least we made it out and we're still alive 
And we're starting over now in the middle of the night It's a matter of time, a struggle to survive 
But it doesn't need to be a lonely fight 
If we stand by each other 
We'll be sure of our survival in the wild Underneath a burning sky 
The tenants of the fire 
Sit in silence as they ponder 
Survival in the wild
