If you want a man who sweep you off your feet 
Or take you out to fancy restaurants to eat 
Then I guess I ain't the one you're looking for 
If you're scarred of what one walking through your door... 'Cause I, I shall object what you need 
And I, you can take it or leave it cause I 
I got time that you see that, I got what you want 
Got what you want, got what you want I got a lap hat full of rock'n'roll 
And I got no education but I do, I got soul 
I never got nowhere without a fight, oh no 
You'll be shaking out the knees with me tonight 
That's right 'Cause I, I should object what you need 
And I, you can drink or leave it cause I 
I got time that you see that, I got what you want 
Got what you want, got what you want I show you how a good boy or a bad boy I can be 
Or if you are just waiting for me 
Cause good girls don't come easy 'Cause I, I shall object what you need 
And I, you can take it or leave it cause I 
I got time that you see that, I got what you want 
Got what you want, got what you want 'Cause I, I should object what you need 
And I, you can drink or leave it cause I 
I got time that you see that, I got what you want 
Got what you want, got what you want
