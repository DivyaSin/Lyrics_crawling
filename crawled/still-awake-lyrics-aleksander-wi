I've been walking around, been making plans for later 
Somehow I lost them out of sight 
I've been tracing steps all through this haunted borough, 
been feeling you I've been prowling round like dogs in sordid alleys, 
crawling in and out of bars 
and it will all be gone tomorrow If you're still awake 
open up the door 
let my ordinary breakdown 
get you down once more 
Oh, if you're still awake 
open up the door 
It's an ordinary breakdown 
just an ordinary breakdown 
If you're still awake I've been picturing your face in vacant windows 
and I keep talking to myself 
Now I'm staying in the zone, this wicked limbo 
like there is no tomorrow 
there is no tomorrow 
it will all be gone tomorrow If you're still awake 
open up the door let my ordinary breakdown 
get you down once more 
Oh, if you're still awake 
open up the door 
it's an ordinary breakdown 
just an ordinary breakdown Tell me what you're waiting for 
Now you've got me standing at your door 
Tell me what you're waiting for 
'Cause it will all be gone tomorrow 
It will all be gone tomorrow If you're still awake 
open up the door 
Let my ordinary breakdown 
get you down once more 
Oh, if you're still awake 
open up the door 
It's an ordinary breakdown 
Just an ordinary breakdown 
It's an ordinary breakdown 
Like the ones I've had before Oh, if you're still awake 
open up the door 
It's an ordinary breakdown 
Just an ordinary breakdown
