I'm in love with a strong man 
And he tells me he's wild about me 
I'm in love with a guy who is everything grand 
Any man can be I'm in love with a strong man 
What a hard-working hero is he 
Great big arms muscled hard, dark and shining he folds around me Hair crisp and curly 
And cropped kinda close 
Picture a lover like this 
Lips warm and full that I love the most 
Smiling between every kiss I'm in love with a strong man 
Once you see him you'll have to agree 
That any other would just be the wrong man 
And it is easy to see Why I love life 
When I'm loving my strong man 
And letting my strong man love me Hair crisp and curly 
And cropped kinda close 
Picture a lover like this 
Lips warm and full that I love the most 
Smiling between every kiss I'm in love with a strong man 
Once you see him you have to agree 
That any other would just be the wrong man 
And it is easy to see Why I love life 
When I'm loving my strong man 
And letting my strong man love me
