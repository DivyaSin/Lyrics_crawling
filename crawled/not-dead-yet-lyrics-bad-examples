I was born too late to play in the rolling stones 
I don't know jimmy page, I never met yoko ono 
Standing with a strat, I'm rock and roll's bastard son 
Go out, get drunk, get laid, have fun 
I don't got a million dollars, don't drive a cadillac 
Gimme half a chance, 'cause I'm not dead yet 
(chorus) 
I'm not dead yet - not dead yet 
I'm a mad dog fighting with the wall against my back 
You'd better get a bigger gun, I'm not dead yet I been machine-gunned, hand-gunned, hijacked, left for dead 
Divebombed, napalmed, nuclear warheaded 
Dropped from a jet plane with no parachute 
Shot by a firing squad and raped by a business suit 
I'm dancing on a landmine, one leg left 
But I can still crawl and I'm not dead yet Chorus Well, you're bigger, tougher, meaner, rougher 
Dirtier and uglier and sneakier and trickier 
You wanna shoot me with a gun, cut me with a knife 
Take your bare hands and rip out my eyes 
You kicked me in the balls and bit me in the neck 
Hit me again, 'cause I'm not dead yet Chorus Well there's a mugger in the alley, there's a sniper in the hall 
There's a girl at the bar wants to get me by the balls 
The hangman is hanging if I autograph the noose 
And lee harvey oswald's brother's on the loose 
There's a mafia hitman with a bullet for my back 
Someday he's gonna get me, but I'm not dead yet I'm not dead yet - not dead yet 
I'm a wild card waiting in the middle of the deck 
You'd better get a bigger gun, I'm not dead yet Chorus
