We'll get back to that run-down place 
to see those raylights in a haze 
I let you breath my smoke again 
Certain things will never end I follow you to that dusty space 
I feel so save when you touch my face 
There's nothing left to say 
We'll hold eachother for eternity Hold me for that day 
Hold me so I feel save 
Hold me now, it's the only way 
for us to survive 
Hold me near, hold me close 
It's the moment when the world will stop for now I'm longing for a little taste 
In this basement there's no time to waste 
Please don't ever quit 
You're the perfect fit 
You'll get yours and I'll get mine 
The things we took will make it right 
When you return from far away 
we'll get back there 
It's the only way, I try Hold me near, hold me now 
Lying next to you is the only way 
for us to survive 
Hold me near, hold me close 
In this moment I got everything I need Come on near me 
I hold you tight and what we've done 
we'll make it right 
It's the best to breath you in 
You breath me out 
It's the olny way, I try Hold me near, hold me now 
Being with you is the only way 
for me to survive 
Hold me near, hold me close 
I really gotta try 
It's the only way, only way, I try
