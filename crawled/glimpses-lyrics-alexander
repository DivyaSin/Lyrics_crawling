I found peace, in my way 
But it didn't last, beyond the day 
I've had glimpses around the bend 
But in the morning, I start again 
I feel the sun, hot on my face 
And I hear my blood giving way I've had some glimpses around the bend 
You know if I didn't, I'd have killed myself today Now mama I'm so tired, from the bullshit 
(Mama yeah yeah) 
And my soul cried, from the bullshit 
(Mama yeah) 
And I'm so tried, 
But I know I'll make it with you by my side Perhaps I'm crazy 
Still I'm thinking, there is change in the air 
We were trying together 
Now we're trying just to care 
Now if we find peace 
Oh let it stay 
Let it last beyond the day I've had glimpses of our tomorrow 
But Lord if I didn't I'd kill myself today Now mama I'm so tried, from the bullshit 
Mama yeah, yeah 
My soul cried from the bullshit 
Mama yeah 
I'm so tired 
But I know I'll make it with you by my side
