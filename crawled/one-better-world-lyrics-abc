Politicians preaching - on TV 
Saying nothing but - vote for me 
Everybody, everywhere 
We got a love, got a love 
Got a love we gotta share... 
One better world 
One better world 
One better world 
Papers feeding - lies each day 
Are you believeing - what they say? 
Pulpit preachers - selling God 
Making big bucks - is that enough? 
Everybody, everywhere 
We got a love, got a love 
Got a love we gotta share... 
One better world 
One betetr world 
One better, better, better world 
Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere 
Let the lion lie down with the lamb 
Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere 
Don't use the colour of his skin to judge the man 
Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere 
Does it matter if you're gay or if you're straight 
Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere 
If it does you fill this world with hate 
Underneath a flag 
Love is just a name 
But underneath the moon 
We are all the same 
Everybody, everywhere 
We got a love, got a love 
Got a love we gotta share... 
One better world 
One better world 
One better, better, better world
