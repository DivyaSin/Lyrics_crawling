Let me take you to Trafalgar Square 
Let me take you there 
Every street's a fashion catwalk 
Everyone's debonair 
Let me take you to Piccadilly 
Guess it leads somewhere Tower over centuries, tower over London 
Tower up and frankly I'm amazed 
What's done cannot be undone, not here not in London 
What's done can never be erased So, tower up! It's those little things 
Make life interesting, Tower of London! 
Tower up! Wasting time 
Yours and mine, Tower of London! 
Hip London! Hip London! Let me take you to St.James' square 
Let me groove you there 
Diplomats get target practice 
In the open air 
Psychobillies scream blue murder 
Then they hit Mayfair Tower over centuries, tower over London 
Tower up and frankly I'm amazed 
What's done cannot be undone, not here not in London 
What's done can never be erased So, tower up! It's those little things 
Make life interesting, Tower of London! 
Tower up! Wasting time 
Precious time, Tower of London! 
Tower up! I'll meet you there 
I'll be there, Tower of London 
New York! Don't make me laugh 
I've seen photographs, Tower of London...
