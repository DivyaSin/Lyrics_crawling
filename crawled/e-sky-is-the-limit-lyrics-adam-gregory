I sat on the couch, with a book in my hand 
I thought of all the good times that I've had 
But even though life's sometimes hard 
And it's hard to understand 
The sky is the limit, so do with it what you can Oh, the sky's the limit the sky never ends 
Even though life's a struggle, one day it will end 
So make the best of what you have 
Be it good or be it bad 
And oh, the sky is the limit 
So do with it what you can I wake up every morning 
With a smile upon my face 
The day seems so exciting 
I could never complain 
My family is so supportive 
They're the best that a boy could have 
So take each day for what it's worth 
And then you'll understand why...
