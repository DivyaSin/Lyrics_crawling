The streets run red with the blood 
Of the innocent, why? Why? Why? 
We stab our knives in the back 
Of humanity, why? Why? Why? There's never peace, just a spiral 
Of the violence, why? Why? Why? 
We'll shoot you down for a difference 
Of opinion, why? Why? Why? Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
Sons and daughters, lost and gone 
Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
No talk, no thought, just shoot and run Our children wake to the bomb 
And the body search, why? Why? Why? 
We fill their ears with the drums 
And the battle cries, why? Why? Why? They burn your car when you stray 
It's a game they play, why? Why? Why? 
They're fed on hate, it's a circle 
We don't want to break, why? Why? Why? Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
Sons and daughters, lost and gone 
Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
No talk, no thought, just shoot and run I'm baptized in your prejudice 
I'm confirmed with your hate 
I'm ordained into violence 
I'm a child of the modern world 
Of the media world, of the TV world 
Of the modern world Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
Sons and daughters, lost and gone 
Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
No talk, no thought, just shoot and run Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
Sons and daughters, lost and gone 
Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
No talk, no thought, just shoot and run Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
Sons and daughters, lost and gone 
Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
No talk, no thought, just shoot and run Cheap the bullet, easy the gun 
Sons and daughters
