all he ever does is sit around the house 
and drinks and drinks 
and when he drinks he drinks Beast 
because it f*cks him up for cheap 
Eins, Zwei, Drei, Vier 
johnny drank all the beer 
he drinks and drinks and drinks and drinks 
and eric tells him what he thinks 
the truth is out, his story's known 
he drained the keg dry as a bone
