Steady yourself even though you've only just fallen 
Maybe you're falling but you're still alive 
Ready yourself that's quite enough of your bawling 
Cause baby by bawling you'll survive 
Ohhh You can copy and paste your head on a new body 
But that new body still made of flesh 
Cutting corners gets you where you're going 
But how you get there is the real test Losing is only a sign 
It's only a sign that you really tried (really tried) 
Losing is only a sign 
It's only a sign that you really tried (really tried) Forever changing places with the same old thing 
Racking up the cases of who I failed to be 
Why would I replace the sky 
Why would I recreate a perfect blue
