Verse 1 
I can see it in your eyes 
Sorry didn't mean a thing 
I can tell that they were lies 
Now in my past is where you stand Chorus 
Fight after fight 
On going wars 
I see the light, not crying no more 
For you to think I'm coming back 
Not this time, not this time Verse 2 
I gave you my all 
You did me wrong it made me strong 
Your chance has come and gone 
how'd we come to this? (Chorus 2x)
