A song of love is a sad song 
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo 
A song of love is a song of woe 
Don't ask me how I know A song of love is a sad song 
For I have loved and it's so 
I sit at the window and watch the rain 
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo Tomorrow, I'll probably love again 
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo A song of love is a sad song 
For I have loved and it's so 
I sit at the window and watch the rain 
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
