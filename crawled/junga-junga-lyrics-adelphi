All we've got is time, 
Ticking till the sun will someday cease to 
Shine into your eyes. 
All we've got is time. It seems I'm spell-bound by your smile. 
My eyes are swirling with a black and white design. 
The brightness of your face defines the night in which I stand, 
Dazed and frozen. All we've got is time, 
Ticking till the sun will someday cease to 
Shine into your eyes. 
All we've got is time. It seems I've wandered from my mind, 
Arms out to reach you as I dive into those eyes. 
I'll perch upon your sunlit brow (all we've got is time) 
And view a world that's fallen underneath your spell. You're so far, so it seems, but I'll chase you endlessly 
through the dark open sea. 
When the light starts to creep and you slip away from me, 
Only then will you see. All we've got is time, 
All we've got is.. All we've got is time, 
Ticking till the sun will someday cease to 
Shine into your eyes. 
All we've got is time. All we've got is time
