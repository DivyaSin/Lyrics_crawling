Pregnant teens on the Barton street bus 
Homeless people living off crust 
And there's a beat-up town car, it's starting to rust 
Hard soles are kicking up dust 
Half a million people living in the corpse of the brown brick 50's 
To the north, all the small town outcasts are now big city bourgeoisie All the boys in the halfway houses 
Wave to the girls of Emerald Street Our calloused fingers, blood red on the brick, but we hold on (hold on) 
We'll never falter, though they want us to slip, we hold on (hold on) The desperate, downtown stealing bikes 
Drunks in the village are picking fights 
So, police like the streets to read them their rights 
No controlling hot summer nights 
The sun goes down on the edge of town, at the end of everyday 
We sit and watch the stacks on fire, to the east across the bay All the boys in the halfway houses 
Wave to the girls of Emerald Street Our calloused fingers, blood red on the brick, but we hold on (hold on) 
We'll never falter, though they want us to slip, we hold on (hold on) There's something in the church belfry 
On the corner of Victoria and king 
And it screams out into the night 
It sings this city's plight All the boys in the halfway houses 
Wave to the girls of Emerald Street Hold on, hold on Our calloused fingers, blood red on the brick, but we hold on (hold on) 
We'll never falter, though they want us to slip, we hold on (hold on)
