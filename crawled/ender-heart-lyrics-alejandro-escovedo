I got a dream do you want to in it too? 
You can be with me and I can be with you 
A god above, another one below 
You better run baby now you'll never know 
I got a dream do you want to be in my dream? 
I got a dream do you want to be in my dream? 
I got a tender heart do you want my tender heart? 
I got nothin' you need and everything you want 
You make your bed honey 
I'll clean your nose 
Roll over once why don't you 
Shake out those pretty clothes 
I got a tender heart 
Do you want my tender heart? 
I got a tender heart 
Do you want my tender heart? First time I saw you I thought 
I must have dreamed you up 
You laughed in my face and 
Threw down in a paper cup 
The ice is melting, it's melting in the sink 
It's only four, why don't you 
Make us one more drink? 
I got a dream do you want to be in my dream? 
I got a dream do you want to be in my dream? 
Do you want to be in my dream? 
Do you want to be in my dream? 
Do you want to be in my dream? 
Do you want to be in my dream?
