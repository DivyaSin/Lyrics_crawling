I guess i figured out 
That something was wrong 
And that things have changed 
Cause girl i sit by the phone 
And i wait for your call 
But the phone never rings 
So i picked up the phone and called you at home 
You're on the other line, 
I wanna talk to you maybe 
Even see you, you say you have no time You started doing things that 
You never did before, how could 
Something so right turn out to be 
Something so wrong You thought the grass was greener 
You thought the well had water 
You thought that you could find a 
Love another place 
So how could you leave this good thing We use to take long walks 
And have long, long talks 
On the telephone 
You use to hold my hand in the 
Shopping mall, i felt i was your own, 
We stopped going out as much 
I started feeling all alone 
Girl you stopped telling me you loved me 
Saying that you cared 
But i still carried on I thought we could work things out 
But i just don't understand why 
How could you leave someone patient 
Like me for something so wrong Even though you, broke my heart in two 
I was just hanging on, trying to do what 
Was right and you were already gone When love came you went away 
And if i see you again 
Girl i would ask you how could you 
Leave this good thing
