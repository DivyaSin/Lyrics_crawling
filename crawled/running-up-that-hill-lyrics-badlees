When the rain is sports arena loud 
In the evening of a self-inflicted day 
And you're contemplating sides that might collide 
The hemlock society and life insurance salesmen 
And you discover all your coupons 
Are for things you hate 
And all your pennies are Canadian 
And you curse that paperweight Drown it all and leave it still 
You're a millionaire of words 
Hand in hand as light as birds 
We'll go running up that hill When acquaintances drain your reservoir 
Of cigarettes like bad construction 
And all your phone conversations slither 
Into a sales pitch from the world of Don Lapre 
And the love from a close-as-sisters friendship 
Up and dies like it too often does Drown it all and leave it still 
You're a millionaire of words 
Hand in hand as light as birds 
We'll go running up that hill The funeral directors' trade show crowd 
Strangles parking so you drive a while 
Past streets and neighborhoods and ghosts 
Of incidents that now define you 
When the weight of expectation cracks 
Cracks your countenance in the damnedest places Drown it all and leave it still 
You're a millionaire of words 
Hand in hand as light as birds 
We'll go running up that hill
