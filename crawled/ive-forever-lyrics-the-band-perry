Oh, oh 
I was dreaming of war 
Saw that I wouldn't die 
Was dreaming of choice 
That my ship would fight 
I was dreaming because 
It made me feel so alive 
Was dreaming it all 
From my bed last night You will be my only one 
Hold my hand so we can run 
You and I, we're staying young, yeah We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever This time, I want it all 
I want it right now, feel the fall 
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy 
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever 
This time, I want it all 
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall 
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy 
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever I was feeling a storm 
But it wasn't outside 
Was feeling a force 
I'm electrified 
I was feeling my heart 
There was thunder inside 
Was feeling it all 
From my bed last night You will be my only one 
Hold my hand so we can run 
You and I, we're staying young, yeah We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever This time, I want it all 
I want it right now, feel the fall 
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy 
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever 
This time, I want it all 
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall 
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy 
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever 
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever All the things that I don't know 
All the dreams that I've been shown 
All the ways that it could end 
Tonight close your eyes We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever This time, I want it all (I want it all) 
I want it right now, feel the fall 
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy (go crazy) 
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever 
This time, I want it all (I want it all) 
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall 
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy 
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever 
Oh, oh, oh, hey 
Oh, oh, oh, forever 
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
