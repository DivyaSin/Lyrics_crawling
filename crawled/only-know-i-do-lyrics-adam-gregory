How do you explain the way the stars just 
Hang way up in the sky 
How do you explain the way rain goes away 
Whenever you walk by It's a mystery just how life can lead 
To a place you've never been 
You've knocked on that door 
A hundred times before, when it 
Suddenly let you in I don't know why 
I've been so blessed to love someone like you 
I don't know why 
I must confess, I only know I do And how do you explain the way 
My world has changed right before my eyes 
And how do you explain the way you 
Gave me wings 
When I swore I could never fly It's a mystery what you've done for me 
I'm at a place I've never been 
I've knocked on that door 
A hundred times before 
Now you've suddenly let me in In my heart, I won't question 
I'll just lay here in your arms
