What's wrong with the world, mama? 
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas 
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama 
Only attracted to things that'll bring the trauma Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism 
But we still got terrorists here livin' 
In the U.S.A., the big C.I.A. 
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK But, if you only have love for your own race 
Then you only leave space to discriminate 
And to discriminate only generates hate 
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah Madness is what you demonstrate 
And that's exactly how anger works and operates 
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight 
Take control of your mind and meditate, let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all People killin', people dyin' 
Children hurtin', you hear them cryin'? 
Can you practice what you preach? 
And would you turn the other cheek Father, Father, Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
'Cause people got me, got me questionin' 
Where is the love? 
(Love) Where is the love? 
(The love) 
Where is the love? 
(The love) 
Where is the love? 
The love, the love It just ain't the same, old ways have changed 
New days are strange, is the world insane? 
If love and peace are so strong, why are there pieces of love 
That don't belong? Nations droppin' bombs Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones 
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young 
So, ask yourself is the lovin' really gone? 
So, I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong? In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in 
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends 
Not respectin' each other, denyin' thy brother 
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug 
If you never know truth then you never know love 
Where's the love, y'all? Come on 
(I don't know) 
Where's the truth, y'all? Come on 
(I don't know) 
Where's the love, y'all? People killin', people dyin' 
Children hurtin', you hear them cryin'? 
Can you practice what you preach? 
And would you turn the other cheek Father, Father, Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
'Cause people got me, got me questionin' 
Where is the love? 
(Love) Where is the love? 
(The love) 
Where is the love? 
(The love) 
Where is the love? 
(The love) 
Where is the love? 
(Love) Where is the love? 
(The love) 
Where is the love? 
(The love) 
Where is the love? 
The love, the love I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder 
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder 
Most of us only care about money makin' 
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction Wrong information always shown by the media 
Negative images is the main criteria 
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria 
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity? 
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? 
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity 
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under 
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down 
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under 
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found and ask yourself Where is the love? 
Where is the love? 
Where is the love? 
Where is the love? Father, Father, Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
'Cause people got me, got me questionin' 
Where is the love? Sing with my ya'll 
(One world, one world) 
We only got 
(One world, one world) 
That's all we got 
(One world, one world) And somethin's wrong wit it 
(Yeah) 
Somethin's wrong wit it 
(Yeah) 
Somethin's wrong with the w-w-world yeah 
We only got 
(One world, one world) 
That's all we got 
(One world, one world)
