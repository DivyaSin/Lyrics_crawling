For so long I've been thinking 
What I can do 
Day and night I've been thinking 
What I can do 
To forget about you to forget about us 
Do I exist in your so called life 
Will this drama ever end 
I am having my doubts 
Forget about me I'm sure you have 
My heart's on a table with three legs 
That's where you want it right 
My feelings sustained 
My dreams are flying away 
Never again, Bittersweet, Poison
