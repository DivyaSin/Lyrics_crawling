Every day I wake up to pictures of your face 
Youre more than an obsession, youre an acquired taste 
Eight seconds of your smile 
Eight seconds of your face 
What a disgrace I walked towards you too late (Chorus) 
And youre so beautiful 
Eight seconds in my life and Ive gone crazy! 
And youre so beautiful 
Eight seconds Ill never see you again Im crazy! Every night I swim through crowds in a dream 
To hear you speak 
I beat myself up for not moving on through, 
My will was too weak 
Eight seconds of a glance 
Eight seconds of a chance 
If Id given a damn I wouldnt be turning in my sleep (Chorus) 
And youre so beautiful 
Eight seconds in my life and Ive gone crazy! 
And youre so beautiful 
Eight seconds Ill never see you again Im crazy! In those seconds you shouldve grabbed my hand- 
Why didnt you? 
In those seconds you shouldve talked to me- 
You wanted to! 
Now its over, and I cant forget 
Didnt know it was a race 
No one said, Get set! Every day I wake up to pictures of your face 
Youre more than an obsession, youre an acquired taste 
Eight seconds of your smile 
Eight seconds of your face 
What a disgrace I walked towards you too late (Chorus) 
And youre so beautiful 
Eight seconds in my life and Ive gone crazy! 
And youre so beautiful 
Eight seconds Ill never see you again Im crazy!
