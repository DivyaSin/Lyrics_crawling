The sky is blue, the grass is brown 
My head is buried inside this helmet 
And the ever present threat of parasites 
So take my hand, let's get these motors running! So you drive red (you drive red) 
And I'll drive black (I'll drive black) 
(We'll see who's machine was most recently serviced) 
We'll slit these rows of Goodyear's like a knife [Repeat: x5] 
We don't fear 
These machines I got the scoop, I got the scoop 
And it doesn't look so good, so good for you So you drive red (you drive red) 
And I'll drive black (I'll drive black) 
(We'll see who's machine was most recently serviced) 
We'll slit these rows of Goodyear's like a knife 
Like a knife, like a knife, yeah 
We'll slit these rows of Goodyear's like a knife So you drive red (you drive red) 
And I'll drive black (I'll drive black) 
(We'll see who's machine was most recently serviced) 
We'll slit these rows of Goodyear's like a knife.
