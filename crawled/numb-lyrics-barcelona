When I woke up, I couldn't feel my arms 
They felt as if they weren't my own 
I don't remember if I really slept at all 
I might have been out building walls How can I stand and hold up this great wall 
And if it falls then I might blow away 
What's wrong, can't he see how hard I've tried? 
I'm numb inside, I'm done tonight This morning found me out of action and alone 
I'd lost command of all I thought I owned 
My friends all called me to make sure I was well 
But I never made it to my phone How can I stand and hold up this great wall 
And if it falls then I might blow away 
What's wrong, can't he see how hard I've tried? 
I'm numb inside, I'm done tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah All this potential has messed up my whole day 
A storm of times and overlapping things 
This information has left me overwhelmed 
I've no idea where I should go How can I stand and hold up this great wall 
If it falls and I might blow away 
What's wrong, can't he see how hard I've tried? 
I'm done tonight
