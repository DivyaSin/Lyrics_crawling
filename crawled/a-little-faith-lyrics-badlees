Martha's wearing blue jeans 
And she's praying for the poor 
Two midgets shop for Halloween 
At a Salvation Army store 
And a widow with a quarter 
Buys herself a plastic ring 
A little faith is a precious thing Santa in December 
The circus in July 
The fat man he has mouths to feed 
Just like you and I 
And a family of agnostics 
Attends a christening 
A little faith is a precious thing Tonight meet me at the graveyard 
Up on Teaberry Hill 
We'll lie upon the ground and dream 
Where truth and superstition 
Are just a reasoning away 
And nothing is ever as it seems Like a seed that grows 
'Neath fallen leaves 
She wouldn't let them keep her down 
Left her parents home 
Moved to the country 
Now her children play in the backyard 
Near where the cooling towers steam 
A little faith is a precious thing
