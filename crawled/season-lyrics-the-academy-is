Wake up think fast, 
Three weeks have passed. 
We are changing. 
No sleep, no gas, 
No excuses will pass these lips 
Because were shapin' up to be all you wish you could have been 
To write the hits and to turn their heads and to open eyes (open your eyes) 
To a brand new season, a brand new season. So show me something we haven't heard yet, 
But I'm not convinced and your hopeless songs won't stick. 
But I, I'll sing you something you won't forget for the first time 
I know this is now who I am. Wake up think fast three weeks have passed these lips
