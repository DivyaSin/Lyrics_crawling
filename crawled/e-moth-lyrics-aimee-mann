The moth don't care when he sees the flame 
he might get burned but he's in the game 
and once he's in he can't go back, and 
beat his wings 'til he burns them black 
no the moth don't care when he sees the flame 
no the moth don't care when he sees the flame the moth don't care if the flame is real 
'cause flame and moth got a sweetheart deal 
and nothing fuels a good flirtation 
like need and anger and desperation 
no the moth don't care if the flame is real 
no the moth don't care if the flame is real So come on let's go ready or not 
'cause there's a flame I know hotter than hot 
and with a fuse that's so thoroughly shot 
away the moth don't care if the flame burns low 
'cause moth believes in an afterglow 
and flames are never douzed completely 
all you really need is a love of heat 
no, the moth don't care if the flame burns low 
no, the moth don't care if the flame burns low
