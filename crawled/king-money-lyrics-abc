Not what you are, 
But what you've earned 
Where Jack-Queen-King 
Money's concerned 
A friend in need is a friend in debt 
That kinda friend king money can forget. 
May those that are full get struck dumb 
When they tell the hungry of the good times 
to come, 
More money than sense in their defence 
And cheaper jokes at our expense 
So if your king is money 
Then I feel sorry for you 
And if you think that it's funny 
Then maybe you do... 
Maybe you do King Money 
King Money, King Money 
The Midas touch doesn't mean 
That much until you're crippled with greed, 
Using gold as a crutch or half a man 
For half a crown for half a kingdom 
For half a town 
No geldt-in-my-pelt-jack, 
No cash in my shack so tell me the things 
That you think I lack 
Just what kinda price are you willing to pay 
For a holiday from the Royal Tourniquet 
So if your king is money 
Then I feel sorry for you 
And if you think that it's funny 
Then maybe you do... 
Maybe you do King Money 
King Money, King Money 
Standing by the Xerox machine 
I want to duplicate some money 
Build a fortune up in black and white 
But I'll need a master copy. 
You're gonna give your love to me 
Shake an apple off the apple tree 
When she moves it's poetry 
Come to me now, one, two, three 
King Ka 
King Ka 
King King Money 
Plan the perfect double murder 
Maybe win the pools when I get some money 
Honey, I'll be knee high in consumer 
durables 
Adorables...
