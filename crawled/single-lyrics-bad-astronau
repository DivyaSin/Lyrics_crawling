Day one just starting to make it my obsession 4 AM, 
two stars, drunk in hell, waiting for sun. 
Day two I call you by mistake 
"Hello, how are you, I'm fine, I miss you too" 
You don't give a shit 
Thers's another town to hit 
There's another girl, she'll surely 
destroy my world 
A single good morning, a well good night 
An overture's ending as curtains rise 
Pay the bail again 
Pay the man at the front just for the memories 
Time to crash on the long drive 
see old friends and tell them how I died 
Some small words say you're alive 
A thinly veiled disguise 
They see that look in your eyes 
A single good evening, a well goodbye 
The worst of intentions or wasted lives 
A sentence, a segue, falling by the wayside 
I'm not the one who wanted this Goodnight 
kiss doesn't feel the same in long distance 
Goodbye kiss doesn't feel the same 
Goodbye kiss doesn't feel the same 
Goodbye kiss doesn't feel the same at all
