I work at the Big Star on old 405 
I make 6 bucks an hour 
And I work steady nights 
Well it might not be much 
But it's all I need 
In that little glass booth 
In that highway to dreams I was not that good of a student at school 
But this life taught me lessons 
That made me no fool 
Oh my mom and dad raised me 
By that golden rule 
In a world that gets ruthless 
A world that gets cruel Filler' up 
Let me check your oil sir 
Cash or card 
Let me get your change 
Just turn right 
When you see that big church sign 
Just go straight 
And you'll be on your way I had me a girl once 
And my ring she wore 
But her father said she 
Could not see me no more 
Oh I know it'd be different 
If I weren't so poor 
So I'm writing these songs 
Trying to open some doors
