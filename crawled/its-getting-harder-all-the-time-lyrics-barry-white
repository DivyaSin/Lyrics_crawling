Can I share this with you? 
Baby you know imagination is really funny 
Sometimes it's very hard to do, it's impossible 
Many nights and days I've, I've tried to imagine 
What it would be like to love you, 
I've even tried to imagine what you would look like 
Being loved, and I, I, I can't do it 
I'm trying to do what a gentleman would do 
Trying to be patient and tolerant 
All the things that a man is supposed to be but 
I just wanted you to know very honestly 
That I'm very anxious to be with you It's getting harder all the time, 
Just to keep myself from wanting you 
Harder every day for me to stay away 
Knowing girl without your loving 
I ain't worth one dime 
It's getting harder, harder all the time 
All the time, it's getting hard every night 
Yes to keep my hands from touching you 
Oh Darling, once I do and I hear you sigh, 
I might as well kiss my poor heart goodbye 
Ain't it just a crime, it's getting harder, harder all the time 
All the time. There's no fighting what I feel, 
Though God knows I've tried. 
Tried to hold back my love for you 
Is like trying to hold back the tide. 
It's getting harder, harder, harder all the time 
I can't stop needing you. 
Harder every day for me to find a way to keep myself 
From the tenderness of your lips touching mine. 
It's getting harder, harder all the time 
All the time. 
I ain't worth a dime, it's getting harder, harder all the time 
Harder, harder all the time.
