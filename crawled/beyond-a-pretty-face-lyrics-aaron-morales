She looks like a dream in anything 
She's the queen of the global social scene 
From Hollywood to around the world 
She's done it all man, she's my kind of girl Her image 
Caught in time 
Frozen moments through the lens of a public eye 
That vision 
Of beauty, style and grace 
She's living dreams that few will dare to chase 
Beyond a pretty face Photo shoots for the magazines 
Cover by cover, she's achieving all her dreams 
She gives it all to make her way 
Perfect ten, man, nothing more to say Her image 
Caught in time 
Frozen moments through the lens of a public eye 
That vision 
Of beauty, style and grace 
She's living dreams that few will dare to chase 
Beyond a pretty face
