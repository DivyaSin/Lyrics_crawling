Came to a point, do I laugh or cry? 
Came to a point, do I quit or do I try? 
I called out, do you even exist? 
Why do you ask, came a voice from the missed Life's just begun 
California son 
Just have some fun 
California son 
Fun in the sun 
California son 
Go have some fun 
California son 
Life should be fun I asked a priest about the mystery 
Why this heart of darkness consumes me 
Merciful mother, the misery 
What have I done that he'd forsake me?
