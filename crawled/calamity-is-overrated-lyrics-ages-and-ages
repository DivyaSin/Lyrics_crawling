Through the flurry I saw trouble come 
Then the smoke that rose like signals 
Telling me something was off 
You can wait around however 
Long it takes to see so for yourself 
Or gather what you want and come along 'Cause a pause is the only time it takes 
For them to get a jump on us, woah 
So if you're staying in, you'd best be braced 
But if you're coming out then let's just go But I can see an opening from here 
And the the sound of so many voices 
Making the rest disappear 
'Cause everything that came before this serves no purpose 
Let's get one thing straight 
Our past is in the ashes, are we clear? 'Cause where we were there was no cause, woah 
Worthy of a sacrifice, woah 
I tell you that there's still hope now, yeah 
But it was never there, so here we go, woah woah woah Woah, woah woah woah 
Woah, woah woah woah 
Woah, woah woah woah Free from the undertow 
I ain't ever gonna go down 
Free from the undertow 
I ain't ever gonna go down Free from the undertow 
I ain't ever gonna go down 
Free from the undertow 
I ain't ever gonna go down
