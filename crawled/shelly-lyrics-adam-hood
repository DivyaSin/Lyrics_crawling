The cafe on the avenue 
We shared a seat for two for the first time 
And inspite of all our chemistry 
You left me in a mystery 
And i dont know why So,Shelly won't you call 
Shelly won't you call 
Shelly won't you call 
When you get home I hoped that i would hear from you 
At least every week or two 
Its been awhile 
And baby it hurts to know 
Sometimes you got to let it go 
When love runs out of time Its been such a long time since my phone quit ringing 
Guess i gotta let you go 
Cause your sailing your ship and baby im sinking 
And i dont want to sink no more
