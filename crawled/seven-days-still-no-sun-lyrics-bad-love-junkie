Seven days & still no sun 
And there's nothing to be done 
The dark days have come calling 
I know that you don't understand 
You think of me as your superman 
This super hero is free falling Oh I don't need this now 
Oh I don't need this 
I don't need this now I hate the place in the space between 
The laughter and the tears 
I flicker on & then off again 
Like some hologram 
Which is all I really am 
Just watch me as I fade away Seven days & still no sun 
Seven days & still not done 
The dark days have com calling Oh I don't need this now 
Oh I don't need this 
I don't need this now I hate the place in the space between 
The laughter and the tears 
I flicker on & then off again 
Like some hologram 
Which is all I really am 
Just watch me as I fade away
