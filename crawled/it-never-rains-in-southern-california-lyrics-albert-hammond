Got on board a westbound 747 
Didn't think before deciding what to do 
Oh, they talk of opportunities 
TV breaks and movies 
Rang true, sure rang true Seems it never rains in southern California 
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before 
It never rains in California 
But girl don't they warn ya 
It pours, man it pours Out of work, I'm out of my head 
Out of self respect, I'm out of bread 
I'm under loved, I'm underfed, I wanna go home 
It never rains in California 
But girl don't they warn ya 
It pours, man it pours Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it 
Had offers but don't know which one to take 
Please don't tell 'em how ya found me 
Don't tell 'em how ya found me 
Gimme a break, give me a break
