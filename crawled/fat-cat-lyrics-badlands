Welfare, move instead 
Tell'm that she can't go on 
Sad time, won't leave 
Feels that ya can't go on 
You save your Johnny child 
In this troubled world 
Better hold on to love 
Stealin' time don't look behind 
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out 
Before you drop now 
Money man, said he's got the plan 
Fat cat watches his stuff 
Crawl the ladder, always gettin' fatter 
Feel that ya can't go on 
You save your Johnny child 
From his troubled world 
Better hold on to love 
Stealin' time, tryin' to wait in line 
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out 
hahahaha, ha 
Get on out, boy before ya drop 
Woo hoo 
Yeah 
Still alone, untimely 
One time that you feared 
Still wanting and tired of love 
Feel that ya can't go on 
You save your Johnny child 
In this troubled world 
Better hold on to love 
Stealin' time 
Still I wait in line 
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out 
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out 
Money bleeds 
Crazy world 
Yeah, yeah 
Woo hoo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Aw hoo!
