It's been a while 
How have you been 
It's really good you know 
To see you again 
You'd think by now 
Those old feelings had died 
But it only takes 
Just one look in your eyes And it's all I can do 
To talk about the weather 
To keep myself together 
When I'm fallin' apart 
And it's all I can do 
To smile and say I'm fine 
When I'm really losin' my mind 
It's all I can do (all I can do) 
To keep this heart from 
Just breaking in two To see the lips 
I used to kiss 
Doesn't make it easy 
To just stand here like this 
I get to thinkin' 
I'm doin' all right 
Then I see the arms 
That once held me so tight And it's all I can do 
To talk about the weather 
To keep myself together 
When I'm fallin' apart 
And it's all I can do 
To smile and say I'm fine 
When I'm really losin' my mind 
It's all I can do (all I can do) 
It's all I can do 
To keep this heart from 
Just breaking I-in two
