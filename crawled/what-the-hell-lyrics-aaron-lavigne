I'm gonna go from a whisper to a yell 
What the hell 
Its only half as good without you Missing you to death is only half as good my darling 
Only half as good as it can be 
A thousand words; they fill my book as you appear my darling 
Help me help myself when you're away Missing you this much isn't easy on my blood flow 
Not as easy on this heart as it can be 
A thousand words begin to pour but only you can say it more 
Help me help myself when you're away I'm gonna go from a a whisper to a yell 
WHAT THE HELL 
Its only half as good without you 
Yes, I'm gonna go from a whisper to a yell 
WHAT THE HELL 
Help me help myself 
Help me help myself when you're away Step one. Take it easy. Its easy to do 
Two. Keep thinking of me 
Rinse and repeat those previous two 
It's how I roll. It's what I do to help me help myself when you're away 
So, tell me how you feel today Cause I'm gonna go from a a whisper to a yell 
WHAT THE HELL 
Its only half as good without you babe 
Yes, I'm... I'm gonna go from a whisper to a yell 
WHAT THE HELL 
Help me help myself. 
Help me help myself when you're away 
Its only half as good without you
