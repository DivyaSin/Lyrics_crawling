Vanessa: 
I can see the things you're doin' 
And you think that I'm nave 
But when I get the goods on you 
She'll finally believe Candace: 
She says it's all just drama 
But every bubble's got to pop 
She's gonna see just what you're doin' Candace and Vanessa: 
And then you're finally gonna have to stop! 
Don't think you're gonna win this time 
'Cause you better believe I'm gonna drop a dime on you I'll get ya! (yeah) I'll get ya! 
And when I do, you're gonna be 
Busted! (Busted!) Candace: 
I don't wanna put the hurt on you 
But you better believe me Both: 
When I tell you that I finally got the dirt on you 
You're busted (Busted!) Vanessa: 
Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light Both: 
This is how it's gonna be, 
When she finds out that I was always right, 
You're busted! There's a new cop on the beach 
And I'm bringing down the heat My eyes are wide to all your lies 
'Cause you're not that discreet 
And I don't care what you've heard 
'Cause there's one six letter word Vanessa: 
It's gonna set me free Candace: 
Gonna set me free Vanessa: 
It starts with a "B" Candace: 
Starts with a "B"! Both: 
It goes B-U-S-T-E-D! 
You are busted! (Busted!) 
I don't wanna put the hurt on you 
But you better believe me 
When I tell you that I finally got the dirt on you 
(I'll get ya!) 
You're busted (Busted!) (Don't think you're gonna win this time) 
Vanessa: Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light. 
(Drop a dime on you.) Both:

When she finds out that I was always right, 
(I'll get ya! I'll get ya!) You're busted!
