Come in the water 
There ain't nobody else here 
Feel it still when the planes are coming 
I just want to lie here 
Left our homes, left our friends 
Left the wombs we lived in 
Spread out along the road 
And I've been weak 
When my Lord was calling 
The water will take our load On the day that you were born 
Legions laid down their arms 
On the day you lost control 
Legions leapt for your throat Telling me I'm wrong... 
Is the face in the water unmistakable? 
Black's the color of the sea 
When it's free from the light of the sun 
Your crystal ball... 
Your faith in the age of medicine 
And the children are asleep 
With their heads on the butt of a gun 
You put up a wall... 
Keep the bad ones out 
And the good ones in 
Fight the battle on your knees 
Till' the sea swallows everyone Come in the water 
Or is there somewhere you have to go? 
We'll keep a lantern open 
In case you lose your way in the cold On the day that you were born 
Legions laid down their arms 
On the day they found you out 
Left no shadow of a doubt And the children are asleep 
With their heads on the butt of a gun 
Fight the battle on your knees 
Till' the sea swallows everyone
