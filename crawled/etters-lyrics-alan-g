BILLY: 
Dear Tom, It's your Little Bro Billy 
Just wrote to say I miss you so 
And Tom, it's just a little bit silly 
But I've run away, run far from home The whole world just bullies me 
I got hate up to my knees 
And it seems my dream is startin' to fade 
Please write to your Little Bro Billy 
I'm here all alone - and I'm afraid TOM: 
Dear Billy, It's your Big Bro Thomas 
Hello from halfway 'cross the earth 
Like you, I'm keepin' our promise 
To stand up for ways that all have worth And I know it don't seem fair BILLY: Not sure why I did this 
That your brother just ain't there BILLY: I'm still just a kid 
But I understand you're tryin' to be true 
Listen up, my Little Bro Billy 
There're some things we all just gotta do BILLY/TOM: There's one that you find 
BILLY: Knows what to say when the world has kicked you down 
BILLY/TOM: There's one you leave behind 
TOM: That you always worry 'bout a ton 
BILLY/TOM: My brother's always been that one BILLY: Dear Tom, we're livin' in fear now 
TOM: These folks don't feel safe here 
BILLY: I'm hit all the time though I still pray 
TOM: There ain't any hope here 
BILLY: And life - is just pain and tears now 
TOM: The people here hurt too 
BILLY: I cry all the time cuz you're away 
TOM: They cry for their sons, the ones about your age 
BILLY: Classmates' words cut like a knife 
TOM: Boys here hope to have a life 
BILLY: All their hate makes me so mad 
TOM: Don't you see... 
We got much more to do, my Little Bro Billy 
Now get along home and wait for me BILLY/TOM: There's one that you know 
TOM: That you try to change the whole world for 
BILLY/TOM: There's one who will show 
BILLY: The way back home when life has made you run 
BILLY/TOM: My brother's always been that one BILLY: 
Dear Tom, It's your Little Bro Billy 
Just wrote to say thanks, I'm heading home
