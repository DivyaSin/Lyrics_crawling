In the middle of the summer 
I'm not sleeping 
cold wind blowing 
In the middle of the night they 
try to find me but I'm still driving. 
If you're going to San Francisco 
lay some flowers on the grave stone. 
There's music on the station and I'm just listening to cold wind whistling 
and if they ever find me 
tell the papers cold wind cold wind 
cold, cold wind blowing 
cold wind blowing 
Ohhh hey hey hey 
something aint right 
something aint right 
and if they ever find me tell the papers 
cold wind cold wind 
cold, cold wind blowing cold wind blowing cold wind blowing 
cold wind blowing cold wind blowing
