[Intro: Bandit Gang Marco] 
Anyway, anyway, anyway 
Anyway, anyway, bandit! [Verse 1: Bandit Gang Marco] 
Huh, I don't love none of these broads 
Nah, don't hit my line lil nigga, fronted all of them calls 
Bitch I don't give a fuck what you wearing, man, you bout to take all of that off 
Nah, bitch, you ain't done suckin' this dick, man, I gotta get all of these hard 
Nigga still countin' this cash, fuck is you sayin'? Fuck is you sayin'? 
MCM in my bag full of them bands, full of them bands 
Huh, [?] standin', [?] pressure 
Balmain jeans, gotta do a little extra, nigga I ain't stressin', huh 
Sellin' hella drugs, thinkin' bout runnin' my spot 
Lil nigga gon' get ya ass plugged, huh, anyway (anyway), anyway 
Anyway, anyway, been catchin' plays, had to pick and play 
Hahahah, ya dig?! [Hook: Zuse] 
Yeah, a nine for a nine and a toot for a toot 
Money is the root of all evil, are you 
Born to win but built to lose 
Let these muhfuckas know I'm gonna get it anyway, anyway 
Washin' down my sins wit' my fuckin' Hennessy 
I'm gonna get it anyway, anyway 
Always gotta ride on my fuckin' enemy 
I'm gonna get it anyway [Verse 2: Spodee] 
Uh, fuck the enemies on mine 
Got ya ho wit' me ridin' party, next door, she a party to a crime 
MAC-11, not a nine, you will not be doing fine 
Cut off his eyelids to send a message to the muthafuckas that's blind 
Every summer, I'mma shine, Ferragamo wit' the sign 
California for the gas, Arizona for the pine 
Mamacita wit' the eye, margarita wit' the lime 
I know they say that beauty skin deep but I just wanna get inside 
I remember pimp didn't have a pot to piss in 
Now my opposition just a box of fishes 
Now they coppin' tickets just to watch and listen 
Now my awesome vision to the boss and bitches 
Gotta watch for snitches, it's a cold game 
Fuck a piece, I want the whole thing 
Got my nigga wit' me on the private jet 
Call that mothafucka Soul Plane [Hook] [Verse 3: Zuse] 
Anyway, let these niggas know I'm a fuckin' renegade 
If you take a shot, boy, you gon' fade away 
Yeah, my head hot and I don't want no lemonade 
Catch you on the block--brrr!--wit' that pepper spray 
And my bomb detonate, pussy nigga, you ain't safe 
Catch a body, not a case, me and Spodee in the race 
While ya ho give me the face, blowin' best by the 8 [Extended Hook: Zuse] 
Yeah, a nine for a nine and a toot for a toot 
Money is the root of all evil, are you 
Born to win but built to lose 
Let these muhfuckas know I'm gonna get it anyway, anyway 
Washin' down my sins wit' my fuckin' Hennessy 
I'm gonna get it anyway, anyway 
Always gotta ride on my fuckin' enemy 
I'm gonna get it anyway, anyway 
I'm gonna get it anyway, anyway 
Always gotta ride on my fuckin' enemy
