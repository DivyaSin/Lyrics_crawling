Listen I don't have to say it 
Just listen 
To the words that we just don't say right now 
I really wanna love but I don't know how 
Van't you hear out it's playing 
Like guitars with broken strings 
There's never any harmony 
Don't cry 
We both know the sounds of a long goodbye The truth is that it 
Never should've gone this far 
And it never would've been this hard I 
I don't want play this song 
But I was never in love CHORUS: 
Now it's all out of tune 
Between me and you 
Can't you hear the music 
I'll be leaving soon 
Cos it's all out of tune 
Can't you hear the lyrics 
The words and melodies 
They're sharp and cut to deep 
The sound is piercing And the song keep playing 
Your heart keeps breaking 
And I can't take it 
The song's still playing 
But we're all out of tune I'll say it cause it painful to just 
Replay this 
I don't wanna break your heart no more 
But I can never give you what you're asking for 
See you have never done me wrong 
To leave a good man is hard 
It's harder if we stay here and we 
Just deny 
We can't be together and we both know why The truth is that it 
Never should've gone this far 
And it never would've been this hard I 
I don't want play this song 
But I was never in love [CHORUS] And the song keep playing 
Your heart keeps breaking 
And I can't take it 
The song's still playing 
But we're all out of tune See I don't really wanna sing this part 
But all I wanna do is make it stop 
But the song plays on 
The song plays on and on and on and on... [CHORUS] And the song keep playing 
Your heart keeps breaking 
And I can't take it 
The song's still playing 
But we're all out of tune
