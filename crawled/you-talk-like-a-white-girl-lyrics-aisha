Chorus: You talk 
Like a white girl 
Do you think 
That you're white, girl 
A line some drew in the sand 
Some will call you an Uncle Tom 
If you support Uncle Sam Verse 1: Ebonix or Hooked On Phonics 
Take your pick 
But they'll call you a city slicker or a hick 
Yea, I know I'm black 
But must every other word be homey or wack 
There was a time when slaves couldn't read or write 
But now you're sitting here telling me it's alright 
To talk like a clown 
To prove your down 
Speaking that gibberish to anyone around 
Some will see it as buffoonery 
An inarticulate form of cartoonery 
Your intellect will be hidden 
Beneath your words 
And when you speak 
You will not be heard 
Fraternized or patronized 
Until the day you realize 
Slang is fine 
But not all the time Repeat chorus Verse 2: Hey, what can I say 
I never felt comfortable speaking that way 
You brag that you're from the hood 
And how living there is supposed to be so good 
But you never hear anyone say 
I'm saving up to move to the ghetto one day 
Most people in the ghetto want something better out of life 
Rather than to be saddled with crime and strife 
You keep listening to rappers 
Telling you what black is 
When they've made millions and left the ghetto off the biz 
They're living in the suburbs that's mostly white 
But they're sitting there telling you "be real" and "dynomite" 
That's like telling an unmarried woman about your wedding day 
Or telling somebody on a diet about a buffet 
You ought to think about that 
Being black is not about the clothes on your back 
Its not about every other word being homey or wack 
Or walking with a swagger 
Or getting drunk until you stagger 
You're born black 
It's not something you acquire 
It's not about your words or your attire Repeat chorus twice
