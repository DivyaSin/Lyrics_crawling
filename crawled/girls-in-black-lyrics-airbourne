In the smoke and the red 
Workin' the late night sweat 
You're the one to go to 
When I wanna forget Like hangin' off the moon 
I don't wanna come down 
Yeah, you get me so high 
It's hell on the ground Just one little glass 
Makes the night go fast 
And you can have what you want 
If you pay the girl cash I said, girls 
Girls in black 
Ooh, I said, girls 
Girls in black, ooh yeah You're the hot bright neon 
In the cold dark night 
When I'm feelin' down 
You make me feel so right Yeah, your bait comes free 
But your hooks cut deep 
Ooh, you make the bad boys smile 
And you make the good boys weep Just one little glass 
Makes the night go fast 
And you can have what you want 
If you pay the girl cash I said, girls 
Girls in black 
Ooh, I said, girls 
Girls in black Ooh, I said, girls 
Girls in black 
Ooh, I said, girls 
Girls in black, oh yeah Ooh yeah, just one little glass 
Makes the night go fast 
Ooh, you can have what you want 
If you pay the girl cash I said, girls 
Girls in black 
Ooh, I said, girls 
Girls in black Ooh, I said, girls 
Girls in black 
Ooh, I said, girls 
Girls in black, oh yeah
