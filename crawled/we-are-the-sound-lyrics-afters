We are the sound 
We are the sound Now is the time we have 
Take it, never give it back 
Say what you mean to say 
This could be your only chance Everybody's watching out 
For someone who can show them how 
To be what you wanna be 
And stand never backing down Here we are 
Here we are We are the sound 
We are the siren 
We're all around 
And we won't stop singing it out Shout it out like you believe it 
We'll break it down 
When we all start singing it out 
Shout it out now Silence is an enemy 
That keeps us from the things we need 
It ages but it never grows 
So quiet that we start to bleed Let's shake it off and let it go 
Forgetting what we think we know 
We'll make it all a memory 
We're taking back control Here we are 
Here we are We are the sound 
We are the siren 
We're all around 
And we won't stop singing it out Shout it out like you believe it 
We'll break it down 
When we all start singing it out 
Shout it out now, shout it out now We are the sound 
We are the sound 
We are the sound 
We are the sound We are the sound 
We are the siren 
We're all around 
And we won't stop singing it out Shout it out like you believe it 
We'll break it down 
When we all start singing it out 
Shout it out now, shout it out now We are the sound 
We are the sound 
We are the sound 
We are the sound
