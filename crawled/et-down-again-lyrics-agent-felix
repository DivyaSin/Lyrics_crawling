how could this be after all you promised me 
my everything and I let you in so 
don't expect me to turn my cheek again 
last time you broke the skin 
nothing ever works out right so why would it now 
my hopes get up so high they fall and shatter 
and shatter with what's left of confidence so here I am 
locked away in a perfect dream 
take a look around I have everything 
and the more I stare 
the more I feel so empty 
cause soon I'll wake up with nothing 
its just a dream 
I can't bring any of it back with me 
(go back to sleep) cut out my eyes before they tell my mind 
what they just saw 
I'd rather be naive 
so lets play pretend and I'll believe in anything so here I am 
locked away in a perfect dream 
I take a look around I see I have everything 
and the more I stare 
the more I feel so empty 
cause soon I'll wake up with nothing 
I swear this time I will not be fooled 
if it is too good it is not true 
you broke the branch 
and your falling down 
but no one's waiting for you on the ground 
to break your fall
