Loving you is like staring in the sun 
The more I try, the faster the tears run 
Never been burned so bad by anyone 
Loving you, is like staring in the sun Lonesome, broken, and blue 
Is how you left this heart that loved you so true 
Might've broke it soft and slow 
(Now all that's left feeds the crows) 
I've been holding on 
But honey I'm just too 
Lonesome, broken, and blue Lettin' go is like putting hot iron to the wound 
It hurts like hell 
But it's something you gotta do 
It's hard to believe a hurt like this 
Could be good for you 
Lettin' go is like putting hot iron to the wound Lonesome, broken, and blue 
Is how you left this heart that loved you so true 
Might've broke it soft and slow 
(Now all that's left feeds the crows) 
I've been holding on, but honey 
Holding on, but honey 
I've been holding on 
But honey I'm just too 
Lonesome, broken, and blue
