There's a fire beneath my skin 
There's a fever that makes me ill 
Got a love, a love that kills 
I've got twenty four hours to live Comeback, I'm begging you please 
Comeback, I'm down on my knees 
Comeback, I'm begging you please I don't know why and I don't understand 
How you sold me down the river 
I don't know why 
I don't understand 
How you sold me down the river 
Sold me down the river There's a rose across my chest 
Got your name written on it 
Love's the drug that I live by 
Give me a shot before I die Comeback, I'm begging you please 
Comeback, I'm down on my knees 
Comeback, I'm begging you please I don't know why 
I don't understand 
How you sold me down the river 
I don't know why 
I don't understand 
How you sold me down the river 
Sold me down the river Sold me down the river tonight 
Who who 
I've got twenty four hours I don't know why 
I don't understand 
How you sold me down the river 
I don't know why 
I don't understand 
How you sold me down the river 
Sold me down the river All right Sold me 
Sold me 
Sold me down the river Sold me 
Sold me 
Sold me down the river I don't know why 
I don't understand 
How you sold me down the river 
I don't know why 
I don't understand 
How you sold me down the river 
Sold me down the river 
Sold me down the river 
Sold me down the river
