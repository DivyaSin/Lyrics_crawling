Through the darkness cuts the morning sun 
Time to focus, time to fly 
Return to face the day with our heads untied 
Watching all the pieces come undone Obscure the darkness, ignore the rain 
Sitting in the cheap seats on a morning train 
Crowds of faces on a one way ride 
We're all smiles on the surface but we're dying inside It's when she 
Saves me, makes me, rolls me over when she 
Shakes me, and wakes me, all the fires come to life 
Breathes me, and frees me, turns me over when she 
Needs me, completes me, cuts the darkness like a knife Grab a taxi, pay the jacked up fare 
Driving like a race car but he just don't care 
Precious memories, we just cast them aside 
We're all smiles on the surface but we're sad inside It's when she 
Saves me, makes me, rolls me over when she 
Shakes me, and wakes me all the fires come to life 
Breathes me, and frees me, turns me over when she 
Needs me, completes me, through the darkness shines a light Sometimes we feel like an ocean 
Unbroken, dreams of what we're meant to be 
Sometimes we capture the moment 
Can't control it, then we live And then she 
Saves me, makes me, rolls me over when she 
Shakes me, and wakes me all the fires come to life 
Breathes me, and frees me, turns me over when she 
Needs me, completes me, cuts the darkness like a knife Saves me, makes me, rolls me over when she 
Shakes me, and wakes me all the fires come to life 
Breathes me, and frees me, turns me over when she 
Needs me, completes me, through the darkness shines a light
