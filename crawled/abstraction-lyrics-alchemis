Help me, I am watching atomic warfare from the safety of the moon 
I am dancing sacrilegiously o' the sound of infectious tunes 
There is no sunset, is no sunrise, things on earth don't seem as they are 
The opal planet I once called home is now revolving a dying star Strange, awakening from cryonic sleep, I vacate my homely hemisphere 
My soul travels on turbulent thoughts whilst my innards remain here 
I feel pity for the ignorant one who leaves the egg but the shell remains 
The severance of umbilical ties multiples his deepest pains Through the eyes in my head I hear the purple flower's scent 
Casting shadows in the shade, lusting for the gates of jade 
Through hallucinative wealth I cannot comprehend myself Sterility, fertility, the life that dwells inside of me 
I often stop to wonder whilst gazing to the sky 
Is there life beyond the quasars, will I find out when I die? 
Is there a being out there who gaze into the night 
And see our burning star as a tiny spark of light?
