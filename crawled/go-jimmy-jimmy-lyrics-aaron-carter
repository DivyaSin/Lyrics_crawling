It's the kids baby, It's the kids baby

And you know I'm coming through 
It's the kids baby, It's the kids baby

It's the kids baby, Leave it up 
Leave it up to me Leave it up to the kids grown-ups own up 
Even when they mess up acting like 
It's all sewn up, mom and dad think 
We need to have a talk 
Let the kids rule the world 
Boys and girls, you can't blame us for 
Nada, you taught us to follow orders 
'Cause I'm the baby (done da da) 
Monkey see (ah ah) monkey do no more 
The puck stops here what's the score 
We might start a play fight just to 
Imitate you, don't you feel silly 
Now shame on you, don't start to cry 
No I don't blame you, after all you're 
Just a grown up, watch gonna do? Yo, It's the kids (keep it locked up) 
Got to heat it up, heat it up 
What's the deal (what do you want, 
Got to give it up, give it up) 
Make way (put it on 
Gonna hook it up, hook it up) 
How's that (leave it up 
Leave it up to me) 
Yo, It's the kids (I can do it if I 
Speed it up, speed it up) 
What, what (set it off 
Gonna live it up, live it up) 
Make way (put it on 
Gonna hook it up, hook it up) 
And how's that (leave it up 
Leave it up to me) When the gown-ups go AWOL 
Nothin's gonna fall, here com the 
Young ones, the baby crime busters 
Big people listen up, relax now 
We're equal and if the money's right 
Then we might make a sequel 
Do I hear a please 
I love it when you beg me 
I need a bribe now just to 
Move me light speed 
And I might fit you in if you make way 
So let me talk to my people 
We could save the day Yo, It's the kids (keep it locked up) 
Got to heat it up, heat it up 
What's the deal (what you want,

Mom and day they'll be getting 
On my nerves, workin' 'em 
Workin' 'em, is that what I deserve 
But after many days, hey 
I want them back tell me who's gonna 
Bake my cake and all that 
Who's gonna suffer from 
My practical jokes and listen when 
I moan, hey, it's gotta be my folks 
And who's gonna get me up 
Ready for the flight and who's gonna 
Tell me everything's all right 
But wait a minute, that sounded so soft 
That won't impress a hot chick 
Like Lara Croft, don't play me out 
'Cause I'll switch you off, you'll be 
Too old for too long, singing 
The same song, if you're old enough 
To vote, then it's time to sit down 
It's all about the little homies 
Taking the crown, so if you're 
Too young to vote, here's your chance 
To have a say, c'mon everybody 
Help me save the day Yo, It's the kids (keep it locked up) 
Got to heat it up, heat it up 
What's the deal (what you want, 
Got to give it up, give it up) 
Make way (put it on 
Gonna hook it up, hook it up) 
How's that (leave it up 
Leave it up to me)

Speed it up, speed it up)
