Baby talk baby talk to me 
Baby walk baby walk with me 
If you're gonna hide away from everyone 
By the way, can I come 
Don't let go 
Keep a hold of me 
Don't let go 
Get a grip of me 
Baby baby let's have a little fun 
Come on baby take a walk in the sun 
If I wander will you tie me down 
Don't want to play around 
It's the way that I want it to be 
You won't find another fool like me 
Baby baby can you understand 
Girl you've got me in your hand
