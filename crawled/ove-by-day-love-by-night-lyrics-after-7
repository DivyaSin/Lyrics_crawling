Oh baby 
If I could touch it 
I'd make you proud 
I would do anything, to make you my lady now 
I wouldn't hurt it baby 
Won't let you down 
And once I get in it 
You'll never want to let me out babe Here it comes 
So brace yourself baby 
And let it flow 
All through you and me 
I'll make you love, love so deep 
Here's what will happen when you get with me

Love nice and slow baby, won't let you go 
Love you by day, love you by night 
Love lets you know, baby, when your love (hook) If I could hold you baby, hold you real tight 
I would relax you girl, make you 
Feel extra nice (make you feel extra nice)

Give you my love, my all and all and then I'd lose control Here we go, so ask yourself baby 
Then let me know is this what you need 
And can you love me baby, love so sweet
