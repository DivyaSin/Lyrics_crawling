The light of my future is dimming 
Because of my childish love, I lost my way on a path of dream 
The venom of my ambition, I sharpened my knife every day 
But because of my uncontrollable greed, 
My knife became dull 
I know it all 
This love is another name for the devil 
Don't hold her hand 
I shouted but turned away from my conscience 
I feel the sharp reality more every day 
There's red blood from being torn apart by reality 
I never thought that 
The greed would become the trumpet heralding hell 
BreatheMy breath is getting shorter 
I close my eyes every night from twisted realityThe music box of tragedy echoesBut in order to be free from this crimeIt's impossible to forget and give upBecause those lips were too sweetI didn't want to let go of the devil's hand 
Too bad but it's too sweet 
It's too sweet it's too sweet 
Too bad but it's too sweet 
It's too sweet it's too sweet 
Too bad but it's too sweet 
It's too sweet it's too sweet 
Too bad but it's too sweet 
It's too sweet it's too sweet 
It's too evil 
It's too evil 
It's too evil 
Yeah it's evil
