You've got a right to be angry 
You've got a right to complain 
But just being right 
Ain't gonna change anything 
You want understanding 
Without saying a word 
You want admiration 
Even though it's undeserved 
It ain't no secret 
Time took it's toll 
I can't believe it 
We're gettin' old 
One of us should stand up 
One of us should scream 
One of us should step out 
And say just what he means 
One of us should say 
Just what it is we're fighting for 
But no one says nothing much 
Of anything no more 
We all have defenses 
And opinions to sell 
We all have our methods 
Of defending ourselves 
But there's nothing as lifeless 
As a tree that don't bend 
There's nothing as worthless 
As a fair weathered friend 
It ain't no secret 
Time took it's toll 
I can't believe it 
We're gettin' old 
One of us should get up 
One of us should say 
One of us should get out 
Of the other one's way 
One of us should face up 
To what no one can ignore 
But no one does nothing much 
Of anything no more 
I am he as you are he 
As you are me, but we just disagree 
Now I ain't anything 
And it's a world full of anger 
It's a world full of pain 
It's a world full of people 
Lookin' for someone else to blame 
But it don't make no difference 
If it don't make no sense 
'Cause the world goes on a changing 
With or without our consent 
It ain't no secret 
Time took it's toll 
I can't believe it 
We're gettin' old 
If one of us was angry 
If one of us was sad 
If one of us was guilty 
It might not be that bad 
If one of us was anything 
We might know something more 
But no one is nothing much 
Of anything no more
