Look how the light in the morning lies 
Please say no more, I see it's time 
10 thousand tears 'til I dry my eyes 
A million more is what you're hoping for 
Or is it love what you had in mind. Follow the song of the Summer sun 
Wander with me where you go 
10 thousand dreams, I know every one 
A million more is what I'm hoping for 
Or is it love what we live to know. Where were you when you were young 
Did you hide beside whoever tried to please you 
Where were you when you were young 
Did you have eyes just to ignore me 
Or were you looking for me 
And tell me. How long before you believe me 
The Summer sun still loves the rain 
10 thousand times you may leave me 
A million more is what I'm hoping 
Or doesn't love bring you home again.
