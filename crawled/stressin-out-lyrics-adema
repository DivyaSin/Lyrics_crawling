The weight of the world has been put on my shoulders 
I looked in the mirror and know that I'm older 
I try to escape but the rain makes it colder 
Why do I let all our problems take over? 
There's nothing I can do 
There's nothing I can say 
We need to try to find a right way 
Stress me out, stress me out 
God has turned his back on me 
Stress me out, stress me out 
There's nothing there for us to say 
Stress me out, stress me out 
God has turned his back 
Stress me out, stress me out 
There's nothing there to bleed 
To blame 
I try to explain what it's doing to me 
Arguing over the simplest things 
You try to make life how you want it to be 
Upset everyday isn't something we need 
There's nothing I can do 
There's nothing I can say 
We need to try to find a right way 
Stress me out, stress me out 
God has turned his back on me 
Stress me out, stress me out 
There's nothing there for us to say 
Stress me out, stress me out 
God has turned his back 
Stress me out, stress me out 
There's nothing there to bleed 
You're letting me down again 
You're letting me down again 
You're letting me down again 
Letting me down again 
There's nothing I can do 
There's nothing I can say 
We need to try to find a right way 
Stressin' Out, Stressin' Out 
God has turned his back on me 
Stressin' Out, Stressin' Out 
There's nothing there for us to say 
Stressin' Out, Stressin' Out 
God has turned his back 
Stressin' Out, Stressin' Out 
I cannot change the fact 
Stressin' Out, Stressin' Out 
God has turned his back 
Stressin' Out, Stressin' Out 
I cannot change the fact 
Stressin' Out, Stressin' Out 
God has turned his back 
Stressin' Out, Stressin' Out 
God has turned his back
