We are, we are the champions, 
We are, we are fabulous, 
We are, we're so high. We have been through this far, 
There are a lot of of hurdles and hurdles and hurdles, 
We through so calm, 
We have been under a run, 
Driving in the sun, 
It was so fun. There was one time we used to fall down, 
But we just don't give it up, 
We don't give up, 
Now sing with me lalalalalala, 
Here we are today to pile the rhymes. Look where are we now, 
We're on top of the sky of the of the sky, 
The shiny sky, 
Don't talk like a moron, 
Because we are today, 
The number one.
