Finished with the old, here comes the new 
Years we've had these plans we've worked out what to do 
Hand me my guitar goodbye blues 
Take it easy brother I'll be home soon I'm falling all alone without a parachute, without a parachute 
I'm falling all alone without a parachute, without a parachute I made a resolution with my friends 
But now I messed it up cause now I'm smoking again 
But I kind of understand where it's all coming from 
From being so stressed out and being far from home Our clocks tick by with feel 
And I feel I'm falling all alone without a parachute, without a parachute 
I'm falling all alone without a parachute, without a parachute I'll chase these, i'll chase these dreams 
I'll make these memories I'm falling all alone without a parachute, without a parachute 
I'm falling all alone I'm falling all alone without a parachute, without a parachute 
I'm falling all alone without a parachute, without a parachute
