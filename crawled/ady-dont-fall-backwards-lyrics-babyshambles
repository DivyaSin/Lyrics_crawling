Once upon a time 
Once upon a time 
When the cold wind that blows 
When the cold wind that blows in my heart 
It was a summer breeze 
And she would meet me 
In Chinatown for opium and tea 
And she always brought me flowers 
Oh, but I spared you those old ballads 
All the songs I couldn't play 
But every giro day 
Where you'd dress me like a ladyboy 
And take me high out of the way 
And let the horse chase the new deal away 
No if we make love in the morning 
Oh, don't my eyes look like two marbles in my head But Lady don't you fall backwards 
Come on fall into my arms 
And don't you fall backwards 
I wouldn't want for you to come to any harm 
And tell me if the darkness comes 
I will sing you a song 
And I'll love you forever 
Till the morning comes 
But don't you fall backwards 
Come on and fall into my arms
