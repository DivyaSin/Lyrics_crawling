I'm tired 
Of hoping and waiting and anticipating to see her there 
I work out, the cure is to ask her if she'll clear up disaster 
Sit and stare Whats the worst that you could do or say? 
Another chance is gone, of mine away I wonder 
Will I always be that taken? 
I never 
Ask anything from anyone 
Just another lonely kid, 
Nothing to hold onto 
Nothing to hold onto You've waited, its wasted, its hopeless, its too late, you fucked up, your chance is gone 
You've waited, to take it, the risks were to high to explain, your chance is gone, gone, gone whats the point when your future moves so fast? 
now you'll regret this opportunity you could've have I wonder 
Will I always be that taken? 
I never 
Ask anything from anyone 
Just another nameless band 
With no hope to hold onto 
Hold onto Let's Go I wonder 
Will I always be that taken? 
I never 
Ask anything from anyone 
Just another lonely kid 
With nothing to hold onto 
Hold onto
