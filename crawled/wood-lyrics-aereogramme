Made out of wood 
Made out of wood 
Thrown us in highlights 
Made out of wood 
Devince promises 
Taking over my life Think in ways 
To make you whole again 
Think in ways 
To evolve back into themselves 
Into themselves Let go, let go 
Let go, let go 
Let go, let go 
Let go, let go Made out of wood 
Made out of scars 
Burned on the highlights 
Made out of wood 
Devince promises 
Taking over my life Think in ways 
To make you whole again 
Think in ways 
To evolve back into themselves 
Into themselves Let go, let go 
Let go, let go 
Let go, let go 
Let go, let go Let go, let go, let go 
Let go, let go, let go 
Let go, let go, let go 
Let go, let go, let go
