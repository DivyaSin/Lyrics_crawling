Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
It's not warm when she's away 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And she's always gone to long 
Anytime she goes away Wonder this time where she's gone 
Wonder if she's gone to stay 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away I know, I know, I know, I know 
I know, I know, I know, I know 
I know, I know, I know, I know 
I know, I know, I know, I know Gotta leave the young thing alone 
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Only darkness every day 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home Anytime she goes away 
Anytime she goes away 
Anytime she goes away 
Anytime she goes away
