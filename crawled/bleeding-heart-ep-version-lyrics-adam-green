When I wake up in the morning I smell your smell 
God knows that I'm not doing well 
You're my clementine, my sweet sunshine 
A sparkling diamond in your eye Bleeding heart, my bleeding heart 
Won't you cut out my bleeding heart 
Over the mountains by the sea and the shore 
I hope you come knocking at my door Baby baby let's live in a shoe 
And I'll tell you some things that I used to do 
You're a broken book, a thievin' crook 
You stole my heart with just one look Bleeding heart, my bleeding heart 
Won't you cut out my bleeding heart 
Over the mountains by the sea and the shore 
I hope you come knocking at my door You take my stuff and you make me blue 
You've got me so goddamned subdued 
And every day I hope and pray 
You'll stay with me while the skies are grey Bleeding heart, my bleeding heart 
Won't you cut out my bleeding heart 
Over the mountains by the sea and the shore 
I hope you come knocking at my door
