My son, my seed, my name, my need 
Believe, belong, be loved, be strong 
cause everyoneis down on you 
And they'll walk out on you 
Try not to let division overwhelm your trust 
Left out, let down, cast out 
Enough, move on, be proud, endowed 
cause everyone here is down on you 
And they will denigrate your will 
In spite still please 
them til you overwhelm them 
humble everyone 
Minus, Divide, equate each side 
That's all a lie connect, decide 
cause everyone here is down on you 
and they walk out on you 
try not to let it overwhelm you 
Everyone here will complicate your world 
And they'll extract the value 
Try not to, let the problems overwhelm you 
Get over everyone 
My son speed low
