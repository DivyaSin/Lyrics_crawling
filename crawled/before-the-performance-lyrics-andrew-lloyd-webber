(Gustave) 
Ooh (Christine) 
Gustave, could you hand me those earrings 
The diamond ones on the left? 
There, how do I look? (Gustave) 
You look so beautiful 
So very beautiful 
Like a queen in a book (Christine) 
You too are beautiful 
So very beautiful 
Once this performance is through 
We'll spend some time just us two 
Won't that be fun? (Gustave) 
Father, doesn't mother look lovely tonight? (Raoul) 
Indeed she does 
As lovely as she looked the very first time 
I came to her dressing room door (Christine) 
And look at you, Raoul 
Huh? 
You look just like that handsome boy in the opera box 
The one who'd always toss me a single red rose (Raoul) 
Please, Gustave, if you don't mind 
Would you wait outside a while? (Gustave) 
May I go exploring, by myself? (Christine) 
Yes, but stay backstage, my dear 
When I'm finished, meet me here (Gustave) 
I will (Raoul) 
Since our wedding day, things have gone astray 
(Christine) Raoul 
I'm not proud of the way that I've acted 
(Christine) We've both been 
The demands I've made, all the hopes mislaid 
I'm aware of the price they've exacted Though I've no right to ask you to 
There's one thing more I'd have you do 
If you love me as I love you (Christine) Anything, darling 
(Raoul)Don't sing the song, dear 
(Christine) What? 
But, Raoul 
(Raoul) You have to know 
Something's terribly wrong, dear (Christine) But I have to do this 
It's what we agreed to 
(Raoul) That hell-spawn demon 
He's had us playing his game all along, dear 
(Christine) Let me just get through this 
Listen, please, I need to (Raoul) 
You need so much, it's true 
And I've denied you 
You need the man you knew 
Back here beside you You'll have him back, I vow 
Just ask it of me 
But we must leave here now 
If you still love me (Christine) Do you mean it, Raoul, truly? (Raoul) 
I've booked a passage for three 
To Cherbourg on the Atlantic Queen, it leaves in an hour 
We'll have just enough time, I beg you 
Let's be on it for both our sakes 
And the child's Leave this place behind (Phantom) 
He knows his love is not enough 
He knows he isn't what you need 
He knows you're made of finer stuff 
I think on that we're all agreed It's time to leave him in the dust 
It's time to be who you should be 
It's time to do now as you must 
And set the music in you free In moments, mere moments 
Drums will roll 
There you'll stand just like before The crowd will hush 
And then in one sweet rush 
I will hear you sing once more And music, our music 
Will swell and then unwind 
Like two strands of melody at last entwined Fulfill us, complete us 
Make us whole 
Seal our bond forever more Tonight, for me 
Embrace your destiny 
Let me hear you sing once more (Stage) 
Miss Daae, it's time (Christine) 
Twisted every way 
What answer can I give? I know I can't refuse 
And yet I wish I could 
Oh, God (Raoul) 
Christine, Christine 
Don't think that I don't care 
(Phantom) 
But every hope and every prayer 
Rests on you now
