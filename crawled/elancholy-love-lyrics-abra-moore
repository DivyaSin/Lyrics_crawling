Well, I'll meet you in the middle and I'll crawl to the edge 
And I'll stand there forever just to see if I can 
And I'll cry a river as I lay in your bed 'Cause I need you like I need the rain 
And I need you like I need the man 
And I need you like I've never needed anything before 'Cause we're just running wild and young 
It was only just for fun 
This melancholy love Well, I'll see you there in your midtown square 
And I'll see you there and I just won't care 
And I'll hold you down but I'll never let you fall 'Cause we're just running wild and young 
It was only just for fun 
This melancholy love But could you tell me why I feel so sad about it? 
Could you tell me why? Well, I'll meet you in the middle and I'll crawl to the edge 
And I'll stand there forever just to see if I can 
And I'll cry a river as I lay in your bed 'Cause we're just running wild and young 
It was only just for fun 
This melancholy love Yeah, we we're running wild and young 
It was only just for fun, wasn't it? 
This melancholy love Could you tell me why I feel so sad about it? 
Could you tell me why I feel so sad about it? 
Could you tell me why I feel so sad about it? 
Could you tell me why I feel so sad about it? 
Could you tell me why I feel so sad about it?
