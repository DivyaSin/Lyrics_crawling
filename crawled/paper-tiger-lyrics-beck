Just like a paper tiger 
Torn apart by idle hands 
Through the helter skelter morning 
Fix yourself while you still can 
No more ashes to ashes 
No more cinders from the sky 
All the laws of creation 
Tell a dead man how to die O deserts down below us 
And storms up above 
Like a stray dog gone defective 
Like a paper tiger in the sun Looking through a broken diamond 
To make the past what it should be 
Through the ruins and the weather 
Capsized boats in the sea O deserts down below us 
And storms up above 
Like a stray dog gone defective 
Like a paper tiger in the sun We're just holding on to nothing 
To see how long nothing lasts O deserts down below us 
And storms up above 
Like a stray dog gone defective 
Like a paper tiger in the sun
