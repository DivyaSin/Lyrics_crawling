There's a space between dark matter, the pupils of your eyes. 
A classroom of stars make light for a bad situation. 
Does it matter if we fight, the path that we chose won't turn out right. 
You think it might and you lie, it's a sad situation. I know it hurts, but I can't love you anymore 
I can't love you anymore, I can't do it anymore. 
It can't get much worse but I don't feel it anymore. 
No, I don't feel it anymore, I can't love you anymore. I cant, I cant. I promised you nothing, I followed through just fine. Brought you an aging life with time. 
Your eyes saw a sad situation. 
A bad taste in my mouth, a glass full of wine, cleansing my sins, cleansing my mind. I hope that it dies, in time. It's a sad situation. You need a love that sweats in fear, you need a love so honest and clear. 
I need a love that's scared of the dark to hold in my arms. I know it hurts, but I can't love you anymore 
I can't love you anymore, I can't do it anymore. 
It can't get much worse but I don't feel it anymore. 
No, I don't feel it anymore, I can't love you anymore. It's way past our time, I give up, I don't mind. I need someone to nest with my heart. 
Let the birds fly away, you go south, I'll go far, make a break for the northest part. 
I'll open my eyes to a thousand skies and the love from a falling star. 
Will never come back, I promise the feeling is not coming back. I know it hurts, but I can't love you anymore 
I can't love you anymore, I can't do it anymore. I know it hurts, but I can't love you anymore (I can't, I can't love you anymore) 
I can't love you anymore, I can't do it anymore. (I can't, I can't love you anymore) 
It can't get much worse but I don't feel it anymore. (I can't, I can't love you anymore) 
No, I don't feel it anymore, I can't love you anymore. (I can't, I can't love you anymore) 
I know it hurts.
