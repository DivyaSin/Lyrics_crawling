Dead men, they celebrate 
As the final chapter fades away 
'Cause they can't hide 
We can see their flesh is rotten The band plays a hopeful tune 
The champagne is poured as they socialize 
But look in their eyes, hide in the light! Everything is paid for tonight 
While at the party of the 
Dead dancing in their graves 
The drinks here are free 
So relax, enjoy the sight of all the 
Dead dancing in their graves And while the world that they built 
Told 'em to change, told 'em to listen 
They just kept it the same 
And now that midnight has come 
I'm in a room watching the 
Dead dancing in their graves Bones covered up by suits 
As the visible scars, they multiply 
Kiss it goodbye 
I'm too stubborn and I will destroy Tick, tock, the time bomb has been 
Recognized and pressurized 
Nowhere to hide 
Swallowing light Everything is paid for tonight 
While at the party of the 
Dead dancing in their graves 
The drinks here are free 
So relax, enjoy the sight of all the 
Dead dancing in their graves And while the world that they built 
Told 'em to change, told 'em to listen 
They just kept it the same 
And now that midnight has come 
I'm in a room watching the 
Dead dancing in their graves I feel a coming strength 
And now it's too late to change [Incomprehensible] 
[Incomprehensible] 
[Incomprehensible] Everything is paid for tonight 
While at the party of the 
Dead dancing in their graves 
The drinks here are free 
So relax, enjoy the sight of all the 
Dead dancing in their graves And while the world that they built 
Told 'em to change, told 'em to listen 
They just kept it the same 
And now that midnight has come 
I'm in a room watching the 
Dead dancing in their graves Feel, feel a coming strength 
And now it's too late to change 
Feel, feel a coming strength 
And now it's too late to change Feel, feel a coming strength 
And now it's too late to change 
Feel, feel a coming strength 
And now it's too late to change
