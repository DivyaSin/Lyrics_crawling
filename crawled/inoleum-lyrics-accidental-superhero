are you weary 
do you no longer lay down 
winter comes slowly 
to reach me through the down save me 
i cannot save myself 
vaguely 
i don't remember how drop down my deary 
to reach me where I fall 
you never did know me 
or care at, care at all so i did a little dance 
as you walked away 
and you smiled at me 
and you smiled through me 
and you smiled, smiled 
and innocently 
looked away save me 
i cannot save myself 
vaguely 
i don't remember how save me 
i cannot save myself 
vaguely 
i don't remember how save me 
save me
