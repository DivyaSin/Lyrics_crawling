LOVE TAKES A LONG TIME TO DIE 
Writer Geoffrey Morgan It's not over when you stop crying and it's the end when you say goodbye 
And it's not finally done when you just walk away from someone 
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die 
There'll be times when you're alone you'll softly speak her name 
Each one's just about left you one time 
Daydreaming through the glass you'll see pictures from the past 
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die 
It's so hard to shut the door when mem'ries won't stay behind 
They'll come around to remind you there's love still locked inside 
So it's not over when you stop crying...
