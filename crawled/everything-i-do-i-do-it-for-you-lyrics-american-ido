Look into my eyes 
You will see, what you mean to me 
Search your heart, search your soul 
And when you find me there, you'll search no more Don't tell me it's not worth trying for 
You can't tell me it's not worth dying for 
You know it's true 
Everything I do 
I do it for you Look into your heart, you will find 
There's nothing there to hide 
Take me as I am, take my life 
I would give it all, I would sacrifice Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for 
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more 
You know it's true 
Everything I do 
I do it for you There's no love, like your love 
And no other, could give more love 
There's nowhere, unless you're there 
All the time, all the way Look your heart, babe Oh, you can't tell me it's not worth trying for 
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more 
Yea, I'd fight for you 
I'd lie for you 
Walk the wire for you 
Yeah I'd die for you 
Ya know it's true 
Everything I do 
I do it for you
