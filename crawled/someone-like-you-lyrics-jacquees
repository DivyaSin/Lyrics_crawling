Somebody tell me what she tripping for? 
What am I doing, what am I doing? 
Ill get there leaving 
Cause what we going through is foolish 
I mean what am I doing 
To make her act this way 
I mean I know sometimes 
I mean I know sometimes 
She get a little carried away She make me wanna 
Drive somewhere then swerve and crash 
I wonder will we ever last 
She make me wanna 
Leave her running on the street 
Sometimes I wish this wasnt me 
She make me wanna 
Pick a girl right out the crowd 
Cause maybe that would make me smile 
But I need someone like you 
Need someone like you, need someone like you 
Why do I need someone like you? 
I dont need no one like you? 
I know I need someone like you, 
Need someone like you, need someone like you There is no girl like you, I keep thinking to myself 
Wanna put my hands around you 
It might be bad for my health 
Cuz we gone fuss, we gone fight 
Cause we dont trust and that aint right 
And youre my wifey, youre my type 
And Ill be there to the sunrise She make me wanna 
Drive somewhere then swerve and crash 
I wonder will we ever last 
She make me wanna 
Leave her running on the street 
Sometimes I wish this wasnt me 
She make me wanna Pick a girl right out the crowd 
Cause maybe that would make me smile 
But I need someone like you 
Need someone like you, need someone like you 
Why do I need someone like you? 
I dont need no one like you? 
I know I need someone like you, 
Need someone like you, need someone like you I know I need somebody that will ride 
Need somebody by my side 
But Im sick of all the arguing all of the time 
Sometimes I wanna kick it and ride with my guys 
I know you need somebody riding with you 
But I cant do everything you want me to 
Sometimes I wanna be with you till the sunrise 
But when you go to tripping girl I change my mind She make me wanna 
Drive somewhere then swerve and crash 
I wonder will we ever last 
She make me wanna 
Leave her running on the street 
Sometimes I wish this wasnt me 
She make me wanna 
Pick a girl right out the crowd 
Cause maybe that would make me smile 
But I need someone like you 
Need someone like you, need someone like you 
Why do I need someone like you? 
I dont need no one like you? 
I know I need someone like you, 
Need someone like you, need someone like you.
