Do you remember me? 
I sat upon your knee. 
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies. 
Well, I'm all grown up now, 
But still need help somehow. 
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream. So here's my lifelong wish, 
My grown-up Christmas list, 
Not for myself, but for a world in need: No more lives torn apart, 
Then wars would never start, 
And time would heal all hearts. 
And every one would have a friend, 
And right would always win, 
And love would never end 
This is my grown-up Christmas list. As children we believed 
The grandest sight to see 
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree. 
Well, heaven surely knows 
That packages and bows 
Can never heal a hurting human soul. No more lives torn apart, 
And wars would never start, 
And time would heal all hearts. 
And every one would have a friend, 
And right would always win, 
And love would never end 
This is my grown-up Christmas list. What is this illusion called, the innocence of youth? 
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth! No more lives torn apart, 
Then wars would never start, 
And time would heal all hearts. 
And every one would have a friend, 
And right would always win, 
And love would never end 
This is my grown-up Christmas list. 
This is my only lifelong wish, This is my grown-up Christmas list!
