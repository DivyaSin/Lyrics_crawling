They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup 
When you see me in your town say wassup 
Roll around say wassup 
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup 
That's wassup 
Break it down that's wassup 
Blow a pound that's wassup 
Heyyy 
[Ab-Soul:] 
And my tail light broke like a promise, homie 
It's the realest shit I wrote, on my momma, homie 
My teachers used to call my momma on me 
Now I'm a rapstar and I could fuck up my momma's homies 
Me and schoolboy hit the liquor store 
Chococalte swisher burnin slow, how sweet? 
Who got the dro who tryna chief? 
Like Pocahontas daddy and I'm off that granddaddy kush, I'm finna start a family 
[Kendrick Lamar:] 
I'm ghetto, my kool aid need mo suga 
5 star suite, you ain't know, suga? 
I'm chillin bumpin anita baker 
Caked up, they wonder why I don't need a baker 
But really though I just need a hater 
So I ask em for their number when I see a hater 
Ask obama if I don't know about presidents, keep them dead motherfuckers restin in my money clip 
They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup 
When you see me in your town say wassup 
Roll around say wassup 
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup 
That's wassup 
Break it down that's wassup 
Dog pound that's wassup 
Heyyy 
[Schoolboy Q:] 
Look up in the mirror and my gangsta told me what it do? 
Captain crunch and top ramen all a nigga ever knew 
Got a bitch to twist a blunt and pop a nigga collar too 
Who that nigga standin over there? That's that nigga Q 
What it do? Thas wassup, bang this in your tonka truck 
Everybody rockin chucks and pistol packin that's a must 
Saggin and my ass showin mami and the cops knowin all I wanna do is smoke a blunt, let it bump 
[Jay Rock:] 
Yeah I'm lookin in the mirror and the nigga said wassup, Rock? 
And that nigga looked back at me and said boy you certified 
Took my 87 regal put it in a chop shop 
Stash spot, 45 
Run up, you gonna die 
Lookin for a pretty bitch who can twerk it and throw it back 
Nigga diss me, no I ain't missin I'm throwin shots back 
Jay rock, top cat, and I'm still a top dawg 
Boxed in that Porsche box like I'm fighting south paw 
They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup 
When you see me in your town say wassup 
Roll around say wassup 
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup 
That's wassup 
Break it down that's wassup 
Dog pound that's wassup

[Ab-Soul:] 
A challenger is like, last year calendars 
[Jay Rock:]

[Kendrick Lamar:] 
We all amazing, you all can hate it, you can live or die that's your ultimatum 
Married to the game at the alter wasted 
A pound of white rice on the side by Asians 
[Schoolboy Q:] 
Niggas didn't ride for me, bitches didn't sign me 
And what's the one thing they hated most? 
[Jay Rock:] 
Sayin bye to me!

When you see me in your town say wassup 
Roll around say wassup 
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup

Dog pound that's wassup 
Heyyy
