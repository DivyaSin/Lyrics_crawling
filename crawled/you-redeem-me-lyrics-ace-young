When the walls are closin' in on me 
And I can't find my way out 
When I've seen as much as I can see 
I just turn my eyes to You 
And I know that I'll get through it And when I'm hangin' by a thread 
And when I'm sure I've reached the end 
I reach for You, You redeem me When I lose faith, when I lose ground 
And everything, oh, comes crashin' down 
You raise me up, You lift me up 
You give me love, You redeem me When I'm out standin' on the ledge 
You pull me right back, back from the edge 
You take me in with just a look, with just a touch 
You redeem me with Your love When it seems this life has stole my soul 
You're there to bring it back 
When the hurt holds on and won't let go 
And it's just too much to take 
I know You'll be there to save me And when I'm sinkin' like a stone 
Thinkin' I'm in this all alone 
I reach for You, You redeem me When I lose faith, when I lose ground 
And everything, oh, comes crashin' down 
You raise me up, You lift me up 
You give me love, You redeem me When I'm out standin' on the ledge 
You pull me right back, back from the edge 
You take me in with just a look, with just a touch 
You redeem me with Your love I lose track and You bring me back around 
Without You there's no way 
I'd be standing here right now 
You look in my eyes, set me free, You redeem me When I lose faith, when I lose ground 
And everything, oh, comes crashin' down 
You raise me up, You lift me up 
You give me love, You redeem me When I'm out standin' on the ledge 
You pull me right back, back from the edge 
You take me in with just a look, with just a touch 
You redeem me with Your love 
You redeem me
