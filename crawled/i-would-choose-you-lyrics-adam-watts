If I could turn this wasteland into gold 
If could journey happily from young to old 
I'd smash a thousand dreams I may have had 
I'd give up all material things and I'd be glad 
If I could only make one choice I would choose you 
I would choose you 
I would choose you 
I would choose you If I could give the heartless a little soul 
If I could set a spark beneath lovers gone cold 
I'd tear at the seams with all I have 
Surrender all my wants, my needs and I'd be glad 
If I could only make one choice I would choose you 
I would choose you 
I would choose you 
I would choose you 
I would choose you I see the world take what I need 
Use it all, lose the rest 
To be a fool is to put it all 
Above the one you know is love 
I would not make that mistake I would choose you 
I would choose you 
I would choose you 
I would choose you I would choose you 
I would choose you 
I would choose you 
I would choose you You, you, you 
You, you, you, you
