Your down on your luck 
You just lost your truck 
You can't afford another beer 
Your credit cards don't work 
Whole world thinks you're a jerk 
You wondering how you wound up here [Choru 
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around 
It woulda been better to let her keep you down 
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account 
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around Now your sleeping on the couch at your best friends house watching Colombo 
Eating cold pizza in your underwear 
Just remember I told ya so [Chorus] So if you're thinking about saying adios 
Well, take it from the fool who knows 
She's gonna serve ya papers make ya pay through the nose 
And when her lawyer gets through with 
You you'll have to move to Mexico. [Chorus] It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
