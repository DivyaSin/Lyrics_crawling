Look at the world through my eyes 
I won't be happy until everything dies I wish you could see this life from the inside 
But you'll go fucking blind 
You've got it good looking in from the outside 
You'll lose your fucking mind 
Look at the world from my eyes 
I won't be happy until everything dies x2 
There is nothing in this world that comes without a price 
Everything you think you know is a fucking lie 
This isn't where your father passed you your life 
My father gave me mine and then he fucking died Look at the world through my eyes 
I won't be happy until everything dies 
Close your eyes and think about the times 
The reality is your all going to die This is how the world ends 
Not with a bang but with a whimper x2 
Let's just stand in silence and face the apocalypse 
Not with a bang but with a whimper
