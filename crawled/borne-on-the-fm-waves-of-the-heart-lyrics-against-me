No (no), it's not what we meant to say (it's not what we meant to say) 
We don't really love each other 
What happens when the summer's over? 
(How long before distance becomes a chore?) 
I'm approaching with great (great) trepidation 
I hope you'll understand Before you speak (before you speak) 
Think about what you're trying to say (think about what you're trying to say) 
Who else is there to blame for miscommunication? 
You're getting caught up in the excitement 
(You making promises you can't keep) 
You need to leave all your options open Too much momentum 
This room feels like it's going to explode 
Too many angles 
Too many factors to cover 
Waiting for signal 
You're searching for a network 
You have to fight to stay in control of the situation Anxiety, anxiety, you give me no mercy 
Grind my teeth smooth and flat in my sleep 
We took some pills to calm us down 
(We needed help to come back up) 
Just trying to stay in control of the situation Too much momentum 
This room feels like it's going to explode 
Too many angles 
Too many factors to cover 
Waiting for signal 
You're searching for a network 
You have to fight to stay in control of the situation 
And we fall apart so easily Too much momentum 
This room feels like it's going to explode 
Too many angles 
Too many factors to cover 
Waiting for signal 
You're searching for a network 
You have to fight to stay in control 
You have to fight to stay in control 
No, you don't have to fight to stay in control of the situation
