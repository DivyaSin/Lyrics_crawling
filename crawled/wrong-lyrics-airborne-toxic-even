All my young life 
I've been trying to say 
just one thing right. 
And now we've come to the day. 
You're here in my arms, I don't know what to say. I believe I was wrong, 
probably most of my life. 
Or I'm just hearing it wrong. 
I'm just watching the fire-light. I see the look in your eyes, 
"Am I trying too hard? Am I doing this right?" 
So I fall 
I fall down to my knees. 
I'm not easy to sooth; 
I'm never easy to please. I believe I was wrong, 
probably most of my life. 
Or I'm just hearing it wrong. 
I'm just watching the fire-light. 
And I don't care if it's right. 
I know your friends are opposed. 
But we've still got tonight. 
We'll just keep our eyes closed. 
( repeat )
