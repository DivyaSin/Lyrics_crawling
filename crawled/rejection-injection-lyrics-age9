Rejection. 
So you fell for that stupid lie, 
you thought you were loved, 
and now you're hating everyone just because you got fucked. 
It hurts, 
it hurts so bad you wish you were never born. 
How anyone could be so mean it blows your mind, 
Leaves your heart torn. 
You know you been there too many times. 
That's what makes you you, 
all of their fucking lies. 
Injection. 
It's hard, 
it's so hard, 
it hurts so fucking bad. 
When you give your heart up to something and nothings there. 
Hard life to live alone it gets you so fucking scared. 
A hard life to live just knowing, 
knowing that nobody cares. 
It's too bad there's no one to help you out. 
It's too bad there's no one that you care about. 
Bring me down, 
I won't get up. 
It's too bad there's no one to help you out. 
It's too bad there's no one that you care about.
