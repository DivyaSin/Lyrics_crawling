We carry a cross 
For this life 
For this life 
Once we were lost 
But to die for this 
To die for this 
Reprise our lives will not be ~Chorus~ 
Silent 
Silent 
Its our salvation day 
And we wont be 
Quiet 
Quiet 
And thus is our Salvation Day And people will stand 
For liberty, liberty 
Forgiveness of man 
Whos bored with 
This bored with this 
Reprise and our lives will not be ~Chorus~(x2) For this hope on which we stand 
Salvation 
Salvation 
For this hope on which we stand 
Salvation 
For this hope on which we stand 
Salvation 
Salvation 
For this hope on which we stand 
Salvation 
Salvation will not be s..s..s..s.s..s.Silent 
Its our salvation day 
And we wont be 
Quiet 
Quiet 
And thus is our Salvation Day 
Silent 
Silent 
Its our salvation day 
And I wont be 
Quiet 
Quiet 
And thus is our Salvation Day
