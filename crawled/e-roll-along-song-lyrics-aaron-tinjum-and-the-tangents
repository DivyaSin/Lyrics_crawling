[Chorus] 
I said I'm going to change my ways, yeah 
Strike a different pose 
And paint a different face 
On a different frame 
Call it "new age" 
It's all the rage 
To be changing what you've made 
But you made a life 
And may get it stuck 
Release that break and roll along 
Roll Along [First Verse] 
I used to drink to think 
And puked my thoughts 
In a ceramic sink 
And rinsed those stains 
Down the drain 
But those were in my darker days 
Per se 
And now a white light 
Breaks through the shades 
Illuminating 
My opaque gaze [Chorus] 
So I'm going to change my ways, yeah 
Strike a different pose 
And paint a different face 
On a different frame 
Call it "new age" 
It's all the rage 
To be changing what you've made 
But you made a life 
And may get it stuck 
Release that break and roll along 
Roll Along [Second Verse] 
I used to date my fate 
Bury my thoughts 
In a shallow grave 
Laid wilted flowers 
On my life's plot 
But there will come 
A circumstance 
That snaps you out of your 
Downtrodden trance 
A pretty girl 
Wants a slow dance
