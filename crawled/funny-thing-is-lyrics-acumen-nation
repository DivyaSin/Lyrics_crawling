got a reptile heart? keep it warm 
got a message? keep it chill 
got a thing for her? masturbate 
got a human heart? kick it aside so listen to me, 
its not that i think your ocean is shallow water 
i just don't believe you can swim out far enough for me 
so ill thank you for your three-ring sadness reminder but somehow 
inside you i am the death of love there is a warm place everyone can go 
everyone but me
