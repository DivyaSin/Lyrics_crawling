I've been loving you too long to stop now 
You are tired and you want to be free 
My love is growin' stronger as you become a haven to me 
I've been loving you a little too long I don't want to stop now With you my life has been so wonderful I can't stop now 
You are tired and your love is growin' colder 
My love is growin' stronger as our affair grows older 
I've been loving you too long I've been loving you oh too long 
I've been loving you too long to stop now
