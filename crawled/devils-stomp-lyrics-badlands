I needed time to think things over 
To heal my soul and ease the pain 
And through a glass, a revelation 
I could swear I heard the darkness call my name Imagination's running for too long, oh yeah 
The mind we lost can read the senses wrong I need a shot of realization 
I can't believe the things I've seen 
'Cause down the bar sat the devil man 
As he turned around and smiled and he said to me He said, hey boy, I know what you're looking for 
It feels so good to be so bad 
Just take a chance, step through my open door 
Lord Now boy, I know you're oh so young 
And the whole world shines in front of you 
But I can give you anything you want 
And I'll make it so easy for you All I know is what my mama told me 
All I know is what she said 
When Beelzebub is sneakin' up on you 
You best be dancin' on his head, yeah Lord, do the devil's stomp 
Oh, he made it sound so good 
Stealin' my soul every way 
The devil's price hangs on my soul 
Throw a pocket full of gold his way All I know is what my mama told me 
All I know is what she said 
When Beelzebub is sneakin' up on you 
You best be dancin' on his head, yeah Lord, do the devil's stomp 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah Oh, words that'll simmer 
Like the moonlight house 
Oh, feels so good, you know to be so bad 
You know, been holding back, baby, for much too long 
And I feel it creepin' right in my bones 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Oh, Lord 
Lord, do the devil's stomp 
Do it
