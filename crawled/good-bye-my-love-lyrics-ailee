My tears remember 
It fills up your seat again 
I try erasing but I can't erase you 
You've become my everything 
You, I can't see you, I can't hear you 
But I'm okay 
Goodbyes are sad, my heart aches 
But if you are happy, if you can smile, then I... 
I will miss you the more I erase you 
I will shed more tears than today 
Like fate, I won't ever have anyone like you 
Only you, only you 
As much as my tears, I hope you are happy 
Good bye my love 
My heart already knew 
This feeling of loneliness that's about to explode 
I try to hide it but I can't hide it 
You've become my heart 
You, I can't have you, I can't touch you 
But I'm okay 
Endless pain, tears shed again 
But if you are happy, if you can smile, then I... 
I will miss you the more I erase you 
I will shed more tears than today 
Like fate, I won't ever have anyone like you 
Only you, only you 
As much as my tears, I hope you are happy 
You will think of me at least once 
That's all I need, until the day we meet again 
I'll wait, it's only a momentary goodbye
