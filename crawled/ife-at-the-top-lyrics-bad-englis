He looks like Deniro, she's his Brigitte Bardot 
And that's enough to hang around with those who think they know 
But if you've got the image, and symbols of success 
You must be doing something right, to keep up with the Jones's They made it from the castin' couch, the sex was rock an' roll 
They're everybody's business, inquiring minds must know 
Every slummy little detail, every superficial move 
And you can buy it retail, in pink and black and blue She said, take me walking where the surf is slow 
He said, what's wrong with right here, I got places to go [Chorus] 
Life at the top, down on your knees, don't stop, don't stop, give it to me 
Life at the top, where nothing is free 
It's alright, alright, baby won't you live it with me If you get up on the table, you're gonna lose your place 
In the city of angels, where fame's a state of grace 
If you need a plastic surgeon, honey, I know an ace 
You can't change your past, but he can change your face She said, take me walking where the surf is slow 
He said, what's wrong with right here, I got places to go [Chorus] He said, baby, take me far away from here 
She said, you already arrived, can't you see yourself clear Life at the top (alright, alright) 
Shakin' the money tree (alright, alright) 
Give it everything you got (alright, alright) 
Shake it one time for me (don't stop, don't stop) [Chorus] (Life) at the top, down on your knees, alright, alright, baby live it with me 
(Life at the top) This stealin' thing you got, in the land of the free 
(Don't stop, don't stop) So come on baby why won't you 
Why don't you steal from me 
(Life at the top) My my my my my my yeah 
(Life at the top) It's alright (life at the top) it's alright, in real life 
(Life at the top) alright, yeah In the city of the angels, you can get it where you want it 
Get it where you want it, get where you want to, want it, want it to be
