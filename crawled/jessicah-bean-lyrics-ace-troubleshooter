She asks me for a ride 'cause she lives kinda far away from me 
So I take off in my car and roll up her steep driveway 
She gets in the car and shuts the door 
I step on the gas and let the engine roar 
And as she calms down I tell her, "By the way, Jessicah Bean, you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen 
Jessicah Bean, you are the girl of my dreams 
Jessicah Bean, you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen 
Jessicah Bean, you are my queen" I show her my muscles and she gets impressed 
I tell her she's rad and she tells me I'm the best 
As we're headed on our way down to the lake 
We get out of the car and I hold her near 
I lay the Johnny on thick and whisper in her ear 
"What a great wife you would make, Jessicah Bean, I really mean I want you for my queen 
And I'll be your king
