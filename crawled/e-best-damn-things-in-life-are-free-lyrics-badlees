(Alexander) Well I met her in college 
Hanging out at sigma Chi 
Singing stoned and drunken versions 
Of American Pie We picked up and married 
Soon as she got out of school 
I'd soon hit the big time 
Seemed like the thing to do I must have overlooked something 
'Cause I'm over my head 
But the best damn things in life are free 
And as long as I got your company 
That's what she said I'm not one for worrying 
'Bout dreams left unfulfilled 
But it's a long way to the "Garden" 
From the Canton Bar and Grill And the wife's got a lifestyle 
That she's looking to maintain 
That these musicians wages 
Can't hope to sustain I'm running out of options 
I'm running out of time 
Just tell me how to make it pay 
If it takes me 27 hours a day 
I won't mind It's a matter of opinion 
Between right and wrong 
In you circles of distinction 
I can't last that long I know I'm not worth much 
To you financially 
But the best damn things in life are free Some read the Wall street Journal 
Some play the lottery 
Some invest in foreign lands 
That they have never seen Others roll the dice or spin the wheel 
Or play their hand 
Me, I learned to play guitar 
And joined a long haired band
