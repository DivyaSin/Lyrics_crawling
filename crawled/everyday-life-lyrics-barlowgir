Oh so long I've looked to me 
For the answers for my life 
All this time I've held the key 
And had control of me 
But now You're saying 
That You also hold the key 
For those plans You made for my life 
Plans made just for me Can I trust You 
Will You guide me 
And show me how to live this life 
Should I give my life for You 
And can I trust You with this everyday life 
And can I trust You with this everyday life I can feel You telling me 
And if I would just believe 
You would take my life and show me 
Exactly what You mean 
When You say that "You can trust me 
And I know what you need 
I am more for you than anything 
You could ever dream." Can I trust You 
Will You guide me 
And show me how to live this life 
Should I give my life for You 
And can I trust You with this everyday life 
Can I trust You 
Will You guide me 
And show me how to live this life 
Can I give my life to You 
And can I trust You with this everyday life 
And can I trust You with this everyday life
