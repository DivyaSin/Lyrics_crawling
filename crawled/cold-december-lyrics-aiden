Those nights we walk together 
I couldn't sleep 
Well I still remember what you wore now 
It was the cold December air 
The way the rain hit your hair but then 
I woke up from a dream I can't repair 
And then realized 
How far I'd finally come 
Well the damage that's been made 
The hurt I've caused can never be erased 
Only until now 
Can we disappear 
Now I walked alone some nights 
Thinking of the time 
We laid your soul to rest 
This disillusion comforts me 
I wait for you sometimes 
But always feel my life 
Is flashing way to fast 
We never had a second chance 
So when was my place branded 
Faithless lost again 
So when was my place branded 
Faithless lost my friend I will never trust and 
Label death as my only defense 
I will never trust again 
I will never trust and 
Label death as my only defense 
I will never love again 
I still remember when your You were found 
And we were bored 
Let's live 
One more time I've made my way this life's 
Taken so much time to manufacture grace 
I feel the darkness fall 
I can remember times when so much 
Love and hate made something more than 
Haste 
It made me push you more 
So when are we supposed to leave this place 
Why you not me 
So when were we supposed to climb on top of grace 
From your cold hands 
And your dead eyes 
From your cold 
Hands I Cry I will never trust and 
Label death as my only defense 
I will never trust again 
I will never trust and 
Label death as my only defense 
I will never love again 
I will never trust and 
Label death as my only defense 
I will never love again 
I still remember that cold December
