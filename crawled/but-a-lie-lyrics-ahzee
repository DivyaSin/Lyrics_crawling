When I saw you with him 
You broke my heart into 
Everything that I felt All (the shame?) you put me through I can't believe my eyes 
Right these be you side 
I need to let you go go go go How can I dream of us 
when is nothing but a lie 
How can I be with you 
when it's always on you mind 
How can I dream of us 
when is nothing but a lie 
How can I be with you 
Hold up. So fking with my mind I calling you (when?) 
And you pulling up (this chase?) 
All the words that were said 
But you never meant a thing 
How can I break away 
It's never gonna change 
I need to let you go go go go How can I dream of us 
when is nothing but a lie 
How can I be with you 
when it's always on you mind 
How can I dream of us 
when is nothing but a lie 
How can I be with you 
So fking with my mind 
So fking with my mind
