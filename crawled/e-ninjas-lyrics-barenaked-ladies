I woke up this morning 
And everything was different 
Something was strange in the air 
I woke up this morning 
And everything was different 
I knew that the ninjas had been there I looked all around my bedroom 
Underneath the dresser 
Behind the curtain 
But nothing could be found 
There was nothing left behind them 
No way that I could find them 
No finger prints or crumbs on the ground The ninjas are deadly and silent 
They're also unspeakably violent 
They speak Japanese 
They do whatever they please 
And sometimes they vacation in Ireland The ninjas are deadly and silent 
They're also unspeakably violent 
They speak Japanese 
They do whatever they please 
And if you tear of their mask, 
They'll be smiling
