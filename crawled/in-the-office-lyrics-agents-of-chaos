I am so distant 
And so cold 
I've lived too long 
And I'm so old 
I've tried so many distant ways 
I've watched each one of them delayed 
I can't expound for the ages 
While we are leafing through the pages 
The office blocks from which we march 
Mirrored shades of the Patriarch 
Lounge lizards in penthouse flats 
May soon find out where it's at 
They gnaw away our hard earned pay 
We walk the treadmill every day 
Caught by streams of constant motion 
Most of the workers have no notions 
Sitting glued to computer screens 
Fingers raised - "must finish the scene" 
Techo-droppings don't exist 
Within these walls we can't resist
