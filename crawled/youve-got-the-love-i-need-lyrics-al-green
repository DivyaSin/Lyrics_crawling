Oh your beautiful to me 
More than my eyes can see 
Your hair blowing in the wind 
I don't know why love should end Stardust in the sky 
I either love you or die 
I gotta have you in my life 
I really wanna make you wife [Chorus] 
You got the love I need baby 
You got the love I need baby 
You got the love I need baby 
You got the love I need baby Oh my only friend 
The only truth I know 
Oh you taught me things about me 
I'd never thought I'd know Darling you've been there for me 
Through the strangest of the times 
Oh it must be meant to be 
My darling love for my life [Chorus] Stardust blowing in the wind 
Blowing in the wind 
I don't know why love should end 
I like loving you so 
I like loving you 
I'll never, never, never let you go [Chorus:Repeat x2]
