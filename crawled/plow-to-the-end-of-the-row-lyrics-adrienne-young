Wake up in the morning in the moonlight grey 
We got dirt to break, we got a note to pay 
Gonna plow, plow to the end of the row 
Wake up in the morning and plow to the end of the row Down to the kitchen with my feet still bare 
Children to the table, papa say a prayer 
Gonna plow, plow to the end of the row 
Down to the kitchen, got to plow to the end of the row Cornbread for breakfast, wont ya boil the grinds 
Got to cut the furrow fore the sun gets high 
Got to plow, plow to the end of the row 
Cornbread for breakfast and I plow to the end of the row Sun just broke out over the trees 
I got a aching in my back and a tremblin in my knes 
If the mule wont pull then the plow wont go 
If the seed dont set, crop wont grow Chickens to the market, seven miles to town 
Gotta make it home fore the sun goes down 
Big storm coming, I can see it in the sky 
Hope it dont hit fore the clothes get dry I got rocks in my shoes, dirt in my eyes 
Working like a dog til the day I die 
You got to plow, plow to the end of the row 
I got rocks in my shoes when I plow to the end of the row 
My babys waitin for me at the end of the day 
She likes to ball the jack in the sweetest way 
Gotta plow, plow to the end of the row My babys waiting for me so I plow to the end of the row 
Wake up in the mornin in the moonlight grey 
We got dirt to break we got a note to pay 
Gonna plow, plow to the end of the row 
Wake up in the mornin and plow to the end of the row
