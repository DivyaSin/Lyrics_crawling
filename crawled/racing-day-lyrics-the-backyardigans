Racing day, it's racing day 
Racing day, it's racing day 
It's not picture-tracing day 
Today's the day we race We'll run somewhere that's not right here 
And while we do the crowd will cheer 
Through the forest over the snows 
Across the ocean and then who knows Whoever is the first around 
Will get to make that victory sound 
Dunt-da-daa, is what they'll say 
At the end of racing day Racing day, it's racing day 
Racing day, it's racing day 
It's not doily lacing day 
Today's the day we race A long, long, long, long way we've come 
To get back where we started from 
We raced real hard but now it's time 
To break that tape and cross that line Racing day, it's racing day 
Racing day, it's racing day 
It's not self-effacing day 
Today's the day we race 
Today's the day we race 
Today's the day we race
