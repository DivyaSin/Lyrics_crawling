HE WAS THERE ALL THE TIME 
Writer Gary Paxton (C) Time after (G/C) time I went (Am/C) searching for (G/C) peace in some (Dm) void. (Em/D - Dm7* - Em/D) I was (Bb) trying to blame All my (G7) ills on this world I was (C) in. (G/C - Am/C - G/C) (C) Surface re(G/C)lationships (Am/C) used me 'til (G/C) I was done (Dm) in. (Em/D - Dm7* - Em/D) And (Bb) all of the while someone was (G7) begging To free me from (C) sin. (G/C - see - G) Chorus: He was (C) there (G/C) all the (F) time (Dm7) He was (G) there all the (C) time (G/C) Waiting (C) patient(G/C)ly in (F) line (Dm) He was (C) there (G) all the (C) time. (G/C - Am/C - G/C) (C - G/C - Am/C - G/C) Never again Will I look for a fake rainbow's end. Now that I have the answer My life is just starting to rhyme. Sharing each new day with Him Is a cup of fresh wine. And oh what I missed, He's been waiting right there all the time. Chorus
