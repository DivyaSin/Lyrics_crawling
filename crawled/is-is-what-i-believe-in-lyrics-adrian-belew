Hold tight to your faith 
Don't let nobody make you jaded 
Your love is precious, 
Give it to somebody who deserves it 
This is what I believe in Hold tight to yourself 
Don't let nobody give you hell 
Your life is sacred 
Live it right, but live it your way 
This is what I believe in All the world is a cannibal 
Even time itself will eat us all 
But that's no reason to be a jerk 
You either make it better or make it worse I believe this. I believe it's true 
I believe it All the world is dangerous 
Full of homicidals and terrorists 
But underneath their blanket of hate 
The only thing that will survive is our love and faith I believe in truth 
And I believe in me 
And I believe in you
