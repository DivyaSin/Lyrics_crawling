Music: jones Lyrics: One strange land 
Was built from the sea 
Put a crown to the castle 
No strange land 
Could break the glass 
That cuts all the cats down 
I heard the captains voice 
No choice to listen up 
To your masses 
I heard the captain's voice 
Like a whistle in the breeze I'm going to the coast of manhattan 
With a bag full of blues 
And a yellow canary 
Captain he spoke 
In a voice from the ivory coast 
Saying there's no passion in perfection 
My son
