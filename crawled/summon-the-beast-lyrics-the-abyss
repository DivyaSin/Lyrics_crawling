Hell storms on the winds of fire 
Ripping the weak jesus christ 
Slice into pieces 
Until nothing remains 
But death {Beating and battling} the holyness 
To ... believe 
Lies and screams of torture 
Nothing but {death ... / battery} ... screams of nothing remains of 
Embarassed screams of {angry/anger} 
{christ is} screaming 
Light's pain 
To raise my soul ... my master with ... 
screaming ... of evil 
{Awaking/awaken} ... of {hate} 
...with angry anguish 
... of darkness 
come {on/of} the beast of god 
alone {it} stand before me Hell storms on the winds of fire 
Ripping the weak jesus christ 
Bite into pieces 
Until nothing remains 
But death In Hell!
