Do you remember that day back in 1989? 
In Beijing some kids built a statue in a square.. 
They made it out of paper 
And they sang songs in the street 
They only wanted to be heard 
and a new age to greet 
They didn't call it revolution 
They didn't call nobody wrong.. 
In that moment a bright promise bloomed 
but the old guard stood opposed 
It was then that the lines were drawn 
but lines of battle, none supposed 
Then in came the artillary 
and in their way stood one man.. 
He held back all the tanks 
with his bare, upheld hands 
Then the tv crews were all scattered 
so no blood was shown on no hands 
Do you remember that day back in 1989? 
In Beijing a statue was burned in a square.. 
But nothing really happened 
whatever the secret envoys all ignored 
It was then that the slate was wiped clean 
as clean as they could afford 
To hell with those who care to forget 
those who died on that day..
