Traffic jam city streets forget about the rest 
Your sanity will be put to the test 
Client call repeatedly they want another change 
Some idiots just cant make up their minds 
Well I would if you want to go 
Just sail away from this madness 
Where we will remain invisible 
I wonder if what future holds will never gonna come 
Were sitting here waiting like a fool 
Photographs I stumbled on they scattered on the floor 
Theyre memories that haunt you from its grave 
Well I would if you want to go 
Just fly away from this madness 
Where we will remain invisible 
Global warmings the thing now everybodys in 
If youre not green you better not be seen 
Armageddon, crystal ball, Jesus reappears 
Theyre prophecies of world comes to an end 
Well I would if you want to go 
Just disappear from this madness 
Yeah I would if you want to go 
Where we will remain invisible
