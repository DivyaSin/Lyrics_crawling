We live in hope of love 
And wait to die 
And sadness all around us 
Waits for crying 
And feelings 
That once meant so much 
Are left to dry and trun to dust 
And ashes We learn to wheel and deal 
And say goodbye 
And madness all around us 
Makes for dyin' 
Young deceivers soon turn old 
And loft to die amongst their gold 
And cash it Give it up or me live just to die 
Give it up (Give it up) 
Give it up, give yourself time 
(Give it up) 
Give it up, save yourself 
Give it up 
(Give it up) 
Give it up 
(Give it up) We drive a million miles to see the sun 
Hoping we are not too late for saving 
The Lord will smile on you today 
And give you love that you can trade 
For matches and TV and movie stars 
And driving cars as cashes Give it up or me live just to die 
Give it up (Give it up) 
Give it up, give yourself time 
(Give it up) 
Give it up, save yourself 
Give it up 
(Give it up) 
Give it up 
(Give it up) Give it up 
Give it up
