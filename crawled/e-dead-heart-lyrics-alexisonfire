We don't serve your country, don't serve your king 
Know your custom, don't speak your tongue 
White man came took everyone We don't serve your country, don't serve your king 
White man listen to the songs we sing 
White man came took everything We carry in our hearts the true country and that cannot be stolen 
We follow in the steps of our ancestry and that cannot be broken We don't serve your country, we don't serve your king 
Know your custom, don't speak your tongue 
White man came took everyone We don't need protection, don't need your hand 
Keep your promise on where we stand 
We will listen we'll understand We carry in our hearts the true country and that cannot be stolen 
We follow in the steps of our ancestry and that cannot be broken 
We carry in our hearts the true country and that cannot be stolen 
We follow in the steps of our ancestry and that cannot be broken Mining companies, pastoral companies 
Uranium companies, collected companies 
Got more right than people, got more say than people Forty thousand years 
Can make a difference to the state of things 
The dead heart lives here
