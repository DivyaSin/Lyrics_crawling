Forced into battle by the government 
Sent out to kill with out my consent 
Kill or be killed is what they say 
No alternative but to do it their way 
Who ever died and made you boss 
Telling me to kill at any cost 
Sent to kill I'm sent to die 
Lost souls of the dead will litter the sky Kill or be killed What ever happened to all my rights 
Shoved up my ass and sent to fight 
Look at all the people turned to ash 
Letting others die to save their own ass 
Approaching fast is a fiery storm 
A miniature hell is about to form 
Too late now death is in the air 
Cries of the dying is all you hear Kill or be killed
