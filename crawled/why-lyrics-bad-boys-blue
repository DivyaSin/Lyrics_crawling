Close your looks. Close your looks. 
Close your looks. Close misty eyes. 
Close your looks. Close your looks. 
Close your looks. Close misty eyes. Something inside me, beats me walking through the night. 
Can't find what I'm looking for. 
Dreaming of those misty eyes. 
Is there a reason for your hurryin'. 
Is it a love cry ? Is it a love cry ? 
What is a reason for your worry? 
Is it harder to come back or harder to tell me? Why ? Why are you walking away from me ? 
Just tell me why ? Why you walking away ? 
Is it a love cry ? 
Why ? Why are you walking away from me ? 
Just tell me why? Why you walking away ? 
Misty eyes. 
(Those misty eyes) You said that you'd change your mind with your ums and ifs and why's. 
There's something inside of me. 
Reading from those misty eyes. 
Where is the love we were making? 
I feel your heartbeat. 
I can feel your heartbeat. 
Is it the memories that you're shaking ? 
Is harder to run or harder to tell me ?
