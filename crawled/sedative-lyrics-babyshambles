Sedative, 
It's a sedative 
It was my hero 
Oh it was.. What's it really like now 
It's been a long long time since I've step outside 
To the morning sun now 
Would you take me out 
Take me by the hand now 
It's been a long, long time since I've step outside 
To the morning sun. Sedative, 
It's a sedative 
It was my hero 
And I had a hit 
??????
