There's a little bit of you and some of me 
There's a little bit of everything you see 
But you don't know why Harry cried 
There's a time right after love when you feel low 
Like a bird with perfect wings denied the sky 
But you don't know why Harry cried Take a look at the common man 
He can talk with the use of his hands 
Pass you on by with a smile 
Like he just don't care 
Take a look at yourself in the light 
People see by the look in your eyes 
Either you're deaf or you're blind 
Or you just don't care Well something stirred today 
Young Harry he passed away Someone moves and a leaf falls to the ground 
Morning comes and he is not around 
But you don't know why Harry cried Well you pick him up and you put him in your hand 
And he slips on through like tiny bits of sand 
But you don't know why Harry cried
