Today you woke up with the same damn dream 
You got some great ideas but you got no self esteem 
And you try but you're stuck and no one gives a fuck but you can't give up 
Trip and fall cuz no one can be perfect 
Earn and learn it and then you will deserve it 
I'm so fucking sick of these people being pussies 
I'm so fucking sick of these people trying to push me Chorus 
Fuck em all 
That's what I gotta say 
Watch em fall 
Till they all bleed away 
Do what you gotta do get the fuck up 
Cuz these fucking punks need to know when to shut the fuck up 
If you wanna be down, knock a hater to the ground 
Cuz these mother fuckers here are always around 
Tac and hash and you know where we stand 
At the very top and you know it man I aint one to talk shit 
But if you bring it up blow it up 
Leave it alone or ima show you up 
This is real I ain't fucking around 
I represent all our fans who say they'll always be down 
I gotta short fuse and you're holding a match 
I fucking dare you to set it off just let it off I'll show you were I'm at 
ABiCA this aint skin dip 
Lemme prove it just put the CD on repeat Fuck em all 
That's what I gotta say 
Watch em fall 
Till they all bleed away 
Do what you gotta do get the fuck up 
Cuz these fucking punks need to know when to shut the fuck up 
If you wanna be down, knock a hater to the ground 
Cuz these mother fuckers here are always around 
Tac and hash and you know where we stand 
At the very top and you know it man
