All I need, all I need 
Is a little more time to take you high All I need, all I need 
Is a little more time to take you high Come through we can Netflix it up 
She says, Bobby, you reckless as fuck 
I said, girl, you know life is a bitch 
Ain't no reason in dressin' it up 
Just give me your word 
Even street signs wanna nigga for curt 
Even peace signs got middle finger, flip a bird 
And as absurd as it seems 
And love is a permanent thing 
You ask what consistency is girl 
But we are not permanent beings 
But give me some time, I'll see what we'll find 
And maybe we'll stir up some things 
Like what's under the surface, we're more than just servants 
'Cause no one is perfect you see 
But girl you're perfect for me 
I need you to fill out of here 
You ain't certain to be 
I was thought and I wear my heart 
On my shirt, on my sleeve 
But a king without his queen, where on earth would he be I was thinkin' Netflix and chill, Netflix and chill 
I got drink and smoke on deck, that's if you come through for real I was thinkin' Netflix and chill, Netflix and chill 
I wake up and need it up, that's a bed and breakfast for real (Oh yeah) All I need, all I need 
There's a little more time to take you high (Oh yeah) All I need, all I need (Oh yeah) 
There's a little more turn (Yeah) 
Just a little more time 
Just a little more time How about Netflix on the sofa? 
Me and you rollin' coast 
How 'bout we take this up a notch 
Imma pour you up a glass of potion, rub you down with lotion 
Tryna set the mood and get it right 
Do a bunch of freaky shit that you like 
Imma take my time wit it, more firmer, Imma grind in it 
Stop, pause I rewindin' 
Move on we gon' role-play, sixty nine, up and down we go round and round 
'Bout sixty times, do the sixty nine, we got House of Cards 
She be blackin' your new arm, what you know 'bout it 
Imma get them rubies and roses for you7 
And Imma give it to you hoe, like I owe it to you 
Ooh got a feeling you gon' have the time of your life tonight 
Imma beat that pussy, we gon' fight the night, 
Going up, going up, going on a flight tonight 
Me and you, sixty nine for two, she gon' blow that horn like flute 
I got a little something on my mind 
Fuck it never mind, here we go I was thinkin' Netflix and chill, Netflix and chill 
I got drink and smoke on deck, that's if you come through for real I was thinkin' Netflix and chill, Netflix and chill 
I wake up and need it up, that's a bed and breakfast for real (Oh yeah) All I need, all I need (Oh yeah) 
Is a little more time to take you high (Oh yeah) All I need, all I need (Oh yeah) 
Is a little more time Just a little more time 
Just a little more time
