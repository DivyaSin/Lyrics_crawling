Do you wake up in the middle of the night 
Find your eyes are on full beam 
Totally wired 
Sweat stains and troubled dreams 
Your throat is burnin' dry 
Caught in your worst nightmare 
You cannot deny And now you've become 
What you said you'd never become 
Hate yourself for all the things you've never done 
You tell yourself you're too old 
I know you're still young 
You're wanting to scream 
You still hold your tongue Whoohoo, whoohoo 
You're at the breaking point 
Whoohoo, whoohoo 
Just one step away 
Whoohoo, whoohoo 
You're at the breaking point 
Whoohoo, whoohoo And in the morning 
Do you remember the night? 
Put on dark sunglasses to shut out the light 
Shut out the pain 
Shut out the red in your eyes you hide 
Everytime you look in the mirror 
How do you live with your life? Whoohoo, whoohoo 
You're at the breaking point 
Whoohoo, whoohoo 
Just one step away 
Whoohoo, whoohoo 
You're at the breaking point 
Whoohoo, whoohoo Whoohoo, whoohoo 
You're at the breaking point 
Whoohoo, whoohoo 
One step, one step away 
Whoohoo, whoohoo 
You're at the breaking point 
Whoohoo, whoohoo
