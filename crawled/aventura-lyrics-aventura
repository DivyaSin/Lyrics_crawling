"This song is for you, wherever you are.....Aventura" 
I dunno what's going on with my baby 
Que ya no me quiere ver 
She doesn't want to talk to me 
She left an early morning without reason 
Sin dejarme un a cartita or a clue where she might be at 
I don't think that I deserve what you have done 
I don't sleep at night 
And I don't eat esperando for your love 
Cuando volveras, when will you come back 
Ay dime mami a donde tu estaras 
When will you come back, cuando volveras 
Dime morena ay a donde andaras 
Tell me why tell me why 
Me haces esto mujer 
If I always loved you 
Ven why vuelve otra vez(2x) 
"Let me find out... 
Oye que feeling mami" 
My heart is in pain and I need your love 
Oh please call the doctor 
why que vuelva mi morena 
I miss her day and night 
Nothing as changed 
And the only thing I have is on the wall her pictured frame 
Cuando volveras, when will you come back 
Ay dime mami a donde tu andaras 
When will you come back,cuando volveras 
Ay dime baby if you're ever coming back 
Tell me why tell me why 
Me haces esto mujer 
If i always loved you 
Ven why vuelve otra vez 
You are doing this to me 
If I always loved you, 
Ven why vuelve otra vez. 
"uuuhhh, when are you going to come back boo, you know I stay missing you" 
Cuando volveras... 
you know I love you,with all my love 
and now I miss you, with all my heart 
'cause you're my baby, you're my Herat... 
Cuando volveras(2x)... aaaaaahhhh... 
!Morena!
