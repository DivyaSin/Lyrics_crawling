Well take a look and listen to the things that I have said 
Well could I really tell the truth with a rifle at my head 
Yeah, I gunned down a president 
Yeah I have done a crime 
But now you've got to listen 'cos I'm running out of time But it's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
But it's not me that is guilty 
That's a man with the C.I.A. Well I got put in jail because I got into a fight 
And while I was in prison I got beat up every night 
Yeah, torture it was blackmail I was messed up with cocaine 
And then they had me thinking I knew just who to blame But it's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
But it's not me that is guilty 
That's a man with the C.I.A. (It wasn't me) 
(It wasn't me) But it's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
But it's not me that is guilty 
That's a man at the C.I.A. Well there I stood before him a revolver in my hand 
With one shot for the torture and a bullet for the man 
So now I'm UP FOR MURDER on a charge I can't deny 
There ain't no clues I'm bom to lose and no ones gonna ask me why But it's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
But it's not me that is guilty 
That's a man with the C.I.A. But it's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
But it's not me that is guilty 
That's a man with the C.I.A. C.I.A.
