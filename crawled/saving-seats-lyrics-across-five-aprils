I remember our favorite times 
Walking around hands locked watching city lights warm up 
Talking of where we'd be this time next year 
These memories still remain my favorite 
My favorite to forget Thanks for calling thanks a lot for calling me just to save your spot I remember your favorite lines 
Saying you need some space then I should have let you go 
But I was to in love with you to leave 
You were to in love with having someone 
Someone you could form to fit your needs 
That's why you're... Walking away but saving seats just in case you change your mind and stay I guess this time you've crossed the line 
Cause I can't feel my heart beat 
Next time I hope you see the sign 
Cause it reads no re-entry Walking away but saving seats just in case you change your mind and stay Stay away from me 
Your job is done here I'm hurt enough already 
Stay away from me 
I can never be what you need Stay away from me 
You know I'll miss you but this is not how love's supposed to be 
Stay away from me 
I can never be what you need
