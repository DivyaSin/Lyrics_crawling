Young Parisians are so French 
They love Patty Smith 
Young Parisians are so French 
At the Champs-Elysees I wanna go to Paris with you 
Just to see what the French boys do 
Why don't you come to Paris with me 
And see the young Parisians? Young Parisians are so French 
They sit on the metro 
Young Parisians are so French 
Not like me and you I wanna go to Paris with you 
Just to see what the French boys do 
Why don't you come to Paris with me? 
And see the young Parisians I wanna go to Paris with you 
Just to see what the French boys do to you 
Why don't you come to Paris with me 
And see the young Parisians? Young Parisians are so French 
Theyre always called Du Bois 
Young Parisians are so French 
Talk nothing but French I wanna go to Paris with you 
Just to see what the French boys do 
Why don't you come to Paris with me 
And see the young Parisians? They're so French 
They're so French 
They're so French 
Are you?
