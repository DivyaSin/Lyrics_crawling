Chorus: Metronome 
Music and rhythm all it's own 
Sound and time 
Music and rhyme 
Sent from heaven 
It's so divine Verse 1: Space and time 
Music and rhyme 
Tic and tock 
The hands of the clock Chorus: Metronome 
Music and rhythm all its own 
Sound and time 
Music and rhyme 
Sent from heaven 
It's so divine Verse 2: In the beginning 
God created Heaven and Earth 
He made the stars in the sky 
And the birds that fly 
In the twinkling of an eye 
He will appear in the sky 
So dry your eyes 
There's no need to surmise 
Space, time, music, rhyme Repeat chorus Ooo metronome 
Ooo metronome All its own 
Sound and time 
Music and rhyme 
Sent from heaven 
It's so divine 
Human metronome
