ten years ago when you were copying your friends 
you never thought you would make a change 
you found comfort in that 
and then you saw some t-shirt in some magazine 
you had to buy it so you could be just as special 
and you'll do it again 
just to stay with the scene 
you'll never have to think again 
and now you're looking back on who you were before 
you'ree thinking "what a dork" but it's the same old you 
and when you see some t-shirt in some magazine 
you have to buy it so you can be just as special
