verse 1 hello crazy love , lets head out 
to the stoned age laugh out loud empty bottles where are they gone ? 
whisky's been a friend to/for many towns there's a rumor that we're going down 
our lives are nothing but sand on the ground so unfaithful you are to me 
your heart is aching , but you're stoned to see chorus 1 losing every battle , with a bag of cocaine then finding out comfort in a bed full of pain 
whisky bottle will find its own way 
exit your imagination hanging over (the) domain verse 2 hello crazy love , light up one more 
find yourself , and/ before you close the door I've asked around , there's a sheriff in town / there's a new guy in town / a new guy's in town / 
he says no/yes to drugs , yes to guns , he's gonna burn this damn town verse 3 hello crazy love where you've been 
hiding in the corridor , of the hotel (where) you were killed your body lies , naked on the floor 
if only you were stoned , you could have lived once more chorus 2 black clouds of the season , pretends to be your slave 
finding out some pleasure in every barrel of pain 
mirrors of December ,hell freezes again 
inside of your skin is calling you to dead
