i'm a rat in a maze, i'm headed in the wrong the direction if societies the cure, well then i'm the infection when i was younger i tried hard to a find a place within it`s structure, but the more that i tried, the more i fuckin' suffered its so fuckin' hard to live this life my gun is fuckin' loaded and i'm begining to see the light. it's so fuckin hard to live this life. i knew all along that it was wrong, when you told me it was right. all these fuckin' rules and regulations hold me down i open up my mouth to scream, but no one hears a sound. they're too busy buying up everything that's been selling, that's why i chose to live a fuckin' lifestyle of rebellion.
