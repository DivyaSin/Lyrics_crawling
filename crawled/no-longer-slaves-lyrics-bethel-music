[Verse 1] 
You unravel me, with a melody 
You surround me with a song 
Of deliverance, from my enemies 
Till all my fears are gone [Chorus] 
I'm no longer a slave to fear 
I am a child of God 
I'm no longer a slave to fear 
I am a child of God [Verse 2] 
From my mothers womb 
You have chosen me 
Love has called my name 
I've been born again, into your family 
Your blood flows through my veins [Chorus] 
(x2) [Interlude] 
I am surrounded 
By the arms of the Father 
I am surrounded 
By songs of deliverance 
We've been liberated 
From our bondage 
We're the sons and the daughters 
Let us sing our freedom [Bridge] 
You split the sea 
So I could walk right through it 
My fears were drowned in perfect love 
You rescued me 
and I will stand and sing 
I am a child of God 
(x2) I am a Child of God 
(x4) [Chorus]
