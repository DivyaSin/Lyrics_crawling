Packed and racked like rats they were down in Hell 
a detestable smell like a poison well, no heaven. 
Chose a divine light they laughed that that was a drag 
instead they lived in a bag, just caught a snag. 
Pure craven. It's the final call great and small. 
Our time not theirs we're all aware. Return... to heaven. 
Grown up in the city with a gift to survive 
and yes the time has arrived to know that love is alive this season. 
But still they can't achieve to hope an alternative deny 
what faith has to give a place where we want to live. 
No reason. You all aware, don't you dare. 
Everyone will be there. Return unto heaven.
