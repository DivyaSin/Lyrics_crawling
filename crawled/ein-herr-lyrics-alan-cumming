You have to understand the way I am, mein herr 
A tiger is a tiger, not a lamb, mein herr 
You'll never turn the vinegar to jam, mein herr 
So I do what I do 
When I'm through, then I'm through. 
and I'm through. 
Tootle-oo. 
Bye bye mein lieber herr 
farewell mein lieber herr 
it was a fine affair, but now it's over 
And though I used to care, I need the open air 
you're better off without me mein herr. 
don't dab your eye, mein herr 
or wonder why, mein herr 
I always said that I was a rover 
You musn't knit your brow 
you should have known by now 
you've every cause to doubt me mein herr 
The continent of Europe is so wide, mein herr. 
Not only up and down, but side to side, mein herr. 
I couldn't ever cross it if I tried, mein herr. 
But I do what I can 
Mile by mile 
step by step 
inch by inch 
man by man mein lieber herr 
farewell mein lieber herr 
it was a fine affair but now it's over 
and though I used to care 
I need the open air 
You're better off without me mein herr 
Don't dab your eye mein herr 
or wonder why mein herr 
I've always said that I was a rover 
You musn't knit your brow 
you should have known by now 
You're better off without me
