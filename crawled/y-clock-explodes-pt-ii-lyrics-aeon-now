Who here can understand 
My riddled airy diction 
Who sees and comprehends 
My other world depiction 
Who begs their last demands 
My flavor their addiction 
Who wades through cold quicksand 
My shoulder turned reception These words are all I know now 
These words are anything but true 
This world just goes to show how 
This world just has no need for you Who stands firm and defends 
My idealist redemption 
Who still tries to pretend 
My spark bends for discretion 
Who wishes to amend 
My loyalty affliction 
Who with clarity contends 
My will is a reflection 
Who helplessly extends 
My cartoon moon affections 
Who embraced me to withstand 
My rainbow mind refractions 
My shoulder turned reception These words are all I know now 
These words are anything but true 
This world just goes to show how 
This world just has no need for you
