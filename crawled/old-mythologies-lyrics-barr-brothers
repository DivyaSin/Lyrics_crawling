Old Mythologies (guessing at a few words) It's probably now that I need you the most 
When I'm one half child and the other ghost 
And one of 'em wants to pull you close and the other to let you go 
Time's criminal love heart won 
And love defies everyone 
Inside my skin, a skeleton is warming up his act 
Though my body's my dog and my friend doesn't bite 
Though he looks severe and erudite 
A hundred degrees Fahrenheit he's as cool as an ermine 
If one of these is a poison cup and my acceptance seems abrupt 
But if you're gonna line 'em up, well I have to knock 'em down Well there's nothing so wrong that what's right can't fix 
Despite how blood and water mix and when a pony runs out of tricks and his work has just begun 
Now lord, duty bade me fight 
Just a lonely impulse of delight and balancing had brought to mind 
The years to come, the years behind 
Will I grow weary of the sun, remembering what I have done with old mythologies? You gotta choose 
You wanted the song to rescue us 
Amy, what did you leave for us? 
So we could get home Solomon sang Sheba's grace and he kissed her soft and sulking face 
If one of us has to leave this place, will the other come along? 
We been on the round and round 
Shared our kisses by the pound and chased our shadows on the ground 
Spilled our cups in China town 
Put up the moon, took down the sun 
Played our songs for everyone 
Remembering what we had done with old mythologies You gotta choose 
You wanted the song to rescue us 
Amy, what did you leave for us? 
So we could get home
