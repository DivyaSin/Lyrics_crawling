Oh, it really isn't easy 
Just to let the good times roll 
Everything is measured at a cost 
Everybody living 
Pays their share of dues 
And sometimes what you think you got 
You lost So ring a ding-ding 
Do your thing 
But remember, darling When you give a dance 
You gotta pay the band 
The band that played your song the whole night through 
When you give a dance 
It's better if you try 
To pay the piper what the piper's due The moves were free and easy 
As we danced across the floor 
The spins and the exchanges 
Being what the music's for
