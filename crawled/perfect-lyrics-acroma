Everybody's watching through the smoke and lies 
What motivates our any motion? 
And everybody's reasons for locking up inside 
The storyline is nothing still you listen 
And you don't want to be perfect 
You just want to be the same 
But all these lights tonight just complicate it 
And hold you down now So tell me 
What are you waiting for? 
Only you can make that change in you now 
And life it's hard enough 
Without carrying all of that old pain around And those who want to hold you 
You'll push them all away 
And you'll wonder how they want you when you're obviously broken 
And for those who leave you empty 
You'll hold a special place 
And you'll want that perfect blackout 
You'll want that lonely cage 
And you don't want to be perfect 
You just want to be the same 
But all these lies tonight just complicate it 
And hold you down now So tell me 
What are you waiting for? 
Only you can make that change in you now 
And life it's hard enough 
Without carrying all of that old pain around Now why don't you just let go? 
Why don't you try to fly? 
The moments wide open why don't you try to fly? And you're always complicated you're always on my mind so now tell me 
And you're always complicated you're always on my mind so now tell me 
Why don't you try to fly? 
Why don't you try to fly?
