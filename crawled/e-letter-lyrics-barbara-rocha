I think I don't know how to write love songs 
I swear I don't know what I did wrong 
Do I have sorrow left inside? 
Let me cry a song for you tonight? I promise you I'll try a little bit 
To prove yourself I'm more than this 
I could draw a letter 
and add some melody on 
And spread the lyrics to everyone Remembering 
Our happiness 
All those years 
So let me fix it up 
before a new day comes 
"Pen and paper" is all I need for once 
And let me walk with you Where are those sparkles in the eyes? 
Everybody sees yours not mine 
Did I lose faith? 
I'm terrified So let me close my eyes and feel it 
To write the words you still believe in 
And tomorrow I won't bleed to death 
Then you'll be lay down in my bed 
Caressing my hair Let me learn 
How to love 
Let me learn 
Please let me learn to Love I need to learn 
I need to learn now Tomorrow cannot exist 
I'll be better be freeze 
Than not deliver you this I guess I finish our love song 
I swear I don't know what I did wrong 
Do I have to step aside? 
Please 
Let me sing a song for you tonight?
