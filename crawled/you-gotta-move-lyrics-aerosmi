You gotta move, you gotta move, 
You gotta move, you gotta move. 
When my God gets ready, you gotta move, you gotta move. You may be high, you may be low. 
You may be rich, yeah, you may be poor. 
But when the Lord gets ready, you gotta move, you gotta move. You may be old, you may be young. 
You may be weak, you may be high-strung. 
But when the good Lord gets ready, you gotta move, you gotta move. You see that woman who walks the street. 
You see that cop man who walks his beat. 
But when the Lord gets ready, you gotta move, you gotta move. Yeah I was hangin' with the devil when we made a pact. 
I'm drinkin' welfare whiskey smokin' food stamp crack. 
It was one part sour, two parts sweet. 
Three parts strong, and four parts weak. I would rather sit on a pumpkin, and have it all to myself, than to be crowded on a velvet cushion. You may be blind, you may not see. 
You may be deaf, it's all meant to be. 
But when the Lord get ready, you gotta move, you gotta move. You gotta move, you gotta move, you gotta move, you got to move. 
When the God get ready, you gotta move, you gotta move. You gotta move, you gotta move, you gotta move, you got to move
