He opens up my mind 
In a way nobody else has ever 
He opens up my dreams 
And now the life I see is so much brighter What makes it so one can touch another 
In such a way 
We underestimate the beauty and the power 
Of one, of one He opens up my fears 
To degrees I never thought existed 
And he opens up my heart 
To relieve the many pains afflicted What makes it so one can touch another 
In such a way 
We underestimate the beauty and the power 
Of one We weren't meant to be alone 
Though alone this life we leave and enter 
In existence of the flesh 
We all need to feel a hand that's tender One hand one heart can affect another 
In such a way 
We underestimate the beauty and the power 
Of one, of one, of one
