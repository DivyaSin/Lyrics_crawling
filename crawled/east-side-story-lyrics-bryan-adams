There was this girl I used to see, down on 42nd street 
She'd walk by on her way to work, n' make the air smell so sweet 
I used to sit in a coffee shop, sometimes I'd have a cup 
And when she'd go by, she'd light up the sky 
Like the sun coming up She be standin' by the bus stop, driver opened up the door 
I'd just sit an' watch her, getting on the one o four 
I wanna give her my number, I wanna tell her my name 
Wanna climb on board that cross-town bus 
Take a chance she feels the same It's just another east side story 
Everybody's got a tale to tell 
And like a hundred guys before me 
I fell under her spell Some things you hold on to, some you just let go 
Seems like the ones that you can't have 
Are the ones that you want most 
I think about her sometimes, I wonder if she was real 
And if I ever find her I'm gonna tell her how I feel It's just another east side story 
Everybody's got a tale to tell 
And like a hundred guys before me 
I fell on her spell, her spell Yeah, her spell It's still the same old story, it's still the same old game 
Up there on the east side, life goes on the same 
She never knew my number, never even knew my name 
She climbed on board that cross-town bus I never saw her again It's just another east side story 
Everybody's got a tale to tell 
Like a hundred guys before me 
I fell on her spell, her spell, her spell, yeah It's just another east side story 
It's just another east side story 
It's just another east side story
