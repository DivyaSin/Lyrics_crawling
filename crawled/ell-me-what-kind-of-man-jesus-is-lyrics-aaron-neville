Ananias, oh Ananias 
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is? 
Spoke to the wind, and the wind stood still. 
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is? (X2) 
Ananias, oh Ananias 
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is? 
Spoke to the sea, and the sea got calm. 
Tell me what kind of man jesus is? (X2) 
Ananias, oh Ananias 
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is? 
Spoke to the sick and the sick got well. 
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is? (X2) 
Ananias, oh Ananias 
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is? 
Spoke to the dead, and the dead would rise. 
Tell me what kind of man Jesus is?
