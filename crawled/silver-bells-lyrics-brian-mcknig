City sidewalks, busy sidewalks 
Dressed in holiday style 
In the air there's a feeling 
Of Christmas Children laughing, people passing 
Meeting smile after smile 
And on every street corner you'll hear Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day Strings of streetlights, even stoplights 
Blink of bright red and green 
As the shoppers rush home 
With their treasures Hear the snow crunch 
See the kids bunch 
This is Santa's big scene 
And above all the bustle you'll hear Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day Soon it will be Christmas day
