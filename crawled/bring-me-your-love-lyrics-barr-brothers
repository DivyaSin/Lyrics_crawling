Bring me the sweat of a concubine 
Bring me the cooing of a dove 
Bring me a quill from a northern pine 
And bring me your love Bring me the sword of a Samurai 
Bring me the stinger of a bee 
Bring me all the Queen's medicine 
And bring me your love And if in all these things we find 
A beauty rare and objectified 
If you bring your love in turn 
All these treasures I will burn Bring me the song of a narwhal 
Bring me a funeral drum 
Bring me the rose of Jericho 
And bring me your love Bring me the eye of a hurricane 
Bring me the dessert in a glove 
Bring me the dagger tattooed 
On Hemingway 
And bring me your love And if in all these things we find 
A beauty rare and objectified 
If you bring your love in turn 
All these treasures I will burn
