Producer for bonnie: ? 
Recorded in 1992 for sophie arbaniti 's album 'parafora', lyrics taken from 
Careful listening. First half of this song is in greek...so your guess is as good as mine - here's 
The english part... You move the veil from your face 
And escape from the world that is hurting 
You feel oppressed when you know 
That the words are killing the meaning There is no reason to hide in the dark 
When you're far from the fighting 
How can you dream in a world that is getting greyer than grey? 
You don't have to hide your face, there's no disgrace 
There's no harm in knowing that we're all a part of the human race You have got to lift your head, think of what he said 
You were born to know the truth, nothing but the truth, and what the truth is 
Worth Oh, the desert is in your heart 
In your heart 
The desert is in your heart 
In your heart 
It's so hard to try to forget 
So many thinks you regret 
You try to look back, but there's little to see 
Just nothing can't take this pain from me Oh, the desert is in your heart 
In your heart 
You don't have to hide your face 
There's no disgrace 
There's no harm in knowing we're all a part of the human race 
You have got to lift your head, think of what he said 
You were born to know the truth, nothing but the truth, and what the truth is 
Worth Oh, the desert is in your heart 
In your heart 
The desert is in your heart 
In your heart 
(greek) 
In your heart 
(greek) 
The desert is in your heart 
(greek) 
The desert is in your heart
