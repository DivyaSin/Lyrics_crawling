Broken heart 
One more time 
Pick yourself up 
Why even cry 
Broken pieces in your hands 
Wonder how you'll make it whole [Chorus] 
You know 
You pray 
This can't be the way 
You cry 
You say 
Something's gotta change 
And mend this porcelain heart of mine 
Of mine Someone said 
A broken heart would sting at first then make you stronger 
You wonder why this pain remains 
Were hearts made whole just to break [Chorus] Creator only you take brokenness 
And create it into beauty once again You know 
You pray 
This can't be the way 
You cry 
You say 
Something's gotta change You know 
You pray 
This can't be the way 
You cry 
You say 
Something's gotta change 
And mend this porcelain heart 
Please mend this porcelain heart 
Of mine, of mine 
Creator mend this heart
