They say loving nothing but the blues 
Everybody got the blue sometimes 
They say that loving nothing but the blues 
And everybody got the blue sometimes 
Come on over here, try me, baby 
Get a taste of this blues of mine I wanted you to know what it mean to be in love 
Do you know what it means to be mistreated day and night? 
Do you, do you, do you, do you know what it means to be in love? 
Do you know what it means to be mistreated day and night? 
Most of all when you love someone 
You always take the wrong instead of the right Lord, I wanna ask you 
Ain't it blue?
