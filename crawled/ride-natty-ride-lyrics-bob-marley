Dready got a job to do 
And he's got to fulfill that mission 
To see his hurt is their greatest ambition, yeah! 
But we will survive in this world of competition 
'Cause no matter what they do 
Natty keep on comin' through 
And no matter what they say 
Natty do them every day, yeah! 
Natty dread rides again 
Through the mystics of tomorrow 
Natty dread rides again 
Have no fear, have no sorrow, yeah! All and all you see a-gwan 
Is to fight against Rastaman 
So they build their world in great confusion 
To force on us the devil's illusion 
But the stone that the builder refuse 
Shall be the head cornerstone 
And no matter what game they play 
We got something they could never take away 
We got something they could never take away And it's the fire (fire), it's the fire (fire) 
That's burning down everything 
Feel that fire (fire), the fire (fire) 
Only the birds have their wings, yeah! 
No time to be deceived 
Oh, brothers, you should know and not believe 
Jah say this judgement, it could never be with water 
No water could put out this fire (fire) 
This fire (fire), this fire (fire) 
This fire (fire), a yaga y'all! ride, natty, ride! 
Go there, dready, go there, 
'Cause now the fire is out of control 
Panic in the city, wicked weeping for their gold! 
Everywhere this fire is burning, 
Destroying and melting their gold, 
Destroying and wasting their souls Go ride, natty, ride! 
Go there, dready, go there!
