Prisoners: 
Look down, look down 
Don't look 'em in the eye 
Look down, look down, 
You're here until you die Solo Prisoner: 
The sun is strong 
It's hot as hell below Prisoners: 
Look down, look down, 
There's twenty years to go Solo Prisoner: 
I've done no wrong! 
Sweet Jesus hear my prayer! Prisoners: 
Look down, look down, 
Sweet Jesus doesn't care Solo Prisoner: 
I know she'll wait, 
I know that she'll be true! Prisoners: 
Look down, look down, 
They've all forgotten you Solo Prisoner: 
When I get free ya won't see me 
Here for dust! Prisoners: 
Look down, look down 
Don't look 'em in the eye Solo Prisoner: 
How long O Lord 
Before you let me die? Prisoners: 
Look down, look down, 
You'll always be a slave 
Look down, look down, 
You're standing in your grave Javert: 
Bring me prisoner 24601 
Your time is up 
And your parole's begun 
You know what that means Valjean: 
Yes, it means I'm free! Javert: 
NO! 
It means you get your yellow ticket-of-leave 
You are a thief Valjean: 
I stole a loaf of bread! Javert: 
You robbed a house! Valjean: 
I broke a window pane! 
My sister's child was close to death 
And we were starving! Javert: 
And you will starve again 
Unless you learn the meaning of the law. Valjean: 
I know the meaning of these nineteen years 
A slave of the law Javert: 
Five years for what you did 
The rest because you tried to run 
Yes 24601 Valjean: 
My name is Jean Valjean Javert: 
And I am Javert 
Do not forget my name 
Do not forget me 
24601 Chorus: 
Look down, look down 
You'll always be a slave 
Look down, look down, 
You're standing in your grave. (Valjean leaves the prison and begins walking) Valjean: 
Freedom is mine. The Earth is still. 
I feel the wind. I breathe again. 
And the sky clears, the world is waiting. 
Drink from the pool. How clean the taste 
Never forget the years, the waste. 
Nor forgive them, for what they've done. 
They are the guilty, everyone. 
The day begins... 
and now let's see 
What this new world 
Will do for me! (Valjean finds work at a nearby farm) Farmer: 
You'll have to go 
I'll pay you off for the day 
Collect your bits and pieces there 
And be on your way. Valjean: 
You've given me half 
What the other men get! 
This handful of tin 
Wouldn't buy my sweat! Laborer: 
You broke the law 
It's there for people to see! 
Why should you get the same 
As honest men like me? (Valjean continues on his way) Valjean: 
Now every door is closed to me 
Another jail, another key, another chain 
For when I come to any town 
They check my papers 
And they find the mark of Cain 
In their eyes, I see their fear: 
'We do not want you here.' (Valjean reaches an inn) Innkeeper's Wife: 
My rooms are full 
And I've no supper to spare 
I'd like to help a stranger 
All we want is to be fair Valjean: 
I will pay in advance 
I can sleep in a barn 
You see how dark it is 
I'm not some kind of dog! Innkeeper: 
You leave my house 
Or feel the weight of my rod 
We're law-abiding people here 
Thanks be to God. (Valjean is thrown out) Valjean: 
And now I know how freedom feels 
The jailer always at your heels 
It is the law! This piece of paper in my hand 
That makes me cursed throughout the land 
It is the law! Like a cur 
I walk the street 
The dirt beneath their feet. (Valjean reaches the home of the Bishop of Digne, who emerges) Bishop: 
Come in, Sir, for you are weary 
And the night is cold out there. 
Though our lives are very humble 
What we have, we have to share. There is wine here to revive you, 
There is bread to make you strong, 
There's a bed to rest till morning, 
Rest from pain, and rest from wrong. Valjean: 
He let me eat my fill 
I had the lions share 
The silver in my hand 
Cost twice what I had earned 
In all those nineteen years 
That lifetime of despair 
And yet he trusted me. 
The old fool trusted me - 
He's done his bit of good 
I played the grateful serf 
And thanked him like I should 
But when the house was still, 
I got up in the night 
Took the silver 
Took... my... flight! (Taking the silver, Valjean runs away and is shortly brought back by two officers)
