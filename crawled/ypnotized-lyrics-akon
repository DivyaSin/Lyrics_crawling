(Feat. Plies) [Intro:] (Plies) 
Hey what's happening homie 
This lil boy plies man 
I ran across a nice lil babe the other day homie 
Lil mama so bad she had me hypnotized 
Couldn't even get my eyes out off her 
Imma tell you how it feels to be hypnotized [Chorus:] (Akon) 
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round, 
That booty keep bumping titties, just bouncing up and down 
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round, 
That booty keep bumping titties, just bouncing up and down [Verse:] (Plies) 
It's 2 o'clock in the morning 
I'm yiked up and I'm horny 
All I need now is some moaning 
That pussy got me zonen 
O fine tell me she wanted 
She got it fuck how she on me 
I got it now cause she jonning 
I know in the panty she foamin' 
I locked eyes on that monkey 
I know she wet cause she told me 
That ass on her she pokin' 
Every nigga in here stokin' 
I see me up and I'm pocking 
She bend over and I'm stroking 
Her cheeks spread wide open 
I beatin' it and I'm focused [Chorus:] (Akon) 
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round, 
That booty keep bumping titties, just bouncing up and down 
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round, 
That booty keep bumping titties just bouncing up and down, (Bridge X2) (Akon) 
Now do it some more (just like that), just do it some more (yes just like that), girl do it some more (now shake that ass, make a nigga like me spend that cash) [Verse 2:] (Plies) 
She bad as hell and she swoll 
I'm tryn to play in her hole 
Lil mama down, she cold 
I fuck her once and she's sold 
I want her naked, no cloths 
I'm in the private shows 
No limits anything goes 
Imma let her ride me on her toes 
Just stand on front of me and pose 
You touch mine I touch yours 
Then get her sprung is my goal 
First time I seen her I froze 
I had to get her she know 
She worked then she fall 
Cause I'm too real and she know 
She want the goon and then show [Chorus:] (Akon) 
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round, 
That booty keep bumping titties, just bouncing up and down 
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round, 
That booty keep bumping titties, just bouncing up and down (Bridge X2) (Akon) 
Now do it some more (just like that), just do it some more (yes just like that), girl do it some more (now shake that ass, make a nigga like me spend that cash) [Chorus:] (Akon) 
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round, 
That booty keep bumping titties, just bouncing up and down 
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round, 
That booty keep bumping titties, just bouncing up and down
