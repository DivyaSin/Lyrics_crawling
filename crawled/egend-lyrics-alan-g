On the day I became a legend 
Holy fire rained down from the clouds 
And the spirit came, callin' out my name 
And I spoke the truth... out loud So a legend was born in the backwoods 
When I found the strength to be me 
Cuz I made the choice, and I found my voice 
The truth has set me free I remember, there in the darkness 
When the silence kept me bound 
But now I'll speak with an honesty 
That was lost but now is found And a legend will rise in the backwoods 
Of a boy who's just startin' to fly 
I will take my place, don't forget this face 
And I'll write my name in the sky I can see my Jesus smilin' 
When I say I'm not afraid 
And when I shout out my Hallelujah 
You'll see the star the Lord has made Now the legend's alive in the backwoods 
For a boy who can shout "I believe" 
Cuz I made the choice, and I found my voice 
The truth has set me free Come on out 
And open your mouth 
Life's what you allow 
Leave your old fears far behind 
Let them hear you now Bring the legend home to the backwoods 
For the ones who still live silent lives 
Tell them not to fear, cuz the time is here 
To write our names in the sky Keep the legend alive in the backwoods 
Live the honest life that you seek 
You must make the choice, and you'll find your voice 
The truth will set you free The truth will set you free 
You must make the choice, and you'll find your voice 
The truth will set-- 
The truth will set, the truth will set you free
