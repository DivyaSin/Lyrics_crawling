Sometimes I almost stop my breathing 
When I think how much I love you 
And sometimes I feel like crying 
For no reason at all Sometimes I feel that I can't take it 
Seeing all the love coming at me from your eyes 
And sometimes I feel like crying 
For no reason at all Sometimes I get a little crazy 
I think o' you and my head gets hazy 
And sometimes I just can think at all 
Oh, baby I love you Sometimes when I feel myself reaching for you 
I can't believe you're lying there beside me 
And sometimes I feel like crying 
For no reason at all Sometimes I get a little crazy 
I think o' you and my head gets hazy 
And sometimes I just can't think at all 
Oh, baby I love you Sometimes I feel myself reaching for you 
I can't believe you're lying there beside me 
And sometimes I feel like crying 
For no reason at all 
For no reason at all
