Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor 
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door 
See if I cry 
See if I shed a single sorry tear 
Can't say that it's been that great 
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus] 
Everybody sees 
And everyone agrees 
That you and I are wrong 
And it's been that way to long 
Take it as it comes 
And be thankful when it's done 
There's so many ways to act 
And there's many shades of black 
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out 
Say what's on your mind 
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind 
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall 
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue 
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black 
There's so many shades of black 
Yeah there's any shades of black 
There's so many shades of black 
Yeah there's many shades of black 
There's so many shades of black 
And there's many shades of black 
There's so many shades of black Go ahead...
