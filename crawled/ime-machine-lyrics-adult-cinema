Everyday I wish for a time machine 
Take me back to the day 
When the music and houses and people 
Had style and beauty, you know, you know 
Had style and beauty you know Everyday I lock myself up and I 
Try to figure a way back 
But I'm stuck here in time of such ugliness 
Eating my time away, away 
It's eating my time away Oh, I guess I am here to stay 
There's no time for beauty 
They've taken those times away Oh, I guess this will be the way 
There's no time for beauty 
They've taken those times away Oh, I guess I am here to stay 
There's no time for beauty 
They've taken those times away Oh, I guess this will be the way 
There's no time for beauty 
They've taken those times 
No time for beauty 
They've taken those times 
No time for beauty 
They've taken those times away Everyday I wish for a time machine 
Take me back to the day 
When the music and houses and people 
Had style and beauty, you know, you know 
Had style and beauty you know
