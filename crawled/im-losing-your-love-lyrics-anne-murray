Stars are falling from your eyes 
You don't feel what I feel inside 
Your hand is warm but your heart is cold 
If you're hurtin' you don't let it show. How much longer can you go on 
Actin' like there's nothin' wrong 
How much farther can we drift apart 
Before all the feeling is gone. I'm losing your love, it's slippin' away 
Minute by minute, day by day 
I'm losing your love, don't you think I know 
It's a matter of time 'til you let go. I see the moon shinin' up above 
Reminded me how good it was 
There's a chill comin' over me 
Why can't it be like it used to be. I feel so helpless, I can't make you stay 
No matter how hard I try 
I can't deny that look in your eyes 
Tryin' to tell me goodbye. I'm losing your love, it's slippin' away 
Minute by minute, day by day 
Oh, I'm losing your love, don't you think I know 
It's a matter of time 'til you let go. --- Instrumental --- Well, I'm losing your love, it's slippin' away 
Minute by minute, day by day 
Well, I'm losing your love, don't you think I know 
It's a matter of time 'til you let go. Slippin' away minute by minute, day by day 
Oh, I'm losing your love don't you think I know...
