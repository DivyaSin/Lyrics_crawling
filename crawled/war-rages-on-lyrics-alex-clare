The war rages on 
You'll be at my side 
through it all 
Through hardships unseen 
We still survive, fortified Please don't pass me by 
Can't you hear me calling out your name 
Forgive the things I do 
Don't turn your back when I need you 
The war rages on When darkness comes 
You're like a burning light 
Through it all 
When a storm knocks me down 
You pull from the depths, time after time Please don't pass me by 
Can you hear me calling out your name Please forgive the things I do 
Don't turn your back when I need you The war rages on I'm still here by your side 
Blood of the dawn ends the darkest of nights 
War rages On I'm still here by your side 
Blood of the dawn ends the darkest of nights Please don't pass me by 
Can't you hear me calling out your name 
Please forgive the things I do 
Don't turn your back when I need you 
The war rages on
