I had forgotten the incredible butter softness of his long fingers 
How they felt on my back when he slow-dragged with me, 
At a fateful "Blue Lights in the Basement" party 
The dim lights making his honey-colored eyes barely visible as he, 
Flashed a penlight in my eyes! 
"Look directly into the light this time" I say look into the light 
See what you look like [Chorus] 
(I scribble on a clean surface, the earthless and worthless) 
(It's life, at the tunnel of the point of purchase) 
(Ey yo freedom got a microphone, and a AK) 
(Make way, and prepare for the melee) The microphone magic of Aceyalone 
The method of my madness could never! Be known 
Don't, try to set home or off of the dome 
Because wigs are known to be split! 
And a, fan is known to be hit with shit 
Rubber band flows that snap back in place 
Rap in they face, get this motherfucker outta here 
He talks way way way way! too much 
Spit for the victory, 'til they sick of me 
I never wallow in the bickery or trickery 
There's no con-fusion, just the fusion! 
No il-LUSION, 'cause God rule them Held high, nailed in the sky 
The artistic eye leaves you mystified 
You're once denied, soon openly obliged [Chorus] They say, "rock you don't stop" but what you talkin' bout 
Well let me guess, you come fi test 
But test not he who knows best, put nonsense to rest 
Preachin' on a soapbox, dope on the block 
Choke on your tongue, smoke from the gun 
Broke in the middle, I hope you're havin' fun 
High! Post, high dose, high strung 
Wind through the lungs, spirit of the young 
Salt on the slug, caught with the plug 
Fought with the drugs, taught by the thugs 
Eye of a tiger, head of a lion 
Walkin' through the interior of Siberia 
Chip away at the rock, or a dynamite block 
Right where they had to stop, we continue 
Think the worst, ink into the verse 
Sink into the earth, die by the end of the rhyme 
What a rush, too much to discuss 
I close it up by sayin' this [Chorus]
