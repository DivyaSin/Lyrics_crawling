[Bridge] 
Two shots, I'm about that gold 
Ricochet then a nigga's brain all over your way 
All day 
'Cause a nigga from [?] 
Stay useless, no chain with a pendant 
Then the pending, access pinned it 
Get about your house you a now an ex-tenant 
I'm stranded when I'm stranded 
And a nigga brain feel like its damaged uh [Hook] 
I'm screaming out, "Bitch, I'm Swank Corleone" 
I get you out your seat, so put me up on your throne 
I'm screaming out, "Bitch, I swank like the king" 
I been with the flow, the illest you know 
Swanking with my own team [Verse 1] 
Motherfuckers wanna test me 
I tell 'em get off the testes 
They swimming in my sack 
While I'm revving the jet ski 
Yeah no nothing nice 
Like they back say [?] 
So deadly, I [?] so hefty 
Don't tempt me, before you see the inside 
Fuck a rap beef, I wanna see the bitch drive 
Road to a million, before the age of 25 
I'm tryna survive, fuck every limit they provide 
I got ties to 47 niggas who ride 
Cooking up dope, everyone get a piece of the pie 
Can't control me, I'm following your time 
You're my son bitch I get it outta line 
Leave it up to me to bring it back to the real 
Bustin' through your window, so you better chill 
I never waste time when I'm with your bitch 
So I grab her waistline, give her dick 
It's the nigga who did it 
Everyone talk, let's see who really live it 
We the only niggas who never spitting a gimmick 
'Cause these other motherfuckers is fake 
I can feel it 
Living the false prophesy for the Gs 
They rats facing to the trap, fumbling the keys 
They tryna see who will open my door first 
I, Romney kill, but nigga the floor worse 
I had to drop 16, to give them they all hearse 
Nigga what's new? You fucking with my old word? 
Nigga that's cool 
No time for pussy, still fucking your honey 
Catching up, then a nigga run back to the money 
Ain't shit funny, you a joke to a king 
Sipping Ace of Spades, but it never been a thing 
I was taught to get it by any means 
So my enemies never had a chance of ending me [Bridge] 
Two shots, I'm about that gold 
Ricochet then a nigga's brain all over your way 
All day 
'Cause a nigga from [?] 
Stay useless, no chain with a pendant 
Then the pending, access pinned it

I'm screaming out, "Bitch, I swank like the king" 
I been with the flow, the illest you know 
Swanking with my own team [Verse 2] 
You know my dick game one hunnid 
Shit is [?] 
Put my money where your mouth is 
Baby better respect 
The nigga who really be the illest without an effort 
Trying to be the ruler of everything within my measure 
My nigga I'm very clever, let me guess you too? 
You seen a nigga on YouTube, now you you 
What a coincidence, I know you feelin' it 
But this is how it's really done, see my niggas militant 
Steady killing shit 
Step into my ring get boxed in 
The most diverse but they saying we boxed in 
So even if you drop a pin you couldn't find me 
So how do the fuck you niggas know what the sound be? 
You and your clown team finna get packed within a black Ac' 
We 21 deep and finna blackjack 
Fuck a hashtag, ending the bullies is who I laugh at 
Every rapper getting smoked with a ash hat 
'Cause every time a nigga spit I wanna kill 'em quick 
I thought I taught y'all, nigga take a syllabus 
You better study what we giving out 
'Cause a nigga never missing but you [?] out 
All shots that I take leave 'em critical 
No guns but I'm aiming for the pinnacle 
They reminiscing over you but fuck it I keep it flossin' 
'Cause every nigga that I remember already lost it 
I throw it over your head, leap frog shit 
It's time to show you who the real fucking boss is 
I draw the fifth from a draw when you talk shit 
You made it lit from a clip when I toss this 
My nigga Nyck says you need to be cautious 
When you walk in through Corleone's [?] 
Posing with the dollars, nigga I'm balling 
I'm Curry with the shot like a block I'm all in [Bridge] 
Two shots, I'm about that gold 
Ricochet then a nigga's brain all over your way 
All day 
'Cause a nigga from [?]
