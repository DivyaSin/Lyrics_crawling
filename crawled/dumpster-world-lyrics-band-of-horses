Worn and tattered, evils of the Western world 
Real better, over in America 
The weather, so serene and calm 
Unseasonably warm Light a candle for the sufferin' ones 
Light a candle for the weak and the small 
God damn it, there's a lot of 'em 
Kinda think that in the modern world Holy terror 
Asleep when the alarms went off 
You're in the mirror 
Studyin' your golden locks I love you 
Lets marry when the time is right 
Or whenever, you like Say a prayer for all the people that died 
Say another for me once in awhile 
I hit rock bottom, I'm gettin' old 
I was really hopin' that the modern world Happy livin' in a dumpster world 
Break out everybody in the jail, 
Lets get it on Let out the wolves 
I'm happy livin' in a dumpster world 
Bring on the booze 
Start it off We won't be arrested, 
For nothin' now 
Don't pick up that trash 
Put, more of it on the ground Bust out the drugs 
I'm happy livin' in a dumpster world 
Everyone in jail 
Yeah, lets get it on Let out all the wolves 
I'm happy livin' in a dumpster world 
That's mine now 
Come and get it on Bust out the drugs Light a candle for the sufferin' ones 
Light a candle for the weak and the small 
Say a prayer for all the people who've gone 
There's no hope for any modern world
