When you're feeling lost and lonely 
And when people treat you coldly 
Close your eyes - you're right there when you think there's nothing up there 
When a doubt becomes a nightmare 
Close your eyes - you're right there you can escape this place 
You can forget this place 
Anywhere's better, kinder, brighter 
Two islands 
Two islands 
They'll take you to their hearts 
My islands nowhere so peaceful 
Nowhere as blissful 
I will always remember my two islands with love 
They will never grow old when your week is made of mondays 
When your road is going sideways 
Close your eyes - you're right there when you swim against the current 
And your arms are getting tired 
Close your eyes - you're right there you can escape this place 
You can forget this place 
Anywhere's better, kinder, brighter 
Two islands, two islands 
They wait for me 
I know my islands nowhere so peaceful 
Nowhere as blissful 
I will always remember my two islands with love 
They will never grow old they came to us for a reason 
Leaving memories we can lean on 
Close your eyes - you're right there one day if I go to heaven 
We will be again together 
Far away from here 
My two islands wait for me
