Grandpa met Grandma back in 1962 
He's still got that picture of them in that car blue 
And he tells these stories about living life and love 
About them against the world and never giving up, he said Put the pedal to the metal with the top down dreaming 
Hands on the wheel with the engine screaming 
Remember what you give is what you get 
It goes by fast it goes by quick 
If you stand on the sidelines watching it 
Or life will pass you by like a blue corvette I was 21 when he handed me the keys 
He said boy she's all yours, fill'er up with memories 
She'll take you through the ups and down 
Any storm that comes along 
If you drive her right, she'll never steer you wrong Put the pedal to the metal with the top down dreaming 
Hands on the wheel with the engine screaming 
Remember what you give is what you get 
It goes by fast it goes by quick 
If you stand on the sidelines watching it 
Or life will pass you by like a blue corvette I drove that car the way he said 
And then i met the girl 
Now it's her and I 
Whatever comes 
It's us against the world, yeah 
Blue Corvette Put the pedal to the metal with the top down dreaming 
Hands on the wheel with the engine screaming 
Remember what you give is what you get 
Oh, It goes by fast it goes by quick 
If you stand on the sidelines watching it 
Or life will pass you by like a blue corvette Don't let life pass you by like a blue corvette 
like a blue corvette
