One song about a girl 
I can't breathe when I'm around her 
I'll wait here everyday 
In case you scratch the surface 
She'll never notice I'm not in love 
This is not my heart 
I'm not gonna waste these words 
About a girl Last night I knew what to say 
But you weren't there to hear it 
These lines: so well rehearsed 
Tongue-tied and overloaded 
You never noticed I'm not in love 
This is not my heart 
I'm not gonna waste these words 
About a girl I'm not in love 
This is not your song 
I'm not gonna waste these words 
About a girl To be loved, to be loved 
What more could you ask for? 
To be loved, to be loved 
Everyone wants to be loved 
To be loved 
What more could you ask for 
To be loved, to be loved 
Everyone... I'm not in love 
This is not my heart 
I'm not gonna waste these words I'm not in love 
This is not my heart 
I'm not gonna waste these words 
About a girl I'm not in love 
(To be loved, to be loved, what more could you ask for?) 
This is not your song 
(To be loved, to be loved, everyone wants) 
I'm not gonna waste these words 
(To be loved, to be loved, what more could you ask for?) 
About a girl
