I can taste it in the love I breathe 
I feel taken in 
A flame within 
It's you 
That I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling I surrender to the urge I feel 
You redeem my soul 
Break my fall 
It's true 
Now I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming back to you Whenever you hold me 
Wherever you reach me 
Forever in between, 
From time to time 
Wherever you find me 
Whenever you feel me 
Life is by my side And I don't look behind 
I feel life walking by my side 
Time and space undefined 
I want life beating by my side Drop my crutches I have died enough 
Heaven knows my pain 
My attempts in vain 
Again 
I recover, recover, recover, recover Descend for me to give me wings 
Just lead me on 
When hope is gone 
With you 
I'll be rising and rising and rising and rising once again
