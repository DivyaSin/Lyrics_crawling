i spy yellow green roses in mary's garden 
i am god don't love you anymore 
down in new orleans 
i know where the devil dwells 
within ya 
i have loved the whore 
i know how it feels down there 
down in new orleans 
i spy yellow blue sky pie 
between the teeth of whores 
god don't love you anymore 
down there 
down in new orleans
