I've been taking this time you've been wasting to write down what's inside 
Of my mind that's been so hard to find since you came along and took me for a ride 
Let's get together in spite of the weather I'm floating here until we all capsize 
I'll think of you Holding off till someone shows me 
Holding on till someone knows the way I'm sedated and self medicated now I can't hear your pleas 
Getting higher I've drawn friendly fire, this tight rope walk is murder on my knees 
It's an art that gets lost from the start you can paint it now anyway you see 
Still think of you Holding off till someone shows me 
Holding on till someone knows the way I'm waiting for you to understand 
I'm waiting for you to tell me its all OK Anything you want now 
Anything you need now 
I couldn't get for you 
Its broken hearts that don't pass start 
Its broken dreams that drive you like they do Feel mostly dead now....but somehow... slightly alive 
Caught in your head wind......a dead spin.....I start to dive 
I'm earthbound........one last round......So dead tired 
Now of you Holding off till someone shows me 
Holding on till someone knows the way I waited for you to understand 
I waited for you to tell me it would be OK
