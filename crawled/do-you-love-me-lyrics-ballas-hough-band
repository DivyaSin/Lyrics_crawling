Girl I can't believe you got me hanging from a thread 
Every time you need me you're just messing with my head 
Well if you love then you love me baby let me know 
And if you don't why don't you leave me baby let me go 
You then twist me inside out 
Girl you know I feel like I've been waiting for a lifetime 
Come around [Chorus] 
Do you love me baby 
Cause I'm going crazy 
Let me know girl if you feel me breaking now 
If you want me tonight 
I'll be right by your side 
And if you don't then I'll be leaving 
Right now How am I supposed to know to know what's going through your mind 
Girl you know I wish that we could stop this and rewind 
If you want me you'll be there every second and 
And you thought that I would never ever be your man 
Now the tables are turned upside down 
But don't cha know I feel like I've been waiting for a lifetime 
Until I come around [Chorus] I'm tired of waiting 
Hesitating 
It's taking a toll on me 
Girl can you get off you mind- wrong [Chorus: x2]
