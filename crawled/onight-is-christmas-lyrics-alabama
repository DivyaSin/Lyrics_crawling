The factories are all shut down and the shopping malls are all closed 
And the busy streets are all empty except for the falling snow 
And in the small towns, in the cities families gather as one 
'Cause the night of love and sharing they look forward to has come [Chorus] 
'cause tonight is Christmas, tonight is love 
Tonight we celebrate god's one and only son 
Tonight there's hope for peace on earth eternally 
Tonight is Christmas and the world's in harmony But across the seas two armies stare down at each other's guns 
Each believing in their cause enough to die or kill the other one 
But tonight there'll be no shooting, not a drop of blood will spill 
They will cease their fire this silent night in the name of peace and goodwill [Chorus]
