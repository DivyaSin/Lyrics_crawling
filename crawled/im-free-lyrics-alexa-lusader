Just tell me you're over me 
How hard can it be? 
Does it matter? Don't say you can't sleep at night 
Without me by your side 
And you're shattered I'm over it 
You're over it 
Let's call it a day 
I'll burn the pictures we took together 
And throw them away (Chorus) 
Cause I'm free free free 
As the air I breathe 
Yeah, i'm free free free as the open sea 
yeah yeah yeah my baby was holding me back from my dream 
Now I can see that 
I'm free free free as a girl can be Don't say I'm still with you 
Cause it isn't true 
You're a liar I'm calling all the shots 
Cause i'm breaking out 
You're so fired I'm over it 
You're over it 
Let's call it a day 
My friends all got my back 
And i'm ready to play Cause I'm free free free 
As the air I breathe 
Yeah, i'm free free free as the open sea 
yeah yeah yeah my baby was holding me back from my dream 
Now I can see that 
I'm free free free as a girl can be No ring and no regret 
It's been over for some time 
Now when I feel like letting go 
The universe is mine all mine Cause I'm free free free 
As the air I breathe 
Yeah, i'm free free free as the open sea 
yeah yeah yeah my baby was holding me back from my dream 
Now I can see that 
I'm free free free as a girl can be
