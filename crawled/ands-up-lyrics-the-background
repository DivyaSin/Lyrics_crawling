Hey it's true. I know a million people just like you. 
You always want to talk. You never want to walk or follow through. 
Is it me? Or is this world full of hate a greed? 
I could never waste a smile. I'm staying for a while. This is all I need. I heard you say it's been a while since you've had a good day. 
Well maybe I can change that babe. Maybe we can up and leave this place. 
I see the way that you stare at the floor. You're wondering if there's something more. Get up, stand up, and make some noise. Throw your hands up and raise your voice. 
This is the future it's your choice. Throw your hands up now. Excuse me for trying to be a gentleman. Here is the now and now is where I want to live. 
Now is the time to be yourself and be positive. You can do it if you say you can. 
Is it me? Or is it hard to find some time to breath? 
You're always on the go but you never really know when it's time to leave. 
I see the way that you stare at the floor. You're wondering if there's something more.
