Crime, it only comes in waves 
I keep one side in distress, the other side of me saved 
Times, why do they always change? 
I keep one foot in the grass, the other foot in the grave 
the other foot in the grave So take what you want and more 
As I'm giving myself away 
I don't care what you use it for 
It's of no use to me, of no use to me 
For so long I've been forlorn 
And I guess it's just as well 
My body and mind are worn 
Send me right back down 
Back down to hell Rhythms in almost every phrase 
One line leads to the next until i choose to refrain 
My mind, why does it always change? 
I keep one side of it stressed, the other side of it sane 
The other side of it sane
