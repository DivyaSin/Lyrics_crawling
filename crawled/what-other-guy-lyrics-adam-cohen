know what you look like in the morning 
Your kisses are soft and warm 
I can draw you with my eyes closed 
See you with nothing on but the radio I know how many years of French you took 
Your favorite movies, your favorite books 
I know what really gets you going glowing I know where you go with your beautiful friends 
I know what you taste like when the night ends I know the kind of thing that makes you laugh 
The way you tilt your head for a photograph 
What other guy knows you like that? And I can name the first guy you ever kissed 
I can name the perfume on your wrist 
What other guy knows you like that? Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne I know what you want by what you're wearing 
The kind of night you're preparing I know what your hands do when you're kissing 
Your number one and number two favorite positions 
I know how your skin glistens, listen 
I know where you go with your beautiful friends 
I know what you taste like when the night ends I know the kind of thing that makes you laugh 
The way you tilt your head for a photograph 
What other guy knows you like that? And I can name the first guy you ever kissed 
I can name the perfume on your wrist 
What other guy knows you like that? Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne I know where you go with your beautiful friends 
Yes I know 
I know what you taste like when the night ends I know the kind of thing that makes you laugh 
The way you tilt your head for a photograph 
What other guy knows you like that? Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne 
Oh, Anne
