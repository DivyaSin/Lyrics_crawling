Once upon a time it was for real 
Nothing mattered, then we were together 
And I couldn't ask for more 
My dream came true 
You were nearest to my heart I can't make you love me anymore 
Nothing matters now when you are gone 
Tried so many times before 
Only now I understand 
We never felt the same But I don't mind 
I don't mind 
A better combination won't be hard to find 
Got to learn to walk again 
It's so new, being free 
Start the life of different kind 
No more us 
From now on it's, me I know this empty room too well 
I've got to plan my new life's resolutions 
First of all I show you how I can survive 
I never knew that I could laugh like this So I don't mind 
I don't mind 
A better combination won't be hard to find 
Got to learn to walk again 
It's so new, being free 
Start the life of different kind 
No more us 
From now on it's, me I don't mind [Repeat x16] Got to learn to walk again 
It's so new, being free 
Start the life of different kind 
No more us 
From now on it's, me Once upon a time it was for real 
Nothing mattered then we were together 
You were nearest to my heart 
Only now I understand 
We never felt the same 
I don't mind,I don't mind, I don't mind 
I don't mind,I don't mind, I don't mind 
I don't mind 
I don't mind,I don't mind, I don't mind
