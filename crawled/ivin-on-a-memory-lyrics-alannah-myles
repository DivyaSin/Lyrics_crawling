The street light crawls into a bare bulb hotel 
Where dead eyes shine there's a story to tell 
It's a life of crime on a bed of stone 
When the devil calls you're better off alone, ah And now I'm hiding from the light 
Running from my destiny 
Haunted by a flame 
Lying low, livin' on a memory The bugs still bite and the breezes blow 
Between your dreams right through your clothes 
Days roll by like cars on a train 
And the August sky still looks like rain, ah And now I'm hiding from the light 
Running from my destiny 
Haunted by a flame 
Lying low, livin' on a memory Haunted by a dream 
Can't escape this reverie 
Trying to break away 
Lying low, livin' on a memory I'll be walking behind you, I'm a face on the wind 
I'll be watchin', still payin' for my sins 
I'm drifting down, river so slow 
The lights of town are beginning to glow And I'm hiding from the light 
Running from my destiny 
Haunted by a flame 
Lying low, livin' on a memory Haunted by a dream 
Can't escape from this reverie 
Trying to break away 
Lying low, livin' on a memory [Incomprehensible] 
[Incomprehensible] 
Let me break away 
Set me free [Incomprehensible] with me, yeah
