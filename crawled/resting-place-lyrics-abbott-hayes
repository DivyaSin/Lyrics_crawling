"I think it's time we turn and face the music 
I think it's time we went our separate ways 
But first we'll ride (one last time) across the country 
Just to find our final resting place" "I think it's time we stepped down from the gallows 
I think you were wrong when you lead us both astray 
And we should stay on the path straight and narrow 
I always thought we were better off this way" "If you want me then fight for me baby 
Don't let it come apart at the seams 
And though we lie in different beds, in different places 
In our minds we were dreaming the same dreams" Don't give me those 
Well known weary eyes 
Coming around time after time 
Don't give me those 
Same old tired lines 
I've heard before night after night
