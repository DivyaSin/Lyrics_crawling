Outside in the rain 
Amongst those outdoor sounds 
I know you feel no pain 
Underneath that ground 
I feel my body wane 
As my head lays down 
Upon your hard packed grave 
I lie here with you now 
everyday Well I set myself some boundaries 
That went no further than the foot of my bed 
And for the first few months I laid there 
Trying to disconnect my head 
It was this helplessness I'm feeling 
It was the stiffness of regret 
If you could see just what I was doing 
You'd know I'd forgotten what you said "You'll tear yourself apart with hate, love 
Trying to keep it all inside 
Instead of dwelling on my fate, love 
Learn to celebrate my life 
Keep pushing forward every way, love 
Taking every day in stride 
Taking every day in stride"
