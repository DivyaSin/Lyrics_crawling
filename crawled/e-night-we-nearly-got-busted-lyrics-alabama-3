Jack, he don't chill 
He's popped too many pills 
Says he's gonna set all the people free 
Jane's much the same 
She's never played the game 
They used to like to keep me company 
They never could stand still 
Always up on that hill 
Said they oughta check out the territory 
'Cause, see, the word was out 
There was no doubt about it 
Undercover men on every corner of their property 
But Jack, he just took Jane by the hand 
He said, 'Come on over here a while, honey 
'Cause tonight I'm gonna take you right back 
You remember that night 
We used to feel so fine.' The night we nearly got busted 
Got down on our knees 
The night we nearly got busted 
It was the Lord who set us free We nearly got busted, but me and Larry Love, we're just too damn slick Well Jane, all those thrills 
They started to spill out all over 
She said she could, she could hear them talking in the hall 
Jack just used to fill up that broken cup 
He swore he saw 'em 
Looking through the holes in the motel wall 
But he said 'Hey, baby, we got time to kill 
Eat another goddamn pill 
I'm gonna check out the coastguard's commentary 
'Cause I believe our ship is comin' in tonight 
And I feel so fine 
I'm gonna spin out another tale of sweet testimony 
So come on over here, baby 
Come on over here, baby 
I'm gonna take you by the hand to the Promised Land 
'Cause remember that night? 
You used to feel so fine 
You used to feel so fine.' The night we nearly got busted 
Got down on our knees 
The night we nearly got busted 
It was the Lord who set us free We can't wait, can't hesitate, they're picking the padlocks at the gate 
Smell the violence, blind suckers on the side of silence 
Are smiling, giving the eye 
Checking out our fingerprint files 
Inquiries, digging in our diaries 
The motherfuckers been a-messin' with the phone line
