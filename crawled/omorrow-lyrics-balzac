Go! 
Kioku no hashi ni nokoru sono gensoo [In the end, memory remains that illusion] 
(It's coming down) 
Soshite soko ni aritsuzukeru [And there it continues on] 
Genjitsu no gaiki nogareru kota ha naku [The "gaiki" in reality never goes away] 
(It's coming down) 
Soshite soko ni aritsuzukeru [And there it continues on] 
Nagareru toki o koba mitsuzukete [The flow of time refuses to continue] 
(Soo) Kyooki sae gitte [So even the madness passes by] 
Nani o motome tsuzukerunda? [What do you continue searching?] 
(In the night) 
Kioku no naka ni utsushi da sareta (sono) gensoo [that illusion you see in the memory] 
(It's coming down) 
Soshite soko ni aritsuzukeru [And there it continues on] 
Never waiting for tomorrow! I will not wait for tomorrow 
(I will not wait for tomorrow) Far away 
(I) never waiting (for) tomorrow
