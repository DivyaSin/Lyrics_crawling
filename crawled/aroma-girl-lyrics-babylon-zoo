There is somethin' strange deep inside her brain 
I don't know where to start this bionic heart in my imagination 
I wonder, how low, how low, how low is your soul 
I don't know what to say it's a fool's parade 
There's a million stars tearing us apart in my imagination 
I wonder how low, how low, how low is your soul 
In my imagination I wonder how low, how low, how low is your soul *Say that that you want me, the fear is gone, the fear is gone 
Waitin' for the midnight run to carry me home, aroma girl, aroma girl You and me we are so manic, never satisfied 
There's no way we're runnin' outta time 
People say the government's to blame, why do we live this way? 
Life is strange, there's no one left to blame, how do we live this way oh me?
