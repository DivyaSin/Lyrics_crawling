Tonight I went to a punk rock show 
The band was really good and the lights were all low 
I saw one on my left, I saw one on my right 
Those punk rock chicks really made my night Gimme gimme gimme one sweet punk rock chick 
I said they look so good and yeah they look so fine 
Gimme gimme gimme one sweet punk rock chick 
Yeah one of these days I'll make one mine all mine To the one on the left I said, "How do you do?" 
She showed me her ring and said, "Toodaloo" 
To the one on the right I said, "What do you know?" 
But I had to leave because of her b.o. Tonight I'm gonna get me one sweet punk rock girl 
'cause they're the coolest in all the world 
I'll see one at the show and I'll know for sure 
That she's the one for me and I'm the one for her 
It'll be so fun 
Gotta get me one
