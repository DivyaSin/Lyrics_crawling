Walking down the street, you stare at your feet 
And never do you let your eyes meet the freaks, 
The deadbeat addicts, social fanatics, 
They're a dime a dozen and they carry guns 
Halloween, every other day of the week 
Living in a cage in the USA 
Living in a cage in the USA 
Holy smoke! somebody blew up the pope 
Living in a cage in the USA [Chorus] 
All around us the rules are changing 
Taller walls and stronger cages 
Nothing is sacred or too outrageous 
Taller walls and stronger cages 
What in the world has happened to the world 
What in the world Driving your Mercedes you think you're safe 
But there's no escape in a world of hateful 
Criminal minds with guns and knives 
Who say "Give me your ride or give your life" 
Halloween, every other day of the week 
Living in a cage in the USA 
Living in a cage in the USA 
Holy smoke! somebody blew up the pope 
Living in a cage in the USA [Chorus]
