Dear whoever, do you remember? 
It's me, old whatshername 
Can't believe it, you ain't dreaming 
I don't look quite the same But history repeats itself 
I kept making a scene 
I kept raising hell 
Now they call me a queen 
And you're under my spell 
Tell me how does it feel? 
Well... I'm looking down from the skyline 
Dancing on the moonlight 
Can you see my name in the stars? 
Yeah, I bet you won't forget me now 
My voice on the airwaves 
It's echoing louder and louder 
I bet you won't forget me now 
I bet you won't forget me now Hey whoever, it's been forever 
I know you know my name 
I heard you're still trying to steal my throne 
I guess some things never change Always knew I'd make it out 
Live a life you dream about 
And now the world's in my hands 
According to plan I'm looking down from the skyline 
Dancing on the moonlight 
Can you see my name in the stars? 
Yeah, I bet you won't forget me now 
My voice on the airwaves 
Echoing louder and louder 
I bet you won't forget me now 
I bet you won't forget me now Said you were gonna run this town 
Now you just get high and drive around 
It didn't happen like you thought it would, yeah 
Hit me up like "hope you're good 
And "can you put me on the list tonight? 
And by the way I've got this clothing line" 
Try to talk like we're old friends 
But you don't even know who I am I'm looking down from the skyline 
Dancing on the moonlight 
Can you see my name in the stars? 
Yeah, I bet you won't forget me now 
My voice on the airwaves 
Echoing louder and louder 
I bet you won't forget me now 
I bet you won't forget me now I bet you won't forget me now 
I bet you won't forget me now 
I bet you won't
