I'm taking it back I'm making a pact 
I will make you indispensable 
I spoke to myself, oh I might as well 
And let you just be made sensible 
Tell me your thoughts so I can 
Love you in spite of them 
But now I'm happy if I 
Never lose sight of them [Chorus:] 
I'll take it back - I never said it did 
And that's a fact - as of a month ago 
But now that the worst is over 
I can just take it back Oh lovers they come, another call from 
A phone booth somewhere in "Lovertown" 
It isn't so bad those others I've had 
It isn't as if I'm losing ground 
I'm getting better when I 
Annex myself from you 
It ought be another 
Country I'm moving to [Chorus:] I'd like to throw myself a 
Million miles an hour 
I'd like to feel before the 
Feeling goes sour [Chorus:] 
So take it back - I never said I did 
And that's a fact - as of a month ago 
But now that the worst is over 
I can just take it 
But now that the worst is over 
I can just take it 
But now that the worst is over 
I can just take it back
