Have you wondered, 
What it could be like, 
And I was all set to come back home. 
You were after nothing I could give long. 
Have you ever wondered, 
What it could be like, 
And I was standing back on my feet. 
There's nothing there, 
So now you want better And I know I should have held you closer, 
And I know I should have treated you better, 
In a perfect world, 
But we're not always, 
What we promised to be. 
You caught my words in mid-air. 
The silence hung as you caught my eye, 
Conversations locked away in my mind. I know I should have held you closer, 
I know I should have treated you better. And I know I should have treated you better 
And I know I should have treated you better 
I know I should have treated you better Have you wondered, 
What it could be like, 
And I was all set to come back home. 
You were after nothing I could give long. 
Have you ever wondered, 
What it could be like, 
And I standing back on my feet. 
There's nothing there, 
So we were better. And I know I should have held you closer, 
And I know I should have treated you better, 
In a perfect world, 
But we're not always what we promised to be. 
You caught my words in mid-air, 
The silence hung as you caught my eye, 
Conversations locked away in my mind. I know I should have held you closer, 
I know I should have treated you better. And I know I should have treated you better 
And I know I should have treated you better
