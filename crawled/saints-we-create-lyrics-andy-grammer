I wrote a story I can sleep with 
Sometimes at night I like to read it 
Half of the time I might believe it 
But its really all for me 
Im putting confidence in hearsay 
Im givin' circumstances its trophies 
Im writin' a script where she is always 
The perfect one for me 
The perfect one for me, oh (Chorus) 
And oh, the saints we create when we are feeling all alone 
Cause you need something 
And oh, the lovers who fake the tale are made to keep us warm 
Cause we need something 
mmmm Im getting caught up in the moment oh 
Im using her beauty as an omen 
She is the one my soul's been calling 
And its really all for me 
Its really all for me (Chorus) It goes we keep pushing,on our hearts, keep pushing,on our hearts 
Tryin' to feel like we're in love 
Keep pushing,on our hearts, keep pushing on our hearts 
It goes we keep pushing,on our hearts, 
Keep pushing, on our hearts 
Tryin' to feel like were in love 
Keep pushin on our hearts, keep pushing on our hearts And i know 
There is more to this 
Than eyes closed and a slow romantic kiss 
And we've shown, that we are bound to drift 
We are searching for an anchor, 
Cause the most of us are anchor-less (Chorus)
