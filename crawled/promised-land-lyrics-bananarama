Lock me up in a room somewhere 
Get me out of the open air 
No perception of space or time 
And no peace of mind Shut me out of the wind and rain 
Shelter me from the hurt and pain 
No temptation to lead me on 
Now that you're gone [Chorus] 
Won't you come to the rescue 
Take me to the promised land 
You've got the power to show me 
Love is at hand 
With you right here beside me 
Dancing barefoot in the sand 
Close your eyes and take me 
To the promised land Bolt the windows and close the door 
Now there's nothing worth living for 
New direction is hard to find 
So leave me behind Dim the lights and hang up the phone 
All I want is to be alone 
No connection with anyone 
I just can't go on [Chorus] Take me to the promised land 
Take me to the promised land 
(Take me) 
To the promised land 
To the promised land 
Take me [Chorus] Won't you come 
To the promised land 
Won't you come 
(To the rescue) 
To the promised land 
(Come to the rescue)
