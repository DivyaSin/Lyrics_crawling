Well I ain't no man, 
No I ain't no man 
I can run and I can hide, 
Fool the best of them 
I can tell you a story, 
You'd believe again 
But you'd see right through me, 
Cause I ain't no man I left you home on a Sunday 
Carrying my pride 
But the lord he only knows 
When a man must die 
Don't you tire of my holding 
Onto you my friend 
I'm only holding on to something 
Cause I ain't no man And I have tired of my youth, 
And I am tired of my mind 
I have tried to think it through, 
Tried a million times 
Your generosity has shown me 
That my only plan 
A setting sun without a morning, 
Cause I ain't no man Well I ain't no man, 
No I ain't no man 
Well, I can run and I can hide, 
Fool the best of them 
And I can tell you a story, 
You'd believe again 
How many times do you have to show me 
That I ain't no man 
How many times do you have to show me 
That I ain't no man 
How many times do you have to show me 
That I ain't no man
