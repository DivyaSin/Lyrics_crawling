I'm the cold man with the broken heart 
Everybody knows that it's hard hard hard to love, love love love love love 
I've got the patience of a brazen mind 
Everybody knows that it's mine mine mine to know, no no no no no Into the desert into the sun I can rely on my self 
I've got a feeling won't eat your approval but I'm waiting for your time 
Run run run into the sea 
Run run run There's a little lack of the fresh cash flow 
Everybody knows but they don't really know, no no no no no 
I'm searching for a thing to complain about 
Even if I'm wrong I wanna shout shout shout I live and I'm alive oh oh oh Into the desert into the sun I can rely on my self, I've got a feeling won't eat your approval but I'm waiting for your time 
Run run run into the sea 
Run run run I'm the cold man with the broken heart 
Everybody knows that it's hard to love 
I'm the cold man with the broken heart 
Everybody knows that it's hard to love Ohh ohh ohh Into the desert into the sun I can rely on my self 
I've got a feeling won't eat your approval but I'm waiting for your time 
Run run run into the sea 
Run run run into the sea 
Run (run) run (run) run into the sea 
Run (run) run (run) run into the sea
