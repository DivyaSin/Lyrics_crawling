understand this i 
never hoped, never felt dealt 
the way i should have been 
under the stars of good i cannot hope, cannot feel 
cannot cope, cannot deal 
through this preemptive strife 
life i will not die 
i'll shed my skin 
all the blood was spilt 
from innocence and i pray and i beg 
don't find me so useless 
so useless understanding through 
all the views you seem to prove 
new waves of jealosy 
from a newborn sea wade the wake, wade the mire 
from down 'til the steeple spire 
forever life seems to be 
a little eternity i will not die 
i'll shed my skin 
all the blood was spilt 
from innocence and i pray and i beg 
don't find me so useless 
so useless and i pray and i beg 
don't find me so useless 
so useless i will not die 
i'll shed my skin 
all the blood was spilt 
from innocence and i pray and i beg 
don't find me so useless 
so useless
