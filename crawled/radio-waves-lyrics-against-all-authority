Don't touch the dial, there's static on the radio 
We're on a frequency way below 
And one day this signals gonna get through to you 
We sent it out in 92, yeah, it's long overdue Can you feel it when you turn it up? Hey 
Transmitting not a thing corrupt 
Crank it up, we're giving it all we've got 
We're blowing speakers and we won't stop We won't stop, yeah, we're still holding it down 
Down, yeah, we're still holding it down 
Down, yeah, we're still holding it down 
Down, we hold it Down with the kids while the airwaves cover it up 
But the static keeps us in touch 
One day this noise is gonna break right through 
With the rhythm of rebellion that were sending to you And I feel it and we'll shout it out, hey 
Transmitting no shadows of doubt 
It's not a test, we're tuned in to you 
Blowing speakers with our feedback, yes, it's true We won't stop, yeah, we're still holding it down 
Down, yeah, we're still holding it down 
Down, yeah, we're still holding it down 
Down, we hold it down We won't stop, yeah, we're still holding it down 
Down, yeah, we're still holding it down 
Down, yeah, we're still holding it down 
Down, we hold it down Down as we spin around this stupid world 
And we surround ourselves 
With things that we despise 
Empty thoughts for shallow lives That live amongst these broken dreams 
With static sounds and silent screams 
That fall upon the deafest ears 
And play upon our darkest fears Of lives that seem so meaningless 
Above our means and in excess 
No one hears the sounds we've made 
We can't touch those radio waves 
The radio waves, the radio waves No one hears the sounds we've made 
We're just chasing radio waves
