What 
Would I like 
This thing 
It haunts me like a shadow 
Never lets me go 
He was lost I knew how lost 
I knew my way 
Oh how I played him 
Dance 
Dirty man 
You dance 
I'm what you've been missing 
Between the thorn and you 
Twist until your itching 
Beg me to come through 
Now he goes part of a whole 
Puppet of mine 
Where will they find me
