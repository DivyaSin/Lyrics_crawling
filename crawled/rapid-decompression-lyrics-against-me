How much is too much? 
I'm tired of predicting to lose. 
But before you point your finger, 
Before you cast your stones, 
Take a look at yourself. 
How can you expect from someone what you won't do yourself? There's no bottom to your reality. 
Your desperation is utter and complete. 
What you can't love about yourself you have to steal from someone else; 
And what you can't steal you have to deny. Rapid Decompression. 
Sometimes it feels like your whole world is coming to an end.
