Under that shits creek so I hope that you brought preservers You could put a turd on the plate 
Silverware on the tablecloth to serve us 
You don't bring shit to the table 
I mean your grill like a Seville when a mark gets murdered 
You pushing the envelope, and I'm shovin' that whole post office further 
Right off the surface, to the serpents in the darkest and the farthest corner How many bars, how many bars 
Maui, wow wee, sour diesel, how many jars, 
To all my people I'll be the Mars, mommy come on 
She can actually wrap my nut sack 'round the back of her neck in a bathroom stall 
And she can just puke from sipping this piss from my twenty four inch catheter cord I'm the type that'll take a bath with' a whore 
Drown her, bang her head on the passenger door 
When I'm stashin' 'er in the back, smackin' her forehead on the dash 
And its accidentally blowin', a Benz jeep horn My friends be knowin' that when I'm on a binge, I'm stingy 
Even when I'm ten deep in a room with the MG and and with' Lindsay Lohan and she on
