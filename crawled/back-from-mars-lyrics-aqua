Hey you, come with me, to a world of billionaires 
See me, I'm the bomb, drinking champagne down at Pierre's All the people that I'm meeting, are so friendly and perceiving 
When they smile 
Some are talking 'bout their feelings, and the stocks that they are dealing 
So they cry, don't want to say bye [Chorus] 
I am coming back from Mars, where they drive in fancy cars 
And the King he is ok, he is coming home today 
I am coming back from Mars, where there are no cheap cigars 
And Elvis has said, that I could be just like they are 
Meet the stars, they're from Mars Baby, it's glamour, throwing bills up in the air 
Back off, I'm too hot, eat the oysters if you dare Saying hi to Mister Shoe Shine, passes by a Missus Diva 
Stop and stare 
This is oh so just fantastic, I will live my life in plastic 
Check the hair, and see what I wear [Chorus] We are porno stars, sucking big cigars 
We are the pop stars, we cannot play guitars
