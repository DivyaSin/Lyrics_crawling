Hi ho, tripper's out cold 
I've got a feeling like a tired old flow 
I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be Gasoline, saccharinne 
I've got no reason for the state I'm in 
But I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be Hotel, Taco Bell 
I got the hit but you know damned well 
But I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be Cut teeth, bet a belief 
I've got a feeling that I'm underneath 
But I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be But it's alright, it's okay 
I got the time but the time don't pay 
It's alright, it's okay 
I got the time but the time don't pay 
It's alright, it's okay 
I got the time but the time don't pay 
It's alright, it's okay! Flick flack, no slack 
I've got the wit that my enemies lack 
But I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be Trick some, just begun 
I'm givin' you more when you only want one 
But I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be Hot sweat, got debt 
Keep your licker in the locker 'cos you don't know yet 
But I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be Ship shape, ticker tape 
Looks to me like a narrow escape 
But I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be But it's alright, it's okay 
I got the time but the time don't pay 
It's alright, it's okay 
I got the time but the time don't pay 
It's alright, it's okay 
I got the time but the time don't pay 
It's alright, it's okay! I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be 
I know what I am! 
I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be 
I know what I am! 
I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be 
I know what I am! 
I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be 
I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be 
I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be 
I know what I am, they know what they are 
So let me be!
