So now a hush falls on my heart 
My mind at ease, apologies as I start 
Overcome, love holds me near 
Pitiful boy, oh I am awed, try to be so sincere I come into 
Your presence falling on my knees 
Beautiful God 
Your face I seek All I can give you is me 
My eyes are dim, and yet within I still see 
Everything disappears 
You are there 
My heart wells up, why do You love? 
Oh Lord, why do You care? In the stillness, the quiet 
In the peace 
You are there 
The idols gone, my mind is free 
Your love for me, my sins You chose to bear
