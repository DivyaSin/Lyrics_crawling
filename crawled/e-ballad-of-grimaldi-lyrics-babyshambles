While there's still a fighting chance 
Can't you just get up and go 
And get away from this hollow romance 
It's slowly binding us both 
Because you tell me what you want and I'll avoid it 
Tell it to the sick and to the damned 
Show me what you love, watch me destroy it 
For your love just crumbles in my hands But if you stay for a while.. 
I'll try to think of something kind to say 
And maybe if we pray for a while 
St. Jude may hear my pleas 
And see me on my bended knees Because she knows how I adore you 
We won't be fighting again tonight 
Not if she knows I adore you 
No fighting again tonight.. I laugh and fall just like Grimaldi 
You wear your make-up like Baby Jane 
All of those promising lies that you told me 
Come on and tell me them again I walked these streets all of my life.. 
The fear and hope 
... Because you tell him what you want and he'll avoid it 
May as well tell it to the sick and to the damned 
Show him what you love, watch him destroy it
