If He never, ever does another thing 
He's already done more than I could dream 
Jesus, we love you 
We give You the praise 
He gave His life for me 
Just so I could live life totally free 
We love You 
We give You the glory All for me 
Did it all for me 
He left His throne 
Came to earth, unknown, for me 
Did it all for me, did it all for me 
And He took that walk 
Carrying that cross for me 
Did it all for me I'm here to lift Jesus high 
Till the world is lighted by His shine 
Lord, You'll be forever glorified 
And everywhere that I go 
I'm gonna make sure everybody knows 
That You are, You are God alone! Did it all for me, did it all for me 
He left His throne 
Came to earth, unknown, for me 
Did it all for me, did it all for me 
And He took that walk 
Carrying that cross for me 
Did it all for me
