Young fools drunk heroes are 
Writhing by my feet 
The killing time has come 
I'll do it it's high time to 
Punish unfeeling killers and rapists 
They'll feel ache ! I'm a ghost a defender of innocent 
And tormented creatures 
I'm killing rapists of children and women 
I'm murdering them with no marcy 
I want them to feel like their victims Ghost, revenge, killing time 
Eternity When I get even with them all 
When there is no cry fear and ache 
I'll go away but remember young fools 
I'll back immediately when I'll get the cry for help... I'm a ghost Victim, murder, eternity
