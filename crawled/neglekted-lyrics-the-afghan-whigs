I knew a girl, extraordinary 
Suggested something, unsanitary 
As I asked her for a moment 
To consider her kind offer 
She blew a kiss and said to me... 
I know you know 
You want it so 
I want it too, so see it through 
Cause when I do what I'm gonna do to you 
Make sure you remember my name 
You know it's true 
I want it too 
I know you know, so make it so 
Cause when I do what I'm gonna do to you 
You'll never ever, ever... 
Intoxicated, by your aggression 
I offer you my one possession 
You can fuck my body, baby 
But please, don't fuck my mind 
Get you high, girl, come with me 
Take a ride in search of ecstasy 
I want to roll with ya, I want to roll 
I feel you now, I never knew 
You were so sad, I'll make it up to you 
Cause I feel you now 
I feel you now...
