Down, down, like an aeroplane 
Storm hit with a world of hate 
I was holding on 
But still falling to the ground Turn, turn in the hurricane 
Wind hit with the heavy rain 
You were calling out 
But I never heard a sound And so I'll go back where we started 
(Down, down) 
I forgot that the heavens are shinning for You 
Light up my heart like the new day 
I never mind if the darkness has to stay, yeah 
I'll comeback with a little faith Burn, burn this consumer's flame 
Never thought it could suffocate 
Because I can't keep up 
And the fire's burning out The world will never be enough with its know how 
What can I get now, I'm sick of all your lies 
They're such a let down, it got my head in the clouds 
Was lost, then I found Your grace I'll just go back where we started 
(Down, down) 
I forgot that the heavens are shinning for You 
Light up my heart like the new day 
I never mind if the darkness has to stay, yeah 
I'll comeback with a little faith I wanna get back, I know when I'm not right 
I'll never look back , back on the old life 
'Cause I wanna make a comeback 
If it takes me life time 
Will You show me where you're at' 
And I'll find the way in Your light The rain is over, the clouds are parting now So, I'll go back where we started 
And I forgot that the heavens are shinning for You I'll go back where we started 
(Down, down) 
I forgot that the heavens are shinning for You 
Light up my heart like the new day 
I never mind if the darkness has to stay, yeah So, I'll go back where we started 
(Down, down) 
I forgot all the heavens are shinning for You 
Light up my heart like the new day 
I never mind if the darkness has to stay, yeah 
I'll comeback with a little faith
