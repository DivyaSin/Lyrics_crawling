Voices inside 
Keep on twisting my thoughts 
things that are rationally right 
sre crooked to me 
but I make it work my way 
the thoughts inside 
are painfully and cruel 
but they are a fuel so strong 
that it makes my life go wrong I seek their pain to ease my mind 
it makes pain in my head seem less bright 
and brings me closer to delight I feel my past 
getting control over me when will I be freed 
from this misery when my mind let me be it seems that no 
body understands 
the pain that's in my head 
it's only eased by death 
it's the only way to live 
it seems that no 
body understands 
that chaos in my life 
it's hurting me so much 
I want to hurt somebody else a memory of burning flesh 
is the deepest thought for me 
the shadows keep hurting me 
it's blackening all of this
