[Garnett Silk:] 
[Chorus] 
If you do wrong they complain 
Even if you call the father's name its the same 
What they'want us to do 
Don't they know it is nothing new 
Why won't they do what they want 
And let me do my thing they should be thankful 
There's lights of hope still shining [Buju Banton:] 
Let Jah rise and the heathen scatter 
Have to give thanks and praises no matter 
Even if the flames is getting hotter & hotter 
Every one should know I don't believe in rumor 
Children arise from your sleep & slumber 
Don't come to bow, come to conquer 
Strictly love why you envy your brother 
Don't let them re-arrange you in a different manner [Garnett Silk:] 
Why should I change to gain acceptance 
Can't tell a next man how to wear his pants 
Lift up the name of Jah in abundance 
Every single thing we do, we are liable 
To get a sentence 
But we won't be like a flea just like how the more we see 
The less you hear we speak 
My brother don't you be like a stubborn sheep 
Blessed are he when man shall revile you 
And persecute you, say all manner of evil 
Against you falsely, for Jah sake 
Rejoice I say and be exceedingly glad 
For great is your reward 
For so persecute they the prophets before you and me [Buju Banton:] 
Let Jah rise and the heathen scatter 
Have to give thanks and praises no matter 
Even if the flames is getting hotter & hotter 
Every one should know I don't believe in rumor 
Children arise from your sleep & slumber 
Don't come to bow, come to conquer 
Strictly love why you envy your brother 
Don't let them re-arrange you in a different manner
