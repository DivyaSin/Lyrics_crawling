She's a hard hearted woman 
See the way that she's watchin' you 
Victims falling before her 
And there's nothin' that you can do Love comes, holdin' on to us all 
Love comes, holdin' on to us all See the hard hearted woman 
Watch the way that she's dancin' now 
Eyes are flashing before you 
Break her spell, please tell me how Love comes, holdin' on to us all 
Love comes, holdin' on to us all See the way that she's watchin' you 
Break her spell, please tell me how Love comes, holdin' on to us all 
Love comes, holdin' on to us all
