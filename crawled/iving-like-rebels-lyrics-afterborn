Rap: 
I see my real G with a gun to kill and shut, right in here, my open eyes is on the world to catch the vibes, I hold my MIC bobbing, and I smoothly flowing understandable words and the matters is moving and I fixed it , play me, I am not the owner right, I am feeling hip hop got me in stock with my grandpa and have me activated, you art as you are new face in town? Got me invisible, Hate me or embrace me rider, I will pull out my gun and shoot the criminals, you see, with light we may fix it or we face it, me forever, I will live till the end time, I may tell you this cause I am falling, Please wake me from this sleep I am falling, I will not let this get too deep, I will be out looking for a president to represent me, I need a president to represent me, I need a good president to represent me. 
Chorus: 
We use to be like family, now we living like rebels, we use to be like people, now we living like rebels, we use to be live kings,now we living like rebels, we use to be live kings, now we living like rebels. 
Rap: 
To my men CK, God bless your name, to my people, to queens, God bless you all, my inside and outside vision is just a wisdom, Nigger pay attention and listen about the matter we had last Christmas session, men brain seize, brain fall, multiple bulls, so many vultures in my country but some vultures are fools, men I need weed to proceed, change the game speed and go back to reality of 66, nothing like dose days we use have peace, I took the shortcut, I didn't lose breath, we need to hassle, city hall like devil castle, dont mind my load the system is devil hustle, the old men become the bad influence, the color of skin is giving me special joy inside, we living larger brother, stop wasting time counting people while people are get broke and broke. 
Chorus: 
We use to be like family, now we living like rebels, we use to be like people, now we living like rebels, we use to be live kings,now we living like rebels, we use to be live kings, now we living like rebels.
