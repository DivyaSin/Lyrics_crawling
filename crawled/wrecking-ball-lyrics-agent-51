She's a wrecking ball 
Like a fever I burn faster 
She she, She's gone faster Her machine will make you weary 
She she, she's gone faster Her high-speed mind is what I'm fearing 
Hold on to your heart 
Hold on to your heart Ready get set 
Tear this place apart 
Oh my god she's a wrecking machine She burned my motor on my engine clean 
Quit playin' dirty tricks single picks She does it all 
She's a wrecking ball 
She's going down low to the fire 
She she, she's gone faster And I don't give a damn if it takes me higher 
If she don't care bout elimination 
She she, she's gone faster Then I don't give a fuck its my bad reputation 
Hold on to your heart 
Hold on to your heart Ready get set 
Tear this place apart 
Oh my god she's a wrecking machine She burned my motor on my engine clean 
Quit playin' dirty tricks single picks 
She does it all 
She's a wrecking ball Wrecking ball 
She's my wrecking ball 
Oh my god she's a wrecking machine She burned my motor on my engine clean 
Quit playin' dirty tricks single picks 
She does it all 
Oh my god she's a wrecking machine She burned my motor on my engine clean 
Quit playin' dirty tricks single picks 
She does it all 
She's a wrecking ball Wrecking ball
