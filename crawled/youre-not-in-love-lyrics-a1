The sun is shining, the rain comes in 
And I don't know what to do, no 
I don't know where I'm going or where I've been 
'Cos my mind is hooked on you Words escape me and tears come down 
And day slowly turns to night 
And I think of all we could have been 
I gave up the fight And you don't 
(You don't) 
Understand 
(Understand) Girl, you make me all I am 
But I'm starting to see 
Just how hard it can be, on my own 
And I'm sorry, baby, won't you come home? You said that we'd been defeated 
But, oh, I am so addicted 
Your love is all I need to get by You told me that you and I 
Would always be true but you lied 
And you're not in love and I don't know why 
No, I don't know why The days around me and years roll on 
And I still don't think it's right 
(Don't think it's right) 
And I have so much love to give 
But I gave up the fight Now you don't 
(You don't) 
Understand 
(Understand) Girl, you make me all I am 
But I'm starting to see 
Just how hard it can be, on my own 
And I'm sorry, baby, won't you come home? You said that we'd been defeated 
But, oh, I am so addicted 
Your love is all I need to get by You told me that you and I 
Would always be true but you lied 
And you're not in love and I don't know why 
No, I don't know why No, I can't make it alone 
(I don't know why) 
And I can't be here without you in my life 
And so I ask you, why, you still deny? And you don't understand Girl, you make me all I am 
But I'm starting to see 
Just how hard it can be, on my own 
And I'm sorry, baby, won't you come home? You said that we'd been defeated 
But, oh, I am so addicted 
Your love is all I need to get by You told me that you and I 
Would always be true but you lied 
And you're not in love and I don't know why 
No, I don't know why No, I don't know why 
Just tell me why 
Please tell me why
