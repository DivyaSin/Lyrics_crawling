A paper clip base in the late 1940's 
Camp Hero, a tribute to time traveling Horus 
Stationed on top of an undersea mountain 
A piece of Atlantis where Montauks are pharaohs Now the air is full 
Of viruses grown within walls underground 
Now the sea is sick 
Toxic pollutants have poisoned the sound The rise of the Phoenix controlling the weather 
Dimensional research to decode forever 
Dismantling molecules for reassembly 
Men meshed with metal USS Eldridge Face the truth of time 
Bio-electromagnetically compromised 
Devastating crimes 
Four hundred and thirty five megahertz rinses the mind And they're reading my mind 
Bending my mind 
Using my mind 
Telling my mind One day the sky will disappear 
The walls of time removed 
Shattered lives won't matter here 
To doom, to search for light, forever black Face the truth of time 
In its inconsistency such a fine line 
Between the then and now 
We're all here together we'll soon find out how but not why Never know why 
We never die 
Caught in this trap While the world turns black and the crowd becomes consuming 
Share your space with souls forever caught 
Between the here and there is only madness 
Is knowing worth the price it costs to stare inside 'Pandora's Box'? One day the sky will disappear 
The walls of time removed 
Shattered lives won't matter here 
Doomed to search for light, forever black Forever black 
Forever black 
Forever black
