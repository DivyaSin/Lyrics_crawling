My name is Akinyele, I be rolling like Pirellis 
Knocking niggas out the box like skullies, taking hoes directly to the telly 
Make them scream my name two times like Pelle, Pelle 
Then I put her on they belly, play it cool like Fonzerelli From New York to L.A. will they sell they body to me to escape poverty? 
Before I started boning chicks, I used to watch the porno flicks 
And every night I fucked that same Yoko Ono chick Anything to get wet, I guess I was just young, sad and blue 
Like the Lissette cassette, the world made me like this 
Girls very rare gave me a kiss, pulling my dick out only to piss Now the tables switched and turned no nigga's straight 
Like a perm, bank I earn, no time to learn, one girl 
Give me all of them, I'll have a ball with them 
And when we do change the numbers, so they don't call again We probably see them at the mall again or the dance hall again 
Fuck it if they with it we could do it all again 
You're a true baller when they treat you like a King like Solomon 
Fuck them like you quarellin' 
Who pussy, who pussy? Now bring the chorus in He's your ho, you know he's your ho 
He rocks three different chicks after every show 
He's your ho, you know he's your ho 
How do you know? 'Cause I told you so 
He's your ho I don't want to be a ho like no more, more, more 
I'm ready to find some girl that I can save my love for, for 
Complexion You'll be dick sucking, clit fucking 
My dick stuck in your back, gonna find it back 
'Cause we heard that you like it like that 
So when your man's finished bring your fucking ass back 
'Cause he's your ho He's your ho, you know he's your ho 
He rocks three different chicks after every show 
He's your ho, you know he's your ho 
How do you know? 'Cause I told you so 
He's your ho Go fuck her, then come fuck me 
Well, you're shit out of luck 'cause this bitch ain't free 
I had a fat piece of twat and it must get bust 
But you're hoing everywhere and you want your dick sucked And you want to come home, pass diseases to me 
Have me scratching my pussy like I'm looking for fleas 
But I'm not your ho bitch 
And you can't fuck me around, 'cause you're a ho He's your ho, you know he's your ho 
He rocks three different chicks after every show 
He's your ho, you know he's your ho 
How do you know? 'Cause I told you so 
He's your ho One hoe, one hoe, 'cause all I need is one 
One hoe, one hoe, 'cause all we need is one 
One hoe, one hoe, listen, 'cause all I need is one 
One hoe, one hoe
