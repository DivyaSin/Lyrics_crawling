Archie:

Patrice will understand. 
Some prizes are worth paying when your dreams come true. Archie: 
I'm getting ready for her. 
I'm getting ready, yes sir. 
Ready for passion to light, and romance. Evan and Archie: 
I'm getting ready to go. 
I'm getting ready and knowing, 
I may only, get this, one chance. Brett: 
There in the dark of the Appleton cinema. 
Free from the public's prying eye. 
There with my girl in the chair beside me. 
I can reveal my big surprise. 
There while the rest of the crowds immersed and 
all of the blood vessels on screen bursting. 
Kendra will get to be the first in line to realize 
here comes the tongue. Malcolm and Eddie: 
Here it comes.

Tolululululululu LAH! Kendra: 
O.K, so just go through this with me one more time? Lucy: 
O.K. Kendra: 
If he does it and I let him? Lucy: 
You;re a slut. Kendra: 
Right. 
And he he wants to and I stop him. Lucy: 
You're a tease. Kendra: 
God! 
And if I let him and I like? Lucy: 
You're a skank. Kendra: 
Wow. Lucy: 
But he could also get his tongues stuck down your throat. 
Or try to kiss so hard he chips one of your teeth. 
Oh, there's a million other things that could go wrong! 
It doesn't matter if the urge to kiss him back is strong. 
You've got to hold that boy at bay. 
Step back from the edge and say, "I'm a good girl. 
I don't do that. 
I'm a nice girl. 
Put that away. 
I'm a good girl. 
Keep your hands off." 
If you tell him that, 
you'll be O.K. Kendra: 
What if it's only like, "this" much. Lucy: 
When you got that solo in choir, 
it's 'cause I told you what to sing. 
When you got the lead in the fall school play, 
it's 'cause I coached you all last Spring. 
When yo got the head of the cheer leading squad 
it's 'cause I taught you everything. 
Think of all the things I should've had, you got instead, 
because you did just what I said. 
You're a good girl. Kendra: 
I'm a good girl. Lucy: 
I don't do that. Kendra: 
But he's so cute. Lucy: 
You're a good girl. Kendra: 
Listen Lucy- Lucy: 
Don't question me! Kendra: 
But I could be his girlfriend. Lucy: 
You're a good girl. Kendra: 
I'm a good girl. Lucy and Kendra: 
I don't do that. Evan: 
Koh Amar. Lucy and Kendra: 
I could be Brett's girlfriend. Evan: 
Hael Adoshem. Lucy: 
If I could get her out of the way. Evan: 
Bohr hashamayim Kendra: 
But now I just don't know what to do. Evan: 
Venotayhem Lucy, Kendra, Patrice:

something that makes her accept me at last. All:
