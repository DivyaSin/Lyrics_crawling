Come home 
Come home I am so temporary 
Tell me I can sing to you 
With my mouth so full of blood An' I am so fragile 
Tell me I can run to you 
When I can hardly stand on my own And how long will you ransom me? 
I always steal myself 
How long will you ransom, ransom me? 
How long will you ransom me? And how long will you ransom me? 
I always steal myself 
How long will you ransom, ransom me? 
How long will you ransom me? I am so temporary 
Tell me I can sing to you 
With my mouth so full of blood And I am so fragile 
Tell me I can run to you 
When I can hardly stand on my own And how long will you ransom me? 
I always steal myself 
How long will you ransom, ransom me? 
How long will you ransom me? And how long will you ransom me? 
I always steal myself 
How long will you ransom, ransom me? 
How long will you ransom me? Meet me as high as I can go 
If you can bend yourself that low 
Meet me as high as I can go 
If you can bend Come home 
Come home
