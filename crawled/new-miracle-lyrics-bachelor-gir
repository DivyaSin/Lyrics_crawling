Where is this new miracle? 
Where is the christ our lord? 
I have heard a manger is where he lies Born of the holy word 
Where is the baby saviour? 
I will bow down to him, for my heart's rule is christ the king 
And I give my life to him, I give my life to him Have you seen our redeemer? 
Come on this christmas day 
For the son of God has been born as man 
To wash all our sins away 
Have you begun the journey 
To offer praise to him? There is love and peace for every man 
If we reach out and touch his hand, if we reach out and touch his hand 
There is joy, born of the light 
There is hope, that now has life
