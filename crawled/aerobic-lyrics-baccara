If you're sad and feeling low 
And your mind is really down 
Better get in shape you know 
You can do it when your party down 
Come and do this dance with me 
Everybody on the floor 
Ebony or ivory, it's a dance you can't ignore Take some time with me 
And pretty soon you will see 
Everybody move your body 
Set your spirit free Aerobic, aerobic... 
Get your body fit 
Aerobic, aerobic... 
Get your body fit Everybody gonna hear me now 
Gonna go right from the stop 
Roll your head from side to side 
Front to back and let it flop 
Put your hands behind your head 
Move your body left to right 
Feet apart and standing still 
That's the way to do it right Take some steps with me 
And pretty soon you will see 
Everybody move your body 
Set your spirit free Aerobic, aerobic... Oh how you're looking so good as you move across the floor 
Yeah and it's doing you good oh, oh, oh 
Oh how you're looking so beautiful darling what is more 
Yeah you're looking so good as you mo-o-ove 
Baby baby you look so good to me 
Feet together on the floor 
Put your arms up in the air 
Move your hips from side to side 
Everybody everywhere 
Bend down touch your toes 
Get up but not too quick 
Turn around and strike a pose 
Then with one leg give a kick Aerobic, aerobic...
