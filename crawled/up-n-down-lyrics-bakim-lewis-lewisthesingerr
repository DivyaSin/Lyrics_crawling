Hook: Girl don't be scared 
Ima be here 
Ima strap your pretty ass up in this chair 
Girl dont you hide 
Im about to find out what you like 
You gone take this rollercoaster ride 
It goes up and down 
Round and round 
It goes up and down 
Round and round Verse 1: 
Let you ride my rollercoaster 
Ima make you bend on over 
Ima give you what you need 
Baby drop down to your knees 
Girl ima gonna love you down 
Make you wet dont stop 
Run your water girl 
Better bring a mop 
And i know its where you wanted to be 
Dont be afraid to take the front seat Hook 2

Ima be here 
Ima strap your pretty ass up in this chair 
Girl dont you hide 
Im about to find out what you like 
You gone take this rollercoaster ride 
It goes up and down 
Round and round 
It goes up and down 
Round and round
