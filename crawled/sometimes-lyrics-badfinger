Sometimes, I'm only waiting for your smile 
Sometimes, I'll only wait a while 
Sometimes, a feeling makes me wanna cry 
Tell me why Sometimes, I'm fooling, playing for my time 
Sometimes, the days are always fine 
Sometimes, a cloudburst puts me out of line 
It's a crime There's always tomorrow, the end of your sorrow and pain 
(Ooh pain, sorrow and pain) 
(Ooh pain, sorrow and pain) 
There's always a reason you always believed in my soul (in my soul) There's always tomorrow, the end of your sorrow and pain 
(Ooh pain, sorrow and pain) 
(Ooh pain, sorrow and pain) 
There's always a reason you always believed in my soul (in my soul) Yeah Sometimes, I'm only waiting for your smile 
Sometimes, I'll only wait a while 
Sometimes, a feeling makes me wanna cry 
Tell me why Sometimes, I'm fooling, playing for my time 
Sometimes, the days are always fine 
Sometimes, a cloudburst puts me out of line 
It's a crime Gotta find out why (find out why) 
Tell me why
