[Verse 1] 
My soul faints for you 
There is nothing left to prove 
And that killer smile you got 
Oh it makes me melt We need to make this magic happen 
Bright sky, white clouds 
Sunshine, that's what i see [Hook] 
I promise you that i'll be true 
I am a man who will fight for you 
I couldn't sleep thinking of you 
Every single night 
Fill this love and let it grow [Verse 2] 
You got me going wild 
Just come on and ride 
With me, you a stunna 
You're an addiction 
I ain't lyin' nah We need to make this magic happen 
Bright sky, white clouds 
Sunshine, that's what i see [Hook] 
I promise you that i'll be true 
I am a man who will fight for you 
I couldn't sleep thinking of you 
Every single night 
Fill this love and let it grow [Bridge] 
Oh babe i'm crazy in love with you 
Oh babe i'm crazy in love with you 
I'm ready to do whatever you want 
I'm ready to do whatever you want [Hook] 
I promise you that i'll be true 
I am a man who will fight for you 
I couldn't sleep thinking of you 
Every single night 
Fill this love and let it grow
