Why did you break my heart 
And say your goodbye 
Why did you break my heart 
And leave me with tears in my eyes 
How could you say you left me 
When all your words were true 
Let me say you really fooled me 
My heart just didn't see it coming I still can see the pictures on the wall 
Of you and I when I walk through the hall 
How can I forget the happy times 
When I thought we were both in love 
I still can hear your voice 
When you would say to me you would never leave me 
How I believed you 
My eyes were just too blind to see Oh I surrendered my heart 
But you just tore it apart 
How could you leave me so lonely, lonely 
I gave my heart to you 
How could you just leave me crying Why did you break my hear 
And say your goodbye 
Why did you break my heart 
And leave me with tears in my eyes 
How could you say you left me 
When all your words were true 
Let me say you really fooled me 
My heart just didn't see it coming Tell me baby 
Why did you have to leave 
Just tell me baby 
I'm begging you, begging you please How could you leave 
Without a word to say to me baby 
And how could you think 
That all my life without you here would be the same 
When you went away 
I can't believe the emptiness just hit me baby 
My heart was crying so loud 
I just could not believe it 
Oh I surrendered my heart 
But you just tore it apart 
How could you leave me so lonely, lonely 
I gave my heart to you 
How could you just leave me crying Why did you break my hear 
And say your goodbye 
Why did you break my heart 
And leave me with tears in my eyes 
How could you say you left me 
When all your words were true 
Let me say you really fooled me 
My heart just didn't see it coming Why did you break my hear 
And say your goodbye 
Why did you break my heart 
And leave me with tears in my eyes 
How could you say you left me 
When all your words were true 
Let me say you really fooled me 
My heart just didn't see it coming Ohhh 
Ohhh 
Whooooo 
Ohhh 
Hooooooo
