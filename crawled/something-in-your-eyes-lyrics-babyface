Performed by bell biv devoe You ask my why, I say why not 
Anything is possible, anything can be 
Therefore tonight I'll get you hot 
You'll feel a passion you never dreamed And in a way you'll feel I'm overconfident 
What kind of man could I be 
It's clear to see it's like animal attraction 
When you add it up it's just a matter of factions, girl Something in your eyes told me 
That you were looking for a man you could adore 
Something in your eyes had given me a sign 
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on You think you're dry, I say your wet 
I can make it possible, I can make it true 
And all night long I'll make it sweat 
Gonna do a feeling that long past overdue And in a way you think why so much confidence 
What kind of man must I be 
It's clear to see it's like adding and subtracting 
When you add it up it's just animal attraction Hook 2 times So when I get inside and make you wet 
I'll lick you dry 
Creamate your body we get from all the body heat 
And like a lion you'll hear me roar 
And when I feed it to your body 
Make that body get weak some more 
I'll take you to the peak 
I'll make you wanna scream 
And like a lion you'll hear my body 
Roar and roar and roar and roar and roar Hook 3 times Anything is possible and anything can be 
You can feel a passion you never dreamed of 
See it in your eyes 
You're givin' me a sign 
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on It was something in your eyes that took me to feel it 
Something in your eyes, and hey, I can see it 
Something in your eyes had given me a sign 
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on Hook 2 times
