Standing room only 
You must think my bed's a bus stop 
By the way you come and go 
I ain't seen you with the lights on 
Two nights in a row 
So pack your rusty razor 
And don't bother with goodbye 
Your cup runneth open 
But mine is always dry [Chorus] 
Standing room only 
But I can't stand no more 
Standing room only 
Outside my door Don't help me set the table 
Cause now there's one less place 
I won't lay mama's silver 
For a man who won't say grace 
If home is where the heart is 
Then your home's on the street 
Me, I'll read a good book 
Turn out the lights and go to sleep [Chorus: x2]
