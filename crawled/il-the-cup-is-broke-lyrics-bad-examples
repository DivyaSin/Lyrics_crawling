Hey there, what do you know? 
I'm still thinking about you 
It's funny how we see ourselves 
We never notice what we do 
Til the cup is broke, til the moment's gone 
Til the dawn is day, and the day is done 
Remember the words we used... 
Do you think they might be true? 
Forget it. let 'em slip away 
We'll never know how much we knew 
Til the cup is broke, til the moment's gone 
Til the dawn is day, and the day is done And do you remember 
The leaps of faith it took us to get back to here 
And I just can't imagine 
The tricks of fate we stumbled on when it was all so clear This letter, I kissed it once 
Wishing that you could kiss me 
It's silly, a romantic hope 
But it's all I can see 
Til I touch your mouth, til I touch your hand 
Til I feel the skin of your hips under me Til the cup is broke, til the moment's gone 
Til the dawn is day, and the day is done 
Til I touch your mouth, til I touch your hand 
Til I feel the skin of your hips under me 
Under me... under me... 
Til I feel the skin of your hips under me
