All that you do 
All that you say 
To get to home is, 
To get away 
You can stay home 
Or go away 
To get to home is, 
To get away. I hear it. Ohh ohh ohh I hear it. Always a rich. 
Never the cold. 
Don't take the pain now 
Hold out for more. 
And when you wake up 
Your dying days 
To get to home still, 
To get away. I hear it. Ohh ohh ohh I hear it. I hear it. I hear it. I hear it. I hear it. I hear it. I hear it. I hear it. I hear it.
