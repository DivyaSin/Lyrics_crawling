Finding it so hard to leave tonight. 
I'm already home 
And I can't tell you goodnight. 
Bitter-sweet feelings that 
break me down when you're around. 
(When you're around) And I brought flowers to you again. 
You gave them back and told me 
That we're just friends. 
You don't know how much it kills me 
When I hear those words. 
(You say those words) And I hope that you regret what you have done. 
It's like shooting yourself 
With your own gun. 
And I hope you cried that night 
I walked into your door. 
(Into your door) And the biggest mistakes are the ones you make 
And I'm watching you make excuses for them. 
And the biggest mistakes are the ones we take 
For granted, And I 
Hope you take it again. And the biggest mistakes are the ones you make 
And I'm watching you make excuses for them. 
And the biggest mistakes are the ones we take 
For granted, And I 
Hope you take it again. And I hope you burn for the pain you caused. 
And I hope you burn long and hard. 
And I hope you burn 
for breaking my heart. 
And I hope you burn for the way you are. 
And I hope you burn long and hard. 
And I hope you burn and see how they are. And see how they are. Tonight. 
Alone. 
Nobody's home. 
We'll count. 
The stars as we fall. 
You wanted more than you could have. 
We both wanted more.
