Suicide boy you're gone 
You say that waves of joy are breaking beneath your frown 
You see the darkest parts of our eyes 
But I caught a glimpse of love two broken hearts couldn't hide But I can't stop the fear in your mind 
So I hope that you won't miss me 
I hope that you won't miss me 
I hope that you find all the love and the light now you're free So it's done 
You saved us from yourself 
Swallowed pills till certain closing your eyes wasn't hell 
But you still come back to life 
You still come back to life 
The ghost of your memory looks like a disease that hurts 
And you still hurt But I can't stop the fear in your mind 
So I hope that you won't miss me 
I hope that you won't miss me 
I hope that you find all the love and the light now you're free But I can stop the fear Suicide boy 
I can stop the fear
