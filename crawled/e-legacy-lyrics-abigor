Overwhelming fear 
As all nightmares come to life 
Extracted pain unfolds within this realm of fear 
A change of visions extend my mind Psychotropic pulse 
I am the chosen one Satan's son 
A flash of shivering stardust enlightens 
The truth beyond the portals Reality's borders fade 
Replaced by liquid glass 
Modulation tunes reveal 
All your tears unleashed All souls wrapped in plastic and wonder how 
It must hurt to see all the fears unleashed 
A battlefield of indescribable beauties 
Like silver statues that glide 
In everlasting oceans depths Legions march onwards in their perpetual cycle 
But soon our journey reach it's end 
And since ages I felt that kind of satisfaction 
As my one and only axe strike hits the hand Of my chosen victim that kneels crying before me 
Oh how I enjoyed to see him cry and finally die 
Now your prophetic redeemer is dead 
But take a look around and understand What has changed, say to do really miss him? 
So forget all set up morals 
And let eternal wisdom flow 
Cosmic revelation demonic incarnation 
Collective concentration total devastation Psychotropic pulse 
I am the chosen one Satan's son 
A flash of shivering stardust enlightens 
The truth beyond the portals 
Set ablaze the fires of Satan
