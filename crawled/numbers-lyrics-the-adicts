1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
I don't wanna be a number 
Just like being a prisoner 
I just wanna stay free 
Don't wanna be a number three 
O I don't wanna be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
Signing on the dot 
Got my name on a form 
Thought I had it made 
They treat you just insane 
Oh I don't wann be no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
You are just a number 
And I ain't got a name 
You are just a number 
And I ain't got a name 
Sitting in a prison cell 
Numbers on my chest 
Age is just a number 
Mummy does know best 
Oh I don't wanna be no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
You are just a number 
And I ain't got a name 
You are just a number 
And I ain't got a name 
I don't wanna be a number 
Just like being a prisoner 
I just wanna stay free 
Don't wanna be a number three 
O I don't wanna be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
You are just a number 
And I ain't got a name 
You are just a number 
And I ain't got a name 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
