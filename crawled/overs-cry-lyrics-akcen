i dream of u and it feels like i am flying 
i think of u when i am smiling 
i am lost into your eyes 
i sing our song and it feels like we are dancing 
my broken heart cant stop resting 
i love but is it wise.. 
she is born to run away 
so sad that she cant stay 
i wish she gives me one more day 
i kiss my love good-bye 
i hold her one last time 
and suddenly i don't know why 
lovers cryyy.. 
tell me the meaning of being together 
if u keep running forever 
i don't understand 
what is the purpose of loving each other 
cause every day i keep wonder 
if i see u again 
she is born to run away 
so sad that she cant stay 
i wish she gives me one more day 
i kiss my love good-bye 
i hold her one last time 
and suddenly i don't know why 
lovers cryyy..
