You give me a call 
The light don't shine on through 
It don't shine through 
You push and I fall 
The black cloud's on the move 
You're on the move 
I've taken on four jobs 
Tryin' to throw you right off my trail 
But on and on you keep on 
I wanna hide 
I wanna hide 
I wanna hide 
From the demon livin' inside 
And the remedy I'm told 
Is to fight with you head on 
But until I find the strength to conquer you 
I'm gonna hide like you want me to 
I can feel you pull from the inside 
Messin' around with my state of mind 
For too long now you've made me so uptight 
Sure made my life a livin' hell 
Livin' hell 
You give me a call 
The light don't shine on through 
It don't shine through 
You give me a call 
The light now shines on you 
And everything you do 
In the cool wind blowin' I'm sweepin' around 
Touch down find a safe hand 
Through an open door and I'm part of a crowd 
I wanna hide 
I wanna hide 
I wanna hide 
From the demon livin' inside 
And from the remedy I'm told 
Is to fight with you head-on 
But until I find a way to conquer you 
I'm gonna hide like you want me to 
I wanna hide
