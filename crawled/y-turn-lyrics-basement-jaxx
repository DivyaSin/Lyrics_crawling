When will this all start? 
When did I fall apart? 
When is it my turn? 
My turn? Working on your heart, 
Trying but I'm falling right apart, 
When will this all start? 
Tell me, when will this all start? Girl, I'll try and to forget it, 
Broken down forever now, we are losing what we found 
My heart is left, alone in pieces, pieces 
Well will this all start? 
Tell me, when will this all start? What is left, of us? 
I am kept in my shell 
I will never run away, you could never get away 
All of this love that we've lost, has left me in pieces, in pieces 
Girl, it's true, we have lost us
