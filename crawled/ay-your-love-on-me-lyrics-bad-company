(ralphs) I've been up, I've been down, I've been in every situation 
I've been pushed, pushed around, and I've been stuck at every station 
Looking back, felt so good, searching for fortune and fame 
Suddenly comes to you, you're only playing a game (don't need no video) no matter what they say 
(don't need no radio) you know, love is here to stay Chorus: 
Lay your love on me, each and every night, baby 
Lay your love on me, it'll be alright Straight up, down the line, I've got the blues in my soul 
All I need is my guitar, I got this rock, I wanna roll 
You gotta fight for what's right, I never did need the fame 
Suddenly comes to you, you're only playing a game (don't need no video) no matter what they say 
(don't need no radio) you know, love is here to stay Chorus: 
Lay your love on me, each and every night, baby 
Lay your love on me, it'll be alright (solo) (don't need no video) no matter what they say 
(don't need no radio) love is here to stay Chorus repeats out... 
Lay your love on me, each and every night, baby 
Lay your love on me, it'll be alright
