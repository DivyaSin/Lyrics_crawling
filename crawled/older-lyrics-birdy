I wish that I was older, 
Old enough to be yours. And I wish that I was wiser, 
Wise enough to be strong minded, 
To keep up with the words you say, 
That make me feel so young. But I don't know where this is going, 
I've just been hoping. 
And I can see by your smile that you're glowing, 
Inside out. 
Let's not pretend like it's not what it is, 
When I'm just starting to realise 
That I love you. And I wish that we were strangers, 
Strange enough to go unnoticed, 
From this crowd. And I wish that we were closer, 
Close enough for me to hold you, 
When you're lonely nights become too long to bare. But I don't know where this is going, 
I've just been hoping. 
And I can see by your smile that you're glowing, 
Inside out. 
Let's not pretend like it's not what it is, 
When I'm just starting to realise 
That I love you. You hold your head up high, 
Though it's hard to 
I can't keep back I know, 
I just want you. But I don't know where this is going, 
I've just been hoping. 
And I can see by your smile that you're glowing, 
Inside out. 
Let's not pretend like it's not what it is, 
When I'm just starting to realise 
That I love you. 
I love you.
