Love was a lesson we tried to learn 
There were no exams to pass or fail 
Only heartbreaks 
Renew our faith Life was a lesson we've tried to learn 
There were no tests to pass, no license to gain 
Only win or lose 
Renew our faith Renew our faith, let us see 
Fifties child was right to believe 
Peace and love were our needs 
The need to be free War is a lesson we've had to learn 
We had to learn to kill, to destroy and burn 
But our spirits cry 
Renew our faith Peace is a lesson we've yet to learn 
A prize for all mankind who race for the gain 
Of love and harmony 
Renew our faith Renew our faith, let us see 
Fifties child was right to believe 
Peace and love were our needs 
The need to be free Renew our faith, let us see 
Young and old we're right to believe 
Peace and love are our needs 
The need to be free
