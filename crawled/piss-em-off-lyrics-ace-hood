Fresh on the scene, I just let the swag talk 
Watch, I pull up in that foreign just to piss em off 
Had to whisper to my dog, I say we here to ball 
Chain ring, wrist bling, Imma piss em off 
Okay, more bottles of Rosay 
Ermaz on her waist, complimented by that oche 
Looking kinda fly Mr. Hood and what tomorrow say? 
Pissing niggas off by the bezel on the watch face 
On that nick Shorty, this just how the boss play 
Phantom with the two tone, left it with the valet 
You dont have a rank, catch me cooping on a Sunday 
Bitch I am the shit. We clear? Little Ray 
Check the swag. Yea, its on 
Gettin cash, the bank row 
I get it fast, never slow 
Piss em off just to let them haters know 
Let em know you will never meet a nigger this fly, aint lying 
Got the top off the wip 
You aint ridin, you aint ridin 
If the watch under 40 
You aint shinnin, you aint shinnin 
Piss em off, you niggas all talk, aint bide it 
Old man, ten grand, bough the home off 
Heard they hatin so I did it just to piss em off 
Chilling with a bad bitch Mrs. WhatchaCall 
Put her in a red bottom just to piss em off 
Good lord, you know what the wrist cost 
Bid the pretty penny probably triple what your reap cost 
Get a nigga shine it, like cutting on a chandelier 
Hop in about that Porsche, why of course that be tha Panamere 
Louie, Gucci, Fini or Versace be my day a pair 
Oh that shit got you talkin 
Its nice, Christmas Caroline with the bullshit 
I do this for real though 
Kick it with a player, talking gang when the field goal 
Swimming in some money, fuck around and do a backstroke 
You know how I like it baby, you just keep your bag low 
Main Im a dog, my wips are retarded 
Swag out of space, you couldnt match it with a martian 
Whatcha talin? 
Check the swag. Yea, its on 
Gettin cash, the bank row 
I get it fast, never slow 
Piss em off just to let them haters know 
Let em know you will never meet a nigger this fly, aint lying 
Got the top off the wip 
You aint ridin, you aint ridin 
If the watch under 40 
You aint shinnin, you aint shinnin 
Piss em off, you niggas all talk, aint bide it
