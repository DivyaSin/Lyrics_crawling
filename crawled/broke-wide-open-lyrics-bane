Just one quick glance was all that it took 
Trapped in your stare of judgement 
As we pass each other on the street 
And I look into your robot eyes as you make your careful calculations 
I choke on your perfume as you file me into lower class 
The moment stretches as I hear the cries of everyone 
That you have stepped on so many throats 
Bled dry to get to who you are today 
A lifetime spent swinging the sharpest of knives 
Oh how I'd like to take it all away 
One twitch of the finger one moment of heart felt compassion 
Break you wide open 
Stare straight through your center 
A lifetime spent with so little sweat 
That nothing in you grew nothing but vanity and twisted wires 
From a rusted heart that slightly resembles a cash register 
Just one look that says it all 
While you figure out just what I'm worth 
And that's the best that you've got 
That and a thousand dollar handbag 
How'd I like to wash it all away 
There is a middle in you somewhere 
Break it open 
For the world to see one quick beautiful violent motion 
A lifetime spent swinging the sharpest of knives 
And you wonder why I am so obsessed with guns...
