The youth of today is a man tomorrow 
Theyll still follow. 
In beginning of this aloud, 
Might gather all the stuff in. Crumbled in fears and run like in years 
To move forward up river with no. Incidential is a creep of coming whole 
Our children will pray and live for tomorrow. Unity for all, no matter the career 
The youth of today has a plan for tomorrow. 
The youth of today is a man of tomorrow. The youth of today is a man of tomorrow 
The youth of today is a man of tomorrow. The youth of today, the youth of today 
Is the man of tomorrow. 
The youth of today is the man of tomorrow. 
They dont live in tears, 
Beg, steal or borrow.
