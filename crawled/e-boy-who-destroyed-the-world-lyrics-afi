Once there was boy who had vibrant glow, but as it goes, someone took it from him 
One day through the rain I heard him meekly moan, he said 
"Will you wrap your arms around me as I'm falling?" Remember when remember when remember when we were all so beautiful? 
Never again never again 
But since then we've lost our glow They said it hurt their eyes but he would never know that they were filled with regret as their own 
He said, "I now feel more desperately alone, even though they wrapped their 
Arms around me as I'd fallen." Remember when remember when remember when we were all so beautiful? 
Never again never again 
But since then we've lost our glow Remember when remember when remember when we were all so beautiful? 
Never again never again 
But since then we've lost our glow They said it hurt their eyes, but he would never know that they were claiming 
Regret as their own 
Their own dissipated
