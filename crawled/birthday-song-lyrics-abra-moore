For you are so beautiful 
And you are so wild 
And you are so young 
Could you stay the way you are? You don't have to carry 
This world on your shoulders 
This life can be scary 
But when you get older Well, I don't have no magic map 
To help guide you along your path 
I just wish you 
All the best in this world For you are so beautiful 
And you are so wild 
And you are so young 
Could you keep it in your heart? And there you are 
You're way above the rafters 
I'm coming after you, yeah I pull you back 
But you keep crawling back for more 
You keep crawling back for more Go get your life 
It?s out there calling to you 
Yeah, you got the light For you are so beautiful 
And you are so wild 
And you are so young 
You just stay the way you are, yeah 
Yeah
