Mmm mmm yah 
I'll take you there 
I'll make the most of it 
Mm mm yah 
You can't confess 
'Cause everyone has goals to live There's addicts by habits and feeding times 
It opens the door to a goldmine awaiting 
Never to return Mmm yah 
You can't compare 
'Cause everyday 
Mmm yah 
I'll take the bet 
I'll bet you'll fold There's addicts by habits and feeding times 
It opens the door to a goldmine awaiting 
Never to return See I never really knew you 
I mean I never really tried to 
Find the way here I tear through 
Leave you fearful 
I'm in a clear view 
Closer I appear like images inside your rearview 
Curling up like smoke dripping out from the nostrils 
Overcome colossal obstacles 
Calm down the hostile rascals 
Its impossible 
I make a million from minerals under my land 
Thats (?) from gas particles and fossils 
Retreat to my fortress of solitude 
Then I study my molecules 
The physiology of man is biological 
Although it seems radical, life is mathematical 
Birth on this planet Earth in the universe is the most habitable 
Pine trees on green hills 
I've seen queens, I've seen mills 
I know the potential of a seed is sometimes concealed Just take a photograph 
I gotta go See I never really knew you 
I mean I never really tried to 
Find the way here Mmm yah 
I'll take you there
