You can walk just like me 
Put your shoe on another foot 
You can walk just like me Walkin' an' a talkin' 
See an' feel a just like me Put your hand in another glove 
You can feel just like me 
Put your hand in another glove 
You can feel a just like me Walkin' an' a talkin' 
See an' feel a just like me Put your shoes on, baby Put your eye on another view 
You can see just like me 
Hey, put your eye on another view 
You can see just like me Walkin' an' a talkin' 
See an' feel a just like me Put your tongue on another word 
You can talk just like me 
Put your tongue on another word 
You can talk just like me Walkin' an' a talkin' 
See an' feel a just like me Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho
