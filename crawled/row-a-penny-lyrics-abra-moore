Speak easy when you speak of leavin' here 
Try not to talk too loud, yeah 
Take your time when you walk away from here 
Try not to take too long, yeah Sometimes this love feels just like a big wheel 
It keeps turnin', turnin' down the avenue 
Sometimes it goes up, sometimes we go down 
Sometimes we just don't know what to feel 
For our love is only perfect for a very short time So I'll, I'll let you go 
And I'll, I'll watch you fall 
And I'll, I'll push you deeper than 
You've ever been pushed before For our love is only perfect 
For a very short time 
Said our love, it's only perfect So come on throw another penny down the river bed 
We'll see if it comes out shinin' and bright 
Throw another penny down the river bed 
We'll see if it comes out shinin' and bright And I'll, I'll let you go 
And I'll, I'll watch you fall 
And I'll, I'll push you deeper than 
You've ever been pushed before Throw another penny down the river bed 
See if it comes out shinin' 
(You've ever been pushed before) 
Throw another penny down the river bed 
See if it comes out shinin' Throw another penny down the river bed 
See if it comes out shinin' 
Throw another penny down the river bed 
See if it comes out shinin'
