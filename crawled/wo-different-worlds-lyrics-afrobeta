It started off like all good things do 
a little after two whatcha gonna do 
I don't have a car neither do you you 
I don't live very far we could walk too 
my friends are going home I could go home with you 
we could keep it quiet they wouldn't have a clue 
You smell so nice, dance so well, it's so dark, 
They can't tell 
What you think they'd say if they knew We're from two different worlds we barely know each other 
How was I to know that you were with another 
We're from two different world and now that we're lovers 
Nobody knows we keep it undercover We're from two different worlds and now that we're lovers 
Nobody knows we keep it undercover The night's getting longer with every step 
You're askin me know are we there yet 
Anticipation is makin me sweat 
are you thinkin it through, is it so wrong to do 
it's a complicated situation, lovers and friends when does it end, which one goes no one knows is it time to pretend, it's a complicated situation, lovers and friends can we begin, meet me here, let's go there only if you dare We're from two different worlds we barely know each other 
How was I to know that you were with another 
We're from two different world and now that we're lovers 
Nobody knows we keep it undercover We're from two different worlds and now that we're lovers 
Nobody knows we keep it undercover Hey I promise I'll call you when I get into your city 
Hold your breath, say bye to your friends before you do it 
you know the drill, a good girl keeps a secret 
nobody knows but everyone knows, 
there's something goin on between us
