[verse one] 
when i was young, 
i didn't know what to say, 
so i would ask my mother, 
questions everyday. one day she told me, 
to go outside and play, 
so i listened to her, 
and ran far away, [chorus] 
i thought she didn't love me, 
so i got me stuff and fled. 
now i wonder if it was the right thing to do. 
since i have fallen and hit my head. 
and now that I'm away from home, 
i am saying... 
WOO HOO! [verse 2] 
when i was young i wanted to be famous, 
now that i got it, i don't see what's so great, 
i think that this is all a sham, 
for whatever they want you to believe, 
so believe everything stars say, 
they are just influencing you to do what they think is right, 
witch really isn't right to begin with. so i am going to tell you, 
not to believe everything happiness says, 
nothing feels better then running from fears. [chorus] 
i thought she didn't love me, 
so i got me stuff and fled. 
now i wonder if it was the right thing to do. 
since i have fallen and hit my head. 
and now that I'm away from home, 
i am saying... 
WOO HOO! [Bridge] 
so now that i have told you what i think, 
i hope that you take it to heart. my mother never answered or talked to me much, 
so then i started to get this big hunch, 
that she didn't want me near her, 
even though she said i was dear to her, 
and the stars tell you to live your own life, 
and be who you want to be, 
but nothing really turns out the way you want it, 
unless you believe in yourself. [chorus] 
i thought she didn't love me, 
so i got me stuff and fled. 
now i wonder if it was the right thing to do. 
since i have fallen and hit my head. 
and now that I'm away from home, 
i am saying... 
WOO HOO! i thought she didn't love me, 
so i got me stuff and fled. 
now i wonder if it was the right thing to do. 
since i have fallen and hit my head. 
and now that I'm away from home, 
i am saying... 
WOO HOO! i thought she didn't love me, 
so i got me stuff and fled. 
now i wonder if it was the right thing to do. 
since i have fallen and hit my head. 
and now that I'm away from home, 
i am saying... 
WOO HOO! woo hoo! 
woo hoo! 
woo... hoo!!!
