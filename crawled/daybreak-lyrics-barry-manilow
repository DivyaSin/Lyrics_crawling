I'm singin' to the world, it's time we let the spirit come in 
Let it come on in 
I'm singin' to the world, everybody's caught in the spin 
Look at where we've been 
We've been runnin' around, year after year 
Blinded with pride, blinded with fear But it's daybreak, if you want to believe 
It can be daybreak, ain't no time to grieve 
Said it's daybreak if you'll only believe 
And let it shine, shine, shine 
All around the world (sing it to the world, sing, sing) 
(Sing it to the world, sing, sing) Singin' to the world, what's the point in puttin' it down? 
There's so much love to share 
I'm singin' to the world, don't you see it all comes around? 
The feeling's everywhere 
We've been closin' our eyes, day after day 
Covered in clouds, losin' our way Hey, but it's daybreak 
If you want to believe, it can be daybreak 
Ain't no time to grieve 
Said it's daybreak, if you'll only believe 
And let it shine, shine, shine 
All around the world (gotta sing, sing it to the world) 
(Everyone singing, sing it to the world) Yes, and it's daybreak 
If you want to believe, it can be daybreak 
Ain't no time to grieve 
Said it's daybreak, if you'll only believe 
And let it shine, shine, shine 
All around the world (everyone singing, sing it to the world) 
Let it shine, shine, shine 
All around the world (sing it to the world, sing, sing) 
(Sing it to the world, sing, sing) It's day-ee-ay-ee-ay break, can ya feel it (sing it to the world, sing, sing) 
It's day-ee-ay-ee-ay break, can ya sing it (sing it to the world, sing, sing) (Sing it to the world, sing, sing) 
(Sing it to the world, sing, sing) sunshine 
(Sing it to the world, sing, sing) 
(Sing it to the world, sing, sing)
