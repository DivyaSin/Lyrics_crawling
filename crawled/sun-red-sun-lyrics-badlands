Late one night through a purple sky 
A vision touched my soul 
Listening to the wind that night 
My soul lost control 
500 years of voices carry on the wind 
Each dawn I watched a sunset melt through an ocean blue 
Aaaww, through and ocean blue 
Sun red sun (sun) 
You've been bleeding child for much too long 
Sun red sun (sun) 
You've been bleeding child for much too long 
Yeah, yeah 
Angels like red shed me of my sins 
And freedom's touched my wings 
Through this hour in the thick and thin 
I stand alone again 
500 years of voices carry on the wind 
Each dawn I watched the sunset melt through an ocean blue, oh 
Sun red sun (sun) 
You've been bleeding child for much too long 
Sun red sun (sun) 
You've been bleeding child for much too long 
Much too long child, yeah 
Each dawn I watched a sunset melt through an ocean blue 
500 years of voices carry on the wind 
Aaaww, strong connection winds 
Sun red sun (sun) 
You've been bleeding child for much too long 
Sun red sun (sun) 
You've been bleeding child for much too long 
Sun red sun (sun) 
You've been bleeding child 
You've been bleeding child 
Bleeding child 
Bleeding child, Oh
