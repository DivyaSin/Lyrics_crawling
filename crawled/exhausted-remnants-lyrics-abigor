Silent screams - beaten and torn 
Sanctify - this life of scorn 
Innocence withdrawn in fear 
Night grows cold and twilight's near 
But the light I see is none 
Just a spectrum of unreal colours 
Which appears before my eyes 
For you neither to see, nor to feel 
Shattered scattered - remnants of life 
What can be extracted from nothing 
What can be found within the emptiness 
Within the emptiness from which I am fed 
I deal in pain - all life I drain 
Cherished - the grandeur of melancholy 
Always and never - the skyline seems so unreal 
If I had wings, would I be forgiven 
If I had horns, would there be flames to show my cry 
Laughing and crying - nothing remains 
No future and no past 
No one could foresee 
The end has come so fast 
And I reach my hand towards this ocean of despair 
To grant my soul a lifetime in hell
