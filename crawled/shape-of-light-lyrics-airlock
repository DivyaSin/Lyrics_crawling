What is it that makes you do 
Things that will bring harm to you 
What is it that fills your head 
And keeps you in your smoky bed What is it that makes you lie 
To yourself you don't know why 
What is it that has the power 
To keep you coming back for more 
You're blinded eyes What is it that makes you drink 
Destroys your mind so you can't think 
What is it that makes you take 
Another fix, there's no escape What is it you sacrifice 
Your everything, your very life 
What is it that pulls you down 
And kicks you when you're on the ground 
You're running dry Is there some place I can go 
Is there some place I can lie 
Take me under your wing 
I need to fill this space inside 
Made in a shape of light Vocoder What is it that ties your hands 
Trips you up and claims the land 
What is it that makes you laugh 
For a while, then all is dry What is it that pushes you 
Closer to the edge, each time 
What is it that makes you pay 
You're giving everything away 
It's time to rise Is there some place I can go 
Is there some place I can lie 
Take me under your wing 
I need to fill this space inside Is there some place I can go 
Is there some place I can lie 
Take me under your wing 
I need to fill this space inside 
Made in a shape of light Vocoder Is there some place I can go 
Is there some place I can lie 
Take me under your wing 
I need to fill this space inside Is there some place I can go 
Is there some place I can lie 
Take me under your wing 
I need to fill this space inside 
Made in a shape of light
