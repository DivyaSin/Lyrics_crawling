So I sit here 
In my hole 
I hope the Lord can 
Come save my soul 'Cause I'm a sinner to my core 
I ask forgiveness and nothing more Darkness surrounds me 
And I can't see 
All of the demons 
Right here with me 'Cause I'm a sinner to my core 
I ask forgiveness and nothing more My eyes are open 
Now I can see 
All of the damage 
Brought on by me I'm a sinner to my core 
And I ask forgiveness and nothing more 'Cause I'm a sinner to my core 
I ask forgiveness and nothing more 
I ask forgiveness and nothing more
