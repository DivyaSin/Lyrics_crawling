Ruth, think about the hope we waste, everyday we erase 
Ruthie can't hear me at all 
I come home 
Another story to own 
This one speaks highly of you 
In notes of the cruel 
And lying is like murder, it's easier each time 
There is only one more step towards your prize 
Open their eyes, open my eyes 
If we could be anything, I'm a dirty monster 
Once I remember forget 
Lies confess, eyes undress 
Your eyes are covered in tarp 
We buried your heart 
And lying is like murder, it's easier each time 
There's only one more step to reprisal 
Open their eyes, open your eyes 
I've got the sickness, I'm the protege, I've been blessed, 
I am diseased boy, catching now like all the rest 
We are revenge, we are progress, we regress 
Hypercynical, hypercynical, hypercynical 
I dreamt murder, ending my regrets 
One thing to depend on is the union of killers and liars 
Open your eyes
