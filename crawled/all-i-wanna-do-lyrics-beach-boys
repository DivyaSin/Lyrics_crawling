All I want to do 
Is always bring good to you 
To give you all the love I can 
And help you in whatever you do Sure as the sun will come around again to start off another day 
You can be sure that in my heart and soul I'll love you in every way All I want to do 
Is bring happiness to you 
I hope it makes you happy to know 
My love's with you wherever you go Ooo when I sit and close my ey-eyes 
A gentle thought comes in my mind 
My love is burnin' brightly 
Like the moon and stars shine nightly 
All I want to do 
All I want to do 
All I want to do 
All I want to do
