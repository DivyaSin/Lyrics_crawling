Alone with my shadows I've come 
To sing the twilight's hymn every time 
A new day dawns onto a place most desirable 
Grateful disembodiment 
..to pierce some holes into our horizon of perception 
which new imaginations could penetrate thru... 
Our dreams will shine like thunder 
On a senseless rainy day 
Wrapped in the dank breathing 
Of both nature and man 
The stars look all too near 
The senses lie so far 
But it's not the way we fear 
It's more the thing we are 
The stars look all too near 
The seasons, oh, so dark 
It's not the way we fear 
It's more the way we are 
Didn't pain prove life 
With its reasons all hallowed 
Didn't fight prove darkness 
With its shadows eclipsed? 
..und die Maschine der Welt kehrt zurck... 
Auspressend den Lebenssaft aus meinen Knochen 
Bin erneut Vergangenheit, ohne Herz, trist und kalt 
Die tote Zeit legt ihren kalten Krper auf meine feuchte Haut 
..und wird zur Ewigkeit... 
Didn't pain prove life 
With its reasons all hallowed 
Didn't light prove darkness 
With its shadows eclipsed 
Alone with my shadow I'm gone 
Still I hear the twilight's hymn everytime 
Life continues its sculptures 
Like poetry without rhyme!
