Rise in the morning shakin wits from your head 
Cussin that morning sun as your crawling out of your bed 
Knees in your back say its time for you to slow down 
Its only what youve lived for and its all that youve ever known 
Rollin down that highway ignoring all of your pain 
Lyin flat in the dirt your just trying to find your way Chorus 
Some call you a fool others call you a bum 
Numbing all of your pain in your reach for your number one 
Some call you crazy but to people that just dont know 
Your living like the gypsy and your living for your rodeo Flying down that highway you got to make it to your next show 
Got the Allman Brothers band jamming on your radio 
Running low on your money hell your running low on your gas 
Hells a lot better than watching your dreams just ride on past 
Cant please the world man you cannot please them at all 
Cuz only in the saddle still its high and your riding tall Chorus
