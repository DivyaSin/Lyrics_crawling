Don't give in the burdens you thrive in. 
Deep inside your head is where you hide them, in this chaos. Your secret, buried inside your chest. Oh my soul, that is all I am, and all I have become,

a thousand reasons to give in, 
the waters we thrive in. 
Twenty feet below the ground 
we hide them, in this chaos. Don't give in the burdens you thrive in, 
deep inside your head is where you hide them, in this chaos.
