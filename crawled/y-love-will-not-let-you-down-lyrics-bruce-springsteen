At night I go to bed 
But I just can't sleep 
I got something runnin' around my head 
Ooh that just won't keep In the silence I hear my heart beatin' 
Time slippin' away 
I got a time bomb tickin' deep inside of me 
Girl all I want to say I keep searchin' for you darlin' 
Searchin everywhere I go 
And when I find you there's gonna be just one thing that you gotta know One thing you gotta know My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down At night I walk the streets lookin' for romance 
But I always end up stumblin' in a half trance 
I search for a connection in some new eyes 
That hardly protect you from too many dreams passed by I see you standin, across the room watchin' me without a sound 
I'm gonna push my way through that crowd 
I'm gonna tear your holy walls down 
Tear all your walls down My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down Well hold still now darlin' 
Hold still for god's sake 
Cause I got me a promise 
I ain't afraid to make (I ain't afraid to make) My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down 
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
