It's Christmastime, there's no need to be afraid 
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade 
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy 
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime 
But say a prayer and pray for the other ones 
At Christmastime It's hard, but when you're having fun 
There's a world outside your window 
And it's a world of dread and fear 
And the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears And the Christmas bells that ring there 
Are the clanging chimes of doom 
Well, tonight thank God it's them instead of you 
There won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime, no The greatest gift they'll get this year is life 
Oh, where nothing ever grows, no rain or river flows 
Do they know it's Christmastime at all? Here's to you, raise a glass for ev'ryone 
Here's to them, underneath that burning sun 
Do they know it's Christmastime at all? (Feed the world) 
(Feed the world, let them know it's Christmastime again) 
(Feed the world, let them know it's Christmastime again) 
(Feed the world, let them know it's Christmastime again) 
(Feed the world, let them know it's Christmastime again)
