It's August again and I'm on my own 
I'm under a cloud and I'm staying home 
The telephone rings and I am hiding out Rituals carved on a well worn path 
It's up with people but I'm failing that class 
So many reasons to style but I'm happy to down I'm under a cloud and no one knows 
Under a cloud my beauty unfolds like a rose 
Whoa-oh oh I've been down so long I got a fear of heights 
My mind keep telling me that something's not right 
So I walk in the sun in my rain hat and overcoat Makes no sense and it's so surreal 
Dispite what you see I feel what I feel 
And I'm bailing out water from this lush lifeboat I'm under a cloud no one knows 
Under a cloud my beauty unfolds like a rose It's a terrible lie 
None of it ever happened 
I have my sunny, sunny days always serverd blackened 
yah 
(oh yah) I'm under a cloud no one knows 
Under a cloud my beauty unfolds 
I'm under a cloud and no one knows 
Under a cloud the beauty unfolds 
Like a rose 
Like a rose Oooh oooh (Baking sun) Bailing out water from this lush boat (Walking in the sun) Bailing out water from this lush boat (Walking in the sun)
