Once I was complete 
With the earth firm under my feet 
My back was strong, my body fleet 
And now I ache all over 
Now I ache all over I learned each virtue I was told 
I worked hard to avoid the mold 
But as I saw my life unfold 
There was no place for me 
There was no place for me I've been beat, I've been broken 
I asked for a place and the world has spoken 
I was asleep, but now that I've woken 
I preferred my dreams. I'm tired guilt, I'm tired of crying 
I'm tired of work and I'm finished trying 
I'm tired of living and I'm scared of dying 
But there is nothing else. It was hard as I begun; 
Each day harder it has become. Once I was complete 
With the earth firm under my feet 
My back was strong, my body fleet 
And now I ache all over 
Now I ache all over I learned each virtue I was told 
I worked hard to avoid the mold 
But as I saw my life unfold 
There was no place for me 
There was no place for me I've been beat, I've been broken 
I asked for a place and the world has spoken 
I was asleep, but now that I've woken 
I preferred my dreams. I'm tired of guilt, I'm tired of crying 
I'm tired of living and I'm scared of dying 
I'm tired of work and I'm finished trying 
But there is nothing else. It was hard as I begun; 
Each day harder it has become. Once I was complete 
With the earth firm under my feet 
My back was strong, my body fleet 
Now I ache all over 
Now I ache all over
