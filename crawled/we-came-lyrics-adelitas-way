I came to stomp all of you out again 
Sending never left me but they're worrying now we'll knock your sense in 
'Cause I don't like just what you are 
I don't like your point of view 
You send them somewhere else to lay 
Show me why we came Hate the little desert you'll be fooled in flame 
I think it's time I showed you why we came 
I'm a little smarter, and I ain't playing games 
I think it's time I showed you why we came 
I think it's time I showed you why we came 
I think it's time I showed you why we came I tamed all that you know, the end 
Should have never left me 
'Cause you feel it now, so stop pretending Hate the little desert you'll be fooled in flame 
I think it's time I showed you why we came 
I'm a little smarter, and I ain't playing games 
I think it's time I showed you why we came 
Think it's time I showed you why we came (Solo) I came to stomp all of you out, again 
Should have never let me 
'Cause we're worried now we'll knock your sense in Hate the little desert you'll be fooled in flame 
I think it's time I showed you why we came 
I'm a little smarter, and I ain't playing games 
I think it's time I showed you why we came Hate the little desert you'll be fooled in flame 
I think it's time I showed you why we came 
Think it's time I showed you why we came It's why we came 
It's why we came 
To show you why we came
