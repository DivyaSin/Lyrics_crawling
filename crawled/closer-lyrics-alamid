I 
I remember the day we met 
And the sun was about to set 
I often think about you day and night 
How time flies by 
Now there's light. REFRAIN 
I remember the moment 
I fell in love with you 
You told me (You/You'll) feel 
The same way too. CHORUS 
To be closer to you (closer to you) 
(That's/Is) all I want to do 
To be closer to you 
And feel the same way too. BRIDGE 
I am hoping and I always pray 
That God won't take you away. II 
All the love letters and "I love you's" 
Won't mean a thing if it wasn't from you 
I wish that we could be together again 
Right this moment until the end. [REPEAT REFRAIN, CHORUS & BRIDGE] 
ADLIB 
[REPEAT REFRAIN & CHORUS then fade]
