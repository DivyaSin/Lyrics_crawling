Ho ho ho Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh 
Ladies and gentlemen 
I give you the jingle bass Merry Christmas Dashing through the snow 
On a one horse open sleigh 
O'er the fields we go 
Laughing all the way Bells on bobtail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
A sleighing song tonight Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh Let me hear you say 
Ho ho ho What fun it is to sing the sleighing song tonight Dashing through the snow 
On a one horse open sleigh 
O'er the fields we go 
Laughing all the way Bells on bobtail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
A sleighing song tonight Everybody sing Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh Let me hear you say 
Ho ho ho Merry Christmas
