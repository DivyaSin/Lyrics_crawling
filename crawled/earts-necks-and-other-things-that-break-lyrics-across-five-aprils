Heart-shaped hallways. 
Leading the way to nowhere. 
You left me stranded here. 
Three years from anywhere. 
No sign of a way back only fear. 
I'll just follow the fragrance of these fake tears. 
Your silence says it all. I know your throat is swelling. 
You want to say so much. 
But you're afraid you might say what you mean. 
I loved you for who you were. 
You tried and tried to change me. 
It's funny now how you say you're leaving. 
Because I'm not the man I used to be. 
Shape someone else now, mold someone new. 
Take someone else down, your heart-shaped hallway too.
