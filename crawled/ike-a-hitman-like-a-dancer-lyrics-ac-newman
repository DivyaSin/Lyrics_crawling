Like a hitman, oh, like a dancer 
On the soul, on the soul 
Like the old champion about to go under 
Oh my soul, oh my soul You'd like a change, man 
Without a change, man 
You could've changed sides 
But you wanted to win 
Changed sides 
But you wanted to win Like a fourth wall, cop chase on blue screen 
All eyes roll, all eyes roll 
Like a snowfall that blankets a city 
Swallowed whole, swallowed whole You'd like a change, man 
Without a change, man 
You could've changed sides 
But you wanted to win 
Changed sides 
But you wanted to win Like a hitman, oh, like a dancer 
On the soul, on the soul 
Like a balancing act or a stage whisper 
It's all I know, it's all I know You'd like a change, man 
Without a change, man 
You could've changed sides 
But you wanted to win 
Changed sides 
But you wanted to win Like a change, man 
Without a change, man 
You could've changed sides 
But you wanted to win 
Changed sides 
But you wanted to win Like a hitman, oh, like a dancer 
Like a hitman, oh, like a dancer
