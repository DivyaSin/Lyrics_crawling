I waited for you today 
But you didn't show, no no no 
I needed you today 
So where did you go? You told me to call 
Said you'd be there 
And though I haven't seen you 
Are you still there? I cried out with no reply 
And I can't feel you by my side 
So I'll hold tight to what I know 
You're here, and I'm never alone And though I can not see you 
And I can't explain why 
Such a deep, deep reassurance 
You've placed in my life Whoa, we cannot separate 
'Cause you're part of me 
And though you're invisible 
I'll trust the unseen I cried out with no reply 
And I can't feel you by my side 
So I'll hold tight to what I know 
You're here, and I'm never alone We cannot separate 
You're part of me 
And though you're invisible 
I'll trust the unseen I cried out with no reply 
And I can't feel you by my side 
So I'll hold tight to what I know 
You're here, and I'm never alone
