In the lobby of the LRC 
Well, I knew I'd find something 
A hundred stories sittin' there to read 
I got my focals out, I put 'em on And all is calm, all is calm There's a doggie coming here to eat now 
Which dated back to 1993 
I don't care what the people say 'cause 
That dog, he don't come around here anymore No, no the dog is gone, the dog is gone 
No, no the dog is gone, the dog is gone The town is so small 
How could anybody not 
Look you in the eyes? 
The way that you drive by The world is such a wonderful place 
The world is such a wonderful I see everyone before me, there was birthday sex and sleep 
Some weren't getting along 
Nobody's outside trying to murder 
Nobody's outside, there's no one really at all What the hell I saw, the hell I saw 
The hell I saw, the hell I saw The town is so small 
How could anybody not 
Look me in the eyes? 
The way that I drive by The world is such a wonderful place 
The world is such a wonderful place 
The world is such a wonderful place 
The world is such a wonderful place 
La-dee-dah, la-dee-dah, la-dee-dah, la-dee-dah
