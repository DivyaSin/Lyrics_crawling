When the first simple cells, Met the first rays of light. 
Carbon beings in process, Leading to the life that we have today. 
A billion years later, technology springs. Exploding progress pushes us forward. 
But exploding progress is tearing us down. What is fiction is fact, There is no blame for conditioning. 
Reality's created by ourselves, We're to blame for our problems. 
Cells of our shells, merge with the earth, Becoming separately involved. 
Composting, transgressing. In order to embrace life and death. We must eliminate, the boundaries that lie between the Physical and spiritual. 
Symbiosis, a two way process. People read their lives and then create their psychosis. 
Staying conscious requires effort, Evolution reawakens primal subconscious. 
Aware - Awake - Alert Known or felt by ones inner being. Flow and flower Observer, and observed. A wave, infinite ocean. 
Life and death in cyclic motion. You are a human being. 
You have an ego and mind It's a useful part of you But it's not you.
