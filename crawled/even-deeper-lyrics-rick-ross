Intro -Barry White 
It feels so good 
You lying here next to me 
Oh, 
Rick ross 1st Verse 
I living underneath the telescope 
Ciroc in my margarita in mehico! 
Got a model with me that I seen on worldstar 
Introduced her to the world of La pearla 
Im talking S and M but got her screaming A to Z 
Talking the type of cheese she used to think was make believe 
I used to fuck em then I made em leave 
Leaving things, I had a bucket full of maybeline! 
I had a bucket of my favorite green 
Open up the budget now its only major things 
Most things, run ya half a ticket 
Bugatti Boys, cop don't even write the ticket! 
I got a few crips that wanna come and kick it 
Catch blue balls if one of ya niggas bitches 
I know the feeling gotta re-align your wills to life 
Or better yet you maybe should write your will tonight! Chorus 
Barry White 
Deeper and deeper 
In love with you I'm falling, yeah 
Sweeter and sweeter 
Your tender words of love keeps calling 
(Ross) adlibs 2nd verse 
Got on my vacaron im paid in full 
Lining up all my niggas bout to pull some major moves 
Consolidate the game and suffocate the others 
Keep it real with ur niggas and multiply the numbers! 
Go to trial and never take the stand 
Every bitch was born to break her man (?) 
I take you deeper than them other dudes 
I see my niggas scramble chickens by the twos 
He talkling like a hoe and family in the benzz 
She acting like a bitch well im takin her friend 
Ran outta 1s now im throwing what I got 
I took her home time to show her what I got 
I took her tongue and took it to another notch 
Im getting funds time to get another watch 
Im having fun fuck it let my brother watch! 
I got credit cards and headed to another lot! 
(ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,Maybach music) 
.... Money Grew like grass 
....Money Grew like Grass 
Uh! Chorus 
Barry White 
Cause deeper and deeper 
In love with you I'm falling 
Sweeter and sweeter 
Your tender words of love keeps calling
