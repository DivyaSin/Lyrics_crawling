The bear's at the window 
The moon is on time 
The record keeps playing 
That nursery rhyme 
The shape of my toenail 
Reminds me of Spain 
A half glass of whiskey 
Is all that remains 
Your phone's on the table 
My head's on it's way 
Down the drain 
I need a little hallelujah 
To feel no pain 
To feel no pain A light in the attic 
A bird in a cage 
Dear Mrs. Henry 
Feeds Mr. Beige 
The lock on the window 
Is rusted and cold 
There's bread on the counter 
That's seven days old 
The bear's on my shoulders 
He's more than I'm able to hold 
Get along little doggie 
Say what you will 
Say what you will A song for your birthday 
A knock on your door 
My hand's in your cookie jar 
Looking for more 
The clouds are behind you 
It's blue up ahead 
I'm looking for synonyms 
Rhyming with dread 
My bulldog reflection 
Stares back from the mirror instead 
I need a little hallelujah 
To feel no pain 
To feel no pain
