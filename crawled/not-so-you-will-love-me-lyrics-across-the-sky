I want to live in the moment 
Like there's nothing that I lack 
I want to give like there's nothing to lose 
And no reason to look back [Chorus] 
Not so You will love me 
Not so You will love me 
Not so You will love me 
But because You do There's no way to impress You 
There's no grace I can earn 
Help me to see that my life is a gift 
I can give in return [Chorus] Because You do 
I don't have to prove a thing 
Because You do 
I am free 
Where there's suffering I'll bring comfort 
Where there's wandering I will guide 
Where there's judgment I'll show mercy 
Where there is darkness I'll be light [Chorus]
