[Verse 1] 
I read your veins like lines on a map 
But I got no destination 
See the smoke and signals rise from my breath 
And the flames are cold and patient 
I filled you with a wonderland born of my imagination 
And go, I can't [Chorus] 
Cause my demons tied me down 
With silk chains wrapped around my soul 
It seems so obvious that I should put an end to this 
But demons take control 
Like toxins in my soul 
I know it seems so obvious that I should put an end to this 
Oh, no, they're just demons [Verse 2] 
I'm pushing through the blood in you 
To heal where you've been hurting 
And I'm so numb, I don't feel it run 
When it stains the walls around me 
I filled the room with shades of you 
Drawn in my imagination 
And go, I can't [Chorus] 
Cause my demons tied me down 
With silk chains wrapped around my soul 
It seems so obvious that I should put an end to this 
But demons take control 
Like toxins in my soul 
I know it seems so obvious that I should put an end to this 
Oh, no, they're just demons 
They're just demons [Bridge] 
They're just demons 
They're just demons 
Staring up the road 
Sick of the darkness and the cold 
The chains are wearing thin 
Oh, I'm fighting for us both 
I built this wonderland 
Drenched in the colours of your skin 
And go, I can't [Chorus - Variation] 
Cause my demons tied me down 
But silk chains are broken now 
I know it seems so obvious that I should put an end to this 
But demons take control 
Like toxins in my soul 
I know it seems so obvious that I should put an end to this 
Oh, no, they're just demons 
They're just demons
