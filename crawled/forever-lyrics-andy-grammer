Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh 
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh It's amazing the time that it's taking for you to come out here 
I don't know what you do in there 
Only so many ways you can change how light will hit your face 
Or how you can fix your hair 
You only got two eyes, two lips so why 
It shouldn't really take long at all 
But when you finally smile, 'cause it's just right 
Damn, you look beautiful You take forever, ever, ever, ever, hm 
But you're always worth waiting for 
You take forever, ever, ever, ever, hm 
I guess I'll wait a little more 
Now I know it's time I realize I'mma be waiting half my life, yeah 
With my back up against the door 
'Cause you take forever, ever, ever, ever, ever ever ever 
But you're always worth waiting for And you lie through your teeth 
When you try to convince me that you'll be 
That you'll be out in less than five 
Because we both know that the only way that you will ever leave 
Is if we set the whole place on fire You already said you had the perfect dress 
So why you gotta try more 
No matter how late it gets I must confess 
Damn you look beautiful You take forever, ever, ever, ever, hm 
But you're always worth waiting for 
You take forever, ever, ever, ever, oh yeah 
I guess I'll wait a little more 
Now I know it's time I realize I'mma be spending half my life, yeah 
With my back up against the door 
'Cause you take forever, ever, ever, ever, ever ever ever 
But you're always worth waiting for You take forever, ever, ever, ever 
I guess I'll wait a little more 
Now now now whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh whoa oh oh oh, yeah 
Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
I guess I'll wait a little more
