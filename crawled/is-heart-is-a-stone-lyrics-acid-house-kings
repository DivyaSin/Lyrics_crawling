They say your middle name is trouble 
But I know it's Caroline They say you remind them of problems 
But I think you look like Audrey Caroline, I know that you put on a show 
Every time you two disagree This heart is a stone 
No one will ever break it 
This heart is a stone 
Close to you it breaks easily 
Cause everything that they say 
It tells me to go away 
But everything that I feel 
It tells me to stay They say they can smell the drama 
But I know it's No. 5 They say you only bring heartache 
But I know you bought a bottle of wine Caroline, I know that you put on a show 
Every time you two disagree This heart is a stone 
No one will ever break it 
This heart is a stone 
Close to you it breaks easily 
Cause everything that they say 
It tells me to go away 
But everything that I feel 
It tells me to stay They say you're like a Monday morning 
I say you're like a Friday night 
I don't get their point 
Anytime is a good time for being with you This heart is a stone 
No one will ever break it 
This heart is a stone 
Close to you it breaks easily 
Cause everything that they say 
It tells me to go away 
But everything that I feel 
It tells me to stay
