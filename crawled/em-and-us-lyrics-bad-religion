Despite that he saw blatant similarity 
He struggled to find a distinctive moiety 
All he found was vulgar superficiality 
But he focused it to sharpness 
And shared it with the others 
It signified his anger and misery Them and us 
Lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers 
Them and us 
Dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence 
That there really is a difference 
Between them and us Hate is a simple manifestation 
Of the deep-seated self-directed frustration 
All it does is promote fear and consternation 
It's the inability 
To justify the enemy 
And it fills us all with trepidation Them and us 
Bending the significance to match a whimsied fable 
Them and us 
Tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence 
A confused loose alliance forming 
Them and us
