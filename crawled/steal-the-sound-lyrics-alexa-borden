Forging ahead, feeling lost. 
and this pace still feels tired. 
Stuck in my head. Ticking off. 
Even the stars are feeling wired. If you stay so still. 
and you steal the sound. 
you will hear me in a daydream. 
All around you is a daydream. Eager to be what I want. 
But the lethargy is all that I've got. 
Stuck in my place are the ticking bombs. 
Right in my face and they're armed. If you stay so still. and you steal the sound. you will hear me in a daydream. All around you is a daydream. I'm fighting for the words to say. 
They die on my tongue and fade away into the day. If you stay so still. and you steal the sound. 
You will hear me in a daydream. All around you is a daydream. 
But if you breathe real deep 
and you whisper it to sleep it will hold you in a daydream. it will take you into a daydream. 
In a daydream. 
Under bliss. 
Under bliss. 
Under bliss.
