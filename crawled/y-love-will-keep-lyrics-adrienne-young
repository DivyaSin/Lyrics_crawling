My Love Will Keep 
Adrienne Young / Mark D. Sanders Baby were you just about to kiss me 
Or were you just about to leave 
Come and sit down here beside me 
Maybe take a moment just to breathe Well I could say Im sorry 
And I could tell you I was wrong 
I just cant say FOREVER 
But here after from NOW ON I love you in the winter when the roots grow deep 
Love you in the spring when the leaves turn green 
I love you in the summer when the trees grow tall 
I love you in the fall of the year 
When the leaves turn brown 
When they cover the ground 
Down where the roots grow deep 
My love will keep Why worry bout our future 
If were not worried bout our past 
So dont you worry bout that question 
Youve been just about to ask I love you in the winter when the roots grow deep 
Love you in the spring when the leaves turn green 
I love you in the summer when the trees grow tall 
I love you in the fall of the year 
When the leaves turn brown 
When they cover the ground 
Down where the roots grow deep 
My love will keep
