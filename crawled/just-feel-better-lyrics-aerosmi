she said i feel stranded 
and i can't tell anymore 
if i'm coming or i'm going 
it's not how i planned it 
i got a key to the door 
but it just won't open i know i know i know 
part of me says let it go 
that life happens for a reason 
i don't i don't i don't 
becuase it never worked before 
but this time 
this time 
i'm gonna try anything to just feel better tell me what to do 
you know i can't see through the haze around me 
and i'd do anything to just feel better 
i can't find my way 
god i need a change 
and i'd do anything to just feel better 
any little thing to just feel better she said i need you to hold me 
i'm a little far from the shore 
and i'm afraid of sinking 
you're the only one who knows me 
and who doesn't ignore that my soul i weeping i know i know i know 
part of me says let it go 
everything must have its season 
'round and 'round it goes 
every day's the one before 
but this time 
this time 
i'm gonna try anything to just feel better tell me what to do 
you know i can't see through the haze around me 
and i'd do anything to just feel better 
i can't find my way

and i'd do anything to just feel better

to all the things i leave behind

you know i can't see through the haze around me 
and i'd do anything to just feel better
