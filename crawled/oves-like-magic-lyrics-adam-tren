Hoh, huh, come on 
Look behind the curtain, I still don't understand 
Was it misdirection or is it just sleight of hand? 
Is your illusion playing tricks on my mind? 
In my confusion losing track of the time? 
How do you do it? How do you do it? (Oh) 
How do you do it? There's nothing to it 
How do you do it, how do you do it? (Oh) 
How do you do it? 
She move like magic on the floor 
Always leave you wanting more 
She got nothing up her sleeve 
I don't know what to believe 
Move like magic on the floor 
Leave you guessing, never sure 
She be looking to deceive 
I don't know what to be believe 
She move like magic on the floor She's like magic, magic on the floor Smoke and mirrors 
Leaving me hypnotized 
Now I'm seeing clearer 
I be feelin' your vibe 
And when you're dancin' 
Keep the music alive 
How'd you get that magic, magic 
Look in your eye? How do you do it? How do you do it? (Oh) 
How do you do it? There's nothing to it 
How do you do it, how do you do it? (Oh) 
How do you do it?

Always leave you wanting more 
She got nothing up her sleeve 
I don't know what to believe 
Move like magic on the floor 
Leave you guessing, never sure 
She be looking to deceive 
I don't know what to be believe 
She move like magic on the floor 
Oh, come on How do you do it? How do you do it? (Oh) 
How do you do it? There's nothing to it 
How do you do it, how do you do it? (Oh) 
How do you do it? 
She move like magic on the floor 
Always leave you wanting more 
She got nothing up her sleeve 
I don't know what to believe 
Move like magic on the floor 
Leave you guessing, never sure 
She be looking to deceive
