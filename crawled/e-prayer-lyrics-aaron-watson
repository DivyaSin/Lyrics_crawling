My mountain is a mole hill 
My throne's a busted chair 
This crown has turn to rust 
And it's all tangled in my hair 
This high horse that I ride on 
Is gonna buckle at the knee 
Upon my castle made of sand 
I cannot be the king of me There's the man in white 
His words are painted red 
There's power in his blood 
And only truth in what he said 
There's the man in black 
With a needle in his vein 
Lyin' flat upon his back 
This is the prayer that he once prayed He said, "My mountain is a mole hill 
My throne's a busted chair 
This crown has turn to rust 
And it's all tangled in my hair 
This high horse that I ride on 
Is gonna buckle at the knee 
On my castle made of sand 
I cannot be the king of me" And this harem in my heart is filled 
With hot metal and fool's gold 
Watch your statue turns to dirt 
All that's left in the end is your soul 
God save your soul So he said, "Shout out of control 
With all your heart and soul 
Though this cold world 
May tear you apart 
Let the whole world know" My mountain is a mole hill 
My throne's a busted chair 
This crown has turn to rust 
And it's all tangled in my hair 
This high horse that I ride on 
Is gonna buckle at the knee 
Upon my castle made of sand 
I cannot be the king of me My mountain is a mole hill 
My throne's a busted chair 
This crown has turn to rust 
And it's all tangled in my hair 
This high horse that I ride on 
Is gonna buckle at the knee 
Upon my castle made of sand 
I cannot be the king of me Lord I'm just a man 
I cannot be the King of me
