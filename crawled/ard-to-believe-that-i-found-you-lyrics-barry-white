"Hard To Believe That I Found You" 
By: Barry White Ain't it a groove? 
It really is, isn't it? It really is 
Baby, you know what just sitting here thinking 
How happy we are right now 
And the way we are with each other 
The way we've been with each other 
You know every now and then two people get to share to know 
Love as we know it and as we share it 
And I really wish... 
It probably doesn't mean nothing to no one else 
But, I really, really wish 
That all women all over the world 
Could be loved as much as I love you 
That could be needed and wanted 
As much as you are 
You see baby, to me it's... 
It's like sometimes I think to myself 
And I say, humph! 
Brother, you're really lucky 
You've got a woman that loves you 
That needs you... 
That pleases you... 
A woman that does everything on earth that a man could dream of 
You got a woman that makes you feel real 
A woman that keeps you strong, right on! 
A woman that means so many things in so many ways 
You've got it all, humph! 
So, you see baby, I really can't 
I really can't help myself 
When I, when I tell you that 
That I love you, baby 
And I thank God for you 
And I want you to know that I do 
And you know sometimes 
I get so, so emotional over you 
I just wanna run out in the street and scream and shout 
And, and just tell the world 
I'm in love 
Oh, I found that one, I found that someone 
I just believe that I found you 
Never knew love could be so true 
And uuh, 
What did I ever say, I'd do, yeah 
Whatever made you love me too, yeah! 
You know I could go on forever and ever and ever and ever 
You know that, don't you baby? 
But, I want to sit here 
You and me close together 
Next to each other and dig this album 
'Cause this album is just for you 
And I want you to dig it 
'Cause it's ought site...I really dig it 
Huh, you like to the way it makes you feel? 
Huh, well right on then, huh, right on 
I love you baby 
Ooh, I love you 
Uh, uh, uh
