Starry, starry night 
The silver beams the only light 
Summer breeze, summer dreams 
Float over me 
The stars frame her silhouette 
Beauty steals away my breath 
The moment will last forever 
Forever, forever There is no time but now 
There is nowhere else but here Time has lost its grip tonight 
Beautiful enchantment 
I just might hold her, hold her close 
Never let her go 
The tenderness in her eyes 
Her hair is drenched with silver moonlight 
Half-spoken thoughts 
Forget-me-nots 
She's the jewel I've sought There is no time but now 
There is nowhere else but here 
When all else is cold 
The warmth of holding her near
