Verse 1: Oh my, what have I done 
My life has just begun 
It's so easy to make a mistake 
And my heart feels like it's gonna break 
I've cried so many tears 
Had to face all of my fears 
But I'm not afraid anymore 
Of this I'm sure 
But this is my reality 
And it's hard being me Chorus: This could have happened to anyone 
Why did this happen to me 
This could have happened to anyone 
Why did this happen to me 
But I'm gonna make it you'll see Verse 2: Oh God 
Please forgive my sins 
And this mess that I'm in 
I don't know how I got here 
And it doesn't even seem fair 
But this is my reality 
And it's hard being me Repeat chorus Bridge: Sometimes I wanna scream 
Sometimes I wanna cry 
And then there are the times 
I just don't understand why 
Sometimes I wanna scream 
Sometimes I wanna dream 
That this never happened at all 
I'm so tired of feeling sorry for myself 
Please Lord hear me 
I'm crying out for help 
I'm so tired of crying in the dark 
I'm not asking why 
That's why there's no question mark 
And the end of...why did this happen to me Spoken: They told you they're okay 
And that you don't have to worry about them that way 
That's the song a lot of people sing 
They told 20 other people the same thing 
Before they slept with them 
Crept with them 
Now you've got their number 
Now you are a number 
Another case on the face of this earth 
It's not about games 
They're not just numbers 
They're people with names 
Somebody's brother, sister, child 
Not just some file or statistic 
This is realistic 
You've got a void in your life Voids 
A loophole to your soul 
A false sense of security 
Compromising your purity 
You need to know why 
Safe sex is an illusion, a lie 
When they say safe sex 
They really mean safer sex 
Safe sex is really married sex 
Between faithful people 
The church and the steeple 
We're musicians not models 
We're supposed to be selling music, not sex 
So tell me what's next 
You say you can't be blamed for society's wrongs 
But your music and your movies turn people on 
It promotes certain behaviors and attitudes 
Symbols of ingratitude 
The diamonds in your chain 
Can't stop it from flowing through your veins 
Up there singing and rapping and clapping your hands 
While someone's life returns to the sands
