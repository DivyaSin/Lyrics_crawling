Jah Children. Jah children. Yeah the meek shall inherit the earth. Jah children. Yeah. The meek shall inherit the earth. Why must the Rasta live this way. The creator has shown us a better way. So why must I n'I fight each other. With unity and love for your brother, there's always a better day. In due season each will pay according to works that they have done on earth today. So I n'I. We shall live in truth. His majesty. His majesty has shown us a better way.
