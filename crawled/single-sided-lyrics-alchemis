Forced to hear your words, though they might be true. Say what you will, others have different points of view. Im hearing all that you say. You forgot no ones the same. This cannot be, you rant and rave. Open your mind, yourself youll save. There comes a time in everyones life. In the end its all the same. Where we choose to question our times, You believe you have certain rights. Its just a factor of human plight, Youre just one side of the game. Dont pretend to hear what I say, And its not the truth you relay, But my mind youll never change. Different thoughts go on in our heads. There is truth in all that is said, Seek to find the causes that evade you. We should be careful where we tread. Try to like the people that resent you, Clear your mind of fog, So you can see through, Dont forget that no one is the same. Seek to find the causes that evade you. Try to like the people that resent you, Clear your mind of fog, So you can see through, Dont forget that no one is the same. Must have the odds unbalanced. I call for heads, A coin thats single sided, Nothing is won, nothing prevails. You call for tails. Must have the odds unbalanced. A coin thats single sided, Look deep inside its there that youll find it, Spend all your life tying to hide it, Dont criticize until you have tried it, There are two sides to balance your mind, Youre single sided.
