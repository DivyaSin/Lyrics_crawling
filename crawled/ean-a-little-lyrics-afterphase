Sunshine, bright day. Happy. Smiling. 
Coffee, wake up, ready, for riding. 
Time to start it up, revving to the red line. 
Time to start it up, hear the noise of a four stroke turning. Again and again, time after time. Watching the white lines pass me by. 
Been on a bend, don't wanna end, finding the roads that make you. 
Lean a little, and get a little excited. 
Twist a little, and live this moment. Heartbeart rising. Excited. Jumping. 
Today, clear skies. Perfect for riding. 
Time to start it up, revving to the red line. 
Time to start it up, hear the noise of a four stroke turning. Again and again, time after time. Watching the white lines pass me by. 
Been on a bend, don't wanna end, finding the roads that make you. 
Lean a little, and get a little excited. 
Twist a little, and live this moment. Rising, turning, speed up, flowing. 
Straight line then curving, the best for riding. 
Time to start it up, revving to the red line. 
Time to start it up, hear the noise of a four stroke turning. Again and again, time after time. Watching the white lines pass me by. 
Been on a bend, don't wanna end, finding the roads that make you. 
Lean a little, and get a little excited. 
Twist a little, and live this moment. 
Live this moment, live this moment.
