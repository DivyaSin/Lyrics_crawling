It's thundering and it's lightning 
I know you're scared of storms 
I hope somebody's holding you 
and you feel safe and warm 
and they tell you that they love you 
and you have everything you need 
Tonight I'll try to find you somewhere in my dreams Chorus: And I don't understand it, it don't make sense to me 
Why can't we be together, if we're family? 
You share my blood, you've got my love 
and you're a part of me 
It's different worlds that we're living in 
Don't forget about me, JennaLyn. I've got some of your pictures of your mom and dad 
And I know that they're stick figures, 
but it still makes me sad 
Cause I wish that I was right there, holdin' your sweet hand 
And now I'm stuck with letters, to tell you who I am. Chorus: And I don't understand it, it don't make sense to me 
Why can't we be together, if we're family? 
You share my blood, you've got my love 
and you're a part of me 
It's different worlds that we're living in 
Don't forget about me, JennaLyn. (x2)
