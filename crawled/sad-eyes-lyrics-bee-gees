Looks like it's over 
You knew I couldn't stay 
She's coming home today 
We've had a good thing 
I'll miss your sweet love 
Why must you look at me that way 
It's over Ohh, sad eyes 
Turn the other way 
I don't want to see you cry 
Sad eyes 
You knew there'd come a day 
When we would have to say goodbye Try to remember 
The magic that we shared 
In time your broken heart will mend 
I never used you 
You knew I really cared 
I hate to say it at the end 
But it's over Ohh, sad eyes 
Turn the other way 
I don't want to see you cry 
Sad eyes 
You knew there'd come a day 
When we would have to say goodbye Sad eyes 
You knew there'd come a day 
When we would have to say goodbye 
Sad eyes 
(Sad eyes) 
Turn the other way 
(Turn the other way) 
I don't want to see you cry 
(Cry, cry, cry) Sad eyes 
(Sad eyes) 
You knew there'd come a day 
(Hey, hey) 
When we would have to say goodbye
