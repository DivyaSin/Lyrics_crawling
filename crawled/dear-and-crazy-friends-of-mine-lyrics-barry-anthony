One day I was looking back wondering how could we have done that 
Were we crazy, simply amazing or ahead of our time? 
Back then we all knew, there was something that we had to do 
And wed do it even if it took the rest of our lives. We were the rulers of the Universe, masters of all that we surveyed. 
We thought like kings and queens, believed in outrageous dreams, 
Those dear and crazy friends of mine. Amazing what wed do for kicks, laugh off at those dirty tricks 
that we play upon each other and upon ourselves. 
Well some of those schemes weren't very smart, ill-conceived but had a lot of heart 
and we charged anyway in the face of unbeatable odds. Soldiers of fortune I remember you, fighting for all that you believed. 
A toast to your noble quest, you'll always be the best, 
Those dear and crazy friends of mine, 
Those dear and crazy friends of mine. 
(Solo) 
Such was the glory of our youthful days, nothing to lose and all to gain. 
Seekers of true romance, willing to take a chance, 
Those dear and crazy friends of mine, those dear and crazy friends of mine.
