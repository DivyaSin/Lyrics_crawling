When you, you get through 
Whatever it is you been up to 
I'll still be he, still be he that drew you in And if they should ever say 
All your love did was get in my way, 
I'll defend you, I'll pretend it's not that way (hey) Though the memory of us is sweeter than we really were, 
Wouldn't trade all those bitter memories for her I hope he's all I'm not, 
And gives you every little thing he's got 
Strength and care, knows that you are a rare bird One who can't be tamed 
Still it's all the men before me they're the ones I blame 
You can add my name to the long heavy chain around you Though the memory of us is sweeter than we really were, 
wouldn't trade all those bitter memories for her.
