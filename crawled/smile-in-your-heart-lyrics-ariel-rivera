That you're holding my heart 
And i know that it is true 
You wouldn't let it be broken apart 
'coz it's much to dear to you 
Forever we'll be together 
No one can break us apart 
For our love will truly be 
A wonderful smile in your heart When the night comes 
And i'm keeping your heart 
How i feel so much more secure 
You wouldn't let me close my eyes 
So i can see you through and through You're a sweet tender lover 
We are so much in love 
I'm not afraid when you're far away 
Just give me a smile in your heart... You brighten my day 
Showin' me my direction

And givin' me inspiration 
How can i ask for more 
From you my dear 
Maybe just a smile in your heart I'm always dreamin' 
Of being in love

Since you came into my life 
It's true love that i had found I pray that you wouldn't leave me 
Whatever may come along 
But if you do i won't feel so bad
