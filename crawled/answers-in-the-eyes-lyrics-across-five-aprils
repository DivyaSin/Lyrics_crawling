I don't know how the days escape leaving nothing in their wake. Except the taste of regretting yesterday. I thought about the tears your cried and the miles that you drive. Just for me, just to see if I'm alive and breathing. So far, so good, so what happens to us now? Something about the way you looked at me tonight. Make me wonder what is going on. Will it be this way tomorrow? Soak the sun but not for very long. I want the morning to burn. If this is a game then I'm losing clearly. The way you looked at me tonight I could have died. Makes me wonder what is going on. Will it be this way tomorrow? Soak the sun but not for very long. I want the morning to burn. Something about the way you looked at me tonight. Sometihng about the way you look when I'm paralyzed by your eyes.
