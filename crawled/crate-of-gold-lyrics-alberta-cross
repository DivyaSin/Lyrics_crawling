Try to stay hungry 
With something to speak 
Looked out my window 
Whose after me Give up my heart 
It's too much guilt 
Gazed out my window 
Someone's scared of me Hey lord show me 
Too many people are after me 
Oh lord show me 
Too many people are mocking me Cut off my hands 
Let it bleed 
I've got a crate of gold inside of me 
Get it straight 
I'm not a jail 
And little folks don't bother me 
Get it straight now 
I'm not a saint Hey lord show me 
Too many people are mocking me 
Oh lord show me 
Too many people are mocking me Mocking me...
