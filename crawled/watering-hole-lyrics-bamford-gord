(Gord Bamford / Byron Hill) There ain't a whole lot of places 
For people round here to go 
But when the work week's done 
We're bound to have some fun 
Down at the watering hole Population seven hundred 
Is all this little town can hold 
But Friday night I swear 
They're all right here 
Hanging at the watering hole Chorus: 
It ain't a watering hole for horses 
Or a place where people go to swim 
Though there's a sign that says no fishin' 
No telling what you might reel in 
Yea a jukebox and a dance floor 
The wings are hot and the beer is cold 
The night is always young when you're having fun 
Down at the watering hole Hey that old bartender I bet he's seen it all 
He's seen grown men cry 
And girls gone wild 
And a few good bar room brawls 
Saturday morning at the diner 
There'll be a few good stories told 
Like who's the fool 
Who fell off his stool 
Down at the watering hole Repeat Chorus
