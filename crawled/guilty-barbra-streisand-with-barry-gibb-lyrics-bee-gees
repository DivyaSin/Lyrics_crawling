Shadows falling, baby ,we stand alone 
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own 
(It oughta be illegal) 
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad (It oughta be illegal) 
You got a reason for living, 
You battle on with the love you're living on 
You gotta be mine We take it away 
It's gotta be night and day 
Just a matter of time And we got nothing to be guilty of 
Our love will climb any mountain 
Near or far, we are, 
And we never let it end 
We are devotion. And we got nothing to be sorry for 
Our love is one in a million 
Eyes can see that we 
Got a highway to the sky 
I don't want to hear your goodbye 
Oh Aah 
Pulse's racing, darling, 
How grand we are 
Little by little we meet in the middle 
There's danger in the dark (It oughta be illegal) 
Make it a crime to be out in the cold 
(It oughta be illegal) 
You got a reason for living 
You battle on with the love you're building on You gotta be mine 
We take it away 
It's gotta be night and day, 
Just a matter of time And we got nothing to be guilty of 
Our love will climb and mountain 
Near or far, we are, 
And we never let it end 
We are devotion And we got nothing to be sorry for 
Our love is one in a million 
Eyes can see that we 
Got a highway to the sky I don't want to hear your goodbye 
Don't want to hear your goodbye 
I don't want to hear your And we got nothing and we got nothing to be guilty of 
Our love will climb and mountain 
Near or far, we are, 
And we never let it end 
We are devotion And we got nothing to be sorry for 
Our love is one in a million 
Eyes can see that we 
Got a highway to the sky 
Don't want to hear your goodbye 
Don't want to hear your And we got nothing to be guilty of
