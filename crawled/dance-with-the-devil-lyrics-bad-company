With just one look my body shook 
You made me ache, shiver and shake 
My blood is hot, I'm in a trance 
For what you've got I wanna take a chance Dance with the devil 
I want ya, yes I do 
Dance with the devil 
And the devil is you My mind's on a twist I can't resist 
Your sugar ????? thighs got me hypnotized 
I'm obsessed, I want to possess your love tonight I wanna dance with the devil 
I want ya, yes I do 
Dance with the devil 
And the devil is you Baby, I'd sell my soul 
To hold you tight tonight 
And never let go 
No no no no no no no I wanna dance with the devil 
I want ya, yes I do 
Dance with the devil 
And the devil is you 
And the devil is you 
And the devil is you I wanna dance with the devil 
And that devil is you 
Got me so, so confused
