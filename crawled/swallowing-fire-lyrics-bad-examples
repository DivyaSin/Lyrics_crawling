I been in it for the money 
I been in it for the fun 
I been in it for too long to want to give it up 
I been crashing and burning 
Pushing too hard after thrills 
I been haunted by a hunger that the pleasure never kills Swallowing fire 
Swallowing flame -- burning inside You don't remember where it hit you 
You just remember that it aches 
Nobody ever knows themselves except by their mistakes Swallowing fire 
Swallowing flame -- burning inside But somehow it keeps you running 
Out of control and into walls 
When you've broken your off switch, 
There's no limit to the falls Now the mornings run together 
Now the clock runs out of time 
And if I don't kill myself I'm gonna die trying Swallowing fire 
Swallowing flame -- burning inside 
I been swallowing fire 
I been swallowing flame, burning inside
