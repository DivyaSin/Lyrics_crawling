Sunday football I got boot off the pitch 
Some people gamble as a way to get rich 
I gotta find a better way to invest in zeroes, oh 
They say that rents may damage your health 
I'd rather save it all to spend on myself 
I got a letter of eviction and I'm no hero Oh, oh, oh, oh 
I'm not a saver, I'm a spender 
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
I'm a one weekender What can we do when our two worlds collide? 
There's only ten ways to survive all the chances of knowing 
After a hard day of work I go home 
I dunno where I'm going but I'm ready to go 
I made a lotta money but got nothing to show 
And now it's 2:59 and I'm still waiting for the train to go home I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of life 
Plenty of butter but I don't have a knife 
Sure beats the hell outta waiting for a ticket to Reno 
Watching TV makes me really upset 
I wonder why I haven't been on it yet 
I'm silly waiting for a part in a Tarrantino (Oh, oh, oh, oh) 
No, no, no, no 
I'm not a saver, I'm a spender 
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
I'm a one weekender What can we do when our two worlds collide? 
There's only ten ways to survive all the chances of knowing 
After a hard day of work I go home 
Y'know, I dunno where I'm going but I'm ready to go 
I made a lotta money but got nothing to show 
And now it's 2:59 and I'm still waiting for the train to go home What can we do when our two worlds collide? Oh 
After a hard day of work I go home 
I dunno where I'm going but I'm ready to go 
I said, I made a lotta money but got nothing to show 
And now it's 2:59 and I'm still waiting for the train to go home 
Yeah, I'm waiting for the train to go home
