O. NEVADA, SISTER ROSETTA THORPE, BRUNER, SPIVERY There's a light coming from a window 
and it shines down on the street. 
There are some guys standing on the corner 
singing that good old harmony. 
And the light coming from the window 
shines on a street-corner-symphony 
put on a laugh, put on a string 
and making that good old harmony 
I'm singing a soul to soul - brother to brother 
- a capella - sounds good to me. 
I'm singing a soul to soul - brother to brother 
- a capella - sounds good to me. 
I just want it understood 
boys about a bookie to the neighborhood 
and there standing under the light, 
I just see them every night 
singing that good old a capella 
sound so sweet, 
put on a laugh - put on a string, 
making that good old harmony 
I'm singing a soul to soul - brother to brother 
- a capella - sounds good to me. 
I'm singing a soul to soul - brother to brother 
- a capella - sounds good to me. 
Well I turn out the light, 
say good bye to another light 
I'm gonna rest my weary head, 
put my bones away to bed. 
I'm gonna get on my knees and pray to the Lord, 
give me just a one more day 
oho Lord - hear my plea, 
this music means so much to me. 
I'm singing a soul to soul - brother to brother 
- a capella - sounds good to me. 
I'm singing soul to soul - brother to brother 
- capella - sounds good to me
