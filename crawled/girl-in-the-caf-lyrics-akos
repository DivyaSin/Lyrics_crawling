Girl in the caf 
You wore all the jewels 
Only Nature could think of 
Girl in the caf 
You really pushed me 
To the brink of pain 
To see such beauty 
A pair of eyes just like a flash of light 
I lost you 
But I defrost you 
From my memory's freezer 
Every night 
No you weren't the love of my life 
But I'm still missing you 
No you weren't the love of my life 
And I've still got no clue 
about you 
Girl in the caf 
All those tears are drying 
I'm not denying 
Girl in the caf 
The magic's gone 
And there's no more crying 
For you and your ivory skin 
With Sister Midnight gasping within 
All the icons 
The zodiac signs 
Have failed to help you 
To get me to sin 
No you weren't the love of my life 
But I'm still missing you 
No you weren't the love of my life 
And I've still got no clue 
about you 
Girl in the caf 
In me a bomb exploded 
My heart was loaded 
Girl in the caf 
You conquered me 
And I want you to know it 
A war was waging in me 
To last awhile, centuries maybe 
Or else 
I might forget 
Your eyes that were 
Glowing so sad 
No you weren't the love of my life 
But I'm still missing you 
No you weren't the love of my life 
And I've still got no clue 
All about you
