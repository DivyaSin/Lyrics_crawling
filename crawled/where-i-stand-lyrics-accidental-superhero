i've got an accidental superhero 
who arrives on cue 
and he says why don't i save you 
why don't i rescue you 
my maverick wine here 
has got to be the notion 
my maverick wine here 
has got to be the potion and i laughed as she walked away 
'cause' i knew there would be 
no more days of lying or 
crying at all 
as she turned 
as she walked away 
her eyes looked through me 
as they seemed to say 
come my way 
come my way come my way, come my way 
you no longer need to stay away 
come my way, come my way and she moves like a dove, 
but i get this feeling that 
she's circling above, and she's 
waiting... and she's waiting 
for me to pass away 
pass away pass away, pass away 
you no longer need to stay away 
pass away, pass away and they know where i stand 
and i stand alone 
and now i'm waiting, waiting 
for you to call me home call me home, call me home 
you no longer need to stay and roam 
call me home, call me home 
call me home
