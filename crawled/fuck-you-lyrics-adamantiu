Now face me 
Not a word to say 
Now feel me scream this wall of hate 
I loved this friend 
But you lied 
You fucking pretend 
It tortures me 
Insanity 
That we must face 
Life loses taste My disrespect and my pain inside my chest 
Inside of me wanted your love 
You gave me hate 
Fuck you 
Never will I trust you again 
Never will I love you again 
It's hard for me and you'll never see 
Just what it meant and what to believe.
