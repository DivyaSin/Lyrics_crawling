Some things never should be stripped naked of fantasy 
They're not meant to be real 
I remember the look in your eyes 
At the hotel when I arrived full of adventure 
You said, "come and see me," until I believed it 
What else could you mean? 
Long drive back from madison... 
Long drive back from madison Some people never will be 
Happy enough to believe somebody could love them 
Sometimes an hour's enough 
To turn an innocent touch into an insult 
You smiled without joy 
As if I was a chore somebody forced upon you Long drive back from madison... 
Long drive back from madison So much time to think about you 
Like a dry wind whistling through my dead expectations 
While the radio fades in and out 
Like the anger that I felt for your empty emotions 
You said, "come and see me," until I believed it 
... what else could you mean?
