There are times when I have a fit 
And there are times when I just lose it 
But I am willing to change my way 
Even if you dont say Yeah I know Im a jerk when I get mad 
I misunderstood the problem that we had 
And now I'm all alone in this cold dark world 
Waiting for your truth to be told Ohh don't leave me here all alone 
And Ohh, oh can you just pick up your phone 
And Ohh, oh the words that I didnt mean to say 
Ohh Ohh they came out anyway Maybe one day youll finally understand 
How much I want this please understand 
I didnt mean to make it end up like this 
And now Im sitting here still Ohh dont leave me here all alone 
And Ohh, ohh can you just pick up your phone 
And Ohh, ohh the words that I didnt mean to say 
Ohh Ohh they came out anyway 
And Ohh, ohh, I hate the way that I am 
And ohh, ohh can you just say that you care 
And Ohh, ohh Im stuck in 99 problems 
Ohh ohh, dont have to be this way Dont have to be this way x2
