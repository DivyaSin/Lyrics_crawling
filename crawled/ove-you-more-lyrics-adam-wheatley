This old heart is still believing 
That love is born of the things you do 
So I can't spoil you with all of my money 
But you say the word and I'll pull down the moon I'm going to give you everything this love can afford 
The riches of this world will all fall short 
And as long as this heart is beating you're going to know 
That I'm going to love you more 
I'm going to love you more I never though that love had a color 
But it filled you up and colored your eyes blue 
So when you throw a look in my direction 
I'll cross any room just to talk with you I'm going to give you everything this love can afford 
The riches of this world will all fall short 
And as long as this heart is beating you're going to know 
That I'm going to love you more 
I'm going to love you more And when the hard times come without an invitation 
We'll make good on all the promises we made I'm going to give you everything this love can afford 
The riches of this world will all fall short 
And as long as this heart is beating you're going to know 
That I'm going to love you more 
I'm going to love you more 
I'm going to love you more
