If I told you I don't mind 
Would you believe me 
When I say to you you're not my kind 
Do I deceive you with this fragile disguise 
Ask me no questions 
And I will tell you no lies. If she could read my heart 
It would break her mind 
So I pretend all these tears on my face don't imply 
That I'm not happy just to see you with her 
One small voice 
That will never be heard. I'm in love with you 
Oh, I'm in love with you 
But I turn away when you look in my eyes 
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies 
I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you 
Oh, I'm in love with you 
Trying to smile with a hole in my heart 
No one knows 
I'm falling apart.
