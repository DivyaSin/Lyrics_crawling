As I stand in place, as the center of my galaxy 
I am, organic electricity 
My eyelids expose the circumference 
My mind tends to bend irreverent! 
Unparalleled chaotic! 
My fairy tale psychotic 
Lifespan infinity 
I am, organic electricity 
Equality and harmony transmit 
Contact shock wave I'm hit! 
Program exchange compute 
Reformat hard drive comply 
Quantum leap time travel exist 
Exiting the exodus connect 
Brainchild nucleus reality 
I am, organic electricity 
All that has ever been I shall be 
And all that will come to be I will become 
God word radiate authenticity 
I am, organic electricity Cocooned in ignorance, silence and darkness 
Blessed with intelligence, keenness and sharpness 
To explore the seamless dreamless nightmarish illusion 
Enhanced by your perception but, no conclusion Mainframe access denied 
Password g.o.d. supplied 
Universal guidance odyssey 
I am, organic electricity 
Divining at the power source intensity 
I am, organic electricity 
Beauty of the inner pain experience 
Struggle of the forces serious 
Stargate pathway enlightened 
Thought process engaged Completing composition but imperfect intuition 
I orbit in position, gravitational suspension 
Past the 3rd and 4th and 5th dimensions 
The extensions of, the pieces of, the essence of this power 
And carve the earth, mountains, land and seas 
Rivers, lakes and valleys, and deserts 
Your eyes'll never hold it all at once - just the small pleasures 
My everlasting backspin, around the solar systematic 
Automatic controller, fold in place by space and time 
Tear down the walls of nothing 
We are all full of individuals and independencies 
'Cause I am, organic electricity
