(uh-huh) I've been grinding so long, been trying this shit for years 
(uh-huh) and I got nothing to show, just climbing this rope right here 
(uh-huh) and if there's a man upstairs, he kept bringing me rain 
(uh-huh) but I've been sending up prayers and something's changed I think I finally found my hallelujah 
I've been waiting for this moment all my life 
Now all my dreams are coming true, yeah 
I've been waiting for this moment Feels good to be alive right about now (woo-hoo) 
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (woo-hoo) 
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (woo-hoo) 
Hallelujah, let that bass line move ya, say hey 
Pretty good to be alive right about now (woo-hoo) I was dead in the water, nobody wanted me 
(Uh-huh) I was old news, I went cold as cold could be 
(Uh-huh) but I kept throwing on coal tryna make that fire burn 
(Uh-huh) sometimes you gotta get scars to get what you deserve 
(Uh-huh) I kept moving on and now I'm moving up 
(Uh-huh) damn, I'm feeling blessed with all this love I think I finally found my hallelujah 
I've been waiting for this moment all my life 
Now all my dreams are coming true, yeah 
I've been waiting for this moment Feels good to be alive right about now (woo-hoo) 
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now (woo-hoo)
