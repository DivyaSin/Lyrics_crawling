I lie awake, thinking of you 
Wondering why I do the things I do. 
How could I let, your love escape 
When all I can do is wait.. I can't stop 
Your love's still there. 
The ghost of you haunts my mind everywhere. 
I'll find a way 
to make it right 
and someday soon i'll get you back in my life. 
Faces change 
and time goes by 
a new day comes 
but I won't change my mind 
How can I stop what I'm dreaming of 
I'll wait--- 
I'll wait forever for your love 
Forever for your love. Lonely days 
and sleepless nights 
remembering why 
your touch felt right. 
You'll be in my heart 
for always 
Things I hear 
nothing is always the same. I can't stop 
Your love's still there. 
The ghost of you haunts my mind everywhere. 
I'll find a way 
to make it right 
and someday soon i'll get you back every night. 
Faces change 
and time goes by 
a new day comes 
but I won't change my mind 
How can I stop what I'm dreaming of 
I'll wait--- 
I'll wait forever for your love 
Forever for your love.
