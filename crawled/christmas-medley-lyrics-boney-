Silent Night, Holy Night 
Son of God 
Love's pure light 
Radiant beams from thy holy face 
With the dawn of redeeming grace 
Jesus Lord at Thy birth 
Jesus Lord at Thy birth Jesus Lord at Thy birth 
Jesus Lord at Thy birth Snow falls over the trees 
Still and calm is the sea 
There is a hush o'er the land 
Christmas is almost at hand Peace alone reigns supreme 
Like in some wonderous dream 
You feel like newborn so grand 
Christmas is almost at hand Hear ye the message that comes from afar 
up in the heavens there shines a new star 
it's shining brightly and lights up the night 
leading the way to a wonderful sight 
no one is lonely and no one forlorn 
'cause in the manger the christ child is born Hear ye the message it's simple and clear 
time for rejoycing is finally here 
fore with the Christ Child there comes a new day 
taking your worries and sorrows away 
Bury your hatred and bury your grief 
hear ye the message and start to believe Let's keep the christmas bells ringing, not just one day of the year 
Let's keep the christmas bells ringing, not just one day of the year
