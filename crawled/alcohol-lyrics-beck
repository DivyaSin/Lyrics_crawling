Alcohol leavin' me dry 
Now it is time for pie 
Takin' them as they come 
Alcohol please give me some 
If I stay in the same place 
The animals will lick my face 
Soak in the dawn of day 
Rollin' my body away 
Alcohol leavin' me dry 
Now it is time for pie 
Takin' them as they come 
Alcohol please give me some
