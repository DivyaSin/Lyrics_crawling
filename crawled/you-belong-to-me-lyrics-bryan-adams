I'll take the night train - I'll take an airplane 
Cuz you belong to me I just wanna to say - ain't gonna let you get away 
Cuz you belong to me I only wanna hold you 
I just wanna hold you 
C'mon let me hold you tonight You say ya ain't leavin', I can't help dreamin' 
You belong to me I'll take the high way, I'll take the low way 
Cuz you belong to me I only wanna hold you 
I just wanna hold you 
C'mon let me hold you tonight I'm not drinkin', gets me thinkin' 
You belong to me While you're out there, remember I'm right here 
And you belong to me I only wanna hold you 
I just wanna hold you 
C'mon let me hold you 
C'mon let me hold you 
Tonight
