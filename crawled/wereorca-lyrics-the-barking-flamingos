At night it crawls into my dreams 
At night it rips right through the seams 
Creeping deep inside my mind 
Showing me the end of time 
At night it rains, at night it pours 
Fire sinks into my pores 
Opening and closing doors 
I am so far away from shore 
In the corners of my memories 
In the deepest ocean, in the darkest seas 
They're creating this monster from me 
There's nothing left to fear 
No nothing else 
Except for fear it self (The were-orca) 
Comes for you 
(Were-orca) 
(The were-orca) 
Is inside of you 
(Were-orca) I hear it moaning and groaning 
Twisting and turning 
My eyes are burning 
My stomach's churning 
Sighing and crying 
The voice inside me 
The fear inside me 
All is said and done 
And now you're face to face 
Now we begin the chase (The were-orca) 
Comes for you 
(Were-orca) 
(The were-orca) 
Is inside of you 
(Were-orca)
