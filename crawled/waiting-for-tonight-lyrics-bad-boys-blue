Man on the run. Sad and alone. 
Sees no solution. Looking for someone. 
All his life. It's so sad. 
All his dreams are only bad. 
But someday in his mind he will find. He will find. You are the one. I'm waiting for so long. 
Give me a chance. Let us romance. 
Love me tonight. Waiting for tonight. 
Forever I'm longing for your love. 
Waiting for tonight. 
And no one else can feel the same. 
When I hold you tight. Not only this one night. 
I'm waiting just for you. 
Right here. Right now. 
I'm waiting for tonight. Man on the run. Sad and alone. 
Looking for emotions. Looking for someone. 
All the times so alone. 
In the night when she's gone. 
But somewhere in his mind he will find. He will find. You are the one. I'm waiting for so long. 
Give me a chance. Let us romance. 
Love me tonight. Waiting for tonight. 
Forever I'm longing for your love. 
Waiting for tonight. 
And no one else can feel the same. 
When I hold you tight. Not only this one night. 
I'm waiting just for you. 
Right here. Right now. 
I'm waiting for tonight.
