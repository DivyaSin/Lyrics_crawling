No, no, no, no 
Nothing is easy All I have to do is forget how much I love him 
All I have to do is put my longing to one side 
Tell myself that loves an ever changing situation 
Passion would have cooled and all the magic would have died 
Its easy as life I try to forget how much I want him here 
Let my tears slowly disappear 
I cannot forget that my emotions die 
Oh, I dont even want to try Nothing in life is ever easy 
Nothing in love will ever run true 
My heart will never stop believing 
I still believe in what love can do All I have to do 
Is pretend I never knew you 
On those very rare occasions 
When you steal into my heart Better to have lost you 
When the ties were barely binding 
Better the contempt 
Of the familiar cannot stop 
Its easy as life I try to forget how much I want him here 
Then my dreams slowly disappear 
I cannot forget that my emotions die 
Oh, I dont even want to try Nothing in life is ever easy 
Nothing in love will ever run true 
My heart will never stop believing 
I still believe in what love can do It hurts to think about you 
When I want to touch you 
And how we would have been 
If you were here with me today Those very rare occasions 
They keep on coming 
All I ever wanted 
Im throwing it away Nothing in life is ever easy 
Nothing in love will ever run true 
My heart will never stop believing 
I still believe in what love can do Nothing in life is ever easy 
Nothing in love will ever run true 
My heart will never stop believing 
I still believe in what love can do
