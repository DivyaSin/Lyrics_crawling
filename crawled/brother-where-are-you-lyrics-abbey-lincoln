A small boy walked down a city street 
And hope was in his eyes 
As he searched the faces of the people he'd meet 
For one he could recognize Brother, where are you? 
They said you came this way 
Brother, where are you? 
They said you came this way 
(Looking for a soul brother all around him 
Looking for a soul brother all around him) The eyes of the people who passed him by 
Were cold and as hard as stone 
The poor boy whimpered and began to cry 
Because he was all alone Brother, where are you? 
They said you came this way, yeah 
Brother, where are you? 
They said you came this way 
(Looking for a soul brother all around him 
Looking for a soul brother all around him) Now there are many who swear it's true 
That brothers all we are 
Yet it seems there are very few 
Who will answer a brother's call Brother, where are you? 
They said you came this way, yeah 
Brother, where are you? 
They said you came this way Now there are many who will swear it's true 
That brothers all we are 
Yet it seems there are so few 
Who will answer a brother's call Brother, where are you? 
They said you came this way, yeah 
Brother, where are you? 
They told me you came this way Looking for a soul brother all around him 
(They said you came this way) 
Looking for a soul brother all around him 
(Said you came this way) 
Looking for a soul brother all around him 
(I know you came this way) Looking for a soul brother all around him 
(Oh, you came this way, I know you came this way) 
Looking for a soul brother all around him 
Looking for a soul brother all around him Looking for a soul brother all around him 
Looking for a soul brother all around him
