Pure energy We're nothing but two lost souls when 
We set out without an ending 
Everyone thought we were wasting time Oh, it was such a struggle that never ended 
On no one else we were dependent 
We did all we could to get it right On an outbound train 
The breaks from yesterday 
Ooh, I always wanted to feel this way On a sky-high plane 
Hotter than all the sun's rays And it's known to be 
We are always meant to be released 
To pure energy, pure energy Pure energy 
Pure energy Found ourselves in a situation Yet there always was a complication 
What we wanted was so hard to find 
So we had to keep on moving 
Only time was time for losing 
Couldn't waste a minute of our lives We've been traveling for days 
Now we're so far away 
Ooh, only stars will light our way In this close to lonely world 
Sometimes I'm just a lonely girl 
But you gotta know 
That we were always meant to be released 
To pure energy Pure energy, pure energy 
Pure energy, pure energy 
Pure energy
