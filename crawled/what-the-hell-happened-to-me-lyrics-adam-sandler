I used to ride a big wheel. 
And sell lemonade. 
Eat popcorn with Grandpa while we watched a parade. 
But now I'm only happy when I'm drinkin' J.D. 
What the hell happened to me? 
I used to have fun throwing snowballs. 
With my best friend Billy. 
Then Mom would make us cocoa if we got too chilly. 
But now I only get excited when I see a girl pee. 
What the hell happened to me? 
I used to be the nicest kid in the neighborhood. 
I only did the things that Mama said I should. 
But now I just do whatever I want. 
I even whipped it out in a restaurant. 
I used to help clean the park in the middle of town. 
Then played kickball ' til the sun went down. 
But now all I do is get VD. 
What the hell happened to me? 
It makes no sense. 
I can't believe I ended up me. 
I'm outta my gourd. 
Won't somebody please help me. 
I'm kind of a wierdo.
