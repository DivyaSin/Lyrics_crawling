Hey 
Something went wrong I feel great 
And I don't know why but I feel 
Like I could do anything now Hey 
Why in the hell did I wait? 
When's the last time I felt real? 
Like I could do anything now But man I can't live if I'm fearing life 
I stood to the side for so long it seems right 
When it comes to self loathing 
I put in my time now I say I don't need you or anything now 
I'll give up when my sun rises down 
As for now I can see I've become 
One brief blinding glimpse of the sun Hey 
Somehow I see through the lies 
I see all life comes from the spring 
And I can do anything now Hey 
Feels like I'm losing my mind 
Who needs your attacks all the suffering? 
When I could do anything now But man I can't live if I'm fearing life 
I stood to the side for so long it seems right 
And when it comes to self loathing 
I put in my time now I say I don't need you or anything now 
I'll give up when my sun rises down 
As for now I can see I've become 
One brief blinding glimpse of the sun
