Hard to be a girl. 
So nice to be a boy. 
In my room at night. 
Not a pretty site. 
Here's an empty kiss marching to the rhythm of the pay roll. 
I can be a good boy too, 
Just let me out of the stable. Sausages and eggs, 
And hot and sour soup. 
Thank me for your time, 
'Cause I can be as bad as you. 
Hard to be a girl. 
That's what the oracle told me, 
I don't care what she says, 
I assume its best to be lonely.
