Do you know a guy who'll talk to a kangaroo? 
Who's always ready to learn about something new 
Who's favorite book has all the animals you can wish 
Who's proud to say his best friend is a fish That's why, he's my man Stanley, oh yeah 
He's my man Stanley, welcome to Stanley's world 
Come help him figure out what life is all about 
Who'll take you swimming with dolphins, laughs with the lions too No problem Stanley can't solve 
In solvin' it involves havin' a friend like you 
Hey Stanley, hey Stanley, havin' a friend like you 
With a friend like you, hey Stanley
