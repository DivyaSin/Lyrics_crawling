There's antiques on the mantle 
Hank Williams in the air 
Bourbon on the counter 
And you've cut off all your hair 
The daisies on the hillside 
Watch the sun goin' down 
Hopin' that time turns around 
Hopin' that time turns around Police at the pawnshop 
Vampires at the mall 
Country boys in gangster clothes 
Skate 'round city hall 
And all the bathtub virgins cry 
Without making a sound 
They're hopin' that time turns around 
Hopin' that time turns around You'll be getting younger 
You'll be dancing on the sun 
And your soul won't remember 
All the damage that you've done 
And the last shall be the first 
And the first shall be the last 
But Johnny come lately 
Will still be pumping gas Yesterday's a beggar 
Dressed up like a king 
Tomorrow is a prophet 
But he ain't saying anything 
Today is just a coward 
Who's painted like a clown 
Hopin' that time turns around 
Hopin' that time turns around 
Hopin' that time turns around 
Hopin' that time turns around
