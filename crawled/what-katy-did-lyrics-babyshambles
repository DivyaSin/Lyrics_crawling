Shoop, shoop, shoop de-lang de-lang Oh watcha gonna do, Katie? 
You're a sweet sweet girl. 
But it's a cruel, cruel world 
a cruel, cruel world. My pins are none too strong, Katie 
Oh hurry up Mrs. Brown 
I can feel 'em coming down 
& it won't take none too long But since you said goodbye 
The polka dots fill my eyes 
And I don't know why Shoop, shoop, shoop de-lang de-lang 
Shoop, shoop, shoop de-lang de-lang

You're a sweet sweet girl. 
But it's a cruel, cruel world 
a cruel, cruel world. Safety pins are none too strong 
They hold my life together 
And I never say never ever never 
say never again Oh but since you said goodbye 
The polka dots fill my eyes 
And I don't know why Since you said goodbye 
The polka dots fill my eyes 
And I don't know why 
Say you want 
Say you will 
Say you won't but don't leave me standing 
Say you will, it's up to anyone 
That's what they all like to know 
... And since you said goodbye 
The polka dots fill my eyes 
And I don't know why
