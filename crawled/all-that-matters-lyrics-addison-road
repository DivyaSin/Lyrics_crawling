That's all that matters 
I may never be the one that gets a second glance 
I may never be the one they call the prettiest 
But thats alright with me And maybe I dont follow every crazy passion 
Spend all my time trying to get a good reaction 
Thats okay with me This world is like a trampoline 
High and low no in between 
Jumping at the chance to please 
Everyone but thats not me 'Cause all that matters is 
All that matters is 
I know your love has set me free 
Thats all that matters to me All that matters is 
All that matters is 
I know your love has set me free 
Thats all that matters to me Some people tell me to step out 
And do my own thing 
And others say I got to blend in 
Just to be the same 
And stop being me But this shallow world is no longer what Im made of 
Ive been changed by grace 
Ive been saved by love 
What more do I need All that matters is 
All that matters is 
I know your love has set me free 
Thats all that matters to me All that matters is 
All that matters is 
I know your love has set me free 
Thats all that matters to me My life comes from the One 
Who made the stars and brought the sun 
He loves me more than these 
So I dont need another identity All that matters is 
All that matters is 
I know your love has set me free 
Thats all that matters to me All that matters is 
All that matters is 
I know your love has set me free 
Thats all that matters to me Thats all that matters 
Thats all that matters 
Thats all that 
Thats all that matters
