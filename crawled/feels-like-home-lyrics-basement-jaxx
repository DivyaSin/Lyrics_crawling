Hold my hand while you sleep 
So when you dream I'm there with you Hold my hand while you sleep 
So when you dream I'm there with you Home 
Feels like home I hurry to make my way home 
Cause you are my truth and my light 
And when night falls I search for you 
Make my way closer to you, closer to you Hold my hand while you sleep 
So when you dream I'm there with you Home 
Feels like home
