Oh I wish I had someone to love me someone to call me their own 
How I wish I had someone to live with cause I'm tired of living all alone 
Please meet me tonight in the moonlight please meet me tonight all alone 
For I had a sad story to tell you it's a story that's never been told 
[ strings ] 
Oh if I had the wings of an angel through the heavenly sky I would fly 
I'd fly to the arms of my poor darling and there I'd be willing to die
