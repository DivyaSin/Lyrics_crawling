Lets go 
Lets go 
Come on 3, 6, 9 
The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the straight car line 
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat Clap pat, clap pat, clap pat, clap slap 
Clap pat! Clap your hand 
Pat it on your partners hand, right hand 
Clap pat! Clap your hand 
Cross it with your left arm 
Pat your partners left palm Clap pat! Clap your hand 
Pat your partners right palm 
Clap slap! Clap your hand 
Slap your thigh and sing a little song 
Go My mama told me if I was lucky 
That she would treat me 
If I was goody 
My aunty told her, I should act older 
No I'm not kidding 
That's what she told her 3, 6, 9 
The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line 
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat Clap clap 
Clap your hands and prepare to pat Clap 
Take your right arm 
Pat your partners palm with your right palm 
Clap 
Take your hand back and clap Clap 
Take your right arm 
Cross your right arm with your left arm 
Pat your partners left palm with your left palm 
Clap 
Now back with a clap Take your hand to your palm and slap your thigh 
And watch the fun materialize 
As you sing this little song My mama told me if I was lucky 
That she would treat me 
If I was goody 
My aunty told her, I should act older 
No I'm not kidding 
That's what she told her 3, 6, 9 
The goose drank wine
