Verse 1 I'll search and find that special tree 
One that looks just right 
Then I'll decorate it perfectly 
Even if it takes all night 
Then I'll light the fire 
Turn the lights down low 
And hang up the mistletoe 
And make some lasting memories 
We'll never forget Chorus A December to remember 
Always in our hearts 
Spending everyday of the holidays 
Wrapped up in each others arms 
All I want for Christmas 
Is forever to be like this 
A December to remember forever more Verse 2 Don't spend a single cent 
On a Christmas gift for me 
Cause the thing that I want most of all 
Can't be found beneath the tree 
It's the loving look that's in your eyes 
That money could never buy 
And I what I give you in return 
Will last throughout the 
A December to remember 
Always in our hearts 
Spending everyday of the holidays 
Wrapped up in each others arms 
All I want for Christmas 
Is forever to be like this 
A December to remember forever more 
And all I want for Christmas 
Is forever to be like this 
A December to remember forever more
