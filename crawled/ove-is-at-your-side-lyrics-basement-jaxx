Before you came to earth 
Life was black and white 
Never had a dream in touched 
The one I'm in tonight 
A love aren't complicated 
Feeling pure as like 
Closed me into you 
Tells me it's alright 
[Chorus] 
Remember it 
LOVE IS AT YOUR SIDE 
You're always been a purpose 
Your happiness is my place 
Whatever heart burned you 
Just remember this 
Life is an enigma 
Our ships rocks side to side 
Hold on tight my darlin 
Love is at your side 
[Chorus] 
Remember it 
LOVE IS AT YOUR SIDE
