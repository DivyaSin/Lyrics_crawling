(Traditional (lyrics) and Chris Eaton (music)) 
O little town of Bethlehem 
How still we see thee lie 
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
The silent stars go by 
Yet in thy dark streets shineth 
The everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years 
Are met in thee tonight How silently, how silently 
The wondrous gift is given 
So God imparts to human hearts 
We hear the Christmas angels 
The great glad tidings tell 
O come to us, abide with us 
Our Lord Immanuel But in this world of sin 
Where meek souls will receive Him still 
The dear Christ enters in.
