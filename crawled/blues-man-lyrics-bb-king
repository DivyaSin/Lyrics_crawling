People I've traveled from town to town 
Seems like everybody want to put me down 
Because I'm a bluesman 
But I'm a good man, understand I went down to the bus station 
I looked upon the wall 
My money was to light people 
Couldn't go no where at all 
See I'm a bluesman 
But a good man, understand The burden that I carry, oh it's so heavy 
It seems, seems like ain't nobody in this great big world 
That would want to help old B. 
Hey, but I'll, I would be all right people 
Just give me a break, good things come 
To those who wait, I've been around 81 years ya'll 
I'm a bluesman 
But I'm a good man, understand burden that I carry, oh it's so heavy 
It seems, seems like ain't nobody in this great big world 
That would want to help old B. 
But I'll, I would be all right people 
Just give me a break, good things come 
To those who wait, I've been waiting a long time 
I'm a bluesman folks 
But I'm a good man, understand
