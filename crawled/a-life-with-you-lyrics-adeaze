Verse 1 - 
I am sorry for the way that I've been treating you 
You've been so good to me and I have been so cruel to you 
I know I'm not the person you expected me to be 
My baby I still care for you 
Baby I still want a life with you, thats true 
Only to you can I be faithful Chorus - 
So I say sorry I hope that you can understand 
And I say sorry I promise you from now I'll change 
I just want you to know that I care Verse 2 - 
I'm looking forward to a time when I'll be down on one knee 
Looking at you so beautiful I'm saying will you marry me? 
I see a tear drop from your eye and theres a smile on your face 
Does this mean that your answers yes 
I wanna spend my life with you,and you are soo blessed 
Only to you can I be faithful Chorus x 2
