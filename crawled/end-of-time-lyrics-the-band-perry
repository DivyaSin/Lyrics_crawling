Here I am standing firm 
As the ground shakes beneath me 
I send you away with my own hand 
I try and try to remember that for now it's for the better 
But there's a Southern kind of tragic blowing in 
Oh and it feels like the beginning of the end Well the Alabama moon fell from the sky 
And the sweet tea wells ran dry 
Somewhere out there you're finding yourself 
Back home it's the end of time I'm scared to death, pick up your phone, outside 
I hear the bells ringing 
Bringing ruin to all that we have ever known 
Pick up your phone, I need an answer 
Come home and call off disaster 
'Cause I fear tonight our Cotton Land might fall 
Oh I'm cracking like the plaster on the wall Oh the Alabama moon fell from the sky 
And the sweet tea wells ran dry 
Somewhere out there you're finding yourself 
Back home it's the end of time It's the end of time 
Is it the end of all time 
Or just the end of mine Well all of the cotton it died in the fields 
The little babies cried the blue from their eyes 
Somewhere I'll bet you're living it up 
So come home before the end The Alabama moon, fell from the sky 
And the sweet tea wells ran dry 
Somewhere out there you're finding yourself 
Back home it's the end of time Come home come home and be mine 
Come home and come home
