(Carr) I sailed out to sea with Figi Fandango 
She looked so good to me with her hair up in tangles. 
Figi never lived a life of royalty she had other dreams 
Figi wanted freedom but she didn't need material things 
Figi was so obstinate the good king Fandango nearly blew 
He said to her "This monarchy has no place for the likes of you" 
The king tried to take my love from me 
He put her under lock and key 
And set forth to the open sea 
He could not take my life from me 
So I became a stowaway 
And when he slept we slipped away 
We stole a dinghy from the king because he said he'd give her away 
We cut the rope and dropped the boat into the sea, that was yesterday
