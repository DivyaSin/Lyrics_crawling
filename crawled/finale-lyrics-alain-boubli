VALJEAN: 
Now you are here 
again beside me 
now i can die in peace 
for now my life is blessed COSSETTE: 
you will live, papa 
you're going to live 
it's too soon to ever say goodbye VALJEAN: 
yes, cossette 
forbid me now to die 
i'll obey 
i will try on this page 
i write my last confession 
read it well 
when i at last am sleeping 
it's a story of those who always loved you 
your mother gave her life for you and gave you to my keeping FANTINE: 
come with me 
where chains will never bind you 
all your grief 
at last, at last behind you 
lord in heaven; 
look down on him in mercy VALJEAN: 
forgive me all my trespases and take me to your glory FANTINE, VALJEAN AND EPONINE: 
take my hand 
and lead me to salvation 
take my love 
for love is everlasting 
and remember 
the truth that once was spoken: 
to love another person is to see the face of god ALL: 
do you hear the people sing? 
lost in the valley of the night 
it is the music of a people who are climbing to the light 
for the wretched of the earth 
there is a flame that never dies 
even the darkest nights will end and the sun will rise they will live again in freedom in the garden of the lord 
they will walk behind the bloodshed 
they will put away the sword 
the chain will be broken and all men will have their reward! will you join in our crusade? 
who will be strong and stand with me? 
somewhere beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see? 
do you hear the people sing? 
say, do you hear the distant drums? 
it is the future that they bring when tomorrow comes! 
REPEAT Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaah, 
tomorrow comes!
