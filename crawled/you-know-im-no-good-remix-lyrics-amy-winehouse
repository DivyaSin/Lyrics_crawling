Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard 
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt 
You say, "Why did you do it with him today?" 
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy 
Hand me your Stella and fly 
By the time I'm out the door 
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself 
Like I knew I would 
I told ya I was troubled 
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy 
He's in the place, but I can't get joy 
Thinking of you in the final throes 
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter 
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter 
There'll be none of him no more 
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself 
Like I knew I would 
I told ya I was troubled 
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain 
We're like how we were again 
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat 
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn 
My stomach drops, and my guts churn 
You shrug, and it's the worst 
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself 
Like I knew I would 
I told ya I was troubled 
You know that I'm no good 
I cheated myself 
Like I knew I would 
I told ya I was troubled 
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good
