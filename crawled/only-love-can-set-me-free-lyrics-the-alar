Somewhere in this world 
I know that love exists 
I've known it in a kiss 
Sometimes in my sleep 
I've been searching 
For more than these few glimpses 
For a love that lasts all eternity There is a light, a light that never dies 
Oh no, see it shine, shining in my sorrow 
There is a light, a light that never dies I'm all alone now 
The crowds have all gone home 
There is a silence 
Silence in my world 
I wish that every moment could be peaceful 
But I guess that's something 
I can only pray for There is a light, a light that never dies 
Oh no, see it shine, shining in my sorrow 
There is a light, a light in my desire (see it shine) 
See it shining, shining for tomorrow Only love can give me an answer (only love) 
Oh I know that love can heal (only love) 
From the dust a new hope rises up 
Only love can set me, set me free This world is crashing down 
In oh so many ways 
I get so scared 
Scared and so alone 
Life I desire 
But what is life without love 
You say that's nothing 
To me it's everything There is a light, a light that never dies 
Oh no, see it shine, shining in my sorrow 
There is a light, a light in my desire (see it shine) 
See it shining, shining for tomorrow Only love can give me an answer (only love) 
Oh I know that love can heal (only love) 
From the dust a new hope rises up 
Only love can set me, set me free I need a friend someone to turn to 
Someone to turn to in my hour of need (someone) 
Someone to give me an answer (someone) 
Someone to give me the love I need Only love can give me the answer (only love) 
Oh I know that love can heal (only love) 
From the dust a new hope rises up 
Only love can set me, set me free Set me free Only love can give me the answer (only love) 
Only love can set me free
