you arms that take 
your arms invertebrate 
venomous,constricting and cold 
blood warms to life 
tongue flickers in time 
vibrations awaken your soul 
the mind sheds away 
you circle, break,swerve and stay 
you stare so deep ,you rise so tall 
you gently sway,your silhouette writhes and plays 
its poison up on the wall 
drumming hearts they sync and then slow 
you whisper songs of peace and of home 
whisper promise though don't show what you see 
when those black diamonds stare straight through to me 
flicker in time 
gently entwine 
daggers slide sharper than pain 
rise up,around 
liquid and vapor 
a warmth that creeps up through my veins 
now is your time 
and ive walked this line 
while you slid down deep in my soul 
i fade away as you breathe your song heavy 
and i take my show on the road 
slide on black racer,slide on.
