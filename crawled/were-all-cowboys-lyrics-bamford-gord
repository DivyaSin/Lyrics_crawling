some of us work 9 to 5 
at a desk job way downtown 
and some of us have calloused hands 
from working that old ground 
but we've got one thing in common 
every guy i know is the same 
we've got a burning in our hearts 
and its a never ending flame (chorus) we wanna ride off in the sunset 
with the girl of our dreams 
and head out west into the rockies 
where the air is cool and clean 
and settle down in some green valley with the moon and stars above 
we're all cowboys when it comes to love we're all cowboys when it comes to love there's a house band somewhere playin' 
in a honky tonk tonight 
theres boots and jeans and beauty queens 
everybody's feeling right 
some are from the country 
and some are city folks 
no matter where you might be from 
every cowboy knows (chorus) we wanna ride off in the sunset 
with the girl of our dreams 
and head out west into the rockies 
where the air is cool and clean 
and settle down in some green valley with the moon and stars above 
we're all cowboys when it comes to love we're all cowboys when it comes to love
