A letter from home came this morning 
And each line on that handwritten page 
Drew a picture of life in Louisiana 
And just how long that I've been away Dear daughter, we love you and miss you 
So I thought I would drop you a line 
Just to tell you how we long to see you 
And to say that we're doing just fine I don't know all the people who've told me 
That they've stayed up way past their bedtime 
Just to see you, sing and play in California 
On the TV last Saturday night Your Dad heard your song in New Orleans 
And he told me that he felt so proud 
That he pulled alongside of the highway 
And he turned up that radio loud Are you taking good care of yourself, dear 
Are those city folks treating you well 
If you need anything you can call us 
We love you more than just words could ever tell I remember when you were just a baby 
The best years that we've ever had 
Until they're gone we'll forever remember 
Love always, your Momma and Dad 
Love always, your Momma and Dad
