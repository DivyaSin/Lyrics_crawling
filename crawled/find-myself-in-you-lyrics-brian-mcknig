I was so lonely, though there was so many symbols waiting 
I'm so glad that this ain't that 
Girl, you're the reason I can make it through the long, long day 
And that's a fact 
Baby, I can't wait to get next to you 
Oh, I can't wait to wrap my arms around your body 
Baby, I can't help but to tell the truth 
Oh, it's so hard to wait till no one else is around Gonna try to keep myself together till I find myself in you 
Baby, naw, naw 
Before they take you back to heaven gonna find myself in you 
Naw, naw I hate to keep you waiting, but there are some things that need my attention 
Before I can get back to you 
Anticipating my hands all over your body, baby 
You know I know just what to do 
And, baby, I can't wait to get next to you 
Oh, I can't wait to wrap my arms around your body 
Baby, I can't help but to tell the truth 
Oh, it's so hard to wait till no one else is around I'm gonna try to keep myself together till I find myself in you, baby 
Naw, naw 
Before they take you back to heaven gonna find myself in you 
No, no, no, no, baby The only place I want to be is right here with you 
Loving you down and you, you can take what you want from me 
Long as you let me hang around I'm gonna keep myself together till I find myself in you 
Oh, baby, before they take you back to heaven, gonna find myself in you 
Oh, baby, gonna keep myself together till I find myself in you 
Oh, baby, baby, before they take you back to heaven gonna find myself in you Listen, listen, ah, baby, baby
