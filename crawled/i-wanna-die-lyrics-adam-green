I want to chose to die, 
And be buried with a rubix cube 
And sleep inside the big blue buildings, 
While the sweet disease drives through There's a bakery in the night sky 
I want to die because the government lied She was a man with herpes, 
Floating in a yellow stream 
Running through the windows backwards 
Kissing all the buildings clean You know his appetite for hardcore taste 
And orgyastic party games
