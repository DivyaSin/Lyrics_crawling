The doctor said with joy 
"A healthy baby boy" 
October 4th of 1925 His parents had a plan 
He'd live a better life 
Be a man of means 
Who knows, he might go really far And then the days slipped by 
And turned into years 
And many pages turned in the story of his life Took a detour through a war 
Cast a shadow across his soul 
October 4th of 1944 Stories he would never tell 
So he had to write them down to keep them captive 
On Veteran's Day he pulls them out 
It's a cleansing of the soul and a freeing of his mind He didn't change the world 
But he eventually met a girl 
Their child would be his only legacy And so he cried to God 
"It's not what I had planned 
And there's one more thing 
I'll never understand How did the days slip by 
When did they turn into years?" 
How many pages did you get for the story of your life? Call it what you will, name it tragedy 
But in the end he just looks back and smiles 
It's just his life
