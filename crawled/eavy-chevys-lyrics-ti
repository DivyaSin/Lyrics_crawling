[T.I. & Big Kuntry] 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Come on (Hey) 
PSC, Uh 
(Y'all niggas) What (Y'all niggas) 
What Pimp Squad shortay 
What you know about them 
What they know? 
You don't know about them 
(They don't know, they don't know) 
Now what you really know about them? 
(What it is) Yeen know about them 
(Them heavy Chevy's shortay) 
Yeen know about them (heavy Chevy shortay) [Big Kuntry] 
Now how you tame a young baller 
That rides Suburbans, Caprises 
Candy Impalas, Rasberry Monte Carlos 
That barks like a rottweiler 
Off the collar 
Addicted to hustling 
And stacking mighty dollars 
O holla 
When you hear the Chevy beating down the street 
Beating so hard 
The Chris is wasting on my mink seats 
To get a rim posted corner 
Call me 10 G's 
The same as the Chevy platinum emblem on my keys 
Wit the diamond against the trim 
A young ass nigga wit a Louis V rim 
A sporty young shorty wit the Gucci shades dim 
These hoes mistaken me for being they pimp 
They said baby couldn't see you pass them shiny rims 
I'ma cool little daddy 
Bitch I never been a simp 
And if you choose a hoe you need to hop on in 
And if you ain't bitch you need to ride wit him 
Cause I'm pimping [Chorus: x2] 
Yeah, we riding in them heavy Chevy's, them heavy Chevy's 
On them D's and them Vogues 
When we shining on them hoes 
Yeah, we riding in them heavy Chevy's, them heavy Chevy's 
Beating hard in the park when we rolling with the squad [AK] 
Now if you heard from me 
You if'eel something hot to the third degree 
Coming down yo street in a black capris 
Wit a fine ass freak in the passengers seat 
Y'all fake niggas don't know the half of me 
I spit pimp game automatically 
Don't be mad at me 
Cause I'm finally coming up in the industry 
And the 44 singing on the triple D's 
Plug not the underground celebrities 
Mac Bone my partna keeping the beat 
Heat it up like a cook out 
When the sun falls 
Y'all niggas better look out 
Your rap careers over 
I put a hook down 
Like you better pallow 
Ride and swerve while my niggas follow 
Hoes wobbling and start slobbing 
Bobbin on the dick until they swallow [Mac Boney] 
Speedometer, broken doors 
Smoking body, dented windows 
Tinted bended round the corner leaning 
In the steaming screaming demons 
Spilling liquor, yeah nigga 
Blowing tall off the wall 
Burning rubber leaving foul 
Motherfucker how you ride 
Chopping blades wit triple golds 
Stay away from camilton rolls 
Player cause I'm riding old 
It ain't no thing to take them vogues 
Jack it up, strip it down 
Had the freshest car in town 
Pimping cause I'm bout my crown [T.I.:] 
Hey shorty whats that knocking sound [Chorus: x2] [T.I.:] 
T.I.P and P.S is fresher than new S-S's 
Triple doors and vogues shining like some treasure chests 
I got a fetish 
I ain't getting in it boy unless it's 
Got them little blue boxes off in the head restes [Big Kuntry] 
I bet it's wood in the dash 
Duel in the ass 
Get an Impala 
Holla watch me (skirt) 
When I pass 
I'm buring rubber in your yard 
Digging up ya grass 
Drag racing four fifty four 
That's what make it fast [T.I.] 
I hit the gas 
And I mash on it in a flash 
Throw it in the gutter 
Buy another if it crash 
That's petty cash [Big Kuntry] 
I parlay all day in a Chevrolet 
Pears jay wit a face bright as heavens day 
I'm beating fo' tens in the floor then 
Hit the store then for some more Hen (Hey Dub) 
Pull a hoe and four friends [T.I.] 
Dubs still spinningg wit a gold grill in it 
White leather guts 
Wipe up wit ya spill in it 
Still trillin out here [Chorus: x2] [T.I.: Talking]
