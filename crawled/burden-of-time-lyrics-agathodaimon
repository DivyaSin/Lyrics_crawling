Tumbling against walls of stone The frozen hand of nothingness breaks my mind Echoes fill the air Arcades filled with silence Crazed eyes follow my stars Locked in halls of solitude Exitless rooms, paths without end End my pain Useless days increase the burden of time Prayin for release Stonecast faces stare at me Every day another scar I don't see summer's sun, Break these chains My senses numb Dark is my tomb I don't feel autumn rain, I don't see winter's snow, Blind are my eyes I don't feel rising spring, Burden of time
