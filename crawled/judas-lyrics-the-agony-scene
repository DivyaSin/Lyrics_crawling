They shut their eyes now that night has fallen 
And pray the wolves are kept at bay 
For now the mist hangs, arms wide open 
Like some cruel depiction of Christ For now the silence comforts lost souls 
Who in this moment hang gracefully 
By the dead, hidden by shadows 
Who've come to take them in their sleep Falling farther in darkness 
Falling farther in darkness Eyes wide lacking comprehension 
As silhouettes dance in the flames 
Their limbs bound by the shadows 
That seem to stare back from the pits of black For now the silence comforts lost souls 
Who in this moment hang gracefully 
By the dead, hidden by shadows 
Who's screams echo for eternity Falling farther in darkness 
Falling farther in darkness 
Falling farther in darkness 
Falling farther in darkness Awakened by their screams 
Like something of a nightmare 
Lacking the desire to breathe 
Wishing for the end Awakened by their screams 
Like something of a nightmare 
Lacking the desire to breathe 
Wishing for the end Wishing for the end 
Wishing for the end 
Wishing for the end 
Wishing for the end They shut their eyes now that night has fallen 
And pray the wolves are kept at bay 
For now the mist hangs, arms wide open 
Like some cruel depiction of Christ For now the silence comforts lost souls 
Who in this moment hang gracefully 
By the dead, hidden by shadows 
Who've come to take them in their sleep Falling farther in darkness 
Falling farther in darkness 
Falling farther in darkness 
Falling farther
