Winter comes calling 
The temperature's falling 
A fear is crawling 
Don't quit, we're all in 
The ship's a mile out 
Don't blow the lights out 
They'll cry their eyes out, if we 
sink the light house Since fear itself is 
Cruel and selfish 
A contradiction 
A fatal addiction 
You tried to shout out 
My words in your mouth 
But they'll cry their eyes out, if we 
Sink the light house We're hard on the angels heels 
With fire and brimstone wheels 
The meadow starts with bones, and flowers and tears 
The ship's a mile out 
Don't blow the lights out 
They'll cry their eyes out, if we 
Sink the light house With darkness closing 
We're decomposing 
We're made of starlight 
From cruel and dark night 
The guilty crushed out 
We're left in no doubt 
They'll cry their eyes out, if we 
Sink the light house
