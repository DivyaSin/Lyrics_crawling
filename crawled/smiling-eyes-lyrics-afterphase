You and me, seem to be. 
Seem to be good together. Seem to match well together. 
Finally, I feel like I, 
I can be myself with someone, that I can really share with someone. 
Finally. When you look at me, look at me with your smiling eyes, 
I could stay forever, held within this dream. 
A dream with so much colour, so much light it's blinding, 
I could stay forever, lost within your eyes. Warm inside, this feels so right. 
You really know how to charm me. You've cast a spell and now you have me. 
You take me, completely. 
No need to wear my mask for you. No need to hide myself from you. 
Finally. When you look at me, look at me with your smiling eyes, 
I could stay forever, held within this dream. 
A dream with so much colour, so much light it's blinding, 
I could stay forever, lost within your eyes. I must say, how I feel today. 
I've never felt this strong for someone, I've never felt such love for someone. 
Feels so deep, I want to keep, 
Learning how to be together, share our lives and grow together. 
Finally. When you look at me, look at me with your smiling eyes, 
I could stay forever, held within this dream. 
A dream with so much colour, so much light it's blinding, 
I could stay forever, held within your eyes.
