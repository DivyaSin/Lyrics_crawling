My sentiment will bore you senseless I know 
But I've got to tell you something 
I want to be a satellite to your world 
Spinning in the universe When all the pleasures in heaven are yours 
You can take what you want from me 
You got me spinning around you 
You got me spinning around you Look at me I'm a bony bit of skinny confidence 
But that might be my photograph 
From the top of the highest peak you can watch me Spinning in the universe When all the pleasures in heaven are yours 
You can take what you want from me My sentiment still bores you senseless I know 
But I've got to show you something I found 
Here's a photo of an astronaut 
And there's you and me spinning in the background Ten million ways I've tried to get into heaven 
But they always chase me out again 
God says I'm wasting my time 
And he know I haven't got a lot of time
