Fuck God, for he is nothing to me 
I spit on Jehovah and display mockery 
The virgin Mary was a dirty whore 
No blood of lamb shall be upon my door I am godforsaken and I shall never change 
My evil thoughts can't ever be rearranged 
Lord of myself and a servant to one 
I deny the holy ghost, the father and the son No need for Alla, without Xul 
Jesus Christ symbolizes a fool 
Tetregrammaton, another form of deceit 
And I renounce the crutch of the weak I am godforsaken and I shall never change 
My evil thoughts can't ever be rearranged 
Lord of myself and a servant to one 
I deny the holy ghost, the father and the son Anephezeton, bow before me! Where's this God? It's not there 
A blind belief which is based in fear 
Mindless herds can't perceive 
Why I rejoice as they grieve
