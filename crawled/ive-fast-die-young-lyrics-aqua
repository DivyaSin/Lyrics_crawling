Whatever happens in the club baby - stays there 
I'm not gonna carry around my past 
I'm just not waiting till that something's gonna happen 
I'm gonna find it baby - trust me Live fast - die young 
All we are looking for is hope and glory 
Cause I was born - to run 
There's not a boring page in my life story Whatever happens in my life baby - boost me 
There's not a second that i'll regret 
I'm just so full of life and ready to explore it 
And it all feels like - I'm ready to explode I know that ever since that I was born 
I was ready just to party on - yeah Live fast - die young 
All we are looking for is hope and glory 
Cause I was born - to run 
There's not a boring page in my life story We're not gonna live forever 
Tonight is the night 
Whatever happens baby 
We are never gonna regret it I'm a little schoolgirl - in my daydreams 
Lighting up the candles - one by one 
Freaky giant doormen - coming closer 
Blowing out my candles - wake up now We are gonna live like there is no tomorrow Live fast - die young 
All we are looking for is hope and glory 
Cause I was born - to run 
There's not a boring page in my life story
