She stands there looking at me 
i know she's wondering 
if she should kick it with me 
cause you know i got that something 
if she be wanting to freak 
that shaking thundering 
and now she's starting to creep 
up on me [chorus] 
man she looks so good (man she look so good) 
and she looks so fine (look so fine) 
her scent takes me high 
singing 'my oh my' (my my my my) 
got to get with her (got to get with her) 
have her in my world (in my world) 
hold her in my arms 
just forever you i wanna rock with you

run around in the rain with you 
everyday now only you 
-rock with you

do everything with you 
run around in the rain with you 
everyday now only you [verse 2-DAESUNG]

through the crowd just tumbling 
i really want her with me 
some one-on-one romance 
what she keeps doing to me

and she looks so fine (so fine)
