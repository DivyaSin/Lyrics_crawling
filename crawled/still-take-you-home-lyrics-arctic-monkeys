Oh, spending all of your money 
On trendy haircuts that you think look cool 
And you're probably alright 
But under these lights you look beautiful 
And I'm struggling 
I can't see through your fake tan 
Oh ya know it for a fact 
That everybody's eating outta your hand 
What do you know? 
Oh you know nothing! 
But I'll still take you home 
Yeah, I'll still take you home 
What do you know? 
Oh you don't know nothing! Fancy seeing you in here 
You're all tarted up, and you don't look the same 
I haven't seen you since last year 
Yeah I'm surprised you hadn't forgotten my name 
But you know it 
Yeah you knew it all along 
Oh you say you have forgotten 
But you're fibbin', oh don't tell me I'm wrong What do you know? 
Oh you know nothing! 
But I'll still take you home 
Yeah, I'll still take you home 
What do you know? 
Oh you don't know nothing, no! Whoa Yeah, so what do you know? 
Oh you know nothing, no! 
But I'll still take you home 
Yeah, I'll still take you home 
Yes, so what do you know? 
Oh you know nothing, no! You sold your soul to the fashion 
You're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too 
Where's the love and the passion? 
Oh I suppose that's nothing to do with you 
But it's alright, put it all on one-side 
And everybody's looking 
You got control of everyone's eyes 
Including mine
