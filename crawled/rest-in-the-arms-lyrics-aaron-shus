When you broken when you're weak 
When you turn the other cheek 
When you cannot speak of the bitter sweet, 
Bitter sweetness 
When the floor gives out beneath 
And everything that you believe 
Cannot bring you peace 
You're broken inside, broken in pieces 
You can Rest in the arms of the One who holds you 
Rest in the arms of the One who knows you 
Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go (2X) When the waters starts to rise 
And you've lost the will to fight 
When the you're losing light 
Just close your eyes 
Close your eyes now 
You can Rest in the arms of the One who holds you 
Rest in the arms of the One who knows you 
Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go (2X) Have no fear 
I'll be here You can Rest in the arms of the One who holds you 
Rest in the arms of the One who knows you 
Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go (2X)
