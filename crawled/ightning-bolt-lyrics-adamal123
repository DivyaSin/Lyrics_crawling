I ran, I chased you down the halls. 
To get the revenge that I wanted. 
I've hunt you down every single day. 
But I never felt free. I'll hunt you down. 
From the classroom to the hall. 
I will find you someday. 
I will get my revenge. 
No matter hard it'll be 
I will finally find you. I came in like a Lightning Bolt! 
Striking right into your ass hole! 
From the classroom to the hall. 
All you did was, blow up everything! 
Yeah, you blew up everything! Could not bare to, I real hate you. 
I'll go and hide in a dark place. 
I'll hate to see your face again. 
So, leave me alone I hate thee. I just wanna live my life. 
Free from constant bullying. 
Living safe and carefree. 
Maybe in my own home 
I'll relax and spend my time 
Living safe an carefree. I came in like a Lightning Bolt! 
Smashing right into you home door! 
It's enough for you to go insane! 
Do not ever get in my way! 
I came in like a Lightning Bolt! 
You punched me into a shallow grave! 
Haven't got anyone else to blame. 
I should've known this would happen to me! 
Yeah, it happened to me! I really want to wreck you up. 
But I never even get to. 
Whenever you get close to me. 
You always got away from me 
I really want to wreck you up. 
But I never ever got a chance. 
You always got away from me. Don't you ever say. 
You didn't bully me. 
Now I'll take my revenge >:) It's time for me to get revenge! 
You hear that, I'm my own man! 
You'll taste defeat from my bare hands! 
Sweet revenge is gonna be true! Hey, beware today's my day! 
I'll take the fight back to your home place! 
You blew me now how about a taste? 
This is for what you've done to me!
