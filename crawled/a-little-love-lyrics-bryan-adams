Some people walk the straight and narrow, some walk the rocky road 
Some get the silver spoon and some get the heavy load 
There's a man in a paper box, he smiles whenever we walk by 
We just walk a little faster and say 
"There but for the grace of God go I" Just a little love 
Just a little love 
A little love can change it all Well, I've been up and down this highway and I ain't seen a road sign yet 
It's cold hard world baby, you gotta hang on to what you get 
Well, I don't believe in miracles but that don't mean they don't come true 
Well, I may not get to Heaven 
But I get a little closer when I'm with you Just a little love 
Just a little love 
A little love can change it all Well, I get a little tired walkin' down the street 
People on my side, everyone I meet 
But they don't know what's on my mind 
And they don't know that they might find A little love 
Just a little love 
Just a little love can change it all Right when you think you don't need love is when you need it most 
Even if you got the father, the son and the holy ghost 
Well, there's more to truth baby than what we know is true 
Yeah we wonder round in the darkness 
But every now and then a little shines through Just a little love 
Just a little love 
A little love can change it all 
A little love can change it all 
A little love can change it all
