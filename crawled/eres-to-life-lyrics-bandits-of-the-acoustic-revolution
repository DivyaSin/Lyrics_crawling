How did Camus really die that night? 
Were they right? 
When he died was it really his time? 
Or was it suicide? And Holden Caulfield is a friend of mine. 
We go drinking from time to time and I find it gets harder every time. [Chorus] 
Three went down (But only two of them come up again) 
The minimal is criminal but less is a sin 
Though three went down (But only two of them come up again) 
I'm not going to play if there ain't no way I'll win Hemingway never seemed to mind the banality of a normal life and I find it gets harder every time. So he aimed the shotgun into the blue, placed his face in between the two and sighed: 
Here's to Life! [Chorus] Hey there Salinger, what did you do? 
Just when the world was looking to you to write anything that meant anything, 
You told us you were through. 
And it's been years since you passed away, But I see no plaque, 
And I see no grave and I can't help believing that you wanted it that way. And Vincent Van Gogh, why do you weep? 
You were on your way to heaven but the road was steep. 
And who was there to break your fall? 
We're guilty, one and all. And I don't know much, 
But I do know this: 
With a golden heart comes a rebel fist and every single soldier wasn't fired, 
Some have quit. And it makes me sick when I think of it: 
All my heroes could not live with this and I hope you rest in peace because with us you never did. And KDC you were much too young and you changed my life but I draw the line at suicide, 
So here's to life!
