"Long live anarchy!" were Sacco's last words 
Their cries of freedom were supressed and they were never heard 
Guilty only of their beliefs, and their foreign births 
No solid concrete evidence of being guilty...cause they weren't 
In an atmosphere of instense hostility 
The system made it clear - because of your beliefs you'll receive no pity 
In defiance of worldwide protest and appeals 
They were electrocuted, their only crimes were their ideals 
"Only with liberty can men rise and be complete 
We're the black cats and the terror of many" to all oppressors we bring defeat! 
They held true to their beliefs until the bitter end 
Their pointless fucking execution was some kind of sick revenge! 
Fuck You!
