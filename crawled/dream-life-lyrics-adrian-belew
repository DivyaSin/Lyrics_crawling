Can you see me as your heart sees 
Not apart from you, but a part of you 
And remember me as the man I am 
Not the things I do or faults I have 
And when you lie asleep at night 
I'm beside you in your dream life 
And when you open up your eyes 
If you think of me Know I am compromised, 
Fighting time and a busy life 
And nothing seems to come easily 
But I'll be there when you need me 
And when you walk along the street 
And the wind blows like a memory 
If you should wake up suddenly 
And you think of me History is full of hurt and tears 
But nothing worse than the fear, 
I'm forgotten 
Most of all I want to say 
I hope you find your own way 
And never quit but remember this 
Life is quick; make the most of it 
And when you lie asleep at night 
I'm beside you in your dream life 
And when you open up your eyes 
If you think of me
