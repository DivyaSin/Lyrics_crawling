Uh-huh, holy shit 
It's about time you get off my dick A few times you been around that track 
But your ass is still fat, it's gonna stay like that 
'Cause I ain't your hollaback boy 
I ain't your hollaback boy

(Ooh oo) This is my shit, this is my shit 
(Ooh oo) This is my shit, this is my shit 
(Ooh oo) This is my shit. You damn right I was talking shit 
I told your man so you would hear it 
What you doin' acting like that 
Now people know what's up 
So you came to my place 
Saw the look on your face 
I hit a home run then I kicked you out 
But first I broke my pom-pom out 
And now you know what's up A few times you been around that track 
But your ass is still fat, it's gonna stay like that 
'Cause I ain't your hollaback boy 
I ain't your hollaback boy 
(Repeat x2) (Ooh oo) This is my shit, this is my shit 
(Ooh oo) This is my shit, this is my shit 
(Ooh oo) This is my shit, this is my shit 
(Ooh oo) This is my shit. So last night girl, saw you under the bleachers 
Giving head to a substitute teacher 
Perfect grades didn't make no sense 
But now it's all cleared up 
And it's comin' right back 
'Cause I'm telling your pack 
So don't freak out when your secret's out 
That's right girl, you can't deny this 
Your knees is all scratched up A few times you been around that track 
But your ass is still fat, it's gonna stay like that 
'Cause I ain't your hollaback boy 
I ain't your hollaback boy 
(Repeat x2) (Ooh oo) This is my shit, this is my shit 
(Ooh oo) This is my shit, this is my shit 
(Ooh oo) This is my shit, this is my shit

But your ass is still fat, it's gonna stay like that
