Everywhere I go 
Somebody I know 
Want's to come kick it with me(hey) 
It's Saturday night and we're gonna have a party [Chorus] 
Everywhere I go 
Somebody I know 
Want's to come kick it with me 
It's Saturday night and we're gonna have a party (it's a party ya'll) Tonight is the night 
I'm feelin' right 
To party 
I'm callin' my boys to come roll with me (oh) End of the week 
Word on the street 
The strip is crawlin' 
With hunnies that can't get enough of me There is something in the air 
Come with me, we can go anywhere (oh) [Chorus] It's Saturday night and we're gonna have a party Lose track of time 
It's gonna fly 
Baby don't have no worries 
Cause there ain't no better place to be (no, no) It's after midnight 
Everything's going right 
You're the only one for me 
And you only ever ? to me at the party Well, there is something in the air 
Just take my hand, we can go anywhere (oh) [Chorus] It's Saturday night and we're gonna have a party Bump bump 
Chicka chicka 
Bump bump 
Play some music 
Cause I'm crusin' in my truck, now 
With my peoples and I'm doin' what I want 
Have a party and get up in the stuff 
It's a Saturday night 
Now it's like a party day 
Got no worries 
So party like it's a holiday 
Hey, hey 
Everybody go 
Hey, hey 
What you say 
(Break, break, breakdown) Everywhere we go, it's on 
Saturday night 
(Yeah) 
We will party, all night long 
Saturday night 
(Yeah) [Chorus] It's Saturday night and we're gonna have a party [Repeat: x3]
