Do you remember how we used to be? Before we lost the dream of you and me? From the very start you took my breath away. So tonight lets bring back yesterday. CHORUS: 
Darlin' Stay. Why don't you be with me tonight? Stay. We can make love till the morning light. Baby Stay. I can make everything all right. Just tell me what to say 'cause i really don't want you to go. You used to laugh and say sweet things to me. You made me happy as a man could be. Hold me in your arms like you did then. Make the memory live all over again. REPEAT CHORUS THREE TIMES AND FADE
