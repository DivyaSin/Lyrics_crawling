I want you now, like we're burning in a five-alarm fire 
I need you now, cause every second is getting hotter, hotter, hotter 
I want you now, now, now, now... Sweat dripping from my brow, heart's pumping high speed 
Jugging this, water down, but I'm still thirsty 
It's only getting worse, too close to you stand next to me, are you warm? 
I feel your clothes sticking to my body, should I take 'em off 
If I keep staring in your eyes, I might get a little lost 
I'm walking over now it seems the whole room starts to cross, I'm caught in your storm Ooooh, nothing can cool me down, not how I feel right now 
You got my attention, call 999 it's a problem I want you now, like we're burning in a five-alarm fire 
I need you now, cause every second is getting hotter, hotter, hotter 
I want you now, Like we're burning in a five-alarm fire 
3-4-5 alarm 
3-4-5 alarm

Come on whisper to me give me chills, with your dirty words 
I can't keep myself away, the separation only hurts, How do you feel? Ooooh, nothing can cool me down, not how I feel right now 
You got my attention, call 999 it's a problem I want you now, like we're burning in a five-alarm fire
