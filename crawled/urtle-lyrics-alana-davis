Little boy wishes he wasn't small. 
He'd give is turtle, to be six feet tall. 
He's got photos of Shaq and Ewing, up on his wall. 
And he'd try a jump shot but he's afraid he'll fall down. 
Little girl wants to fall in love. 
Dressed up like her mother, in white evening gloves. 
She pretends, tells her friends she's got somewhere to go. 
They don't ask her where, so they'll never know how she feels. 
With a shorter past, there's a greater hurry. 
Let the moment last, there's no need to worry. 
We should be living for today, or tomorrow anyway, 
And don't ask for the world on a plate, 
'Cause you just might get it. 
Don't ever say it's too late, you know you'll regret it, because 
Just when you're sure, your life can change right before your eyes. 
A mother's thinking of her little boy, 
Left home at sixteen back in eighty-four. 
He's got a dog named Lucy, says she's all he needs. 
Lucy knows better, she hears all his dreams. 
When you search yourself, when you get down to it. 
If you know yourself, you know you'll get through it. 
So start living for today, or tomorrow anyway, 
And don't ask for the world on a plate, 
'Cause you just might get it. 
Don't ever say it's too late, you know you'll regret it, because 
Just when you're sure, your life can change right before your eyes. 
With a shorter past, there's a greater hurry. 
Let the moment last, there's no need to worry. 
Start living for today, or tomorrow anyway... 
Just when you're sure, your life can 
Change right before your eyes, 
Right before your eyes.
