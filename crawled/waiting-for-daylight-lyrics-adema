We'll raise our fists and we'll stomp our feet 
We will resist all authority until they topside 
We're marching admirably, let them see 
We'll watch them crumble, oh, we're gonna watch them die When all the people settle down 
And all the alcohol runs out 
I'll just sit here by myself 
(Waiting for) Each and every souls worn thin 
All the walls are closing in 
(Waiting for) 
Wishing I was someone else 
(Waiting for) 
Waiting for the daylight to come The highway's coming alive tonight 
We'll kill the headlights, roll right through the twists and the turns 
We'll make our move when the time is right 
We'll start our fire, oh and let them watch it burn When all the people settle down 
And all the alcohol runs out 
I'll just sit here by myself 
(Waiting for) Each and every souls worn thin 
All the walls are closing in 
(Waiting for) 
Wishing I was someone else 
(Waiting for) 
Waiting for the daylight to come I take everything I'm given 
Can't stand 'cause the room keeps spinning 
This is the life that I'm livin' 
(This is the life that I'm livin') I take everything I'm given 
Can't stand 'cause the room keeps spinning 
This is the life that I'm livin' 
(This is the life this is the life) When all the people settle down 
And all the alcohol runs out 
I'll just sit here by myself 
(Waiting for) Each and every souls worn thin 
All the walls are closing in 
(Waiting for) 
Wishing I was someone else 
(Waiting for) 
Waiting for the daylight to come 
(Waiting for the daylight to come) 
To come, to come
