When a man loves a woman 
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else 
He'd change the world 
For the good thing he's found If she is bad, he can't see it 
She can do no wrong 
Turnin' his back on his best friend 
If he put her down When a man loves a woman 
He spend his very last dime 
Tryin' to hold on 
To what he needs He'd give up all of his comforts 
And he sleep out in the rain 
If she said that's the way 
It ought to be Well, this man loves you woman 
I give you everything I have 
Tryin' to hold on to your hot blood love 
Baby, please don't treat me bad When a man loves a woman 
Deep down in his soul 
Oh, she can bring him 
Such misery If she is playin' him for a fool 
He's the last one to know 
Oh, lovin' eyes, lovin' eyes 
Can never see I love, I love, I love, baby, baby, baby, woman 
And I love you, baby, I love you, baby 
From the bottom of my heart 
Deep down in my soul, can't you see?
