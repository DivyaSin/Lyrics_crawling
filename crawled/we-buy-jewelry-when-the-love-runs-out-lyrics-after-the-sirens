I have been both lover and beloved, unrequited 
dispassionate and quiet around you. And when I am old, when the skin under my eyes 
stretches to wrap around the things I've seen, 
what will it mean that I didn't take a chance on you? 
Didn't get lost in a glance from you? 
This fragile balance, this delicate palace where one left 
puts two people on two different paths. 
But if I hold out my hands to you 
it doesn't make it right, it doesn't make it right. I want more for my life than my name in lights, 
my name in lights! I've read books and understood them, 
understood the looks you gave me 
when I sent you a letter from Bennington 
telling you that I couldn't leave his grave without a poem of my own 
and all I wrote about was having you and not having you.
