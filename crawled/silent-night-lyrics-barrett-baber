Silent night, holy night 
All is calm, all is bright 
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child 
Holy infant so tender and mild 
Sleep in heavenly peace 
Sleep in heavenly peace Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Silent night, holy night 
Son of God love's pure light 
Radiant beams from Thy holy face (Thy holy face) 
Oh, with dawn of redeeming grace 
Christ the Savior is born 
Jesus the Savior is born Oh, Christ the Savior is born, ooh 
Jesus the Savior is born
