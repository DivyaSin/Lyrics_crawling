What if I could move mountains 
And gave all I had to the poor? 
Would it mean a thing? 
Would it mean a thing if I don't have love? What if I used all the gifts 
And gave my body to the flames? 
Would it mean a thing? 
Would it mean a thing if I don't have love? And when I pass through that veil 
I know perfection comes 
The chains will come off, the walls will fall down 
The scales will drop and I'll see him face to face Love came to Earth so we'd see 
A deeper way to live and grow 
Self-seeking in nothing 
Show us what it means to walk in love To show us how to always trust 
To persevere and always hope 
Give thanks in everything 
And show us what it means to walk in love And when I pass through that veil 
I know perfection comes 
The chains will come off, the walls will fall down 
The scales will drop and I'll see him face to face, yeah Love is patient, love is kind 
It doesn't envy, doesn't bind 
It means everything 
It means everything when you have love And love when'll you have love 
Love when'll you have love
