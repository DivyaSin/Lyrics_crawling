Where my real niggas that's gonna ride with me 
Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me 
Where my real niggas that's gonna ride with me 
Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah Tell the police I'ma stack this paper 'til I overdose 
Woodie, hoodie, slowly back your bitch ass up your over close 
I overflow on all the hoes, my niggas is over height 
Shooting up your phantom night and call your shit the holy ghost 
Mercy, lord would you please have mercy 
And protect me from the hoes if their life ain't sweet they go desert me 
Shut the fuck up and stand out when you see me like I'm the verdict 
That's respect now I got your wifey and you're back to using jerk and hurt 
Sick and spill and tip it for my niggas who done passed away 
Charge your ass a fuck you fee and make you pay your tax today 
I'm on the secluded island, I swear I feel like cast away 
Put that money in my shooter hands and tell 'em blast away 
Look I feel like getting paper is my destiny 
'Til I rest in peace, getting money recipe 
Throw my mic is what you want, bitch just leave the rest to me 
Ain't no motherfucking rest for me, 
'Cause Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Diamond rings, hundred chains, slick rick the rula 
I got cars, cribs all in my name 
Got them m's all in that bank 
Griff Blake all in that paint, stack some bread come watch me pray 
Pray that never die broke get them cases by the boat 
Went shopping bought the store, shorty snuck her fell that crab 
Eating lobster on my dinner plate 
Stacking all this money homie trying to see that ceiling break 
Mula ain't everything homie, is the only thing 
Came from the hall of piss straight to the hall of fame 
Talking money we got it, thug boys shoot your style 
Eating good I ain't brolic I'm just chasing them comma's haahh 
My niggas ride got five and my bitches ten 
Got that china white call it german land 
Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
A chain, a fridge, deep freezer and a cooler Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah Where my real niggas that's gonna ride with me 
Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me 
Where my real niggas that's gonna ride with me 
Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me
