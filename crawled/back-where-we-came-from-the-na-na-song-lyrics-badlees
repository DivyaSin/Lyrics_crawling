A lot of folks do well enough leavin' well enough alone 
But that was never true for me and you 
Livin' like the characters in "Like A Rolling Stone" 
Confirming things that we already knew You were young and pretty - me, well, I was young 
Leastways young enough not to need a reason 
I was for the memories and you were for the fun 
And we were both just fillin' up the season With no dreams and no plans and no schemes 
Somehow here we are again CHORUS Na na na na na na 
We're ending up back where we came from 
Na na na na na na na Na na na na na na 
We're ending up back where we came from 
Na na na na na na na We had beer and "Jack" and Kerouak and weekends on the fringe 
And lots of time to think about tomorrow 
But it seems our little bivouac was more than just a binge 
Sometimes you end up keeping what you borrow With no dreams and no plans and no schemes 
Somehow here we are again CHORUS
