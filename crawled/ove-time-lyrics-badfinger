Every day I look into your eyes 
I see a love that's there 
I see myself and stare Loving you so many different ways 
A kind of harmony 
Another part of me 
Makes it harder now If it's easy to believe it 
It's hard to realize 
As easy to believe it 
As the love that's in your eyes Well if it's easy to believe it 
It's hard to realize 
As easy to believe it 
As the love that's in your eyes
