Dashing through the snow 
In a one-horse open sleigh 
O'er the fields we go 
Laughing all the way 
Bells on bob-tail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
A sleighing song tonight Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh Dashing through the snow 
In a one-horse open sleigh 
O'er the fields we go 
Laughing all the way 
Bells on bob-tail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey 
Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg 
Batmobile lost its wheel and Joker got away A day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright 
Was seated by my side 
The horse was lean and lank 
Misfortune seemed his lot 
He got into a drifted bank and lo, we made the cut Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh Now the ground is white 
Go it while you're young 
Take the girls tonight 
And sing this sleighing song 
Just get a bob-tailed bay 
Two-forty for his speed 
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack, you'll take the lead Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh What fun it is to laugh and sing 
What fun it is to laugh and sing 
What fun it is to laugh and sing (ha-ha-ha, ha) 
What fun it is to laugh and sing, sleighing song tonight
