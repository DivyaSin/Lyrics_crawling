Chestnuts roasting on a open fire 
Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir 
And folks dressed up like Eskimos 
Everybody knows 
A turkey and some mistletoe 
Help to make the season bright 
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight They know that Santa's on his way 
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
And every mother's child is going to spy 
Too see if reindeer even know how to fly 
And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
To kids from 1 to 92 
All though it's been said many times 
Many ways Merry Christmas to you 
And every mother's child is going to spy 
Too see if reindeer even know how to fly 
And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
To kids from 1 to 92 
All though it's been said many times 
Many ways 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas to you
