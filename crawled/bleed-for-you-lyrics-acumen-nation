staring out to space what i do best 
barely at the table as i chew as i swallow as i spit 
i forgot my english as the language that i often abuse 
yesterday a blackout swallowed up the afternoon 
yet i cant lay down 
still cant lay down because its so loud in here 
i cannot breathe for you 
but i crash and i burn 
so i can bleed for you 
and ill stay alive 
just to have you 
ill stay alive 
just to own you (but that's the only reason why...) picture your presence collecting your goal 
asphyxiating on love and other pastimes 
a piece of your traction i never get to taste 
these limbs wont lift me off of this floor 
its times like this i like to forget who i am 
actually its more like i have never had the choice 
yet i cant lay down 
still cant lay down
