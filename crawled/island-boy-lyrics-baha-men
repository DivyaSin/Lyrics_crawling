You know my heart is still in the Caribbean 
I still hear my girlfriend say 
Come Back Home, to the land of the palmy beaches 
Where your heart has always been, since the very first day I still miss Goombay Samba every evening 
And the sailing boats beneath the bridge so high 
I feel the sun and my heart within me leaving 
To come back to Nassau, to the sun, the sea and the sky I hear cowbells and the drums on New Years morning 
And I smell hibiscus in the tropic skies above 
Look at the boats and the conch and fish a dawnin 
I know its Nassau and everything about it I love 
Island boy, youve got your mind on your job 
but your heart is in the Caribbean Island boy, when you look at the concrete walls 
You can hear them say 
Come back home, 
to the land of the sun and the palmy beaches 
Where your heart belongs 
Since the very first day
