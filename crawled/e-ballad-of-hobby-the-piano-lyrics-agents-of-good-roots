Music: jones Lyrics: Hobby was an only child 
He couldn't see or hear or read. 
But heard a voice inside his head 
Hobby was the deaf kid. Started playing toy piano 
Practiced morning, noon and night 
Got a gig and stole the show 
Hobby was a virtuoso. Now he's playing bop jazz 
A debussy in neck tie. 
Wynton came and couldn't speak 
When hobby played "a love supreme". (chorus): 
I know you hear something free 
Hobby was the bomb inside me 
Ears don't feel 
Eyes can't see 
Hobby was the deaf 
King of swing Saw him on arsenio 
You knew that he could really blow 
For hobby had completely floored us 
By the time he hit the second chorus Now he's playin' out shit. 
Shaved his hair and started smokin' 
Met a girl as sweet as honey 
She robbed him blind and stole his money But found some peace inside a thought 
Where his music never stopped. 
And out of nowhere came a light 
His ears could hear his eyes had sight. (chorus) Now hobby don't play no more 
Can't hear the chords that used to move him 
He opened up a record shop 
The specialty is hip-hop
