I gave you a kiss last Saturday 
And you still will not give one back to me 
You never have good apology 
And your hooves never wrap all the way around me And if you want something you gotta give something 
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away Sometimes at the movies if I buy you a soda 
You do sit just a little bit closer 
And while we're all spending my money 
Sometimes you do smile but I get mad If you want something you gotta give something 
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away Would you share with me? 
And whatever I got is never enough [Incomprehensible] I feel so special when you are close to me 
And if you cared it all for me 
You would swear to God that you hated me 
And send me away with [Incomprehensible] If you want something you gotta give something 
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away If you want something you gotta give something 
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away If you want something you gotta give something 
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away When nothing free would you share with me? And now for something completely different
