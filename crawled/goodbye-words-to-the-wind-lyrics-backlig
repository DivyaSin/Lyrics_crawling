I've seen the morning scatter on your pretty face, 
when we realized we'd let it grow just to bring it to waste, 
but when tears, like leaves, left the sick top of our trees, 
we should have known it wouldn't be long before we'd come to this. We'll try to write it all over again 
tracing blind footsteps upon wet sand. And thinking of what it has been 
I'll tell goodbye words to the wind 
I know you can hear them 
and with a smile you'll remember me. 
I see you leaving in backlight 
but I just can't be too sad, 
all I want is for you to jump into the sun 
so don't turn back and run. Let hope lead your way 
and may you have no regrets 
deep down there's nothing you lost for good. 
You'll find me in another face, another rising sun, 
that will wipe your tears and warm your hands, 
that will run with you. We'll try to write it all over again 
tracing blind footsteps upon wet sand. And thinking of what it has been 
I'll tell goodbye words to the wind 
I know you can hear them 
and with a smile you'll remember me. 
I see you leaving in backlight 
but I just can't be too sad, 
all I want is for you to jump into the sun 
so don't turn back and run. I know it's hard to choose to leave 
but cryin' feels so wrong, we still got ways to go 
when we don't know what tomorrow might bring 
so be strong and apart won't mean alone Then look for me within the whispers of the wind 
and the haze will leave your eyes and you will see And thinking of what it has been 
I'll tell goodbye words to the wind 
I know you can hear them 
and with a smile you'll remember me. 
I see you leaving in backlight 
but I just can't be too sad, 
all I want is for you to jump into the sun 
so don't turn back and run.
