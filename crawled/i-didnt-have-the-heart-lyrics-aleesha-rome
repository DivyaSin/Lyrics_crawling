, I didn't have the heart to say goodbye 
And heaven knows a thousand times I tried 
To explain how I feel You, you closed our eyes and said a long goodnight 
I kissed you for the last time and I tried 
To explain how I feel I, I didn't have the heart to say goodbye 
And heaven knows a thousand times I tried 
I didn't have the heart I, would lie awake and wonder every night 
Cause losing you is burning deep inside 
I can't explain how I feel I, I didn't have the heart to say goodbye 
And heaven knows a thousand times I tried 
I didn't have the heart to say goodbye 
And losing you is hurting deep inside 
I didn't have the heart I, I didn't have the heart to say goodbye 
And heaven knows a thousand times I tried 
I didn't have the heart to say goodbye 
And heaven knows a thousand times I tried 
I didn't have the heart to say goodbye And losing you is hurting deep inside 
I didn't have the heart I can't explain
