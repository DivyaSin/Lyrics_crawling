Alive among the lifeless 
How many of us still survive? 
Stranded in this hell 
Cursed by the walking dead There's not much time left now 
The sun has already begun to set 
Time to board up the windows and doors 
It'll be dark in half an hour Rising from forgotten graves 
The dead returning to life 
The corpse walks 
Never to be killed again Bon(e)y fingers covered in moldy flesh 
It's got you by the neck 
A look of hunger in dead eyes 
Broken teeth sink into your throat 
Too late, you saw it too late 
Your flesh a feast for fiends The body scattered on the ground 
Blood soaked into gravelly earth The streets are now empty 
I watch the dead as they begin to feed
