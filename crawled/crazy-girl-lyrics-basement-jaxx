When I met you 
You were sexy 
You were freaky 
I thought my luck was in 
Then I noticed, 
You were crazy 
I did not know what to do 
'cause I thought it was love Crazy Girl (Freaky)

Somewhere where the sun will shine 
Why must we be so incompatible 
Freaky 'cause I thought I was in love Crazy Girl (Freaky)
