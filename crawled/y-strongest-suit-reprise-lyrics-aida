Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere Now I believe in lookin' like my time on earth is cookin' 
Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked 
With some glamor guaranteein' every fiber of my bein' 
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect From your cradle via trousseau to your death bed you're on view, so 
Never compromise, accept no substitute 
I would rather wear a barrel than conservative apparel 
Because dress has always been my strongest suit Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere Staying in or hitting townwards from the top and working downwards 
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time 
Whether wig or hat or turban whether clad boudoir or urban 
Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime And the few who are invited to my wardrobe are delighted 
As they wander through my things to find en route 
That in negligee or formal, I am anything but normal 
Because dress has always been my strongest suit Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere Now you don't need a recital of the reasons why it's vital 
That tonight my trappings will not be subsued 
That from coronet to sandal, no one else is worth a candle 
That I couldn't make more impact in the nude So bring me all my finest, most audacious, mi divinest 
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot 
Most arresting, most heart-stopping 
Most free flowing, most eye popping 
Because dress has always been my strongest suit Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
