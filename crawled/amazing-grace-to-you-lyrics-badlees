There was a man who sang the blues 
No one could deny he spoke the truth 
He shouted through the microphone 
But no one could care less 
He lived his life anonymously 
Was rediscovered posthumously 
Now people quote his words 
And talk about his tragic death (Ain't that the way it goes) 
The was a man who told a lie 
With a twinkle in his eye 
People came from all around 
To stand by his side 
People will sell their souls away 
For a little false hope and some unfound praise 
There's always somebody out there 
Who is happy to oblige (Ain't that the way it goes) 
Amazing grace to you He met her in a college bar 
Talked his way into her car 
She fell in love with him, I guess 
The same time he lost interest 
Now, he takes a hit off of his bong 
While she listens to country songs 
Ah, to be young again (Ain't that the way it goes) 
Amazing grace to you There's a place in my father's home 
Where I still go to be alone 
Demons visit me there yet 
Sometimes we share a cigarette 
They laugh and whisper in my ear 
Tell me what I want to hear 
The devil has so many friends Amazing grace to you 
(Ain't that the way it goes)
