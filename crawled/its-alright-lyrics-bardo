It's cool with me boy if you've got somewhere to go 
Although we made some plans 
I'm going with the flow 
Won't hear no drama out of me 
Won't hear no noise 
'Cause I'll be hanging with the girls 
Will you be hanging with the boys Won't be sitting by the phone 
Gonna put my make-up on 
And be out, call me when you get home 
Hit me when you get home baby CHORUS 
It's alright, it's ok 
I am not gonna do your thang 
'Cause I will be doing mine 
Think I'm gonna dance all night If you don't know by now 
I'm not a silly girl 
So what you do with me 
It might not work with her 
What I've been through in my life 
Only made me strong 
So I ain't trippin' 'bout no man 
Baby I'll see you when I can Won't be sitting by the phone 
Gonna put my make-up on 
And be out, call me when you get home 
Hit me when you get home baby It's alright, it's ok 
I am not gonna do your thang 
'Cause I will be doing mine 
Think I'm gonna dance all night I'm not worried 'bout tomorrow 
I'm just living for today 
I've got my mind on letting go boy 
So go out and do your thing 
Ain't no pressure let's make plans 
And just hook up another time 
Keep on doin' what you're doin' 
I'll be fine It's alright, it's ok 
I am not gonna do your thang 
'Cause I will be doing mine 
Think I'm gonna dance all night
