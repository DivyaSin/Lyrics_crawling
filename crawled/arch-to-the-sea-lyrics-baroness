There was an anchor, there was a silver-sweet refrain. 
You tucked your fingers in between my troubled bones. 
And what you did next was second to none. 
You really let us down. 
You tied yourself up and jumped in the sea never to come home. You left me all alone 
Tell me when I will be whole again. There was a whisper. Once there were heralds and parades. 
You sang your secrets through the tolling of the day. 
The fugitive room, the 
The the the silence and the cries. 
The quickening beat, your march to the sea, never to return. Sweep my feet, you've taken all of me. 
Let me know, when you will let me go. Heroin, where did you take my friend? 
Tell me why, those ropes are hanging high? You left me alone.
