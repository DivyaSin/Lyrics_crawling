See the lightning, hear all the thunder 
What you gonna do? 
Feel the ones and zeros above you 
Now you feeling blue Watch the ships into the harbor 
Now you're on your own 
When they see your own reflection 
But you'll never gonna Take my heart or take my hand 
And keep your conscience clear 
Well, I got a feeling it's a burning desire 
And I don't know what it means So listen, are you looking in hell for heaven's key? 
So listen, are you looking in hell for heaven's key? All the friends that said they were with you 
Seem to disappear 
Even that most focused of feelings 
Now it's not so clear How can you just stand beside me 
In my hour of need? 
Well, the second cut is deeper 
So you better let it Take my heart or take my hand 
And keep your conscience clear 
Well, I got a feeling it's a burning desire 
And I don't know what it means So listen, are you looking in hell for heaven's key? 
So listen, are you looking in hell for heaven? Take my heart or take my hand 
And keep your conscience clear 
Well, I got a feeling it's a burning desire 
And I don't know what it means So listen, are you looking in hell for heaven's key? 
So listen, are you looking in hell for heaven's key?
