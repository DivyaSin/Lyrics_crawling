I can 't, can 't, can 't, can 't do 
Can 't, can 't, can 't, can 't do Sometimes I feel like shit 
So don 't waste my fucking time 
I don 't need no family 
Just a big fat check of royalties I know what I want to do 
But I just don 't seem to get it through 
And I see-see-see-see-can 't do anything 
No, I see-see-see-see-can 't do anything You live like a wannabe 
In this sick society 
And you 're sitting next to me 
Can 't you fuckin ' see I know how I ended up here 
I took your piece of shit for real 
And I see-see-see-see-can 't do anything 
No, I see-see-see-see-can 't do anything I can 't do nothing And I see-see-see-see-can 't do anything 
No, I see-see-see-see-can 't do anything `Cause I 'm a U.F.O. Romeo 
Well, I 'm a U.F.O. Romeo 
Well, I 'm a U.F.O. Romeo 
Well, I 'm a U.F.O. Romeo
