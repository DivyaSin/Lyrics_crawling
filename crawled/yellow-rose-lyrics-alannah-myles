Hopelessly watching and waiting 
To see if my lover has turned to walk away 
Opening slowly I sit by the water, I'm broken 
There's nothing left to say Red, red roses, all but one yellow bud 
The gentle thud of unrequited love Am I protected by this thorn in my heart? 
What must I have been thinking of? 
The rose of recognition 
Or the yellow rose of unrequited love Here in the aftermath, hopes crashed asunder 
I wonder, can I camouflage my sadness? 
Begging forgiveness, I don't understand love 
How could I not notice my madness? Red, red roses, all but one yellow bud 
The yellow rose of unrequited love Am I protected by this thorn in my heart? 
What must I have been thinking of? 
The rose of recognition 
Or the yellow rose of unrequited love Holding my head up to fight off their glances 
I shifted and picked up my coat and my glasses 
Boldly I stood up to everyone's weakness 
I've lifted my spirits but still I am sleepless Red, red roses, all but one yellow bud 
The yellow rose of unrequited love Am I protected by this thorn in my heart? 
What must I have been thinking of? 
The rose of recognition 
Or the yellow rose of unrequited love 
What must I have been thinking of?
