Find Some Love 
Randy Bachman - Fred Turner We always find you on the inside looking out 
You dreams are always soaked in rain, 
Sun just don't come out 
Somewhere in the distance you can hear the games begin 
Your hopes are up but still you know, 
Your ship ain't comin' in You say it's love, that you're looking for 
Well it won't walk through your front door 
Get in the race, get something goin' 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love Livin' in the city ain't that easy gettin' stuff 
You'll find your share of chills and thrills 
But you just can't get enough 
The music there will rock you hard 
The women sooth you soul 
There's nothing there that you can't get, 
So you ain't goin' home alone You say it's love, that you're looking for 
Well it won't walk through your front door 
Get in the race, get something goin' 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love Love is like a hurricane, 
Love can fall apart 
Love is like a ball and chain, 
And love can break your heart The moon tonight is freezing bright but hides behind the clouds 
You walk alone along the streets, 
The silence screams out loud 
It's getting late, you sit and wait, 
Hopin' that she'll show 
And if she's never commin' back, 
You'll probably want to know You say it's love, that you're looking for 
Well it won't walk through your front door 
Get in the race, get something goin' 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
You gotta find some love 
Find some love
