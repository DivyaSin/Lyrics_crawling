She always says she loves me when we're drinkin' 
Won't admit it but it's true 
I think I've had enough of this one 
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you 
She always says she loves me when we're drinkin' 
Won't admit it but it's true 
I think I've had enough of this one 
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you When she's drunk she calls me a punk 
She blow my phone up, she don't know what's up 
When she drink that Jack 
She won't call back, and when she off that rum 
She acts so dumb 
She tells me grow up! I say you know what? 
She won't let me finish, she starts to go nuts 
Stop throwing stuff, time to own up 
I'm so done baby I'm so done 
All I need to do is turn my back, and she'll be gone for good 
Finished packing my bags, going where I know I should 
It's only right for me to move on to what's next 
But when she texts me with those three words it gets me like She always says she loves me when we're drinkin' 
Won't admit it but it's true 
I think I've had enough of this one 
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you 
She always says she loves me when we're drinkin' 
Won't admit it but it's true 
I think I've had enough of this one 
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you She's gotta quit showing off to all of her friends 
And go pick someone else who can handle her shit 
I'm so sick of this and I can't pretend 
But I'll be stuck with this girl like wet cement, yeah 
I don't want her following in my footsteps 
But I think my shadow needs it 
Despite her good side, and some good sex 
I'd rather go through amnesia 
Like forget all about it 
No reason to always get so dramatic 
I'm more manual, she automatic 
Oh oh 
Tryna get rid of her static 
I got smacked last night, it makes sense tonight 
Well it's time to tell her I've had enough She always says she loves me when we're drinkin' 
Won't admit it but it's true 
I think I've had enough of this one 
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you 
She always says she loves me when we're drinkin' 
Won't admit it but it's true 
I think I've had enough of this one 
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you Take my hand 
Let's start new 
I wasn't planning on it but I'm likin' you 
And we just met 
But I get you 
You seem like the type that got something to prove 
Come on and dance 
Let's see you move 
This ain't the first time that I noticed you 
Take off those heels 
Let's keep um new 
Now bring that body closer for a few She always says she loves me when we're drinkin' 
Won't admit it but it's true
