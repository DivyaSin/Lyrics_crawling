Sedated and lazy cold skies full of blue 
The sun burns forever it reminds me of you 
On your dead shore the sand is warm 
She hides her tears and quickly lets it die 
I will make it thru even without you 
My sky will be blue 
I live tranquilized 
Slow motion, liquid universe I'm feeling nowhere 
It don't matter where we're goin' cause I already been 
There on your dead shore the sand is warm 
She hides her tears and quickly lets it die 
Their dying of rabies eating their babies 
In fields of dead daisies 
I live tranquilized 
I'm numb and unfeeling so I just burn and stare at the ceiling 
I'm here but so far away I see your mouth movin' but can't hear what you 
say 
And I don't think I'd give a fuck anyway
