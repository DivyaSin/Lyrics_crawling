I've got a problem, I say I got a problem 
I got a problem people, I've got a problem 
I got a problem 'bout my woman 
I got a problem 'bout my wife An' all you, when you see me stand here, two's in my life1 
I know you might be wonderin', did I wreck my life? 
Well, I got a problem 'bout my woman, ha! 
I got a problem 'bout my wife Now my wife is number one, my woman is number two 
My woman would do things for me, that my wife wouldn't do 
'Cause I dig my wife, but you understand 
Sometime it takes two y'all, to satisfy one man My problem started out 
When I started messin' 'round with number three 
She called up my wife, an' told on my woman an' me 
Now my wife packed up her clothes 
Went home to her mother 
My woman went off, an' found another lover
