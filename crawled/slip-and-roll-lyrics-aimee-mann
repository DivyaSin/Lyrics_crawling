You went from moonlighting 
But you came out fighting 
I saw you larger than life 
Throwing your knife 
Gone into deep hiding But you were so charming 
That it was disarming 
I wondered what was behind 
Having to find 
An army that keeps arming Oh, slip and roll, honey 
Stick the jab, kid 
Don't just trade punches 
Like your father did 
Cause this playing the odds 
Isn't fooling the gods 
So slip and roll 'til you're willing to take the hit So we just keep hoping 
Although the deck's sloping 
You're thinking, Throw me a bone 
Or leave me alone 
To do what they call coping Oh, slip and roll, honey 
Stick the jab, kid 
Don't just trade punches 
Like your father did 
Cause this playing the odds 
Isn't fooling the gods 
So slip and roll 'til you're willing to take the hit And you can take it, take it, take it, take it 
We've all seen that guy take it on the chin 
Oh, take it, take it, I know you can take it 
But when will you take something in Oh, slip and roll, honey 
Stick the jab, kid 
Don't just trade punches 
Like your father did 
Cause this playing the odds 
Isn't fooling the gods 
So slip and roll 'til you're willing to take the hit And you can take it, take it, take it, take it 
We've all seen that guy take it on the chin 
Oh, take it, take it, I know you can take it 
But when will you take something in 
When will you take something in
