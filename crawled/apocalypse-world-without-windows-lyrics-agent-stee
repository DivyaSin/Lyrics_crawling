I am the consequence of zealotry, I am decay 
Corrosive rust of time, you'll never wash away 
I am the bitter cold, the frozen wind, the frost of hate 
Across the plains I sweep to slaughter what I've raped I have no patience for the masses 
My star is death, in the sky it burns I am the blackened earth, the fire of hell, the end of night 
I am the final breath in all the wars you fight 
I am justice I am vengeance, sentence all to die 
I am nothing, believe in nothing, I am every cry I have no patience for the masses 
My star is death, in the sky it burns 
The book of truth well written 
And so the pages turn Let the stars fall from the sky 
A sign your ties are severed 
Let your hatred rule our mind 
A death that lasts forever, forever I am atomic, I'm a warhead, I am suffering 
The scar of ignorance and soul of blasphemy 
I am destruction, devastation, I am every crime 
Annihilation of creation and the end of time I have no patience for the masses 
My star is death, in the sky it burns 
The book of truth well written 
And so the pages turn Let the stars fall from the sky 
A sign your ties are severed 
Let your hatred rule your mind 
A death that lasts forever, forever Forever 
Forever 
Forever
