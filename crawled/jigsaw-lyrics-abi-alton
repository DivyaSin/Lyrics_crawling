I look for you in every boy 
cos' you are never off my mind 
I close my eyes and I see your face 
when I'm alone I long for your embrace 
and I've tried to find you many times 
but you have faded my eyes 
cos' you are you are you are 
one of a kind 
Find that missing part 
the part that completes my heart 
I don't know , I don't know 
know what I mean 
all I know 
is you're my missing jigsaw piece 
I don't know where this will end 
maybe we will be just friends 
but I know in my heart you will always stay 
one plus one is you and me and it's always been that way 
All I know 
is you're my missing jigsaw piece
