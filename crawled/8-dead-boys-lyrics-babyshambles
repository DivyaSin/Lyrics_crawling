Sit right down if you're a friend 
You know there ain't too many left of them 
You said, ?I want love, I want it all? You look better now than last time 
But you still look better from afar 
The life that you wanted was not in store 
You're being in the dark once again Hello, hello 
Hello, my love 
Hello, my love Stop your moaning and I'll give you a taster 
They give you and line and they call you a waster 
Give you a line, oh what a waster 
Say you will or you won't You do or you don't 
You do or you don't 
You do or you don't 'Cause you look better now than the last time 
But you're still no better than before 
The life that you wanted wasn't in store 
You're being in the dark once again Hello, hello 
Hello, my love
