Sold down the river bitch I'm far from the track 
The waters running fast and it's strength that I still lack 
The storm the rain it covers my tracks 
I don't think i'll come back Sold down the river darling i'm not who I was 
Things don't come easy like they used to when I was young 
My tales are told my songs they are sung 
I don't think i'll come back 
I don't think i'll come back 
I don't think i'll come back
