What's the point of fame if it's been abused? 
What's a kid like me even got to lose? 
Here I am on your bed again 
It's too big for the room it's in 
Watch your face and laugh just a little bit 
Everybody knows that you're good at it 
But nothing hurts like an answer phone 
Drinking some, waking up alone! Maybe if I try just a little more 
I can take myself from this dirty flow 
And walk through buildings of elegance 
Just like you are intelligent, 
But still I fall from grace with this microphone 
How to find yourself if you never roam 
Certainly, I'm indebted, baby!. 
Certainly, certainly, yeah! 
I know my place but it don't know me 
I know my place but it don't know me 'Cause no one wants to hear that you're breaking up 
It wasn't long ago we said, "start me up!" 
Now all your dreaming' will have to wait 
While you discern, you'll anticipate. 
Play your forty five with this late at night 
Open all the windows, turn out the light 
Mysterious creatures will fill the room 
My midnight show just put on for you Maybe if I try just a little more 
I can take myself from this dirty flow 
And walk through buildings of elegance 
Just like you are intelligent, 
But still I fall from grace with this microphone 
How to find yourself if you never roam 
Certainly, I'm indebted, baby!. 
Certainly, certainly, yeah! 
I'm going my way, yeah 
You gonna, you gonna know me 
I'm going my way, yeah 
You're going, going
