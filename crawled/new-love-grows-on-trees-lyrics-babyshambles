Are you still talking to 
All of those dead film stars 
Like you used to 
And are you still thinking of 
All of those pretty rhymes 
And perfect crimes 
Like you used to love And if you're still alive 
When you're twenty five 
Shall I kill you like you asked me to 
If you're still alive 
When you're twenty five 
Shall I kill you I know you told me to 
But I really don't want to I remember all of the thing-things said to me 
Until ... calvary 
Ah you said, you said new love grows on trees 
New love grows on trees 
New love grows on... new love grows on trees Are you still shaking out 
All the dead wood from your bed love 
Well times don't change and you're still thinking of 
All of those pretty rhymes for love divine 
Oh no, you really don't have to 
If you're still alive 
When you're twenty five 
Shall I kill you 
Oh I know you asked me to 
But I really don't want to
