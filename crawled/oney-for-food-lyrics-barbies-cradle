Too-di-di-doo... Too-di-di-doo... 
Too-di-di-doo... Too-di-di-doo... 
Too-di-di-doo... Too-di-di-doo... 
Too-di-di-doo... Doo-doo... Someone's knockin' at the door 
But I'm too lazy for a political conversation 
What now you know that I can't hear 
What all the masses here and there like to buy 
And you can't... Sing all you like... 
Sing all you like... 
Sing all 'cause people still need money for food Too-di-di-doo... Too-di-di-doo... 
Too-di-di-doo... Too-di-di-doo... 
Too-di-di-doo... Too-di-di-doo... 
Too-di-di-doo... Doo-doo... Maybe I should stay in school 
And learn to make a living 
Selling some things that I don't love 
And maybe singing is a luxury 
And when you can't afford it someday 
It's possible you'll starve 
If you will... Sing all you like... 
Sing all you like... 
Sing all 'cause people still need money... If you happen to see me on the street 
Would you please give me coins and a drink Sing all you like... (4x) 
Sing all you... 
Like... (sing all you like) (4x) 
Cause people still need people 
Who have money to give 
Money for food Too-di-di-doo... Too-di-di-doo... 
Too-di-di-doo... Too-di-di-doo... 
Too-di-di-doo... Too-di-di-doo... 
Too-di-di-doo... Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo...
