I was looking for a better day 
To say things really I don't understand 
To someone, to no one, in some way I was looking for a better way 
to live a life when all seems to be gone 
to someone, to somewhere, to nowhere You have just gone too far 
You have taken too much of mine 
All that really matters now for you 
Is that really no one has a clue All that really matters now for you 
Is that really no one has a clue Nothing is supposed to be like this 
And I'm not here to build your golden dreams 
It's over, it's over, it's over I thought I could have a better day 
But I'm not here to stand another game 
It's over, it's over, it's over You have just gone too far 
You have taken too much of mine 
All that really matters now for you 
Is that really no one has a clue
