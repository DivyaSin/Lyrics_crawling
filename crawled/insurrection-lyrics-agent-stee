Do they lie to you? 
Are their, are their fingers bloody? 
If you asked questions would you 
Feel the fool? Mass acceptance, feeds the 
Flame of propaganda 
Do we trust them or are 
We their tools? Painting pictures watch them 
With their bloody fingers 
Smear the message 
In our supple minds Are you sure you're thinking? 
Are you sure you're seeing? 
Would you know the truth? 
And could you smell a lie? Conscious 
And the world is dreaming 
The dream is death 
The dream is death Official words are spoken 
Do you, do you hear the message? 
Brace yourselves they say 
So you try When the time comes soon now 
Will you wear their colors? 
Will your blood spill for them 
Or will you realize? Conscious 
And the world is dreaming 
Freedom 
Demands an equal price I'll fight, I'll fight 
In an insurrection 
You'll taste the steel of the back of my hand 
I'm not dying slowly I'll fight, I'll fight 
In an insurrection 
None are free with a king in the land 
And I'll fight forever And the Gods are sworn to treason 
Let the battle rage until the world is free of chains 
When the wicked fall, may the clouds roar in triumph 
And the lightning laugh as it basks in their shame So your Gods are sworn to treason 
So the battle rage until the world is free of chains 
When the wicked fall, may the clouds roar in triumph 
And the lightning laugh as it basks in their shame I'll fight, I'll fight 
For an insurrection 
I'll fight, I'll fight 
For an insurrection I'll fight, I'll fight 
For an insurrection 
I'll fight, I'll fight 
For an insurrection
