I can't stand this feeling when you turn and look my way 
Make my day then look away for someone better 
And if I could I'd show you how it feels to be insane 
I'd break your heart and put it back together 
I would Love you out of your mind 
Love you out of your mind 
I would take you up to the top 
Make you start all over Love you out of your mind 
Drag you down to that fine line 
Never stop until I love you 
Out of your mind Can't stand to leave but I know you can't stand to be alone 
Look me in the eye and tell me you don't want me 
Let me hold your hand and touch your heart and take you home 
I will show you just what happens when you touch me Love you out of your mind 
Love you out of your mind 
I would take you up to the top 
Make you start all over Love you out of your mind 
Drag you down to that fine line 
Never stop until I love you 
Out of your mind Break your heart and put it back together 
I would Love you out of your mind 
Love you out of your mind 
I would take you up to the top 
Make you start all over Love you out of your mind 
Drag you down to that fine line 
Never stop until I love you 
Out of your mind
