Huh, yeah, woo 
Hey, yeah, huh 
Hoo, yeah 
Uh-huh, yeah Clock strikes upon the hour 
And the sun begins to fade 
Still enough time to figure out 
How to chase my blues away 
I've done alright up to now 
It's the light of day 
That shows me how 
And when the night falls 
Loneliness calls Oh, wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat 
With somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat 
With somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me I've been in love 
And lost my senses 
Spinning through the town 
Sooner or later the fever ends 
And I wind up feeling down 
I need a man 
Who'll take a chance 
On a love that burns 
Hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart calls Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat 
With somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat 
With somebody 
Yeah, wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me Somebody, somebody, oo 
Somebody who loves me, yeah 
Somebody oo Somebody oo 
To hold me in his arms oh 
I need a man 
Who'll take a chance 
On a love that burns 
Hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart calls Oh, wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat 
With somebody 
Yeah wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh, wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat 
With somebody 
Yeah 
Wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me Hoo, hoo, dance
