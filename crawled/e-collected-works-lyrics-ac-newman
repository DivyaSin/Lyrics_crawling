There was a tempest roaring in the deep blues 
There just to put the revolution in you 
We compared the cost of the war 
With walking into a wall Though we saw you coming, including me 
The empty bottles of coup d'etat at your feet 
You repeat the same free advice 
The kind of entrance you'd have 
Expected from the collected works of excess And you have defended the chemistry of the divine 
But careful walls of conversation aside 
A beat too late and it's gone 
A twist on natural law Then you arrive with an impact rising size 
Sealed, delivered, a gift to the magi sign 
To my old friend anew 
Who dropped in recently 
Unexpected from the collected works of excess
