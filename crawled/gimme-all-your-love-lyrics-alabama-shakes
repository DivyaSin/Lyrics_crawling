So much is going on 
But you can always come around 
Why don't you sit with me for just a little while? 
Tell me, what's wrong? If you just gimme all your love 
Gimme all you got, baby 
Gimme all your love 
Bit more So tell me what you wanna do 
You say to [?] that doesn't fit with you 
Why don't you talk to me for just a little while? 
I can only try to make it right If you just gimme all your love 
Gimme all you got, baby 
Gimme all your love
