Tell me baby 
Are you coming over or do I need to go back to sleep? 
This scene is utter chaos 
You're driving me crazy with all the little secrets you keep 
This name means nothing to me 
All I ever needed 
All I ever wanted was you 
Take a look outside your window 
I'm watching closely 
I see everything that you do. Are you coming 
Are you coming with me? 
Are you coming 
Coming home with me 
Are you coming with me? 
Are you coming 
Are you coming with me? 
Are you coming 
Coming home with me I just wanna be anyone you need 
I just wanna breathe the air you breathe so deep 
When will you see you're the one for me? 
You know you really need to come home with me Every night after dark the beast comes out to feed 
Feel the wrath of standing still 
No more hogging the window 
I'm coming out and I'm needing to feed 
Let me play you that endnote Tell me baby 
Are you coming over or do I need to go back to sleep 
This scene is utter chaos 
You're driving me crazy with all the little secrets you keep 
This name means nothing to me 
All I ever needed 
All I ever wanted was you 
Take a look out your window 
I'm watching closely I see everything that you do I want you to feel me in you 
If you only knew revealing the truth 
Can it be seen this change in me? 
One last goodbye 
Kissing you goodnight I'll pave the way through to better days 
Forget today 
There seems to be no other way 
One thing I'll say is that I know all things will break 
Your trying hard 
You come off like a fake 
Stars fall 
Please do your best to soften up their landing.
