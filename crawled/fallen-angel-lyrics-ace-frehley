I know you've been up 
I've seen you flyin' 
Sometimes I'd wish 
That you would fall down I'm tired of your act 
You're not even tryin' 
Any dreams of hope 
Are dashed all away I'll take you down, so you can see 
Take you down, what you've done to me 
Take you down, you're wanted by all below Ooh, fallen angel 
Ooh, fallen angel Many times alone 
I've been here waiting 
And many times again 
I could not care less But you've got a hold 
And deep down I'm shakin' 
I won't let you make 
A fool out of me I'll take you down, so you can see 
Take you down, what you've done to me 
Take you down, you're wanted by all below Ooh, fallen angel 
Ooh, fallen angel Ooh, fallen angel 
Ooh, fallen angel 
Ooh, fallen angel 
Ooh, fallen angel Ooh, fallen angel 
Ooh, fallen angel
