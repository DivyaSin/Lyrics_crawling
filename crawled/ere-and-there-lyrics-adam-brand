Here, here is where I was born 
My father's son 
In the heart of the country Here I got my family tree 
Deep down in me Still growing strong But there, there are those city lights 
Shining bright 
Calling me And there is where I got to go 
Or I'll never know 
Who I can be Sometime between now and then 
I'll find my way back home 
But until you see me walking 
Down that long and dusty road 
I'll be somewhere between here and there Here I've got a world I know 
It may be slow 
But it's true And her I got my Ann-Marie 
She needs me 
And I need her too But there, there are those city lights 
Shining bright 
Calling me And though it's more that I can bear 
I've got to go 
Cause my dreams are there
