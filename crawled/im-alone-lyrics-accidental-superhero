far from washed away 
five steps from yesterday 
lonely lonely's gone away 
deep down in disarray 
all the hope that's gone today 
breathing life in eloquence don't feed me 
i won't wash away all the world is dancing 
and i'm alone 
leave me alone 
i'm alone all the world is dancing 
and i'm alone 
leave me alone 
i'm alone deep down in disarray 
no one to carry me 
freedom feeding everything 
bring down the enemy 
reap the seeds that seem to be 
breathing breathing life in me don't feed me 
i won't wash away 
don't feed me 
i won't wash away all the world is dancing 
and i'm alone 
leave me alone 
i'm alone all the world is dancing 
and i'm alone 
leave me alone 
i'm alone
