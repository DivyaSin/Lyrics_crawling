What will I be years from now 
What will I wear, how will I look 
I think too much, I think too much Sometimes it's scary over thinking 
What you have or haven't done 
You think too much, you think too much Will the rain smell the same 
Will our loosing treacherous game 
And the star much shine 
The colours seem so blurry 
Will I end up all alone 
Without a shoulder to cry on What will I be years from now 
I have answered them but none have answered me 
And when my time has come 
I hope my last seconds in this life will have you 
Will have you
