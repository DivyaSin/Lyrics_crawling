Close your eyes with me, start imagining 
A world full of love 
We can change the stars with our hands and hearts 
Make them shine on us 
But no, no, don't worry darlin' 
They won't stop staring, but soon they'll be caring 
Come from near and far with their hands and hearts 
Cuz it's time to stand up Oh the world is changing 
And all I am saying 
Is you gotta believe 
I'm a drop of water 
but you know together 
we're the ocean deep The time is always right to open up your eyes 
And be the flickering flame 
We can light the corners, shine through all the borders 
Deep down we are the same 
But no, no, don't worry darlin' 
They won't stop staring, but soon they'll be caring
