He tried to tell you it was over so many times 
You kept convincing yourself that he would change his mind 
You never thought that love could do this to you and him 
You thought that it was supposed to be innocent 
You gave him everything and more that you had to give 
Three shining faces that will never fade 
So tell me what it's like to be on his own again 
He makes it look like it's easy but I've heard 
That one before No place for tears 
You're giving him everything 
All or nothing 
No pain, no gain 
Now you can chase your dreams 
Chase your dreams He ??? so we can tell him down the phone 
??? 
You feel as if you loose a something that wants was yours (?) 
No one could ever take away what belongs to you 
If you don't want to choose the choice will be made for you 
It doesn't matter what he decides to do 
He's working ??? you'll have to find your way 
If you don't ?? your life you gave it all away No place for tears 
You're giving him everything 
All or nothing 
No pain, no gain 
Now you can chase your dreams 
Chase your dreams He lost you while he was trying to find himself 
It's nothing new, I see it happening all the time 
So tell me, tell me, has he found what he's looking for 
He had the icing on the cake and he wants some more 
I know it's not been easy making it on your own 
Don't let it get you down, were here, you're not alone 
You've got your girls, what love, they'll always be by your side 
The grass has always been greener on the other side No place for tears 
You're giving him everything 
All or nothing 
No pain, no gain 
Now you can chase your dreams 
Chase your dreams No place for tears 
You're giving him everything 
All or nothing 
No pain, no gain 
Now you can chase your dreams 
Chase your dreams
