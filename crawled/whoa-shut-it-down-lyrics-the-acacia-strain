I'm so sick of the fights, so sick of your mouth - I know where you live and I see where you sleep. 
So let's settle this here and now, I'm not wasting away my life because you don't like what I have to say. 
Sorry I'm not just like you. 
Who are you again? 
Remind me, because I don't care. 
I hope you like this; I really hope you do. 
I hope you like it as much as getting your face busted in with a hammer. 
You are done destroying lives. 
Everyone will suffer. 
I have given up on you. 
So who the fuck do you think you are? 
You will learn to breathe through a straw. 
So do as the world a favor; pull your bottom lip over your face and swallow. 
I don't mean any disrespect, but I hope you are buried alive. 
Your world is about to come crashing down. 
Everyone will suffer.
