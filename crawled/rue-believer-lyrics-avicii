I wasn't always the brightest, 'till I learn how to dance 
You got me thinking love will come around but you never gave me a chance 
A pride I've been the tallest, 'till I learn how to jump 
You got me thinking love will come around but you never say I'm the one If I could make you, make you fall in love with me 
If I could make you, make you fall in love 
Wish I could make you, make you fall in love 
Baby love will come around if you want it enough 
Baby love will come around if you want it enough Love will come around Baby love will come around 
I wasn't always the brightest, they say you only live once 
So, you got me thinking, I'm so glad I found you 
Life's what you make it, so here it comes, we go If I could make you, make you fall in love with me 
If I could make you, make you fall in love 
Wish I could make you, make you fall in love 
Baby love will come around if you want it enough 
Baby love will come around if you want it enough If you're a true believer 
If you're a true believer 
Love will come around
