She keeps looking up and says, 
"The sky is assembling an army." 
I hold her closer and push her hair out of her face. 
"There's nothing to fear unless 
they start shooting." 
And I remember why this cold was worth your kisses. "Don't you think it's a pretty night to watch your own breath?" 
So I open my mouth and blow into the frost 
to let out all the ghosts.
