Prodigia, comploratus 
Silens, oro 
Regnet exitium Days of warning 
Night brings morning 
My prayers worthless 
Heaven is burning down I walk stricken 
Pitch black vision 
Oh one, save me 
Caress my weary eyes Darkest Lord 
Your mercy shall I gain 
Strike the match 
Engulf the earth in flames In flames 
In flames 
In flames Nature quaking 
Prophets aching 
I kneel faithful 
Damnation cracks the sky My heart fiction 
Superstition 
Your grace deathless 
Give life to my last breath Darkest Lord 
Your mercy shall I gain 
Strike the match 
Engulf the Earth in flames In flames 
In flames 
In flames Prodigia, comploratus 
Silens, oro 
Regnet, exitium Rise from ashes 
Violence clashes my soul vacant 
Cleanse me of all this sin I stand guilty 
I bleed filthy 
Born of fire 
Savor this final hour Darkest Lord 
Your mercy shall I gain 
Strike the match 
Engulf the Earth in flames In flames 
In flames 
In flames
