Silver chairs stuck in your mind 
you fall back into 
Every time it leaves you tired 
Wait to will and walk 
This is the side unforgetting 
and I'm better without you 
Safe to say I'm lost in the feeling 
Feeling we're too small Wherever we go, to the end of the road 
Wherever we go, we are gold 
Whoah When I'm there stuck in your mind, 
You crawl back into 
Every time it leaves you tired 
Wait to will or walk 
This is the side unforgetting 
and I don't know where to begin 
Safe to say I'm lost in the feeling 
Feeling we're too small Wherever we go, to the end of the road 
Wherever we go, we are gold 
Whoah This is the side unforgetting 
and I'm better without you 
Safe to say I'm lost in the feeling Wherever we go, to the end of the road 
Wherever we go, we are gold 
Whoah 
Wherever we go, to the end of the road 
Wherever we go, we are gold 
Whoah
