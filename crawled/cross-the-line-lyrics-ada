(Chorus) 
It is my destiny 
It is a truth I see 
In this world I find 
A way to CROSS THE LINE (Verse 1) 
Everybody's doin' what everybody's doin' 
Everybody's doin' the same thing 
I'll be doin' what i'll be doin' 
I'll be doin' my thing 
The world spins round, to the right they say 
I'll be spinin' the other way 
Doin' what i can 
Doin' what i know 
The world's my stage and I'm the show! (Chorus) 
It is my destiny 
It is a truth I see 
In this world I find 
A way to CROSS THE LINE 
No possibility 
Originality 
Don't be left behind 
Go ahead and CROSS THE LINE (Verse 2) 
They say yes 
I say no 
Tellin' me to stay 
I'm gonna go 
Me gotta be who me gotta be 
I gotta be who i gotta BE! (Chorus) 
It is my destiny 
It is a truth I see 
In this world I find 
A way to CROSS THE LINE 
No possibility 
Originality 
Don't be left behind 
Go ahead and CROSS THE LINE (Verse 3) 
For the souls of those who don't know 
Step on the line and be your own 
Listen to the voice of spirits free 
Start a new life and fly with ME (ME) (Chorus) 
It is my destiny 
It is a truth I see 
In this world I find 
A way to CROSS THE LINE 
No possibility 
Originality 
Don't be left behind 
Go ahead and CROSS THE LINE (Bridge) 
It is my destiny 
It is a truth I see 
It is my destiny 
A way to CROSS THE LINE 
It is my destiny 
It is a truth I see 
It is my destiny 
A way to CROSS THE LINE
