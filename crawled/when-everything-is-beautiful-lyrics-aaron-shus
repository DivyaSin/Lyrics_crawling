Take my ashes 
Take my dirt 
And clay 
Take my pride and strip it all away 
Take my mourning, take my doubt 
And fear 
Say the word's I long to hear Though your sin's, were as scarlet 
They will be, as white as snow 
Though they were red, red as crimson 
They will be like wool 
When everything is beautiful Everything I tried too hide 
All the games I've been playin' 
Every secret, every lie 
All the shame I've been claiming 
Come and whisper in my ear 
And say the word's I long to hear Though your sin's were as scarlet 
They will be, as white as snow 
Though they were red, red as crimson 
They will be like wool 
When everything is beautiful I'm alive with a hope of a brand new day 
Oh oh whoa 
I'm alive with the hope of a brand new day Though your sin's were as scarlet 
They've become as white as snow 
Though they were red, red as crimson 
They've be like wool Though your sin's were as scarlet 
They've become as white as snow 
Though they were red, red as crimson 
They've be like wool And everything is beautiful 
Everything is beautiful
