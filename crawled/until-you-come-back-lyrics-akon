[Intro:] 
Going crazy my heart is breaking 
I can't sleep at all 
Trying to get throught this 
Don't know how I'll do this 
I know that I only got my self to blame (only got myself to blame) 
But that doesnt help to ease the pain (doesnt help to ease the pain) 
I'll just die if I can't see your face [Chorus:] 
Until you come back 
I can't breath 
Until you come back 
I got no reason 
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees 
I still need you beside me [Verse 1:] 
Now it's morning 
Your still gone and 
I still reach for you (still reach for you) 
Don't know how to 
Live without you 
I wish, I can take back all the hurt I've caused 
(take back all the hurt I've caused) 
If I could give back all the love I lost 
(give back all the love I lost) 
The price I pay is just to high of a cost yeah [Chorus:] 
Until you come back 
I can't breath 
Until you come back 
I got no reason 
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees 
I still need you beside me [Verse 2:] 
Please forgive me (forgive me) 
If we had one more chance in your life (one more chance in your life) 
Till your with me 
I'll be half a life until you come back (back back) [Chorus:] 
Until you come back 
I can't breath 
Until you come back 
I got no reason 
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees 
Cause I need you beside me [Chorus:] 
Until you come back 
I can't breath 
Until you come back 
I got no reason 
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees 
I still need you beside beside beside beside me
