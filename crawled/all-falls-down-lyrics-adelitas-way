I knew I should have savored every moment 
I wish I would have grabbed tight and just hold in I know, I know everything's wrong 
Let go, let go, now I'm gone When it all falls down 
And you know 
There's no way that you can get out (x2) I know I should have cherished every second 
I step back, step back to another perspective 
And in my mind, my mind I know it's been long 
It's a feeling you've got, you're feeling so cold When it all falls down 
And you know 
There's no way that you can get out (x2) I don't want to feel like this will never be over 
And I don't want to sit and think about what's going wrong 
I don't want to feel like this will never be over 
Cause it feels like I've been falling for so damn long When it all falls down 
And you know 
There's no way that you can get out (x2) (All falls down 
And you know 
There's no way you can get out) When it all falls down
