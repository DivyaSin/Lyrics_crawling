Your smile as it widens on your face 
Is like a child running off across the hills 
And I love your smile as I love my own 
And I love your smile Your hair riding down around your ears 
Has never been more beautiful than now 
And I love your hair as I love my own 
And I love your hair Your body, moving down to mine 
Is like the coupling of the pale November clouds 
And I love your body as I love my own 
And I love your body and it's part of my own
