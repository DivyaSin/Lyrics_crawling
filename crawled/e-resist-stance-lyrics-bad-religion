Seeds of rebellion lay outside your front door 
If you nourish them and water them they'll grow into a healthy what for? 
And if revolution isn't what's in store 
How can you care anymore? It's a dangerous slip, 
A conscientious shift 
In the spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip 
Lest the state of your resolve makes you quickly devolve to a fundamentalist You're an archetype, 
That they can pin to the wall 
As you cling to all convictions like a farm animal in its stall 
Never thinking of the bigger world outside 
As they take you for a ride It's a dangerous slip, 
A conscientious shift 
In the spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip 
Because passion unabated will be readily conflated with belligerence It's a dangerous slip, 
A conscientious shift 
The spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip 
And the verdict won't be kind 'cuz they're desperate for a viable alternative Take a stance. The Resist stance. 
Take a stance. The Resist stance. 
Take a stance. The Resist stance. 
Take a stance. The Resist stance.
