(Interlude) 
- Mo' than a man, I been died and rose again 
Fast life, slow motion, these days 
- Well I've been out walkin' 
I don't do that much talkin' these days 
- I gotta stop smokin' cigarettes 
- These days, these days I seem to think a lot 
About the things that I fo'got to do 
And all the times I had the chance to 
- Yo, how the fuck my new girl got me jealous of otha girls 
I think I live in anotha world 
- And I have a luva 
But it's so hard to risk anotha 
These days 
- These days 
- These days 
- Aye, he wrote this shit when he was sixteen he said 
I'm twenty seve, this is like my whole life 
This 
- Now if I seem to be afraid 
To live the life that I have made in time 
- You know all I like to do is keep it real 
Solo... hoe 
- Well it's just that I have been losin' 
- Can I win one time 
- So long 
- Yeah, its that pain you was talkin' about 
Can I win one time (Verse) 
So many pills I should've slipped already 
My lungs the same color as my lips already 
Expensive clothes, insufficient funds 
Me & my bros switchin' hoes just fo' fun 
The money and bitches is all we care about 
Very far from home if you worried about my whereabouts 
Chasing the light at the end of the fuckin' tunnel 
Pray fo' Sydney, send Tia a text, tell her I luv you 
The devil is a lie, neva let him persevere 
God took my angel, and left me here, it's happy here (Interlude) 
- Well I will keep on movin', movin' on 
Things are bound to be improvin' these days 
- It's long term, this shit real 
- I luv these days 
- It will all make sense one day my nigga 
I even been on songs with Common 
It's crazy 
- These days I'll sit on corner stones 
- Can't stop me my nigga, yeah 
- Count the time and Quarter Jones today, my friends 
Don't confront me with my faith! 
- Can't achieve success without failure, babe 
- I have not fo'got to mend (Verse 2) 
Diggin' fo' gold in these Codeine bottles 
Tryna picture potential in these Instagram models (like) 
Information racin' around the internet 
Befo the iPad was invented, I had a pad of writtens 
Smokin' a cig on the side of the house 
Tryna figure it out 
The axe didn't cut it, moms told me cut it out 
Clem told me always take pride in my work 
I clutch the mic with blessed hands at all my concerts 
Why his name Solo, how is he so smart 
We can see his 4 footprints in the sand when he walk 
I like to refer to myself in 3rd person from the 3rd person 
That's a outta body experience of self 
So I can see me fo' me and no one else 
Don't need to see a Em-E, award or no jail 
I'm at them like a cell, I just wanna be free 
All this chatter from the chattel nigga 
I don't speak sheep, this TDE and nothing beyond that 
Told Du Dog I don't even need to read the contract! 
Yeah, as if some legal documents can stop me 
Legalize, legal lies, legal eyes, oh I see 
I did it while you were sittin' wishin' 
Ask my nigga DZA 
All my verses hearses leavin' churches 
Not the cheap chicken 
And I luv the Beast Coast 
But what about the best one 
Whats your life without a soul 
A dead one 
Yeah Mac, you ain't got bars like that Mac
