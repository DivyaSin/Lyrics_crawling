We work in the factories and the fields 
Assembly lines and coal mines and the steel mills 
That's what we do but there's more to us than that 
If you want to know who we are it's on the logos of our caps We're Mountaineers, volunteers 
We're the tide that rolls, we're Seminoles 
We're a herd of Longhorn steers 
We drive Ford and Chevrolet 
Shoot twenty-four and eighty-eight 
We crank up our music Friday nights 
On two thousand country stations 
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right We might fix your water pump, your AC 
Bring your apple pie, and fill your glass of tea 
Take that Fedex package to your door 
But underneath that apron or that uniform We're Wild Cats, Wolverines 
We're Tigers, Buckeyes, Bruins 
Bulldogs, Hogs, and Hurricanes 
We pray before we race 
Cheer fourteen and forty-eight 
We drink ice-cold beer on Friday nights 
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right We're all across the map 
Down city streets and old dirt roads 
We're the fabric of this nation 
And we're a nation all our own We're Mountaineers, we're volunteers 
We're Devils, Heels, and Rebels 
Fighting Irish and Cavaliers 
We soup up our Chevrolets 
Cheer twenty-four and eighty-eight 
And we crank up the same songs Friday night 
On two thousand country stations 
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right
