When you find yourself 
In some far off place 
And it causes you 
To rethink some things 
You start to sense 
That slowly you're becoming someone else 
And then you find yourself When you make new friends 
In a brand new town 
And you start to think 
About settling down 
The things that would have been lost on you 
Are now clear as a bell 
And you find yourself 
That's when you find yourself Well you go through life 
So sure of where you're heading 
And you wind up lost 
And it's the best thing that could happen 
'Cause sometimes when you lose your way 
It's really just as well 
'Cause you find yourself 
That when you find yourself When you meet the one 
You've been waiting for 
And she's everything 
That you want and more 
You look at her 
And you finally start 
To live for someone else 
And then you find yourself 
That's when you find yourself
