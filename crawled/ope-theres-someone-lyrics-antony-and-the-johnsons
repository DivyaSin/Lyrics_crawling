Hope there's someone 
Who'll take care of me 
When I die, will I go Hope there's someone 
Who'll set my heart free 
Nice to hold when I'm tired There's a ghost on the horizon 
When I go to bed 
How can I fall asleep tonight 
How will I rest my head And Godsend 
I don't want to go 
To seals of shame! 
There's a ghost on the horizon 
When I go to bed Oh I'm scared of the middle place 
Between light and nowhere 
I don't want to be the one 
Left in there, left in there There's a man on the horizon 
Wish that I'd go to bed 
If I fall to his feet tonight 
Will allow rest my head So here's hoping I will not drown 
Or paralyze in light 
And godsend I don't want to go 
To the sea's watershed Hope there's someone 
Who'll take care of me 
When I die, Will I go Hope there's someone 
Who'll set my heart free 
Nice to hold when I'm tired
