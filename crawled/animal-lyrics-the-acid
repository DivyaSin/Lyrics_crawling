Woo-oo-oo Woo-oo-oo-ooooo (x4) I need your love 
Pushing on my pride 
I want your touch 
Pressing on my hide Tell me, animal 
Call it what you want 
Push me in a ball 
Tearing at the walls Woo-oo-oo Woo-oo-oo-ooooo (x4) Oh now come on 
Put it on my pride 
Taste like a storm 
Let it come, it come Tell me, animal 
Call it what you want 
Push me in a ball 
Tearing at the walls Woo-oo-oo Woo-oo-oo-ooooo (x4) 
I need your love 
Pushing on my pride Tell me, animal 
Call it what you want 
Push me in a ball 
Tearing at the walls I need your love
