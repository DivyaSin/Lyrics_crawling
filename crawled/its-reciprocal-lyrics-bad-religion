Hoarding turns allure to discontent altruism's a grind 
All it's own morning makes you know your in a cell 
But love is just as pure as you both because it's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal it's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal when true love is metaphysical Venal desires we learn to beset you 
And me we've got a special thing 
But I want you to never forget it's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal it's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal each bedtime I stir with regret guilty and vain, 
Hoping for retribution charity's immune from my demands 
I don't expect a thing from the weak but you my love are measured 
And compared predisposed to my profane decree it's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal it's reciprocal, it's reciprocal
