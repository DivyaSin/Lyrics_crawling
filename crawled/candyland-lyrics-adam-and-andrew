We are 
Watching Cartoons 
Your mom 
Won't be home too soon 
What's left 
Which your made to do 
Is to strip down 
And play doctor with you And I know 
That its a sin 
But I just can't help myself 
I know 
You're only ten 
But you look like you're twelve And if you want love 
We'll make it 
Say its against the law 
But We'll break it 
Your too young for it to feel good 
But you can fake it 
And i'll buy you an icecream cone I wanna play some candyland 
With you 
Wanna draw you a bath and get in it too 
I wanna play some candyland I'll pick you up from school 
With glitter in your hair 
Piggy back rides into the pool 
You can give me your shoe 
And i'll show you how to tie it 
Your mom will never tuck you in 
Without me hiding in your closet You want love 
We'll make it 
Say its against the law 
But we'll break it 
Too young for it to feel good 
But you can fake it 
And if you do a good job I'll take you out to disney land 
Its true 
I'll play with all your toys 
If you play with mine too 
I'll take you out to disney land Damn Baby 
Your mother hates me 
But we can make her a necklace with string and Macoroni 
We can go in a room 
And ride my little pony [Talking and Laughing] I wanna play some candyland 
With you 
Wanna draw you a bath and get in it too 
But during all the time I'll still be true 
I just wanna play some candyland Here come the da's
