Would you go with the babbling brook / All the way to the sea / Would you go with the whispering wind / Disappear silently 
With no goodbyes / Leave it behind / Closing your eyes / In a cool moonlight / Telling no one / Steal on your way / Into the night / Vanish away 
Would you go with the babbling brook / All the way to the sea / Would you go with the breeze in the night / Over cities and lakes / Would you die and be born again / Just before the dawn breaks 
There's a luminous passage so bright and so cold / Apples of silver / Dawning with gold / Lighting the candles / For the love of your god / I am three times wise / In a hail of blood 
One is the pain / One keeps me sane / One is the blessing and curse all the same 
All the same
