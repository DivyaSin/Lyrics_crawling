Dear Angie, just these lines to confirm something you may know 
Dear Angie, please excuse the writing, it's my nerves, you know 
When you caught your train today 
You took my heart and soul away 
I can't wait 'til Friday night 
To see you, touch you, hold you tight 
Dear Angie, how's your folks and relatives? 
I hope they're well 
Dear Angie, I'm spending my vacation at that same hotel 
I've known you now for one whole year 
There's something I've not told you, dear 
Turned a blind eye for too long 
This letter proves that I've been wrong 
Ba ba da, oooooooh 
Ba ba da, oooooooh 
I've known you now for one whole year 
There's something I've not told you, dear 
Turned a blind eye for too long 
This letter proves that I've been wrong 
Dear Angie, I've beat about the bush, it's time I spoke my mind 
Dear Angie, It's been a long time coming, guess I've been unkind 
Dear Angie, the writing's on the wall 
Dear Angie, I love you, you're my all 
Guess that's all.
