Lately, I've been thinking bout you. 
Baby, you don't know what I'm going through. 
But every time, when I look at your face, 
I forget about all my problems, baby, cause you lighten up my days Bridge1 
Cause whenever I'm with you it feels so right 
that's why i ask you this one question, girl, 
won't you please be mine [chorus] 
Cause I'm fallin' for you 
Girl, you're the one I choose 
whatever you ask, I'll do 
Cause I care so much about you You're always on my mind 
I need you to be by my side 
I want you to be mine, oh mine 
For all time So beautiful are those sparkling eyes 
So wonderful; with you i'll never ever cry 
I want you to know, you're the one I'll always treasure 
how else can I show that we've got something special Bridge2 
Girl I know this may be hard to understand. 
That's why I ask of you one chance to let me be your man [chorus] 
Cause I'm fallin' for you 
Girl, you're the one I choose 
whatever you ask, I'll do 
Cause I care so much about you You're always on my mind 
I need you to be by my side 
I want you to be mine, oh mine Girl I know this may be hard to understand. 
That's why I ask of you one chance to let me be your man 
Cause whenever I'm with you it feels so right 
that's why i ask you this one question, girl, 
won't you please be mine [chorus] x2 
Cause I'm fallin' for you 
Girl, you're the one I choose 
whatever you ask, I'll do 
Cause I care so much about you You're always on my mind 
I need you to be by my side 
I want you to be mine, oh mine 
For all time You're always on my mind 
I need you to be by my side 
I want you to be mine, oh mine 
For all time
