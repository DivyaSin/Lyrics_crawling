I pulled into Memphis, I could not slow down 
My brakes were gone, I wrecked the car...fire on the ground 
Then my car exploded and the flames licked my chin 
And my life flashed before my eyes like an X-rated film 
Like a poison arrow my soul shot through the sky 
Landed there at heaven's gate, much to my surprise 
And an angel with a halo walked up and said, "Hey, dude! 
Welcome to Heaven...we've got this glass of milk for you." 
(Chorus) 
I said, "Hey St. Peter, won't you open up your gate... 
I hear the Devil calling, now please don't make me late. 
He's got loud guitars, alcohol, cheap Jamaican whores... 
I don't want to stay in Heaven no more." Well, Satan came a-running, said, "Hey, that boy is mine!" 
He had a John Hiatt T-Shirt and trouble in his eye 
Then the Devil on Cloud 7 and St. Peter on Cloud 4 
Played a hand of poker, and the winner gets my soul Chorus Well the last thing I remember, Satan held two Jacks 
And I woke up in the back of a Memphis ambulance 
And I do not know for certain which cards St. Peter held 
So I'm breaking all ten commandments to make sure I go to Hell
