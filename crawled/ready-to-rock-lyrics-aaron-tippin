Well, I've done it every way they say it oughta be done 
But if I can't be me, well, it ain't much fun 
So I bowed out, said, "I gotta go 
Gotta crank it on up, I got to free my soul 
So it's back to my roots an' startin' today 
I'm ready to rock in a country kinda way Ready to rock all night long 
Yeah, ready to rock 'til the cows come home 
Well, it's the same ol' me, so don't be afraid 
I'm just ready to rock in a country kinda way This time I got a guitar that you gotta plug in 
An' a stack of screamin' amps twisted way past ten 
I'm havin' a ball an' to tell you the truth 
I'm back to makin' music like I always do 
I got Conway, Jones flowin' through my veins 
An' I'm ready rock in a country kinda way Ready to rock all night long 
Yeah, ready to rock 'til the cows come home 
Well, it's the same ol' me, so don't be afraid 
I'm just ready to rock in a country kinda way Hey, I don't think ol' Hank'd mind 
If I done it this way 
Ready to rock in a country kinda way Ready to rock all night long 
Yeah, I'm ready to rock 'til the cows come home 
Hey, it's the same ol' me, so don't be afraid 
I'm just a-ready to rock, yeah, I'm ready to rock 
I'm ready to rock, rock, rock, rock 
In a country kinda way Now, ain't that pretty? 1, 2, 3, 4
