We had it so good, I thought we had it so right 
When I came home early one morning 
And another man's arms were holding you tight Now a young girl cries herself to sleep 
'Cause her daddy ran away 
And she doesn't know when she'll see him again 
She's living from day to day Is that all there is to love? 
She finally turns and walk away 
Is that all there is to love? 
And face a little more everyday I can still remember lying in my mother's arms 
How it makes me feel so good 
Now all it is, is a memory 
'Cause it make me feel just like a child should Now an old man sits by the telephone 
Faded photos on the wall 
You see his wife died ten long years ago 
And his children never seemed to call Is that all there is to love? 
And she finally turn and walk away 
Is that all there is to love? 
And face a little more everyday Well, no, no, no, no, no 
Is that all there is to love? 
That's all there is to love 
I guess that's all there is 
Love, love, la la la la
