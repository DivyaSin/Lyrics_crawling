A couple of weeks ago now 
The kids had a big surprise. 
They turned on the cartoon network 
And couldn't believe their eyes. 
The animals on the cartoons 
Have left the screens and escaped 
They wandered the streets and they had 
Adopted their natural states. Wasn't it grand? 
Wasn't it great? 
When the cartoons 
All went to assume 
Their natural state Mickey Mouse felt his vertebrae snap 
With his head caught in a trap, 
Eating the cheese 
And full of disease 
In his natural state. The day they just all discarded 
Their anthropomorphic ways. 
They burst out the TV sets and 
They changed the way they behaved. 
Ermintrude the Cow was sorry 
When back in her natural state, 
Cos Damien Hurst had sliced her 
And put her up in the Tate. Their natural state, 
Their natural state. 
Don't be upset 
But most of them met 
A grizzly fate. Bugs Bunny spent his very last day 
In laboratoire Garnier 
Feeling a bit cross 
Testing out lip gloss 
In his natural state. 
His natural state. 
And Earthworm Jim 
Found himself in 
A fisherman's bait. Peter Rabbit and his friends 
Got hit by Mercedes Benz 
Like Mr Toad 
Found dead on the road 
In his natural state. 
His natural state Some of our friends 
Met quite sticky ends 
On restaurant plates. 
Daffy Duck met the end to his days 
With an aromatic glaze, 
Nice crispy skin 
And topped with Hoi Sin 
In his natural state. They wound up beaten, 
Chopped up and eaten 
In their natural state. Each cartoon critter 
Cooked in a fritter; 
Each animation 
Fried up like bacon 
When the cartoons 
Went to assume 
Their natural state.
