Saw you on the mountain an angel in disguise 
Then when you descended to rescue my life 
You made me believe in love as long as love's around I won't let you down 
Oh, I'll never let you down You taught me how to show it and it's deeper than the sea 
The amount of love I give you can't come close to what you give to me 
I want the world to know it 'til I'm buried in the ground I won't let you down 
I'll never let you down I won't let you down 
Oh yeah I'll never let you down 'Cos when I look in you eyes I'm hypnotized 
And everything I thought I'd realized goes out the window 
When you're by my side I'm in paradise 
Oh, what would I do if I lost you? I'd hang my head in shame 'cos I know if I lost you, baby 
I'd be the one to blame don't ever let me lose you 
'Cos as long as love's around I won't let you down 
I'll never let you down I won't let you down 
Oh no, I'll never let you down I won't let you down
