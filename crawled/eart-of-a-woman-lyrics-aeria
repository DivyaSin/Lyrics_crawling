you say you love her, so why bleed her dry? your words, they break her, and you wonder why. try a little harder, reach a little further, to love her. little whimpers echo by the pale moonlight, and teary eyes glisten, like stars up in the sky...you don't listen to her. try a little harder, reach a little further, try a little harder, to love her. your home will be where her heart is, the heart of a woman, you know. your home will be where her heart is, the heart of a woman, you know. it's in the heart, it's all in the heart, yeah.
