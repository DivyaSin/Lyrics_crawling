I can't feel nothing at all Drug market, sub-market 
Sometimes I wonder why I ever got in 
Blood market, love market 
Sometimes I wonder why they need me at all 
Zydrate comes in a little glass vial A little glass vial? 
A little glass vial 
And the little glass vial goes into the gun like a battery 
Hhh, hhh And the zydrate gun goes somewhere against your anatomy 
Hhh, hhh 
And when the gun goes off, it sparks 
And you're ready for surgery, surgery Graverobber, graverobber 
Sometimes I wonder why I even bother 
Graverobber, graverobber 
Sometimes I wonder why I need you at all And Amber Sweet is addicted to the knife 
Addicted to the knife? 
Addicted to the knife And addicted to the knife 
She needs a little help with the agony 
And a little help comes in a little glass vial In a gun pressed against her anatomy 
And when the gun goes off 
Ms. sweet is ready for surgery, surgery Graverobber, graverobber 
Sometimes I wonder why I need you at all It's clean, it's clear, it's pure 
It's what? 
It's rare, it takes you there It what? 
It takes you there 
It takes you there A little jump before the cut 
Why agonize? Anesthetize 
I can't feel nothing at all 'Cause surgery, 'cause surgery 
'Cause surgery is what she needs Is what I need, it's what I need 
To change inside, to change inside 
To feel alive Mag's contract's got some mighty fine print 
Some mighty fine print 
And that mighty fine print puts Mag in a mighty fine predicament 
If Mag up and splits, her eyes are forfeit And if Geneco and Rotti so will it 
Then a repo man will come 
And she'll pay for that surgery, surgery 
Surgery, surgery I can't feel nothing at all
