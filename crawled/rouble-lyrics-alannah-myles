When it comes to trouble 
I dont think twice 
When it comes to trouble 
Ive paid the price 
I ve let my guard down 
And I been caught 
There aint a lesson baby 
I aint been taught Comon trouble 
Ah hoo 
Im in trouble 
Ah ooh, hoo, hoo hoo 
I call 9, 1, 1, when Im in a fix 
When I need you baby I call 6, 6, 6, 
Im in trouble You might be the last 
You sure aint the first 
I could be the best for you baby 
Or I could be the worst 
If we let it slide 
Itd be a crying shame 
We got the same bad blood runnin through our veins Comon trouble 
Ah hoo 
Im in trouble 
Ah ooh, hoo, hoo hoo 
I call 9, 1, 1, when Im in a fix 
When I need you baby I call 6, 6, 6, 
Im in trouble
