[Chorus:] 
When the lights go down in the City 
And the sun shines on the bay 
I want to be there in my City 
Ooh, ooh So you think you're lonely 
Well my friend I'm lonely too 
I want to get back to my City by the bay 
Ooh, ooh It's sad, oh there's been mornings out on the road without you, 
Without your charms, 
Ooh, my, my, my [Chorus]
