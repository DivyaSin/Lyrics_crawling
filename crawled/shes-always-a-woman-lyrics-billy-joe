She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes 
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies 
And she only reveals what she wants you to see 
She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me 
She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you 
She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you 
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free Yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me 
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants 
She's ahead of her time 
Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in 
She just changes her mind And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden 
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding 
But she brings out the best and the worst you can be Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me 
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants 
She's ahead of her time 
Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in 
She just changes her mind
