There's a place, 
I think that you could take me there. 
If you only showed me where... 
Cause I've been waiting in despair 
If there's a need 
To lose my rights and change my name 
It is the creed 
Cause these rooms starts to feel the same If the fire comes too close, don't bother 
Cause the tides swallows one after another Sometimes your shadow 
And I will hold it by the hand 
Cause when darkness fell 
I picked it up and did first hand If the fire comes too close, don't bother 
Cause the tides swallows one after another 
If the freezing starts to win, don't bother 
Cause I'm your follower and you're my lover Picking up the card my lover 
Roll the curtains and the cover 
I will line up in your shadow 
Sweep the dirty road I follow Picking up the card my lover 
Roll the curtains and the cover 
I will line up in your shadow 
Sweep the dirty road I follow If the fire comes too close, don't bother 
Cause the tides swallows one after another 
If the freezing starts to limb, don't bother 
Cause I'm your follower and you're my lover
