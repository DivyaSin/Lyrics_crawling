Just give me five so I can step outside 
Or even give me three and I'll be satisfied 
But if you give me none at all 
You're gonna see me climb that wall 
And you know you're gonna see me fall 
I can't take it Take all the nights that a man can give 
And make all the days so a man can live 
But if you take up every hour 
You're gonna take up all my power 
And you know you're gonna turn me sour 
I can't take it, no I can't take it, wooo 
I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it, wooo 
Place a lock upon my door Give me all your money in your dark, brown vase 
You've even got my soul in your dark, brown case 
But baby, can't you see outside? 
You know you've got my fingers tied 
And you know you're gonna hurt my pride 
I can't take it, no I can't take it, wooo 
I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it, wooo 
Place a lock upon my door I can't take it, wooo 
I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it, wooo 
Place a lock upon my door I can't take it, wooo 
I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it, wooo 
Place a lock upon my door I can't take it, wooo 
I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it, wooo 
Place a lock upon my door I can't take it, wooo 
I can't take it
