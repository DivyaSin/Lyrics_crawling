Unemployment life on the dole 
No work for me no work at all 
City and slums and poverty too 
Hanging about with nothing to do 
Go on back now nobody cares 
Just carry on with their own affairs 
And when someone else starts something bad 
Remember the trouble they've always had No red tape, no red book 
Eamon Andrews don't give a - 
Boredom boredom in your minds 
Hey you punks this is your life
