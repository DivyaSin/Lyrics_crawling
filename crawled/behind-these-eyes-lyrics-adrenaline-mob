You ever feel like you've lost yourself 
Hiding behind a life that never found you 
You've always lived your life just like you were someone else You never gave what you have to give 
And love was like a drug and you refused to take it 
I believe that is time for me, to let it show Hiding behind these eyes 
Lies the soul of a broken man 
And now I realize 
And I finally understand 
Oh can you save me? 
I begging tonight, 'cause I'm losing this fight 
Can you save me? 
'Cause I don't wanna be 
Just a memory I never needed anybody else 
I never needed anyone to tell me 
I believed I could bide my time by never letting go 
So many years filled with lonely days 
Way down the line I feel my heart is breaking 
And I believe it's time for me, to let you know Hiding behind these eyes 
Lies the soul of a broken man 
And now I realize 
And I finally understand 
Oh can you save me? 
I begging tonight, 'cause I'm losing this fight 
Can you save me? 
'Cause I don't wanna be 
Just a memory You are the one, you are my one and only 
Never alone you know you're always with me 
I'm falling harder every time I'm with you 
When we're apart you're on my mind, I need you 
Want you to know that I will never hurt you 
Want you to know that I will not desert you 
I say it time and again... Hiding behind these eyes 
Lies the soul of a broken man 
And now I realize 
And I finally understand 
Oh can you save me? 
I begging tonight, 'cause I'm losing this fight 
Can you save me? 
Oh oouh Hiding behind these eyes 
Lies the soul of a broken man 
And now I realize 
And I finally understand 
Oh can you save me? 
I'm down on my knees, I'm begging you please 
Won't you save me? 
'Cause I don't wanna be 
Another memory 
Don't wanna be, no, no 
Don't wanna be!
