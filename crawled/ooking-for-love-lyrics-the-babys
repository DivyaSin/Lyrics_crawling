Up in the sky deep in the sea 
I'm looking for love 
Where can it be 
Been everywhere And I've asked everyone 
I'm looking for love 
But love can't be 
Day after day The need in me grows 
The more that I need 
The more that it shows 
Lone will I be Cannot survive 
I need some love 
To keep me alive 
Looking for love Looking for love 
Yeah yeah 
Looking for love 
Yeah yeah yeah Up in the sky 
Deep in the sea 
I'm looking for love 
Where can it be I've been round the world 
I've asked everyone 
I'm looking for love 
But love never comes
