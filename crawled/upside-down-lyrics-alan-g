He's up.... side... down Hot blonde boy 
Dancin' in the club 
Slick like oil 
Sexy junior stud 
Comes in close, Now I'm tasting him 
Our first kiss, our first kiss In my car 
I can barely steer 
Trouble starts 
Shifts us into gear 
Lose control, He's got something I 
Can't resist, can't resist Now we're parked 
Darkened alleyway 
Action starts 
Nothin' left to say 
Blonde boy smiles, hidin' somethin' that's 
Up his sleeve, up his sleeve Plays his card 
Bam! a big surprise 
Swallow hard 
Can't believe my eyes 
World's been turned, on its head cuz he's 
What do I see? What do I see? Whu-oh! Upside down 
He's upside down 
He's upside down 
In my passenger seat He's upside down 
He's upside down 
He's upside down 
In my passenger seat Clothes burn off 
Sparks ignite so fast 
Nothin' soft 
Giant shadow cast 
I can't stop, I surrender to 
My desire, my desire 
Ecstasy 
Measures far beyond 
Fantasy 
Waves his magic wand 
Shocking size, Looks so wrong but it 
Feels so right, feels so right Face the truth 
Numbers tell the tale 
Eyes meet boots 
Inhibitions fail 
Hypnotized by the six that becomes 
A nine, a nine 
Trap is sprung 
Lust grows with a sigh 
Take the plunge 
Tastes so good to try 
We don't see face to face but I'm 
Takin' it in, Makin' it mine, Take it Upside down 
He's upside down 
He's upside down 
In my passenger seat He's upside down 
He's upside down 
He's upside down 
In my passenger seat Every dream springs free 
When it's turned around 
Find all that you seek, when 
Right-side up meets upside down Upside down 
Upside down 
Upside down 
Upside down Upside down 
He's upside down 
He's upside down 
In my passenger seat He's upside down 
He's upside down 
He's upside down 
In my passenger seat Upside down 
He's upside down 
He's upside down 
In my passenger seat He's upside down 
It's bigger 
He's upside down 
It's massive 
He's upside down 
It's mind-blowing 
In my passenger seat Upside down 
Upside down 
Upside down 
Upside down Upside down 
He's upside down 
He's upside down 
In my passenger seat He's upside down 
He's upside down...
