I heard she's thinking bout taking my life 
She's got the guy killer eyes in her sights 
It wouldn't take long for this one to tire 
A desperate man sought to a ? 
Oh I know you played straight 
How long I gotta wait for you 
To pull the trigger and leave 
But can't you stop 
Stop and see that 
That's what love is for 
Its ok life is crazy 
Livin six feet under aint to bad anyways 
Its all right just a good night 
If you see me in sight 
Just remember 
Aim high 
Another letter arrived later day 
Its never opened cause there's no looking back 
She made him ride a twelve-hour train 
Only to find he'd been stabbed in the back 
Oh I know you played straight 
How long I gotta wait for you 
To pull the trigger and leave 
But just for now 
Maybe you could 
Point your gun at someone other than me 
Its ok life is crazy 
Livin six feet under aint to bad anyways 
It's all right just a good night 
If you see me in sight 
Just remember 
She makes him listen hard 
Since she don't wanna talk about it 
So I gotta guess on my own 
She lives her life in silence 
That'll be waitin for the violence 
That'll be playin the next sad song 
She'll never know the feeling 
Of a love that's so revealing so she'll 
Never take that chance 
And late at night the song comes on 
He's waiting for the telephone 
And this time there's no romance 
Its ok life is crazy 
Livin six feet under aint so bad anyways 
It's all right just a good night 
Livin six feet under in the candlelight 
Its ok life is crazy 
Livin six feet under aint to bad anyways 
It's all right just a good night 
If you see me in sight 
Just remember 
Aim high
