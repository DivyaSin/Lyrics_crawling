Oh, oh where we get this hope 
I can't tell the weak thing is tough 
You better get this go 
But that is space I want to go on 
I got to move far 
I don't want it no more, more Feel the 
Today you are the TV, I need you to feud 
Just a little justice Give a little money and a house and the car 
Filling up your pockets but it's all that you got I want you to feud, feud It's just a freak show, wait till you see on the inside 
He was caught sleeping, steady dreaming with the ship 
I'm on top, my heart, my heart Give a little money and a house and the car 
Filling up your pockets but it's all that you got 
I want you to feud, feud
