Don't put all Your hopes in this flesh 
This flesh, this mess I am 
Empty promises, my steady diet 
Won't be quiet till I Spread, so thin devotion 
Thus far my notions rant 
Don't put all Your hopes 
Don't put all Your trust in me 
You must not see I can't Set sights in failing 
Target, no control 
Grips, relax and lose hold I lose my defense at Your answers 
And I come all undone with Your gaze Sunless skies, this progress 
Thicker, skin can't stretch the length 
Wearying with face set against the elements 
Is how I spent my strength Set sights in failing 
Target, no control 
Grips, relax and lose hold I lose my defense at Your answers 
And I come all undone with Your gaze 
I lose my defense at Your answers 
And my resolve at Your counter ways I can't run forever 
With the lions loose on me 
Show us no escape 
Lest we forget we're dying Fill my mind with Your thoughts 
My lungs with Your breath 
My mouth with Your words 
My soul with Your death I lose my defense at Your answers 
And I come all undone with Your gaze 
I lose my defense at Your answers 
And my resolve at Your counter ways
