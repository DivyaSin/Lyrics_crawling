Bare breasted, you make love in the turret 
I feel each single thrust that you take 
In silence I watch on from the bastion 
Entranced, I make myself look away Bare breasted making love in the turret 
I'll never love nobody other than you 
And in silence I can feel as you quiver 
Keep quiet or you know what he will do I know I am not the man you desire 
I know you think that I am some kind of fool 
And I know you would gaze in his eyes forever 
I've figured out just how to give that to you When he found us in the western wing sleeping 
You cried at all the things you thought he would do 
And I tell you in the heat of the scuffle 
Nobody ever takes my eyes off of you And oh Katherine, how you run me my fever 
Oh Katherine, tell me was it worth it for him? 
These gallows are no place for the stubborn 
Just you and your lover as a dark souvenir She sees me on display inside the museum 
Comes every morning and again when she can 
Strokes her blistered hand across my glass container 
Saying "It's so good to see you back here again."
