Well I'm staring down from Venus in the dead of night 
My mind is thinking back to when the world was right Your guns and bombs keep rolling off the assembly line 
And people keep on starving and you think that's just fine [Chorus] 
With my head in the clouds its easy to see 
You better live together peacefully 
You know the world is still your family 
So keep it straight, remember me 
It's not too late, remember me Well I'm floating and spinning and flying 
above the Earth's atmosphere 
And I've got a few things to say 
That you may not want to hear Now there's just enough time to repair it 
As long as you don't let it get you down 
But there's not a whole lot you can do for yourself 
when you're buried underground [Chorus] There's so much yelling an screaming 
and lying and cheating 
and robbing and preaching 
That we've heard it all We need some loving and caring 
And kissing and hugging 
And helping each other 
Or we're gonna fall And that'll be all So remember me [Chorus]
