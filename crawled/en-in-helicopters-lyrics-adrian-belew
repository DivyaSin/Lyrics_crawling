Wouldn't it be great 
To see the African plains 
Before they lay them to waste 
And only the bones remain 
Wouldn't it be poetry 
To shoot holes in the poachers we see 
With an elephant gun 
Men in helicopters fly 
Shooting rhinos from out of the sky 
Why do we always assume 
The planet is ours to ruin? 
What a legacy we`re leaving behind 
What a legacy 
Wouldn't it be something 
For the men killing dolphin 
To be caught up by their necks 
In their greedy fishing nets 
Wouldn't it be irony 
If the tuna fish canneries 
Were to fall into the sea 
The dolphins and the whales still left alive 
Cry to the stars in the deep blue night 
"There's nowhere to hide, 
The people on earth will not be denied" 
What a legacy we're leaving behind 
What a legacy 
Wouldn't it be odd 
If there really was a God 
And he looked down on earth 
And saw what we've done to Her 
Wouldn't it be just 
If He pulled the plug on us, 
And took away the sun
