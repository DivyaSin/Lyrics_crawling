So where were you when I was still trying to create 
A better world for myself trying not to be late 
It wasn't easy and its still hard 
Oh I was right to mark your cards I didn't care much for you then 
I don't care much for you now Do do do do do do And when you see all people need was to grow up 
And I've seen the world, did not know there was so much 
And if I ever run out of melodies, I'll just milk the shit out of these I didn't care much for you then 
I don't care much for you now 
I didn't care much for you then 
I couldn't care less for you now Do do do do do do Now recently I heard you ran out of luck 
If I am honest, tell the truth I could not give a fuck 
And that's not easy to say in a song 
But all your rights never made me wrong I didn't care much for you then 
I don't care much for you now 
I didn't care much for you then 
Couldn't care less for you now Do do do do do do do I know you'll understand
