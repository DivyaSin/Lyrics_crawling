Like a warrior that fights 
And wins the battle 
I know the taste of victory Though I went through some nights 
Consumed by the shadows 
I was crippled emotionally Somehow I made it through the heartache 
Yes I did, I escaped 
I found my way out of the darkness 
I kept my faith, kept my faith When the river was deep 
I didn't falter 
When the mountain was high 
I still believed 
When the valley was low 
It didn't stop me, no, no 
I knew you were waiting 
Knew you were waiting for me With and endless desire 
I, I kept on searching 
Sure in time our eyes would meet Like the bridge is on fire 
The hurt is over 
One touch and you set me free No, I don't regret a single moment 
No I don't, looking back 
When I think of all those disappointments 
I just laugh, I just laugh When the river was deep 
I didn't falter 
When the mountain was high 
I still believed 
When the valley was low 
It didn't stop me 
I knew you were waiting 
Knew you were waiting for me So we were drawn together through destiny 
I know this love we share was meant to be Knew you were waiting 
Knew you were waiting 
I knew you were waiting 
Knew you were waiting for me I didn't falter 
I still believed 
When the valley was low 
It didn't stop me 
Knew you were waiting 
Knew you were waiting for me I didn't falter 
I still believed 
When the valley was low 
It didn't stop me 
Knew you were waiting 
Knew you were waiting for me I didn't falter 
I still believed 
It didn't stop me 
Knew you were waiting I didn't falter 
I still believed 
It didn't stop me
