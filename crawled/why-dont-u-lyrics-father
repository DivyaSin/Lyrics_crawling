[Intro: Abra] 
Hot boys and Xanies 
Sun dress no panties 
And we day drunk 
And we butt rub 
And I no sleep like Addies 
Is this love, daddy? 
Is this love? [Hook] 
Why don't love me daddy? [Verse 1: iLoveMakonnen] 
You come around and you be tripping 
See you in the club 
And you always want me tipping 
Take you to the spot 
Baby make it hot 
You don't call me back 
I wonder what the fuck we got 
See me with them other girls 
Lying bitches new pearls 
You say "I don't love you" 
I'm like "girl, give you the world" 
Take you out to Atlanta 
Show you all bandanas 
You be smoking on the gas 
All my shit is bananas 
Girl you acting so damn crazy 
I can't even do this shit 
I'm 'bout to go out to LA 
You tripping on my bitch 
Told you 'bout my west coast hoes 
Told you 'bout my North Side bitch 
You want to go to hotels 
But you can't even act right, bitch [Hook]
