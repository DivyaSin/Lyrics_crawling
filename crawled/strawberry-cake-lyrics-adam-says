I saw a picture of your humble smile 
Don't you have a name? It's what i need to find 
I asked my best friend to let me see her smile 
The day seems special since I found you that time It's been awhile since you were planted in my mind 
Oh through the time there you grow high and higher 
I sing this music as you rise in my mind 
As long as you stay, I'll call you like the title You show me what is love 
That makes me always smile 
I own a way to tell you oh baby 
You make me always smile 
That no one can explain 
All I want is to see you oh baby It was the moment when we met in a park 
I caught your eyes were shining like the diamonds 
Well I felt happy for a reason at that time 
As long as you stay, let me call you like the title You show me what is love 
That makes me always smile 
I own a way to tell you oh baby 
You make me always smile 
That no one can explain 
All I want is to see you oh baby I like you more, 
I love you more, 
I want you more each day.
