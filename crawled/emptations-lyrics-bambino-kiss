I stepped into a club, 
I saw a girl sat all alone, 
Looking kind of lonely baby, 
Don't know why I even asked her, 
If she would dance with me, 
When she said yes and it all began. Oh no, I'm falling down, 
Oh no, I think I wanna cry, 
Oh no, I think I wanna die, 
Oh no, tell me why. I asked that girl to dance, 
What the hell was I'm thinking of, 
So tell me why, 
I asked that girl to dance, 
I know it wasn't love, 
Though she was my type. Wish that I've known, 
That she lives for herself, 
What I've gone and done, 
Right now I need help.
