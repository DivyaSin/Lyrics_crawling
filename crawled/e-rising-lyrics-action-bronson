Fly Mary in to sing to the cow before we slaughtered it 
Then I ordered it Don't say a word to me 
You already committed perjury 
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that 
You know better, you better save that Laid by the pool, my legs gettin' massaged by your professional 
Strictly business, nothin' sexual 
Seasonal vegetables lookin' exceptional 
You ain't think I was hot then, now you wanna hum on my testicles 
I'm from a dirty borough where that Sun don't come out 
But when the moon come, the goons come, the crew runs 
Like a big Jamaican, I stand adjacent 
To that S600 in amazement 
My time gon' come, I'm headed to the top right 
I never wore makeup, and I'm ready for the spotlight 
You know I got my hoodie on, and it's such a hot night 
Shit I'm straight from Queens, catch me in the limo like it's prom night Don't say a word to me 
You already committed perjury 
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that 
You know better, you better save that This that do a hundred in the rental in the rain 
With the jammy, a day before I have to go to Spain 
Livin' on the edge, different colored women in my bed 
Different, different colored linens on my leg 
My mother said I better win or else she'll fuck me up 
Ma we did it, I love you, you lucky slut 
Since I was young I had the husky gut 
But I'm gorgeous, got money in the pouch just like a tourist 
Swerve in a Skylark, big piece of the pie chart 
Bitch this is fine art, I guess my shine on 
You lyin', dog, you never even put the iron on 
You drive a Scion, you ain't ridin', dog 
Me, I'm cell built, grab your chest 
Still get hit with right hands from left field 
My life is a kaleidoscope 
She makes me feel just like I'm high on dope 
I never calm down, shoot the gun without puttin' my son down Don't say a word to me 
You already committed perjury 
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that 
You know better, you better save that
