I Am Flat Dead On My Feet 
I Have Had Nothing To Eat 
I Am Sick Of Highways And Cold Hotels Rooms 
I Have Replay There In Our Soft Bed 
I Am So Tired Of Missing You So Let's Turn Out The Lights 
(Let's Turn Out The Lights) 
And Lay Here By My Side 
(Lay Here By My Side) 
Give Me The Lose That I Need 
Baby Let's Love Some Sleep Tonight All These Shows That I Play 
Take Me So Far Away 
I Know That I Have Negleated Your Needs 
You Have Been Tested And Trialed 
Stuck Firm By My Side 
Waiting Patiently For The Man Of Your Needs So Let's Turn Out The Lights 
(Let's Turn Out The Lights) 
And Lay Here By My Side 
(Lay Here By My Side) 
Give Me The Love That I Need 
Baby Let's Lose Some Sleep Tonight (Instrumental) Sweetheart One Night Together 
Is Not Nearly Enough 
We Need The Rest Of Forever Making Up For Lost Love So Let's Turn Out The Lights 
(Let's Turn Out The Lights) 
Lay Here By My Side 
(Lay Here By My Side) 
Give You The Love That You Need 
Let's Lose Some Sleep Tonight 
The Love That I Need 
Baby Let's Lose Some Sleep Tonight
