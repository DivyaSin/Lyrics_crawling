I've got a feeling inside of me 
Running all through my veins 
It's like electrical energy 
A world's about to change 
It's an open road 
So here I go [Chorus] 
The rest of my life 
Is starting tonight 
Feels like I'm fin'lly on my way 
I'm looking ahead 
Can't tell where it ends 
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith 
And I'm gonna hold on tight 
And ride this ride 
The rest of my life I'm gonna go for it all aloud 
I know there's no guarantee 
But I've been given a chance and now 
What's next is up to me 
I'm gonna set my sights 
So light those lights [Chorus] If all the world's a stage 
I'm here to take my place 
I know I'll always find a way to shine The rest of my life 
Is starting tonight 
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
I'm looking ahead 
Can't tell where it ends 
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith The rest of my life 
Is starting tonight 
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
It starts with a dream 
Of who I can be 
Wherever it takes me I can't wait 
So I'm gonna hold on tight 
And right is right 
The rest of my life 
The rest of my life 
The rest of my life
