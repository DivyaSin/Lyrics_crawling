It's been coming 'round for days 
Ive been seeing it for years 
Youve said all you had to say 
It doesnt mean that you're sincere 
If what you mean is harm And we know what you will say 
When you talk behind our ears 
Youre the good in everything 
And the worst of all our fears 
If what you mean is harm And your dying thoughts kill us all 
And your dying thoughts kill us all Now youre waiting on a life 
That you thought would reappear 
You take comfort in the ways 
That you held out all these years 
No love, loss, or harm
