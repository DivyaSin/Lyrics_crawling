when your with me in everything that i do, 
and there you are so dear in my heart 
and still i just can't let you go 
thats why i came here, so you know...... 
that i don't wanna live, 
if livings without you, 
and that i would give my all 
just for one more day 
don't tell me its over 
coz for me it has just begun 
baby please lets give us one more try 
i can give you what money can't buy 
if you let me be there, 
every moment beside you 
feel love and let feelings just guide you 
trust in me and you'll never be hurt 
coz i'll keep you safely you know, 
that why i came here so you know....... 
that i don't wanna live, 
if livings without you, 
and that i would give my all 
just for one more day 
don't tell me its over
