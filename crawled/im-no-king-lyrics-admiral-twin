I'm no king and I'm no leader 
I'm not like Paul but a lot like Peter 
I've denied my friends and denied my wife 
I know my purpose, I know my rights 
As a human, as a friend, as a lover, as a man 
I'm a believer and I know what I believe 
I'm a believer and I wear it on my sleeve 
I'm a believer and I'm climbing up this tree 
I'm a believer and the world's looking at me 
When I was three I had no worry 
My goals were small I wasn't in a hurry 
To please the masses or fill a role 
To gain the world or lose my soul 
I'm a human, I'm a friend, I'm a lover, I'm a man 
I'm a believer and I know what I believe 
I'm a good bleeder and I know when I should bleed 
I'm a reciever and I give what I recieve 
I'm a believer and I'm stuck up in this tree 
When I was three I thought the world revolved around me, 
I was wrong and so I sing 
As a human, as a friend, as a lover, as a man 
I'm a believer and I know what I believe 
You're a bandito and you wear it on your sleeve 
You're incognito and you need no help from me 
I'm a believer but I wish that I was three years old again
