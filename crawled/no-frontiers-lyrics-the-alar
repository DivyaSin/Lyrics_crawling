A thousand miles before us 
Long is the road 
The mountain high 
And the valley low 
Our love is stronger than we know In the tears of a river 
I see the wrong 
Hear the mountain cry 
Cry anger 
Feel the pain in the valley below I want to run 
Where the sunlight beats on my face 
I want to feel 
The wind in my hair THERE ARE NO FRONTIERS 
That we can't cross tonight 
There are no borderlines 
To keep us apart 
THERE ARE NO FRONTIERS I am devoted to you 
Like the sea to the shore 
Like the tree to the forest 
I can't live without you 
A river can't live without water I want to run 
Where the sunlight beats on my face 
I want to feel 
The wind in my hair THERE ARE NO FRONTIERS 
That we can't cross tonight 
There are no borderlines 
To keep us apart 
THERE ARE NO FRONTIERS 
That we can't cross oh oh oh THERE ARE NO FRONTIERS 
That we can't cross tonight 
There are no borderlines 
To keep us apart 
THERE ARE NO FRONTIERS 
That we can't cross tonight 
There are no borderlines 
To keep us apart 
No, no, no 
THERE ARE NO FRONTIERS 
THERE ARE NO FRONTIERS 
To keep us apart 
THERE ARE NO?.
