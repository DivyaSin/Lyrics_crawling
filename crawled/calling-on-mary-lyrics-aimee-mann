I heard the sidewalk Santa say: 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas 
Salvation's coming cheap today 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas I searched the skyline for a star 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas 
And baby I wondered where you are 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas 'Cause comfort's not possible when 
You look past the joy to the end Calling on Mary is voluntary 
Unless you're alone like me 
If there's a star above, then it can look like love 
When they light up the Christmas tree When I was young I couldn't see 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas 
All that my true love gave to me 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas She offered sight to the blind 
But I'm not the miracle kind Calling on Mary is voluntary 
Unless you're alone like me 
If there's a star above, then it can look like love 
When they light up the Christmas tree And to all the lost souls down below: 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas 
What's one more drifter in the snow? 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! If there's a star above, then it can look like love 
When they light up the Christmas tree 
If there's a star above, then it can look like love 
When they light up the Christmas tree
