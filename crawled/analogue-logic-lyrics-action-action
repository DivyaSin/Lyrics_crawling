We are the locust, annihilate your redemption 
We are clever, clever lines 
But the science is in the time of the delivery 
Spaced in sporadic time If you jump in, I will jump in too 
Who will save your soul? 
If you strike the match then I'll let it shower over you 
Drink down the chemicals I am the future, am the scene 
I am the logic, I am the dream 
(Flying on borrowed wings) 
Build it up, just sit back and relax, burn away 
(Flying on borrowed wings) We are just shadows, take advantage of this ego trip 
Let's dream to make our movies, let's make movies of our dreams 
Starring in our own little scripts, just take advantage of this ego trip 
Who would play your role and intelligent unknown? 
Or an up and comer or a blockbuster hero? I am the fever, just expired on the inside 
And I am itchin' for the trigger 
Or I am waiting to detonate all over you 
Please, please, you decide Time is the dark spot on all of our lungs 
Salvation or defecation? 
I am your church, your science, your imaginary Savior 
All hail the game of chance I am the future, am the scene 
I am the logic, I am the dream 
(Flying on borrowed wings) 
Build it up, just sit back and relax, burn away 
(Flying on borrowed wings) This is the worst trip, this is the worst trip 
This is emergency, so go, go, go, go back and get it 
This is the worst trip, this is the worst trip 
This is emergency, so go, go, go, go back and get it This is the worst trip, this is the worst trip 
This is emergency, so go, go, go, go back and get it 
This is the worst trip, this is the worst trip 
This is emergency, so go, go, go, go back and get it This is the worst trip, this is the worst trip 
This is emergency, so go, go, go, go back and get it 
This is the worst trip, this is the worst trip 
This is emergency, so go, go, go, go back and get it
