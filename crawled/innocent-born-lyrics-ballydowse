He holds in His strength every 
innocent born stricken in body or 
mind. He forms the frame from the 
weak and unwise which holds up the 
land. In only His eyes is the worth and 
the truth of beauty defined at once 
broken man and completely divine. I wish to dwell in Your life. 
I wish to be where You are. 
I follow You from no fear of hell. 
Alone it's gone so hard. 
Alone I've gone so far. The years can be erased till one by one 
they fall. Your tears had form and taste. 
The Son of man is the Lord of us all.
