Epilepsy is dancing 
Shes the Christ now departing 
And Im finding my rhythm 
As I twist in the snow All the metal burned in me 
Down the brain of my river 
That fire was searching 
For a waterway home I cry glitter is love! 
My eyes pinned inside 
With green jewels 
Hanging like Christmas stars 
From a golden vein As I came to a screaming 
Hold me while Im dreaming 
For my fingers are curling 
And I cannot breathe Then I cried in the kitchen 
How Id seen your ghost witching 
As a soldering blue line 
Between my eyes I cry glitter is love! 
My eyes 
Pinned inside 
Sea green jewels 
Hanging like Christmas stars 
From a golden vein Cut me in quadrants 
Leave me in the corner 
Oh now its passing 
Oh now Im dancin
