You, you who smiled when you're in pain 
You who soldiered through the profane 
They were distracted and shut down So why, why would you talk to me at all 
Such words were dishonorable and in vain 
Their promise as solid as a fog And where was your watchman then I'll be your keeper for life as your guardian 
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden 
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand 
The greatest honor of all as your guardian You, you in the chaos feigning sane 
You who has pushed beyond what's humane 
Them as the ghostly tumbleweed And where was your watchman then I'll be your keeper for life as your guardian 
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden 
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand 
The greatest honor of all as your guardian Now no more smiling mid crest fall 
No more managing unmanageables 
No more holding still in the hailstorm Now enter your watch woman I'll be your keeper for life as your guardian 
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden 
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand 
The greatest honor of all as your guardian
