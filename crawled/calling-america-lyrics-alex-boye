A better day is coming for mankind, 
for a United States and peace of mind 
The envy of a nations dream, may lead to strife 
But what gives man the right to take 
Another mans life? So im calling America, to help me ease the pain 
I'm calling America, so i can live again, 
I'm calling America, shine your light 
For all to see, 
I'm calling on those stars and stripes 
To make a patriot of me Citizens both young and old 
Lets fight for glory, not for gold 
Raise your banners to the sky 
I know its hard sometimes to be strong 
When you've suffered for so long Chorus So im calling America, to help me ease the pain 
I'm calling America, so i can live again, 
I'm calling America, shine your light
