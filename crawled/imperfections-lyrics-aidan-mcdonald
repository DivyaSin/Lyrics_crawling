(Intro) (Verse 1) 
Im opening my heart to, anyone affected, 
But all they do is ignore, and turn back around. 
Then spit on everything I stood for, 
I cant do anything anymore, 
To convince them that I overrule, 
In my heart, in my heart, soul, and mind. (Chorus) 
Imperfections, Imperfections, 
I dont know anybody who has them. 
Perfections, oh perfections, 
Theres only one girl who I think is perfect, 
Perfect to me, but who am I, 
With these imperfections. (Verse 2) 
All my life, Ive been put through so many things, 
For Christmas, I didnt even get five golden rings, 
Why is it so hard for me to explain, 
My feelings for the girl of my dreams. (Chorus) 
Imperfections, Imperfections 
I dont know anybody who has them. 
Perfections, oh perfections, 
Theres only one girl who I think is perfect, 
Perfect to me, but who am I, 
With these imperfections. (Bridge) 
Why is it always the same routine, 
It seems like everyone is laughing at me, 
Sometimes all I want to do is scream, 
Out loud, but nobody cares, theres nowhere to go. 
But shes always been there for me, 
Someone to talk to, the girl of my dreams, 
But she never even seems to see, 
Through all of my..... (Chorus) 
Imperfections, Imperfections 
I dont know anybody who has them. 
Perfections, oh perfections, 
Theres only one girl who I think is perfect, 
Perfect to me, but who am I, 
With these imperfections. (Outro)
