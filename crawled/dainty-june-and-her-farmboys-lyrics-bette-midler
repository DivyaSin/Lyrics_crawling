That 5 foot 2 bundle of dynamite, Dainty June Hello everybody my name is June 
What's yours? I have a moo cow, a new cow 
A true cow named Caroline, moo moo, moo moo 
She's an extra special friend of mine, moo moo, moo moo 
I like everything about her fine, moo moo, moo moo She likes to moo in the moonlight 
When the moody moon appears 
And when she moos in the moonlight 
Gosh, it's moosic to my ears, she's so moosical She loves a man cow, a tan cow 
Who can cow her with a glance, moo moo, moo moo 
When he winks at her she starts to dance, moo moo, moo moo 
It's what grown-ups call a real romance, moo moo, moo moo But if we moved to the city or we settled by the shore 
She'd make the move 'cause she loves me more Yes, Mr. Grantziger, Ill tell her 
Thank you very much, that's all 
But we have a great dramatic finish
