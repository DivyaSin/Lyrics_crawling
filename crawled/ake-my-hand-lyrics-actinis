Since the first time I saw your face 
It became my dream to feel your lips 
Tried so hard to leave your picture behind Is it a sin? 
Is it my fault? 
That I can't deal with you being too far 
Is it too late now? 
for me to show you how 
I've felt all this time would you let me in 
For just this once? Take my hand and I'll show you everything 
forget about tomorrow and yesterday 
cause we live our life today 
its all about you and me 
it's not about the price that we have to pay 
i promise i will give you all of me it's getting too hard to breath 
i know its hard for you to see 
but it seems that i've lost my way 
it seems that i've lost my way Is it a sin? 
Is it my fault? 
That I can't deal with you being too far 
Is it too late now? 
for me to show you how 
I've felt all this time im gone crazy 
im lost help me 
before its late 
before its too late Take my hand and I'll show you everything 
forget about tomorrow and yesterday 
cause we live our life today 
its all about you and me 
it's not about the price that we have to pay 
i promise i will give you all of me nothing can stop me anymore 
its just us 
cant take away my eyes 
this is the only thing 
i can not fall 
too far its getting harder and harder to take 
a part of me starting to break its getting harder and harder to take 
a part of me starting to break Take my hand and I'll show you everything 
forget about tomorrow and yesterday 
cause we live our life today 
its all about you and me 
it's not about the price that we have to pay 
i promise i will give you all of me its getting harder and harder to take 
a part of me starting to break its getting harder and harder to take 
a part of me starting to break
