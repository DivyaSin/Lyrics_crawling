My Sin is Pride 
Will Kimbrough / Tim Littlefield I let you walk away 
I kept it all inside 
Swore you?d be back someday 
My Sin Is Pride I could have reached out to you 
But I felt like my hands were tied 
I?m always bound to prove 
My Sin Is pride Wasted so many words 
When I told the truth I lied 
I never will confess 
My Sin Is Pride I?ve chosen a narrow path 
Lost sight of the road so wide 
But I never will look back 
My Sin Is Pride Nobody sees the pain 
Nobody knows I?ve cried 
I never will confess 
My sin is pride 
I never will confess 
My Sin Is Pride
