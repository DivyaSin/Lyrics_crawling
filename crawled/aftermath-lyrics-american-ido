Have you lost your way? 
Livin' in the shadow of the messes that you made 
And so it goes 
Everything inside your circle starts to overflow Take a step before you leap 
Into the colors that you seek 
You get back what you give away 
So don't look back on yesterday Wanna scream out, no more hiding 
Don't be afraid of what's inside 
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright 
In the aftermath Anytime anybody pulls you down 
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed 
Just remember you are not alone 
In the aftermath You feel the weight 
Of lies and contradictions that you live with everyday 
It's not too late 
Think of what could be if you rewrite the role you play Take a step before you leap 
Into the colors that you seek 
You get back what you give away 
So don't look back on yesterday Wanna scream out, no more hiding 
Don't be afraid of what's inside 
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright 
In the aftermath Anytime anybody pulls you down 
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed 
Just remember you are not alone 
In the aftermath 
In the aftermath Before you break, you have to shed your armor 
Take a trip and fall into the glitter 
Tell a stranger that they're beautiful 
So all you feel is love, love 
All you feel is love, love Wanna scream out, no more hiding 
Don't be afraid of what's inside 
Wanna tell you you'll be alright 
In the aftermath Wanna scream out, no more hiding 
Don't be afraid of what's inside 
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright 
In the aftermath Anytime anybody pulls you down 
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed 
Just remember you are not alone 
In the aftermath 
In the aftermath Gonna tell ya you'll be alright 
In the aftermath 
In the aftermath Just remember you are not alone 
In the aftermath
