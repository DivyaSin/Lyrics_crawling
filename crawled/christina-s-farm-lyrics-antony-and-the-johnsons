i got kissed by a turtle dove 
upon a cold Paris manger 
i was waking up to my love, 
first moment dawning danger everything was new 
every sock and shoe 
my face and your face tenderly renewed i awoke to find a whiteness inside 
everything did shine, slyly, from each body 
halos from within, diamonds the year in 
as we crossed to where the virgin mary moves over the fields 
here and there, she kneels 
sighing sweet relief upon the prairie everything was new 
every sock and shoe 
my face and your face tenderly renewed as the rich winds blow, 
kiss each flamingo, 
tussle reckless trains of the wild white horses 
and at night the owl streaks the field and howls 
she sees there's a kitten, stops wind aghast to hear them shudder everything was new 
every sock and shoe 
my face and your face tenderly renewed
