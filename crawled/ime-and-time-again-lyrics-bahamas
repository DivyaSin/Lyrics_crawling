One, two three Time and time again my love I wonder where you are 
Time and time again my love I've found you among the stars 
Time and time again my love I felt from you so far 
Time and time again my love seen your face in each passing car Now I admit I might let my mind wander 
But it only gets as far as my heart 
Cause if anything's gonna do us in now 
It'll be "death do us part" Time and time again my love I left you feeling blue 
Time and time again my love you looked around for someone new 
Time and time again my love well I guess I look around too 
Time and time again our love brings me right back around to you Now I admit I might let my mind wander 
But it only gets as far as my heart 
Cause if anything's gonna do us in now 
It'll be "death do us part" Now I admit a few heavy days go by 
and I can't remember when 
We ever disagreed though I know 
We'll disagree time and time again
