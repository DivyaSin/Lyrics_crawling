If I could do it all again I'd look more in the mirror 
Instead of finding someone else to blame 
If I could do it all again I'd do a lot more praying 
Less cussing 'bout the things that I can't change I'd laugh a little louder, sing more in the shower 
And care a little less if I'm in tune 
I'd concentrate on who I am, not who I might have been 
If I could do it all again If I could do it all again I'd take it a little slower 
And make a few more memories I could keep 
I'd crawl in bed beside my wife and just lay down and watch her 
Soaking up her beauty while she sleeps I'd work less hours, I'd buy her more flowers 
Make more love on rainy afternoons 
Overlook my little faults and not my little sins 
If I could do it all again
