Billy had a woman but he treated her bad 
Lost the best thing he ever had 
Betty got tired of being put down 
So she packed her bags and left this town 
Gotta love somebody if you wanna them to stay 
Treat them right or they'll slip away 
Slip away [Chorus] 
Feed the fire 
Stoke the coals 
You never stay warm at night 
If love grows cold 
Stirring it up will make that flame burn higher 
If tou want love to last 
Feed the fire Falling in love will come easy for you 
But staying in love us what's hard to do 
A little give and take and compromise 
Can help to keep your love alive 
You gotta say you love him every day 
Show you need him in a hundred ways 
And love will stay [Chorus: x3]
