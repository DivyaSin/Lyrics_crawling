Boys With Tattoos I'm a bad bitch, I need a bad boy, 
My ass outta this world, astroids. 
I like deep waves and D-Boy cliches, 
Top down 100 on da freeway, 
In his lumberjack, but under that discover tats 
From front to back, wait run it back, he played runnin' back, 
And when I say I pass he came runnin' back. We Jerkin' (8 times) Ima Reject (4 times)
