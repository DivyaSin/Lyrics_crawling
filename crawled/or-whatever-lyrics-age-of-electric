In your love, I should have been more kind 
In your love, I could I be so blind? 
In your heart, Your wasted, In your mind 
Forever or whatever come what may 
Our love will live to see another day 
Sing your song, Sacred are your words 
I bend my knee, And you will be my church 
With an angels voice, You offer me no choice 
I close my eyes, And I sing away my hurt 
In your arms, Salvation, In your mind 
You'll never leave me, You'll never hurt me 
You didn't love me, Where are you now? 
Fell my bite, The thorn in my side
