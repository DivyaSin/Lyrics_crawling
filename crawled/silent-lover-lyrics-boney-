Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover 
When my man's in town You never been a shy one 
You really are a sly one yes sire, yes sire, oh 
Coming right out of hiding 
Slipping right in and sliding, down to me, oh baby oh 
And when it's time for worryin' 
You're doing what you're doing, gracefully, oh baby 
When you took me into your arms and shook me 
To the core, oh yeah... Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover 
When my man's in town 
Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover 
When my man's in town Oh I guess you really change me 
You sort of rearrange me more and more, oh baby yeah... 
Each day you come on stronger 
I know you really longer 
What's the score, what's the score, alright 
And I know you're much too clever, 
Just to go run forever 
No, not you, oh baby 
You're like a wind wing rover 
Just like a wind wing rover, passing through, oh yeah... 
And one day you'll say 
No use to keep on saying, name the truth, oh baby Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover 
When my man's in town 
Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover 
When my man's in town You never been a shy one 
You really are a sly one yes sire, oh baby 
Coming right out of hiding 
Slipping right in and sliding, down to me, oh yeah... 
Oh...and when it's time for worryin' 
You're doing what you're doing, gracefully, gracefully 
Oh you took me into your arms and shook me 
To the score, to a score 
Oh I guess you really change me 
You sort of rearrange me more and more, oh...yeah... Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover 
When my man's in town
