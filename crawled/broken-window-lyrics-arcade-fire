Deep in the past, far in the future time 
Deep in the past, far in the future time 
Just 'cause no one saw you, that don't mean it ain't a crime They say they know me but they only know my name 
They say they know me but they only know my name 
They're through asking me questions, I ain't gonna learn to sing If they want it they can take it, they don't need no reason why 
If they want it they can take it, they don't need no reason why 
The night they took you from me I saw the broken window and I cried They bound my eyes and they bound my hands 
They bound my eyes and they bound my hands 
Where they're gonna take me now? No one understands They say they know me but they only know my name 
They say they know me but they only know my name 
They're through asking me questions, I ain't gonna learn to sing Lay their hands upon me now, it's midnight blue 
Lay the hands upon me now, it's midnight blue 
They didn't know me and they didn't know you, no, no Now reduced to hide in the dark when they came for you I gained the world but I lost your trust 
I gained the world but I lost your trust 
they throw their money at you, it ain't easy to adjust Come out, and put your hands on your head 
I said come out, and put your hands on your head 
Come and join the rest of us, we are already dead If they want it they can take it, they don't need no reason why 
If they want it they can take it, they don't need no reason why 
The night they took you from me I saw the broken window and I cried Woe unto them if they touch a hair on your head 
Woe unto them if they touch a hair on your head 
You're gonna join the rest of us, we are already dead They won the battle, but the war is through 
They won the battle, but the war is through 
They didn't know me and they didn't know you, no, no Now reduced to knock in the dark when they came for you
