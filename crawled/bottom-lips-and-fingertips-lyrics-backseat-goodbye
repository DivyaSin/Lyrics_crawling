Bottom lips and fingertips 
Two twenty something kids getting acquainted 
In a dim lit room at the bottom of the stairs 
Forget first names and old birthdays 
Those were lost with the clothes that hit the floor 
When the light switch got turned off I'm just your boy to fuck, you're just my girl to touch 
Of course it's natural to fall in love 
But love is for people with hearts 
Not for the kids just brushing up on their chemistry Bottom lips and fingertips 
Two twenty something kids with a bottle of gin 
Making bad decisions in a blur on the kitchen floor 
It's not like tonight is the end of the world 
And it's not like we'll remember any of this 
Come tomorrow we'll pretend today didn't even ever exist I'm just your boy to fuck, you're just my girl to touch 
Of course it's natural to fall in love 
But love is for people with hearts 
Not for the kids just brushing up on their chemistry If we're only young once, then we better get up 
'Cause we don't know how long we've got until the music stops 
If I'm only young once, then I better get out 
Of this trend where I end up lost in the middle of a town I know by heart Take all your good days and turn them into memories 
Forget all the bad, it's just a thing of the past 
You get what you got and you got what you give 
You get what you got and you got what you give You get what you got and you got what you give 
You get what you got and you got what you give 
You get what you got and you got what you give 
Got what you give, got what you give
