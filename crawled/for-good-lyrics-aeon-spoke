A hot and humid Sunday 
Faces, faces everywhere 
Then a face, I remember my face years ago 
Such fear Many psychic scars 
In just his short few years 
In the noise of his silence he ran away from the violence 
To heal But this is my day 
And I can dream above the buried cry 
Cause I've got something better 
And it might just be my own 
For Good But this is my day 
And I can see the wreckage in my head 
But it's not the same 
Cause I transform the pain
