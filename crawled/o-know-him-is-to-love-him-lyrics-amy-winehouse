Is to love love love him 
Just to see that smile 
Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him 
Is to love love love him

And I do Oh I'll be good to him 
I'll bring joy to him oh oh

When I'll walk alongside of him To know know know him 
Is to love love love him 
And I do 
I really do 
And I do Why can't he see? 
How blind here he be? 
Someday he'll see 
That he was meant just for me, oh oh oh oh To know know know him 
Is to love love love him 
Just to see that smile 
Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him 
Is to love love love him 
And I do 
I really do 
And I do
