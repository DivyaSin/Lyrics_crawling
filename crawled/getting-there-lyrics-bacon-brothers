WRITTEN BY MICHAEL BACON I'm a man who likes to take his time 
In the ways of love 
Long gone that's where I am 
When push comes to shove 
But when I first laid eyes on you 
My heart began to race 
Now this whole things out of control 
And I can't take the pace Chorus 
Cause you tell me I don't love you 
You say I'll never care 
Maybe I don't love you no no 
But I'm getting there 
Oh girl I'm getting there 
You're the kind of woman 
Who likes to take a chance 
My friends keep saying go man 
But I don't know this dance 
Dizzy dazed and out of sorts 
And almost out of time 
Now this whole thing's out of control 
And I'm out of my mind Chorus There you go again flashing those sexy eyes 
Are you trying to ruin my day 
I remember when my heart's disguise finally fell 
And then you tell me Chorus
