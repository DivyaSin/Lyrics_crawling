Frozen fingers on a coco wheel 
Hot emotions that you can't conceal 
Stay on the freeway 
Take the chance of your life Screamin' sirens cryin' in your ear 
Flashin' red lights burnin' in the mirror 
Come on step on it 
Get them out of your sight Can't be too cool 
When you're dancin' with danger 
Don't play the fool 
When you're dancin' with danger, hey Runnin' lonely and your out of steam 
Silent madness when you try to speak 
Shattered pictures 
Of a face you once knew Life can be cruel 
When you're dancin' with danger 
Don't be too cool 
When you're dancin' with danger Can't be too cool 
When you're dancin' with danger 
Don't play the fool 
When you're dancin' with danger Can't be too cool 
When you're dancin' with danger 
Don't play the fool 
When you're dancin' with danger Life can be cruel 
When you're dancin' with danger
