Bet you wish you knew what time it is 
And it's clear that you don't 
Understand a love that requires fewer words 
It's been a while since we spoke 
But there's still hope If we materialize the myth 
We never trivialize the kiss 
Oh it feels like there's no fire left in your eyes 
And this is how love dies
