Pull the top down, use your knees to drive 
I'll make it worth your while, just let me taste the sky 
You pressed your mouth on mine 
And fed me a star then said 
We never can truly know who we are 
Know who we are With the light out and the night inside 
The broken radio was playing suicide 
I felt myself falling 
I confessed to you, I saw a body 
You said you'd seen a few This night has only just begun 
If there's discretion that 
You've not abandoned now's the time 
We'll burn to best the morning's sun 
Go grab your bag, I'll bring the gun, the gun Keep the top down, use your knees to drive 
I'll hide these words, they're only yours to find 
You pressed your mouth on mine 
And said, they'd call us stars 
Then said we never can truly know who we are This night has only just begun 
If there's discretion that 
You've not abandoned now's the time 
We'll burn to best the morning's sun 
Go grab your bag, I'll bring the gun Everything was burning bright 
Everyone was frightened 
You said, stay strong 
Everybody knowing that what 
We'd invited still remains when we're gone This night has only just begun 
If there's discretion that 
You've not abandoned now's the time 
We'll burn to best the morning's sun 
Go grab your bag, I'll bring the gun, oh This night has only just begun 
If there's discretion that 
You've not abandoned now's the time 
We'll burn to best the morning's sun 
Go grab your bag, I'll bring the gun, the gun 
I'll bring the gun, oh
