We're waiting on a sign 
Something to wake me from this daydream 
We all know what it's like 
When your hopes are on hold, there's no where to go We're finally breaking free 
I think it's time for us to leave 
Our old life is a memory tonight Oh oh oh oh 
This is the start of something 
Oh oh oh oh 
Bigger than ever before 
Oh oh oh oh 
We're all born fire-starters 
Oh oh oh oh 
This is the start of something When you're at the end 
It's a new beginning, the world's still spinning 
I know that we can 
Be the spark when it all goes dark, cause We're finally breaking through 
I think it's cause I'm next to you 
Out with the old, in with the new tonight Oh oh oh oh 
This is the start of something 
Oh oh oh oh 
Bigger than ever before 
Oh oh oh oh 
We're all born fire-starters 
Oh oh oh oh 
This is the start of something We're finally breaking free 
I think it's time for us to leave 
Our old life is a memory tonight Oh oh oh oh 
This is the start of something 
Oh oh oh oh 
Bigger than ever before 
Oh oh oh oh 
We're all born fire-starters 
Oh oh oh oh 
This is the start of something
