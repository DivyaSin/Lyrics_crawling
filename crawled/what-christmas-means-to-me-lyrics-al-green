Oh yeah 
Candles burning low 
Lot's of mistletoe 
Lot's of snow and ice Everywhere we go 
Choirs singing carols 
Right outside my door All these things and more, baby 
(All these things and more) 
That's what Christmas means to me, my love 
(Christmas means to me, my love) 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I see your smiling face 
Like I never seen before 
Even though I love you madly 
It seems I love you more 
The little cards you give me 
Will touch my heart for sure All these things and more, baby 
(All these things and more) 
That's what Christmas means to me, my love 
(Christmas means to me, my love) 
Oh, yeah I feel like running wild 
(Running wild) 
As reaches and a little child 
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe 
I kiss you once and then some more And wish you a Merry Christmas, baby 
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby) 
And happiness, happiness in the coming year 
Oh, yeah Christmas means to me, my love 
(Christmas means to me, my love) 
(Christmas means to me, my love) Let's deck the halls with holly 
Sing a silent night 
Fill a sheet with angel hair 
And pretty, pretty lights 
Go to sleep and wake up 
Just before daylight All these things and more, baby 
(All these things and more) 
That's what Christmas means to me, my love 
(Christmas means to me, my love) 
Hey, yeah That's what Christmas means to me, my love 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas, oh yeah 
Merry Christmas, yeah, oh yes
