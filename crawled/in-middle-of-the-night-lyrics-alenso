Alenso In Middle Of The Night 
[Verse 1] 
this can't be true 
this can't be happening 
between me and you 
why you broke up with me 
can't you saw 
that i'm burning in your love 
i don't care any more 
get out of my life 
[Chorus] 
there is no way 
for clearing my memory 
i always remember 
what you did to me/ 
i can't standing 
without you and your touch 
but i am trying to 
forget your love 
[Verse 2] 
It's so hard to breath/ 
it's so hard to take/ 
tell me these all are fake/ 
it's not good to taste/ 
it's wrong or it's right/ 
but it is the truth/ 
i'll sing till i die/ 
but next song not yours 
[Chorus] 
there is no way 
for clearing my memory 
i always remember 
what you did to me/ 
i can't standing 
without you and your touch 
but i am trying to 
forget your love 
[Bridge] 
In middle of the night 
i sit by my own 
looking for you every where 
you're not in my home 
you're not in my home
