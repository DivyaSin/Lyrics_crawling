When the summer clouds roll around the sky 
And a strand of stars sparkle in the night 
Let me take your worry from you 
Let me make a world around you 
Let me love you like nobody ever tried When the lazy days come to lay around the lake 
And the rays of the sun run among the waves 
Don't you think about tomorrow 
Don't you drink a drop of sorrow 
Don't you look upon the past or wonder why Let it roll down your shoulder 
Let it fall on the floor 
I'll be loving you 
Like the water loves the shore Let it fall from your fingers 
Let it go, let it come 
I'll be loving you 
Like the summer loves the big blue sun 
The big blue sun 
The big blue sun When the summer clouds roll around the stars in the night 
And the lazy days lay around the morning light 
Let me take your worry from you 
Let me make a world around you 
Let me love you like nobody ever tried Let it roll down your shoulder 
Let it fall on the floor 
I'll be loving you 
Like the water loves the shore Let it fall from your fingers 
Let it go, let it come 
I'll be loving you 
Like the summer loves the big blue sun 
The big blue sun 
The big blue sun
