Kevin wasn't really all that popular in school 
But I remember well the day I thought now that guy is pretty cool 
He pulled into the parking lot and everybody cheered 
'Cause he had gone and painted his entire Chevy Cavalier 
Camouflage (camouflage) Camouflage (camouflage) 
It disappears when it pulls out of his garage 
Camouflage (camouflage), camouflage I asked Penny to the prom and her mom knew how to sew 
So she made a matching tux and gown from Duckblind Mossy Oak 
We took pictures in the backyard before we went to the dance 
And the only thing you can see is our faces and our hands Camouflage (camouflage), camouflage (camouflage) 
You should have seen the way it popped with her corsage 
Camouflage (camouflage), 
Camouflage, ain't nothing that doesn't go with camouflage You can blend in in the country 
You can stand out in the fashion world 
Be invisible to a white tail 
Irresistible to redneck girl Camouflage (camouflage), camouflage 
Oh you're my favorite color camouflage (Get her done) You can blend in in the country 
You can stand out in the fashion world 
Be invisible to a white tail 
Irresistible to redneck girl Well the stars and bars offends some folks and I guess I see why 
Nowadays there's still a way to show your southern pride 
The only thing is patriotic as the old red white and blue 
Is green and gray and black and brown and tan all over too Camouflage (camouflage), camouflage (camouflage) 
Designed by mother nature and by God 
It's camouflage (camouflage), camouflage 
You're my favorite color camouflage (Get her done)
