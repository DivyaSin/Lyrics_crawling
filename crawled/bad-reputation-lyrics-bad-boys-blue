I hear the voice calling me. 
We're out on the road tonight. 
My baby's leaving me. 
'Cause I'm never home at night. I had a telephone. 
I'm in a hotel room. 
Someone's knocking at my door. 
It cannot be for me. 
I got a bad reputation. 
Bad reputation. I needed love in the heat of the night. 
You weren't around and I could not fight. 
I got a bad reputation. Oh, baby it hurts you so. 
But the show must go on. 
Tonight is another town. 
It goes on and on.
