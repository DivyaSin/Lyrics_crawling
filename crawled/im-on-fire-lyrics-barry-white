I'm On Fire It's no surprise, the way I feel 
When you look at me I know your love is real 
I never thought that I could feel this way And I'm on fire, baby fire 
I can't believe it's happening to me 
I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire 
And I will love you endlessly You touched my heart, you touched my soul 
You took this half a life and made it whole 
When we make love I lose control ohh Cause I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire 
I can't believe it's happening to me 
I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire 
And I will love you endlessly I hope that I will make you understand 
How very much you mean to me 
And the day we met, my life began 
Because your love has set me free Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire I hope that this will never end 
Cause I will never find a love like yours again 
And I'll feel this way until the end Cause baby I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire 
I can't believe it's happening to me 
I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire 
And I will love you endlessly 
Cause I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire 
Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire 
Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire
