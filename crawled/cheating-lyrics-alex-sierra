Do you ever think about cheating on me? 
Where would you go and who would it be? 
One of my friends or a celebrity 
Do you ever think about cheating on me? Do you ever think about a one night stand 
And leaving the club at three AM 
With a male model or a guy from a band 
Do you ever think about a one night stand? You can tell me "no" 
That's not an answer I believe 
There's not a single soul 
Who hasn't had a fantasy 
But on the other side, you know 
The grass ain't always green Do you ever, do you ever 
Think about cheating on me 
Do you ever, do you ever 
Think about cheating on me Do you ever think about breaking up 
Throwing in the towel 'cause you've had enough 
Turn around the corner 'cause the road looks bad 
Do you ever think about breaking up? You can tell me "no" 
That's not an answer I believe 
There's not a single soul 
Who hasn't had a fantasy 
But on the other side, you know 
The grass ain't always green Do you ever, do you ever 
Think about cheating on me 
Do you ever, do you ever 
Think about cheating on me La la la la, la la la la 
La la la la, la la la la On the other side, you know 
The grass ain't always green (oh) Do you ever, do you ever 
Think about cheating on me 
Do you ever, do you ever 
Think about cheating on me 
Do you ever, do you ever 
Think about cheating on me
