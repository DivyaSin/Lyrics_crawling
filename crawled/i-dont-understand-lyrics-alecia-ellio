There's a little girl livin' on the street 
I don't understand 
Turnin' tricks to get some some food to eat 
I don't understand 
There's a mama prayin' to god to bring her baby back 
I don't understand 
I don't understand There's a crack house down across the tracks 
I don't understand 
People tradin' smoke for cold hard cash 
I don't understand 
There's just no way this could be part of the greater plan 
I don't understand 
I don't understand Is everybody livin' in a world without windows 
Am I the only one who ses 
If this is all that's left of what was once the promise land,oh 
I just can't comprehend it 
I just don't understand There's a daddy walkin' out the door 
I don't understand 
Leavin' three kids who need him more 
Then he understands 
These days the trouble starts right where the family ends 
I don't understand 
I don't understand Is everybody livin' in a world without windows 
Am I the only one who ses 
If this is all that's left of what was once the promise land,oh 
I just can't comprehend it 
I just don't understand Is everybody livin' in a world without windows 
Am I the only one who ses 
If this is all that's left of what was once the promise land,oh 
I just can't comprehend it 
I just don't understand I don't understand
