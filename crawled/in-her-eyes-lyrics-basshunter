It's a Saturday night 
Nothing will go wrong 
But if it does do I care? 
I just don't know how to run 
It's a Saturday night 
And I hope you believe 
My heart is calling your name 
So hear me out when I say I can see it in her eyes 
When she turns to me and smiles 
Everything feels so right 
Until the morning light I can see it in her eyes 
When she turns to me and smiles 
Everything feels so right 
Until the morning light "Are you ready to party " It's a Saturday night 
Nothing will go wrong 
But if it does do I care? 
I just don't know how to run 
It's a Saturday night 
And I hope you believe 
My heart is calling your name 
So hear me out when I say I can see it in her eyes 
When she turns to me and smiles 
Everything feels so right 
Until the morning light "Are you ready" I can see it in her eyes
