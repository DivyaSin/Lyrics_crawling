I heard you were stranded 
Up in Tulsa, Oklahoma 
On an airport delay 
Oh what a day I just wanted to tell you 
That I miss you all of the time 
What else can I say 
Oh what a day I'd climb a mountain for you 
I'd cross a river for you 
I don't know what else to do 
I'd climb a mountain for you When you get back home 
I'll love you all of the time 
What else can I say 
Oh what a day I've heard it's very nice 
Up in Tulsa, Oklahoma 
But please come back to stay 
Oh what a day I'd climb a mountain for you 
I'd cross a river for you 
I don't know what else to do 
I'd climb a mountain for you I'd climb a mountain for you 
I'd cross a river for you 
I don't know what else to do 
I'd climb a mountain for you
