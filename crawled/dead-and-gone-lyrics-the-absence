When syllables go soundless 
The sensation kills you 
To the brink of burning 
From the fill of your filth 
Through the lacking of skill While walking through these walls 
I've come to find no unconditional I am now breeding fear 
Deep into your soul 
You may live on as nothing 
I am now dead and gone Reaching further into the void 
Past the gates of slumber, forever night To a non-believer, from a distance 
It seems much clearer 
The total loss of mind 
From suspended faith 
To where it must die I am now breeding fear 
Deep into your soul 
You may live on as nothing 
I am now dead and gone I am now breeding fear 
Deep into your soul 
You may live on as nothing 
I am now dead and gone It would be senseless to drag this out 
Anymore then time could wither 
Clock hands corrode Live on as nothing 
You'll live on as nothing While walking through these walls 
I've come to find no unconditional I am now breeding fear 
Deep into your soul 
You may live on as nothing 
I am now dead and gone I am now breeding fear 
Deep into your soul 
You may live on as nothing 
I am now dead and gone Breeding this fear deep in your soul 
I am now dead and gone
