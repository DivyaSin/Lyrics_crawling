I'm sorry, look what they've done to me 
Left my love behind to suit their fantasies 
I'm dying, why won't they just let me be? 
I once was carefree, now I'm all so lonely 
Baby, don't leave I'm lovin' everythin' about you 
Mad, 'cause everybody only wanna use you 
Physically and mentally abuse you 
Misuse you and can't even console you They only wanna get you dirty, treat you gully 
Get ya bloody, uh-huh, it's not funny 
Rappers bring ugly, straight to you 
But baby girl, I'm on my knees 'cause I love you I'm loving everything about you 
Inside, outside, that's right, in every molecule 
Forget the money, forget the cristal 
Princess to a queen, that's right, I wanna see you smile I'm lovin' everythin' about you, boo 
I'm lovin' everythin' about you, true 
I'm lovin' everythin' about you 
Pure love I spit, that's right, look what I bring to you 
I'm lovin' everythin' about you I'm sorry, look what they've done to me 
Left my love behind to suit their fantasies 
I'm dying, why won't they just let me be? 
I once was carefree, now I'm all so lonely 
Baby, don't leave I'm sorry for your mistreatments 
Frankly, I know you been mistreated 
Fake prophets, false off our favors of filthiness 
It's silliness, with no love for the culture Tryna get rich, yeah, it really makes me nautious 
They're the reason, some women, they have abortions 
Hip hop, you was my very first girlfriend 
I focused to spit it right, my songs are an offerin' Knowledge first, over beats, producers are samplin' 
Myself and creations, on the line as I offer in 
It's kinda sad that the toxins are smotherin' 
Youth in the hood, poisoned by instant messages Materialism, barbarianism, all types of isms 
And schisms by tainted vision 
I watched you grow from a seed into a forest 
I watered you and watered you but your flowers are dyin' I'm sorry, look what they've done to me 
Left my love behind to suit their fantasies 
I'm dying, why won't they just let me be? 
I once was carefree, now I'm all so lonely 
Baby, don't leave I'm lovin' everythin' about you 
Mad 'cause everybody only wanna use you 
I admit I used you, but together 
We have family, my album's in your name 
I'm loving your music beautifully, I feel you slippin' away Come here girl, uh-uh, can't have my love gone 
It's like En Vogue, I guess I gotta 'Hold On' 
I wanna drop it for the cause, I know you righteous 
Spit something from the heart, help clean up the virus 
Decapitate ferocious, peg leg rap pirates They only flowing now, 'cause the dough flowing now 
Who, what, when, why, where and how 
I'm sorry baby, that you've been used and abused 
And served like hell, some they say I'm a tattle tale 
If that when I see wrong done to you, you know I got to tell 
Tell, tell, tell, tell I'm sorry, look what they've done to me 
Left my love behind to suit their fantasies 
I'm dying, why won't they just let me be? 
I once was carefree, now I'm all so lonely 
Baby, don't leave No, baby, don't go 
No, baby, don't leave 
No, baby, don't go 
No, no, baby, don't leave 
No, baby, don't go 
No, baby, don't leave
