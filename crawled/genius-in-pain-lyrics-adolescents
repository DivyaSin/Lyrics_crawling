I don't really know which way to go 
What I really want to do 
Can't you see the pain overload behind mine eyes? Expecting mass perfection 
So the plan will carry through 
A gift from above? A curse in disguise? 
Can't find a soul who'll sympathize [Chorus:] 
I'm a genius in pain, I'm a genius in pain 
Try to keep a pace impossible to sustain 
I'm a genius in pain, I'm a genius in pain 
Well I've got to let the storm strike out of my brain 
I'm a genius in pain, I'm a genius in pain 
Said "Make no mistakes or it'll all go down the drain" 
I'm a genius in pain, I'm a genius in pain 
Said "Give me enough time and I'll go insane" Ad Hoc, Ad Loc, Quid Pro Quo 
So little time, so much to know 
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy 
The fuses blow Expecting mass obedience 
So my life will go as planned 
Is it my friend? Is it my foe? 
Too many directions that I can go [Chorus] When I snap, my springs unwind 
Will I take it out on you? 
Can't you see the danger signs behind mine eyes? Expecting mass destruction 
If it doesn't go my way 
Doesn't matter to me who lives or dies 
Never, No, never will I compromise! [Chorus] Genius! - In pain! 
Genius! - In pain! 
Genius! - In pain! 
Genius! - In pain! In pain! In pain! In pain!
