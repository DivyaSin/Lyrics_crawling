Come around when you're feeling low 
When you're down you can be sure 
That I am the one place you can go It's been a long long time 
And you haven't made up your mind 
It's been a long long day 
And there isn't enough to say 
It's been a long long night 
And there isn't an end in sight 
Oh 
but that's alright. Make a call when you want to know 
After all 
you should be sure 
That I am the one place you can go. It's been a long long road 
And we've still got a way to go 
It's been a long long song 
But we're gonna try rambling on 
Baby 
baby 
such a long long night 
And there isn't an end in sight 
Oh 
but that's alright. I'm heading back to where I've been 
But there's a change 
I can't get used to being free with you 
It's strange 
It's been a long (such a) long while 
Now I see you smile 
Nothing left to do but to let it rain Repeat last 2 verses
