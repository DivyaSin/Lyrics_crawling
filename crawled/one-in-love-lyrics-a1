Have you seen your sunset 
Fade beneath a raincloud 
Have you ever chased you dreams away 
Did you ever think that 
Life was just a highway 
A never ending road of lonely days There are times we cry 
And reach out to the sky 
For the strength we need 
To hold our head up high All we have to do now 
Is love one another 
Sisters and brothers 
Can all live as one 
And all we have to do now 
Is show one another 
We all need each other 
To live as one in love Have you seen a sunrise 
Promising you daylight 
When all you need is shelter from the storm 
Have you ever felt that 
Love was just an island 
You can't survive on love all on your own There are times when I 
Need to reach inside 
For the strength I need 
To hold my head up high All we have to do now 
Is love one another 
Sisters and brothers 
Can all live as one 
And all we have to do now 
Is show one another 
We all need each other 
To live as one in love If we push aside the blame 
For the tears and the pain 
You know love can reign 
And the world will smile again If we push aside the blame 
For the tears and the pain 
You know love can reign 
And the world will smile again
