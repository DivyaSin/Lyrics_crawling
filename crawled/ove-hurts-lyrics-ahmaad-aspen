Verse 1 
Midnight falls the day's end 
No phone calls where she at 
Up and down just looking 
For my baby to come back I'm going so crazy 
Trying to find my baby 
Where she at I don't no 
Its lost love this love hurts Pre-Chorus 
Just bring my baby back to me 
I don't care if I don't sleep 
Just bring my baby back to 
Me in my arms (yeah) Just bring my baby by my side 
I want to look straight in her eyes 
I need to know if she loves 
Me for me (yeah) Chorus 
This love hurts (yeah) 
I wanna go back 
Back to the way it use to be ( Oo woah) This love hurts (yeah) 
I wanna go back 
Back to the way it use to be ( Oo woah) 
Bring back my baby. Verse 2 
All the nations falling down 
My world is crumbling 
All hopes i've given up 
I just want my baby Tears pouring down my eyes 
The sun is slowly going 
Where is my baby 
Why won't she come back? Pre-Chorus 
Just bring my baby back to me 
I don't care if I don't sleep 
Just bring my baby back to 
Me in my arms (yeah) Just bring my baby by my side 
I want to look straight in her eyes 
I need to know if she loves 
Me for me (yeah) 
(Is this love?) 
(Is it for real?) 
(Let's go back) Chorus 
This love hurts (yeah) 
I wanna go back 
Back to the way it use to be ( Oo woah) This love hurts (yeah) 
I wanna go back 
Back to the way it use to be ( Oo woah) Spoken 
Someone ask me one day if love hurts 
This is my answer Verse 3
