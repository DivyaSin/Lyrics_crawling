I can love you, 
Without asking why 
See you, 
All that's in your eyes 
Knowing, there's no alibi, 
If I made you cry I can see you, like the morning sun 
Feel you, and I'm holding on 
Knowing, that I'm not alone 
Want to take you home And all of the flowers 
Seem to wither in their beds 
And say good night 
And all of the hours 
Seem to clear away the bad 
And make it right. And all of the flowers 
Seem to wither in their beds 
And say good night 
And all of the hours 
Seem to clear away the bad 
And make it right.
