There's a few more lonesome cities 
That I'd like to see 
While the wine of wondering 
Is still inside of me There's a few more pretty women 
That I'd like to know 
Bridge or two I'd like to cross 
A few more oats to sow Maybe when I've done it all 
Seen all there is to see, I'll find out 
I still cannot run away from me But as long as trains keep running 
Restless man I'll be And there's a few more lonesome cities 
That I've yet to see 
Maybe when I've done it all 
Seen all there is to see, I'll find out 
I still cannot run away from me But as long as trains keep running 
Restless man I'll be And there's a few more lonesome cities 
That I've yet to see 
One or two more lonesome cities 
That I've yet to see
