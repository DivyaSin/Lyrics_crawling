(Chorus) 
Operation Uppsala 
Operation Uppsala (Verse 1) 
Enemies of Jah them come to I and I 
Trying to take away my pride 
His Majesty was there and di angels of Jah 
We were all standing there in Uppsala 
Informer and police dem rush I and I 
And try to sabotage mi chanting 
But Uppsala reggae rise, di wicked man shall fall 
Cah victory shall bloom above them all (Chorus) 
Operation Uppsala

Operation Uppsala (Verse 2) 
Enemies of Jah dem lock up my teacha 
And couldnt even try to explain himself 
Dem carry him dung a station 
Abusing dem powa 
It all happen dung in Uppsala 
Di flashlight and di badge 
Di dogs and di gun 
Di plan was to find mi sensimilia 
Di monsta dem nuh like 
My Solomon herb 
The truth is written inna di Bible words (Chorus) 
Operation Uppsala

Operation Uppsala (Verse 3) 
When we do good babylon dem no like it 
If you do bad babylon dem no like it 
If you don't move babylon dem no like it 
If you just step babylon dem no like it 
Dem want fi run de masses cah dem a fascist 
No dem no like RastafarI dem a racist 
Dem neva accept King Selassie dem a prejudice 
Some police dem a move like dem a terrorist (Chorus)
