Cry 
Come to me and cry 
I know, I know, I know it's not easy 
Your heart is aching 
But so is mine, 
How can I tell you 
Why 
For so long, so long, so long, 
I've been thinking 
Now I know 
I can't live a lie They say true love lasts forever 
If we want it 
There will be waiting A second chance 
Baby but now we need time 
Time to learn 
Time to understand 
Where we went wrong 
'Cause I feel so strong 
We are cruising for bruising 
My Baby Go 
I must let you go 
Don't stop, don't stop 
'Cause it's better now 
When I still love you 
Don't say goodbye
