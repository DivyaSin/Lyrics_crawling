She spent the last of her teenage years 
At home alone with her worst fears 
When the telegraph came, she did not know who to blame [Chorus:] 
She walks alone  The War that took her husband's life 
It made a widow of his wife 
The world came crashing in, she made a haunt to rest with him [Chorus] She walks alone! She leaves the flowers on his grave 
The last one we forgot to save 
A note of long regrets, the pension checks are all she gets [Chorus]
