Your majesty 
Release your hold on me 
I'll never be 
One of your servants Your majesty 
Been awhile for me 
Now I see you 
For all that you are All that you are is all that I'm not 
All the pain you bring 
Unrest and rot 
I finally see what your pain 
Means to me My queen of hearts 
Just let me go 
Played the fool too long 
I'm full of sorrow 
Bleed them dry 
That's all you know 
My queen of hearts 
My sovereign of sorrow Your majesty take these chains off me 
My queen of hearts 
You've torn it all apart 
Take what you want 
Destroy what you touch 
Release your hold on me My queen of hearts 
Just let me go 
Played the fool too long 
I'm full of sorrow 
Bleed them dry 
That's all you know 
My queen of hearts 
My sovereign of sorrow Your majesty 
The sun has set on you 
And me 
We were never fit 
For eternity Your majesty 
Look what you've done 
To me 
Now see me 
For all that I am All that you are 
Is all that I'm not 
All the pain you bring 
Unrest and rot 
I finally see 
What your pain 
Means to me My queen of hearts 
Just let me go 
Played the fool too long 
I'm full of sorrow 
Bleed them dry 
That's all you know 
My queen of hearts 
My sovereign of sorrow This is the end of your rule 
I won't play this game anymore 
Won't be your fool Sovereign of sorrow
