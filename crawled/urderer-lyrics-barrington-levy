[Barrington Levy:] 
Unoheal, Unoheal (Rock a bet) 
Murderer [Repeat x 4] [Rakim:] 
Who want low boats of keys from overseas 
Then put it in the streets and spread like a disease 
Neighborhoods infected then misdirected 
It ain't no cure and it's hard to correct it 
Bless by the most high cursed by the lowest 
Used to think the quick now thoughts travel the slowest 
Close to comatose brain waves rigamortist 
You forget the skit the most high tortoise 
I remember so they want to murder RA 
Know what I mean because I got knowledge of self 
Yeah I know, you probably don't believe me 
But be easy I'm gonna leave it up to Barrington Levy [Barrington Levy:] 
Who gone test, No man curse 
That prejudge end up a hearse, who God bless no man curse 
I'm gonna end up in a hearse, because they maskata 
Murderer [Repeat x 4] [Rakim:] 
Here they come, known blood-suckers of the poor 
Rob us for culture and now they want more 
Caution they come in many forms of identity 
A lot to suspect so detect the enemy 
Worst than a mosquito or a vampire, 
They're not sitting at the movies or a campfire 
Huh, yeah, I know you don't believe me, be easy I'm gonna leave it to 
Barrington Levy [Barrington Levy:] 
They let me tell me that I'm a murderer 
Dress up in a jacket, then dress up in a tie 
Want to deprive 
I'm a murderer 
Murderer [Repeat x 4] 
Not them. 
Murderer [Repeat x 2] [Rakim:] 
Bless by the most high, cursed by the lowest 
Used to think the quick now thoughts travel the slowest 
Close to comatose, brain waves rigamortist 
You forget the skit, the most high tortoise 
I remember so they want to murder RA [Barrington Levy:] 
Murderer [Repeat x 4] [Rakim:]

Watch them, watch them, watch them unfold. [Repeat x 5]

'Cause I got knowledge of self [Repeat x 4]
