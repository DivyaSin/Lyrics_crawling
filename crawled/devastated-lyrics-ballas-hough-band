She eats me up alive, 
The category five, 
She's like a hurricane 
She don't come with no directions, 
She keeps me guessing, 
And it hurts my brain She can do what she wants with me, 
I'm a wheeling casualty [Chorus] 
She got angel eyes, 
I can't deny, 
Look what God created, 
She leaves me devastated, 
She loves me blind, 
It should be a crime, 
She knows how to play it, 
She leaves me devastated Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
She leaves me devastated 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Can't refuse about anything, 
She got that something you just dream about 
That girl ought to be my ruin, 
What she's doing, 
I can't live without She can do what she wants with me, 
I'm a wheeling casualty [Chorus] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
She leaves me devastated 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I don't know why she loves me, 
I don't care, 
Because we got something going, 
Something going on, 
Don't try to save me, 
Cos I'm too far, too far gone [Chorus] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
She leaves me devastated 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
She leaves me devastated 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
