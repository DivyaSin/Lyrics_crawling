Is it getting better or do you feel the same? 
Will it make it easier on you now? 
You got someone to blame You say one love, one life 
It's one need in the night 
One love, you get to share it 
It'll leave you baby if you don't care for it Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth? 
You act like you never had love 
You want me to go without Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light 
We're one but we're not the same 
We gotta carry each other, carry each other 
One Have you come here for forgiveness? 
Have you come to raise the dead? 
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head? Did I ask too much, more than a lot? 
You gave me nothing, now it's all that I got 
We're one but we're not the same 
We hurt each other then we do it again You say love is a temple, love is a higher law 
Love is a temple, love is the higher law 
You ask me to enter then you make me crawl 
And I can't keep on holding on to what you got 
When all you got is hurt One love, one blood 
One life, you gotta do what you should 
One life with each other, my sisters and my brothers One life but we're not the same 
Gotta carry each other, carry each other 
One, one, one, one
