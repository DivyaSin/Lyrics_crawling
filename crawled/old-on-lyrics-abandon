She sits alone and wonders 
When is the end of broken dreams? 
This isn't what I pictured 
She says as tears run down her cheeks She needs a friend beside her 
She's looking for a savior Hold on, hold on 
Someone will find you 
Hold on, hold on 
Somebody loves you She grabs her coat to leave 
So sure it's gonna be the end 
Another broken family 
Tears are her only friends This isn't the life they wanted 
She's hoping that heaven comes through Hold on, hold on 
Someone will find you 
Hold on, hold on 
Somebody loves you Yeah, hold on, hold on 
You're not drowning this time Hold on, hold on 
Look for the search lights Does anybody care? Do you even see? 
Look past my skin, do you see me? 
Do you even know what I'm going through? 
I need to talk to someone, can I talk to you? Does anybody care? Does anybody care? 
Does anybody care? Oh Hold on, hold on 
Someone will find you 
Hold on, hold on 
Somebody loves you, yeah Hold on, hold on 
You're not drowning this time 
Hold on, hold on 
Look for the search lights Hold on, hold on 
Hold on, hold on 
Hold on, hold on
