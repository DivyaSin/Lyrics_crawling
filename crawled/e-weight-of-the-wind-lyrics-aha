Your face looked new against the town 
You've come to lose some memories 
Like you I've came to touch new grounds But you want to lose 
The weight of the wind (of the wind) 
Rests hard on your shoulders 
Bringing you down (down down) 
The one that you love (love} 
Will never be found! You speak into the falling rain 
Words you'd lost, but found again 
I see their snakey arms entwined 
So clear and cruel 
In your jealous mind! But you've got to lose 
The weight of the wind (of the wind) 
Hard on your shoulders 
I know what that means {down down) 
The one that you love (love) 
Will never be found!
