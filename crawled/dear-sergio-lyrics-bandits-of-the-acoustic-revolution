Run, run, run all you do is fucking run 
But youll never run away from yourself 
I know its hard but youve been there before 
And you know youre gonna be there again I dont care what the stars may say 
Because they always feed their bullshit to me 
Its kinda sad how you lost what you had 
And youre never gonna have it again and so I say Hey Sergio, its getting kind of hot in here 
And so I say, hey Sergio, youve got to get us out of here 
And so I say, hey Every other day you dont care what they say 
Because they always leave you two steps behind 
You try to smile and it lasts for a while 
But they always send you back to the start Eenie, meenie, miney, mo they shoot down everyone 
Yu know and then they leave you there all alone 
You wish theyd stop but they never give up 
And you know deep inside that youre stuck and so I say Hey Sergio, its getting kind of hot in here 
And so I say, hey Sergio, youve got to get us out of here 
And so I say, hey Sergio laughed for the last time today 
He said, It never really bothered me 
We all have dues to pay like a man 
Thats cut off at the knee He hobbles and hobbles because nothing is free 
So wake up, wake up, wake up but dont cry 
Because youll fuck up your make-up and if you do 
You wont get laid, you wont make money No you wont get paid, so you act so free 
You act so free, everybodys happy 
Because, you act so free, well you might fool them 
But you cant fool me with your mindless chatter 
Like I dont need them, I dont need help 
I dont even need to see the end Hey Sergio, its getting kind of hot in here 
And so I say, hey Sergio, youve got to get us out of here 
And so I say, hey
