Thinking you could be my Romeo tonight 
I bet you wanna taste it 
I got what you've been looking for

Think of all the things we'd like to do and say 
To get syncopated 
Body close to body till harmony They say Italians do it better, Italians do it better 
They say Italians do it better 
You proved them wrong, you do it better Because everything I want I get 
And baby, baby, yeah you're next, you bet 
Everything I want I get 
Tell me if you can handle it Slow down, I think I love this baby 
Throw down, don't keep me waiting
