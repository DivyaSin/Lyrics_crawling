Oh I stumbled in all wide-eyed 
To the computer show 
I didn't have a passport 
So they turned me into snow 
They turned me into snow Follow you follow you follow you follow you 
Into every store 
Follow you follow you follow you follow you 
Tell me what I'm for 
Tell me what I'm for Oh I stumbled in all wide-eyed 
To the computer show 
I didn't have my passport 
So they turned me into snow 
They turned me into snow Follow you follow you follow you follow you 
Into every store 
Follow you follow you follow you follow you 
Tell me what I'm for You caught my eye against your eye 
Deep inside the crowd 
You hung me from the hooks inside 
My asshole and my mouth 
My asshole and my mouth Follow you follow you follow you follow you 
Into every store 
Follow you follow you follow you follow you 
Tell me what I'm for 
Tell me what I'm for I stumbled in all wide-eyed 
To the computer show 
I didn't have my passport 
So they turned me into snow 
They turned me into snow 
They turned me into snow 
Take me home with you 
Take me home with you You needed to read the computer magazine 
To know that you liked computers 
To go to the computer show 
To see me standing there 
To take me home with you 
I need to go home with you 
I can't go home without going home with you
