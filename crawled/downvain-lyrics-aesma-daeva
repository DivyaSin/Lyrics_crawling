Flow my tears, fall from your springs, 
Exiled for ever, let me mourn. Flow my tears, fall from your springs, 
Exiled for ever, let me mourn 
Where night's black bird her sad infamy sings, 
There let me live forever. (Light doth but shame disclose) Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell! Down vain lights, shine you no more, 
No nights are dark enough for those 
That in despair their lost fortunes deplore; 
There let me live forever. (Light doth but shame disclose) Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell, 
Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell, 
Learn to contemn light; 
Happy, they that in hell 
Feel not the world's despite. Aaaa-aaah... Hark you shadows, there let me live forever. [Lyrics from John Dowland's (1563-1626) "Flow my tears"]
