Faith pours from your walls, drowning your calls, 
I've tried to hear, you're not near. 
Remembering when I saw your face, 
Shining my way, pure timing. 
Now I've fallen in deep, slow silent sleep, 
It's killing me, I'm dying. To put a little sunshine in your life. Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me. 
Soleil all over you 
Warm sun. Now this slick fallen rift, 
Came like a gift, 
Your body moves ever nearer 
And your will dry this tear Now that we're here, and grieve for me, not history 
But now I'm dry of thoughts, wait for the rain, 
Then it's replaced, sun setting And suddenly we're in love with everything. Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me. 
Soleil all over you 
Warm sun.
