I want to see ya bounce Welcome to the party 
This is one of a kind 
Like a hot chilli pepper 
It'll blow your mind 
Don't know if you can take it 
Tonight we're gonna shake it 
And if you can't 
Getcha under house arrest It's like this 
We've got the crazy notion 
DJ's feedin'us a jumpin' potion 
So come on everybody throw your hands in the air 
We're givin' it uno, dos, tres 
Oh yeah Ya gotta get up 
To get it down 
(Come on, come on) 
When the beat kicks in 
And you feel the swing 
Just don't stand around Are you ready to jump 
Gonna funk around 
(Come on, come on) 
When the beat kicks in 
Let the fun begin 
Don't stop now cause I want to see ya bounce [Chorus x2] 
Livin' it up 
Cause we're here to party 
With a bouncey, bouncey 
Gonna make you happy 
Playin' the disco bongo with me 
And a bouncey, bouncey 
Come dance with me Stop the tracks 
Can't you see it's not enough 
It's the vinyl bliss 
And he's coming on tough 
They say "Turn it down"
