Sit back and put your 
Toys aside for a while 
It ain't war if that's what you like 
Somebody said I'm in for the fight 
It ain't mine if that's alright Ain't trading pigs for swine x2 
All the suits they stand in line 
But all they do is fantasize 
Sicker than the first 
Got no hunger and no thirst 
It's not workin' 
It ain't working 
Thick it's gonna burst medication 
Is the curse 
It's not working Lookout, you're looking 
Like the black in the dark 
It ain't bright to live on the lie 
Somebody said I'm losing my spark 
It ain't so, but that's alright Ain't trading pigs for swine 
Ain't trading pigs for swine 
All the suits they stand in line 
But all they do is fantasize 
Sicker than the first 
Got no hunger and no thirst 
It's not workin' 
It ain't working 
Thick it's gonna burst medication 
Is the curse 
It's not working Only the pigs of the irony 
Stealing swines from the enemy 
Only the pigs 
Only the pigs All the suits they stand in line 
But all they do is fantasize Sicker than the first 
Got no hunger and no thirst 
It's not workin' 
It ain't working 
Thick it's gonna burst medication 
Is the curse 
It's not working 
It's not working 
It ain't working 
It's not working 
It ain't working
