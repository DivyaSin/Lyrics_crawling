Mr. Wallace Wood 
So life's not very good? 
But it's real 
So please just let me know 
If you're ready to go 
If it's real Hello kid Cobain 
I can feel the pain 
'cos it's real 
So please just let me know 
If you're ready to go 
If it's real If it's tragic 
You're feeling low 
You're dying to leave the show 
A word before you go... Now turn around 
And waltz away 
And dream of something else 
Now turn around 
Your point of view 
And look inside 
A new kaleidoscope 
Dream the calliope 
End the anxiety 
Then when you get there 
You will be somewhere Diane Linkletter 
Do you feel better?

So please just let me know 
What you're wanting to say 
Is it real? Marilyn Monroe 
Is it to be free?

And waltz away 
And dream of something else 
Now turn around 
Your point of view 
And look inside 
A new kaleidoscope 
Now turn around Now turn around 
And waltz away 
And dream of something else 
Now turn around 
Your point of view 
And look inside 
A new kaleidoscope 
Dream the calliope 
End the anxiety 
Then when you get there 
You will be somewhere
