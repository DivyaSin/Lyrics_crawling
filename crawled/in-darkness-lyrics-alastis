Why so many obstacles on my way. 
Why these creatures 
Whirl `round on me? 
I want to know who do they obey. 
Which occult strength manages them? I'm living in darkness 
Far from this world 
I'm living in my dreams 
My own legend Their infernal sound 
Leads me to sink into folly 
How to overcome this fear 
Which paralyzes me? 
Let me dream of a real existence 
Far from this world 
Of suffering and anxiety... I'm living in darkness 
I'm seeking the truth 
Hess living in my brain 
The fallen angel Let me dive into the seeking serenity 
Let me live my own legend 
Find the answers 
Which are eluding me 
Understand the meaning 
Of my non existence 
Let me dream of a real existence... I'm living in darkness 
I'm fighting for freedom 
I'm living in my dreams 
My own legend No doubt. Beyond this zone of terror 
Will find all the answers 
No doubt. The try to stop me 
But Ill fight. Cause even if the price 
Of the knowledge consists of suffering 
Even if the path to the eternal passes 
In transit to hell Ill go to the end 
To the end of my dreams
