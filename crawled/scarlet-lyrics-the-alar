I 
Dream in red 
Of the things 
That this world could be 
And is not 
I 
Walk in the glow 
Of a thousand candles 
Burning, burning slow 
Sunrise 
Sunset 
Daylight 
Daybreak 
Watching 
Waiting 
Hoping 
Asking 
Begging 
Pleading 
Shouting Scarlet Red 
Scarlet Red 
Scarlet Red 
Scarlet Red 
Scarlet Blood 
On the page 
Of a thousand words 
I've written 
Can't express 
I 
Walk in the light 
Of a world I wish 
I wish to set on fire Sunrise 
Sunset 
Daylight 
Daybreak 
Watching 
Waiting 
Hoping 
Asking 
Begging 
Pleading 
Shouting Scarlet Red 
Scarlet Red 
Scarlet Red 
Scarlet Red Sunrise
