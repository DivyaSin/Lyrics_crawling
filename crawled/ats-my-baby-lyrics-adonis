[Chorus] 
That's my, That's my (3x) That's my, Thats my baby 
That's my, Thats my baby(4x) [Adonis-Verse1] You have every right to be mad 
Cuase you may baby, but i know you'll be alright, sometime i feel like you impatient and thats when i got to step in and save the night I'm so in love....., But what we got to do just to put up a fight, Maybe make love..... And i'm still on the scene like i dress to kill left the market, is what they call it, and my heart can't take games at your own will,spin it again and you'll see, that you are not a loser baby you everything [Chorus] 
Thats my, Thats my baby 
Thats my, Thats my baby(8x) [Adonis-Verse2]Cupid got a gun, and baby we got time to run, so his bullets are gold, and my heart is full of it, and i see the leprechaun, but he can't read my palm, so i guess i'm on this journey all along.... (But baby send me a flare baby) Maybe that get me out of here,we in the UK, like donatella ware,and i know you can't hear it, so when you smile, I smile back to secure it 
yea that make me laugh, cuase baby you the one, and they the pass [Chorus] 
That's my, That's my baby 
That's my, That's my baby(8x) [bridge] 
You are... 
you all i have 
and i want to be with you forever (Yeaaaaaaa) 
You are... 
You all i have and i want to be with you forever 
(yea,yea,yea,yea) [Chorus] 
That's my, That's my baby 
That's my, That's my baby(8x)
