If I were God I would do 
all the things I'd like to do 
I would never go to work 
or pay attention to some jerk 
I would jump from every mountain 
I would sail the seven seas 
I would fly up in the sky 
if God was me If I were God I would see 
all the things I never see 
I would always be with you 
and make all your dreams come true 
I would fill your days with laughter 
I would live a million years 
We'd be happy ever after 
They would never see our tears 
Guess how wonderful it would be 
if God was me yea... I would save the seals from dying 
I would rip down all my chains 
I would always stop your crying 
and make sunshine when it rains There won't be no thing as time 
I would find the perfect rhyme 
everyone would love this song 
there won't be no right or wrong 
I'd uncover every liar 
talk to birds and walk on fire 
print my picture in the paper 
I would have my private baker 
how wonderful it would be 
if God was me hmm... how wonderful it would be 
if God was me
