Mother, did you watch? 
Everything is sold 
Mother, can't you tell the new routine 
It went so well? I was worried just a touch 
That it might have been too much 
Just a bit, well, rather, free But just listen to that crowd 
Why, they've never been so loud 
Screaming only for me Meg And the master must have heard 
Every note and every word 
Mother, tell me, did he see? Meg, stop it Even he will now concede 
I'm the only he'll need Mother, what's wrong? Meg, sweet fool 
You did all that you could 
Shining bright 
And yet still not enough Wh-what do you mean? How you danced 
They're all entranced 
Yes, all but the one 
Whose entrancement we sought He wasn't there? Where, poor girl 
Do you think that he was? 
Yes, that's right 
In with her all along With Christine? Claiming of their son they love 
Too smitten to spare you 
One moment of thought But you said All that you gave him 
It's all been a waste You were wrong All that you've done 
It has all been a waste Don't say that Now he has them 
As for us we have 
Both been replaced No
