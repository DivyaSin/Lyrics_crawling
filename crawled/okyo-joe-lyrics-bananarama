My girly Friday she's no square 
She like lotus blossom in her hair 
Be-bop records and something new 
Sometimes borrowed but shes never blue 
Oh no........not Tokyo Joe 
Way past midnight - she's not home 
She cut the ice down the danger zone 
Water-tight suit, she dont care 
A trifle risque, a tart, no sir........ 
Oh no........sounds like Tokyo Joe 
Geisha girl show you she adores you 
Two oriental eyes implore you 
Femme fatale or ingenue? 
She's very cunning, fiendish clever 
Geisha girl suffer many times a fool 
Sayonara moon 
When all the worlds a stage, oh where are you? 
Tokyo rose on the radio 
Or diz n bird puttin on the moan 
Tappin out telexes to tupelo 
Dear John, doh ray me fah so? 
Lets go........call for Tokyo Joe 
Walkin tall down the danger zone 
He hokey-cokey till the cows come home 
Big shot - from the hip - neon cool 
Say, when youve been around, whats left to do? 
Dont know? ask Tokyo Joe 
So inscrutable her reply 
Ask no question and tell me no lies 
G.I girls howlin out for more 
Vips purrin je tadore........ 
Ah so........thats Tokyo Joe
