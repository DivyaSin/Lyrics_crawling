A union made in the heavens 
Untouched by an outside world 
Driven by the needs of lovers 
To the beauty of the One unearthed 
Sanctify, mystify 
A vision of the light 
Sacrifice the gift of life 
Above the sky there no higher A love that scales mountains 
(Hell or high water) 
A love that is oceans deep 
A love to set us free In paradise lost they found it 
On the slums of a shanty town floor 
They're driven down the roads of Mordor 
By a hurricane gale force Sanctify, mystify 
A vision of the light 
Sacrifice the gift of life 
Above the sky there no higher A love that scales mountains 
(Hell or high water) 
A love that is oceans deep 
A love to set us free A love that scales mountains 
(Hell or high water) 
A love that is oceans deep 
Hell or high water Written in the pages of a book 
Only some have read 
Spoken in a tongue only lovers hear 
With a whisper 
With a scream A love that scales mountains 
(Hell or high water) 
A love that is oceans deep 
A love to set us free A love that scales mountains 
(Hell or high water) 
A love that is oceans deep 
Hell or high water 
Hell or high water (Hell or high water) 
(Hell or high water) 
Driven by the needs of lovers 
(Hell or high water) 
Driven by the needs of lovers 
(Hell or high water)
