The anger won't leave me 
My blood still runs cold 
Forget all the glamor 
Forget all the gold Are you listening? Do you even care? Am I just a face or someone you trust? 
I fire on the mountain, a stranger on the bus 
A book without an ending, a rumor we all know 
Is true I'm just a book without an ending 
When I cry it means nothing 
Well I do, I am 
And I scream for you I'm surrounded by the poisons 
That feed off of greed 
I keep on laughing 
You're not taking this from me 
I'm book without ending, a rumor we all know 
Is true Just a book without an ending 
When I cry it means nothing 
Well I do, I am 
And I scream for you 
When I bleed it means nothing 
Well I do, I am 
And I scream for you I can't seem to learn 
The signs of being 
Who I am 
So I scream for you I don't know why 
I keep missing signs 
I'm loosing it 
I scream for you When I cry it means nothing 
Well I do, I am 
And I scream for you 
When I bleed it means nothing 
Well I do, I am 
And I scream for you 
And I scream for you 
And I scream for you
