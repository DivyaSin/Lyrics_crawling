Many fucking disappointments I experienced in my worthless life 
Only the dominion of loneliness is inhabiting me, like a curse 
So many days without a smile, just distorted grimaces around me 
Damned to drag myself on through a desert full of desparation [Refrain] 
Can somebody please tell me why this is happening to me?!! 
Please tell me my name! I did forget it forever 
Alone and deprived of all my value in this world 
Slowly I'm turning my head towards death's door 
(x2) Suffering from many sores life has slashed into my heart 
Beloved friends died for fucking nothing 
Deep wounds I'm licking but they won't heal 
Damned to scrape a living of sadness and senselessness (Refrain) My soul is black without a candle illuminating the holes in it 
Darkness fills my lamed extremities 
My heart is bleeding from within, fucking blood! 
I'm shedding bloody tears from my pale cold eyes My heart is bleeding from within, fucking blood! 
I'm shedding bloody tears from my pale cold eyes Alone and deprived of all my value in this world 
Slowly I'm turning my head towards death's door (Refrain) I wanted to taste the beauty of love and life 
But these symbols are vanishing and rotting before me 
I'm a failure and will approach the landscape of no hope. 
No one has ever cared or even recognized my departure I'm a failure and will approach the landscape of no hope 
No one has ever cared or even recognized my departure
