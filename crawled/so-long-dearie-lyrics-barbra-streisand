Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
Don't try to stop me, Horace, please Wave your little hand and whisper so long dearie 
You ain't gonna see me anymore 
And when you discover that your life is dreary 
Don't you come knockin' at my door 'Cause I'll be all dolled up and singin' that song 
That says, "You dog, I told you so" 
So wave your little hand and whisper so long dearie 
Dearie, should have said so long, so long ago Because you've treated me so rotten and rough 
I've had enough of feelin' low 
So wave your little hand and whisper, so long dearie 
Dearie would have said so long, so long ago For I can hear that Choo Choo callin' me on 
To a fancy new address 
Yes, I can hear that Choo Choo callin' me on 
On board that Happiness Express I'm gonna learn to dance and drink and smoke a cigarette 
I'm goin' as far away from Yonkers as a girl can get 
So and on those cold winter nights, Horace 
You can snuggle up to your cash register It's a bit lumpy but it rings, don't come knockin' 
I'll be all dolled up and singin' that song 
That says, "You dog, I told you so" So Horace, you will find your life a sad old story 
You'll be livin' in that lonesome territory 
When you see your Dolly shuffle off to glory Oh, I should have said so long 
How could I have been wrong? 
Oh, I should have said so long 
So long ago
