Moonshine on the bayou 
Love shrine break the taboo 
I wanna know what's in your potion 
Bound by total devotion I was looking for love all over 
You're the hunter and I'm your prey 
Now I'm lost and love ain't over 
I try to leave but I have to stay 'Cause it's voodoo (under your spell) 
'Cause it's voodoo (under your spell) Swamp scenes, all love beside 
Snakes bites, aligning stars 
I'm in rapture there is no cure 
No sanctuary from your allure I was looking for love all over 
You're the hunter and I'm your prey 
Now I'm lost and love ain't over 
I try to leave but I have to stay 'Cause it's voodoo (under your spell) 
'Cause it's voodoo (under your spell) Cos the voodoo you do is all that can do, make me into your fool 
Cos when you do voodoo I'm just like a doll that the pins keep pushing into 
So every time I try to break this trance 
I'm almost afraid I miss my chance to be bewitched violent by you 
I just gotta say I want your hex 
I don't want to live without your hex 
I'm so obsessed with your sexiness 'Cause it's voodoo (under your spell) 
'Cause it's voodoo (under your spell) 
'Cause it's voodoo (under your spell) 
'Cause it's voodoo (under your spell) So obsessed with your sexiness
