When you look into a night sky 
You see the stars far away 
You're seeing them because of the light 
Which travels from them to you Now it takes time for light to travel here 
So what you're doing is seeing the stars as they were in the past 
The amount of time it has taken for the light to reach us 
And the further and further away those stars are 
The further back in time you are looking Now you are seeing a star that is say six thousand years ago 
Imagine somebody on that star looking at us 
They would be seeing us as we were six thousand years ago 
Which of those two is now? So space and time are linked together 
As we are looking across space, we are looking back in time
