Tonight, tonight I say goodbye 
To everyone who loves me 
Stick it to my enemies, tonight 
Then I disappear 
Bathe my path in shining light 
Set the dials to thrill me 
Every secret has its price 
This one's set to kill Too loose, too tight, too dark, too bright 
A lie, the truth, which one should I use? 
If the lie succeeds 
Then you'll know what I mean 
When I tell you I have secrets 
To attend Do you think I'm beautiful? 
Or do you think I'm evil? 
Will you take me for a ride? 
The one that never ends 
Too loose, too tight, too dark, too bright 
A lie, the truth, which one shall I use? 
If the lie succeeds 
Then you'll know what I mean 
When I tell you I have secrets 
To attend Tonight, tonight I say goodbye 
To everything that thrills me 
As I throw the chains 
I forged in life 
To shatter on the floor
