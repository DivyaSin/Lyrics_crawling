Well all the boy's in my hometown are celebrating 
'Cause she's turned eighteen 
They all think that she's just the cutest 
They've ever seen 
Well now she's grown up 
And they've all shown up At last she's turned eighteen 
At last she's turned eighteen 
At last that girl that lives across the street 
Has turned eighteen, teen, teen 
Ooh ah ooh ah Well farmer Thompson really knows how to grow 'em 
If you know what I mean 
He's been sittin' on the porch with his shot gun 
And he don't miss a thing 
She's been locked up 
Now they've all rocked up
