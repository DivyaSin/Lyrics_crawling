I heard the bells on Christmas day 
Their old familiar carols play, 
And wild and sweet the words repeat 
Of peace on earth, good will to men. And thought how, as the day had come, 
The belfries of all Christendom 
Had rolled along the unbroken song 
Of peace on earth, good will to men. Till ringing, singing on its way 
The world revolved from night to day, 
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime 
Of peace on earth, good will to men. And in despair I bowed my head 
"There is no peace on earth," I said, 
"For hate is strong and mocks the song 
Of peace on earth, good will to men."
