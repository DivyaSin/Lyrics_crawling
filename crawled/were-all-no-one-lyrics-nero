You do your best. 
You take the fall. 
You reminisce. 
About almost nearly having it all. You see the stars 
You try and catch one 
ooooh 
You tried so hard 
Chasing, nothing Because, 
We're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone 
'Til then we're no one 
And you got me looking at you I said we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone 
'til then we're no one 
And you got me looking at you, looking at you We're all the same 
We all have hopes 
Ohh it gets insane 
When you're slipping down that downward slope 
I come with peace, 
I offer love. 
So if you're hearing me, 
Then hurry baby, 
Give it up. Because, 
We're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone 
'Til then we're no one 
And you got me looking at you I said we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone 
'Til then we're no one 
And you got me looking at you I said we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone 
'Til then we're no one 
And you got me looking at you I said we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone Oh! 
C'mon 
Oooooh! 
C'mon Do ya best. we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone 
'Til then we're no one 
And you got me looking at you, looking at you I said we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone 
'Til then we're no one 
And you got me looking at you, looking at you.
