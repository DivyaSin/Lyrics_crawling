Frosty the snowman 
Was a jolly, happy soul 
With the corn cup hat and button nose 
And two eyes made out of coal Frosty the snowman 
Is a fairy tale they say 
He was made of snow but the children know 
How he came to life one day There must have been some magic 
In that old silk hat they found 
For when they placed it on his head 
He began to dance all around Oh, frosty the snowman 
Was as alive as he could be 
And the children say, he could laugh and play 
Just the same as you and me Frosty the snowman 
Knew the sun was hot that day 
So he said, "Let's run and have some fun 
Before I melt away" Down to the village 
With the broom-stick in his hand 
Running here and there all around that square 
Saying, "Catch me if you can" He led them down the street of town 
Right to the traffic cop 
And he only paused a moment when 
He heard him howler, "Stop" For Frosty the snowman 
Had to hurry on his way 
But he waved goodbye, saying, "Please don't cry 
I'll be back again someday" Thumpdy, thump, thump, thumpdy, thump, thump 
Look at Frosty go 
Thumpdy, thump, thump, thumpdy, thump, thump 
Over the hills of snow
