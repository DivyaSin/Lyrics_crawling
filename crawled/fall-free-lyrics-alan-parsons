What's the use of worrying if we'll be here tomorrow 
All we need to be is here today 
Don't care if you're rich or if you have to beg and borrow 
You can always find a way Dive and breakaway Fall free, freedom's in the air 
It's calling you, your heart is there 
Fall free, blaze across the sky 
The perfect fall, the perfect high Mother earth looks peaceful as we climb towards the ceiling 
We must be ten thousand feet or more 
Hear the wind rush screaming while we fight to curb our feelings 
As we stand beside the door Let our spirits soar Fall free, freedom's in the air 
It's calling you, your heart is there 
Fall free, blaze across the sky 
The perfect fall, the perfect high Fall free, freedom's in the air 
It's calling you, your heart is there 
Fall free, blaze across the sky 
The perfect fall, the perfect high
