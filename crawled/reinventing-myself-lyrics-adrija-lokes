Blankly staring at the street 
Thinking of all I need 
Nothing really comes into my mind All the crazy ideas that were there 
All the stories I wanted to share 
They've just vanished with the time I can feel the wind on my face 
In this weird kind of daze 
There's a whirlwind on nothingness I don't know what to do 
Sit around or play it cool 
Maybe I could just stare at my shoes Pre chorus- This emptiness just keeps coming around like 
Coming around like 
The past just keeps haunting me like 
Haunting me like Chorus- I don't wanna be the object you made of me 
No I don't wanna be the same 
So I'm just gonna lie around today 
I'm just reinventing myself Talk about day after today 
Have to wake up to a new play 
All the characters are brand new But that's just in my head 
"It's a dream", having that said 
Be lost in the same Now I'm back in my bed 
Staring at the ceiling, like I said 
Exploring this nothingness I'm in I'm glad you left me this way 
To myself not I have all day 
To sweep off the floor of my head
