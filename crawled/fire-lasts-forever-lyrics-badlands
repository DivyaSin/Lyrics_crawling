So woman, you give it all to me 
Sweet child, more than I could bare 
For the years gone by, traveled through the year 
Sweet child, more than I could bare 
We shared some hard times 
Oh yes, we have 
We've been through the sad times 
But they're the best I ever had 
Yes, it was 
Well, I seen blue skies headin' on my way 
Take my hand, walk that extra mile 
Story's almost over 
Pages are still turning 
Aahhh, the fire lasts forever 
Let it be my baby girl 
It's time to set me free 
Travelin' on this road for much too long 
Long line, long line, long line 
Until the search that I fly 
Long lines tellin' in these hands 
Shared some hard times 
Oh yes, we have 
Been through sad times 
But they're the best I ever had 
Well, I seen blue skies headin' on my way 
Take my hand, walk that extra mile 
Story's almost over 
Pages are still turning 
Aaahh, the fire lasts forever 
Well, I seen blue skies headin' on my way 
Take my hand, walk that extra mile 
Story's almost over 
Pages are still turning 
Aaahh, the fire lasts forever 
Well, I seen blue skies headin' on my way 
Take my hand, walk that extra mile 
Story's almost over 
Pages are still turning 
Aaahh, the fire lasts forever
