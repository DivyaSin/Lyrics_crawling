Go! Out of the Blue! 
Take advance of your fear 
Go! Out of mind! 
I'm gonna do it just for you 
Nothing gonna changin' my world 
Just right! 
Nothing gonna changin' my world Go! Out of sight! 
You had better do it now 
Go! I know better than to do such a thing 
Nothing gonna changin' my world 
Just right! 
Nothing gonna changin' my world Whoa-oh-oh oh-oh! 
Don't ask me why 
So! I don't want you here! Just right now go! 
Whoa! All I want 
You can't hide it! 
Lonely only one
