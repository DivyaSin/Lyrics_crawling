Open your eyes, take a look, if you follow I will lead the way 
It's never the same looking back, we don't wanna live in yesterday 
You and I are alright because together we're the lock and the key 
Come on put your hand in my hand, live far from it we can both be free Cause you~ you make me feel Always when I see you darling, you're up in the clouds above 
And baby tonight, you got me so damn high that I think this could be love 
And tell me if you think sometimes that the feeling gets too much 
Cause baby tonight you got me so messed up that I think this could be love Something unknown now I seen twas only you who woke me up from the daze 
That we'll surely go together, you're the fire that sets my heart ablaze 
Won't be long now baby til the only time I have is you 
Every step we take together is a step nearer to feeling true Cause you~ you make me feel Always when I see you darling, you're up in the clouds above 
And baby tonight, you got me so damn high that I think this could be love 
And tell me if you think sometimes that the feeling gets too much 
Cause baby tonight you got me so messed up that I think this could be love
