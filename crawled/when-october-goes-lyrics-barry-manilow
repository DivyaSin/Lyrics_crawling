And when October goes 
The snow begins to fly 
Above the smoky roofs 
I watch the planes go by The children running home beneath 
A twilight sky 
Oh for the fun of them 
When I was one of them [Chorus] 
And when October goes 
The same old dream appears 
And you are in my arms 
To share the happy years 
I turn my head away to hide 
The helpless tears 
Oh how I hate to see October go [Chorus]
