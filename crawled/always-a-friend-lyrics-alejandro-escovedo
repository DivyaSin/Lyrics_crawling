[Chorus:] 
Wasn't I always a friend to you 
Wasn't I always a friend to you 
Do you wanna be my friend 
Do you wanna be my friend 
Every once in a while honey let your love show 
Every once in a while honey let yourself go 
Nobody gets hurt no nah 
Nobody gets hurt We came here as two, we laid down as one 
I don't care if I'm not your only one 
What I see in you, you see in me 
But if I do you wrong 
Smoke my smoke, drink my wine 
Bury my snakeskin boots somewhere I'll never find 
Still be your lover, baby 
Oh-oh oh oh-oh oh [Chorus:] Well I could be an astronaut on the wrong side of the Moon 
Or wrapped up like a baby on a bus home to you 
Wherever I go, will you go with me? 
But if I do you wrong 
Take the master suite, I'll take the floor 
Sleep in late, get your rest 
I'll catch up on mine 
Still be your lover, baby 
Oh-oh oh oh-oh oh
