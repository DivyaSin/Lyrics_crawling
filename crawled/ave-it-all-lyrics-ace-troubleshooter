Counting down expecting latest, greatest 
Newest model maybe, hope 
Wishing hoping praying to outdo the Joneses Squalor impulse crowding 'tis the season 
Do the days turn just for these? 
Savior born in manger 
Please forgive us born in the inn Heaven tomorrow 
Heaven, my chance to have it all See all my glimmering weakness 
Here's my world come on, will you come in? 
Brought to my knees 
Child I'll play for you Child enters in this world it's broken 
Angels sing and men sleep the night 
Though it's brazen and defiant 
Please be born in my heart Heaven tomorrow 
Heaven, skies open pour out hope See all my glimmering weakness 
Here's my world come on, will you come in? 
Brought to my knees 
Child I'll play for you
