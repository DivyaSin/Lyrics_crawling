Producer for bonnie: dieter bohlen 
Recorded in 1994, bonnie's last single on the 'hansa' label. this single was to promote the 'comeback singles collection '90-'94'. lyrics taken from careful listening. I dream of home again 
A thousand voices call to me 
A cry that splits the night 
Woke up the soul inside my memories 
I chose to walk alone 
To search and find my destiny 
So many lonesome roads 
Lead me away from where I long to be 
When I awake and see a cold and empty room 
I sit alone and think of places I once knew 
The friends that I had loved and left behind 
Oh, how could I have been so blind? Back home 
Where all the love is that I need 
Where all my family waits for me 
Back home 
I close my eyes and I can see 
Where the river meets the sea 
Back home 
There is no better place than home for me 
'cause home is where I'll find my destiny I'm going home again and I just can't wait to see 
The folks that I have missed 
A mother's tender kiss, so soft, so sweet 
I'll hold her in my arms, like I'd never let her go 
My family's my home and I will tell them that I love them so 
Oh I know I've been away so very long 
That I hurt you when I left and I was wrong 
And I see that home is where my heart belongs 
So hang on heart, 'cause her I come Back home 
Where all the love is that I need 
Where all my family waits for me 
Back home 
I close my eyes and I can see 
Where the river meets the sea 
Back home 
There is no better place than home for me 
'cause home is where I'll find my destiny Back home 
Where all the love is that I need 
Where all my family waits for me 
Back home 
I close my eyes and I can see 
Where the river meets the sea 
Back home 
There is no better place than home for me 
'cause home is where I'll find my destiny 
Back home
