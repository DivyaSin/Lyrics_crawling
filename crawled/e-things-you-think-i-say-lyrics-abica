Line em all up and we'll knock em down 
Lost in the music in the sound 
Now you're coming back to me but we're never meant to be 
Now I see what I've done 
But I'll never be the one 
Cuz I'll never be what you need 
And you'll never see it in me 
So let it break, just one mistake 
What we had was never fake 
It was real, it was true 
It's the best that we could do 
I got that feelin that's when 
I started thinking again 
I keep on going and I'm knowing that this aint gonna end Chorus 
It's just the way we do the things we do 
I'm here for music your here for the things you think I say about you 
It's just the way I use you how I do 
I know your using me too that's why I know I can do it to you Don't stop get it get it 
The way you let me in it 
The way you let me hit it got me going crazy wit it 
Don't talk quit it quit it 
Cuz when we're done we're finished 
I'm nothing more to you than someone more to say you did it 
You wanna party with me y want the same 
There's something here for both of us same type of lust just different names 
You got me thinking that's when 
i started drinking my friend 
And all these pretty dolls got me back here up it again It's just the way we do the things we do 
I'm here for music your here for the things you think I say about you 
It's just the way I use you how I do 
I know your using me too that's why I know I can do it to you You trust me to this point 
Gonna break now 
And I hear you in my mind 
I can't see straight 
It's just the way that we do that we do 
Grab a drink 
You start to think 
And I'm saying, are you listening? It's just the way we do the things we do 
I'm here for music your here for the things you think I say about you 
It's just the way I use you how I do 
I know your using me too that's why I know I can do it to you
