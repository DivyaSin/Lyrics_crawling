You are the original template 
You are the original exemplary 
How seen were you actually? 
How revered were you (honestly) at the time? Why pleased with your low maintenance? 
You loved us more then we would've loved you back 
Where was your ally your partner in feminine crime? Oh mother who'd your buddy? 
Oh mother who'd got your back? 
The heart of the house 
The heart of the house 
All hail the goddess! You were "good o!" 
You were "count on 'er 'til four am" 
You saw me run from the house 
In the snow melodramatically Oh mother who's your sister 
Oh mother who's your friend? 
The heart of the house 
The heart of the house 
All hail the goddess! We left the men we went for a walk in the gateaus 
And talked like women like women to women would 
Woman to woman would "where did you get that from? 
Must've been your father your dad" 
I got it from you I got it from you Do you see yourself in my gypsy garage sale ways? 
In my fits of laughter? 
In my Tinkerbell tendencies? 
In my lack of color coordination?
