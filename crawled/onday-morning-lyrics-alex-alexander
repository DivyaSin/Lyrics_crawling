Intro Monday Morning and my phone keeps calling 
What happened on the weekend it was straight up ballin' I don't wanna wake up today 
I'm closing my eyes hope it goes away What did i do what did i say 
Heads banging harder than a drum today Wanna hear what I got to say 
Listen up closely while I kick my game Verse 1: What happened to the weekend? DAMN it went fast 
Friday don't remember but the party must've been a blast 
Saturday I was reminded of what took place that night I was blinded by 
Jack and Patron 
Now I feel the pain tossin' turnin' on the floor 
Sunday Funday came, but my brain was drained 
By the time I hit the sheets, I was feeling some type of way 
Now it's Monday Morning and the sun's high 
Sunrise, makes me feel as if I just died 
My body's moving slower than a zombie 
Nothing left behind, today just makes me vomit 
Thankful I'm alive but DAMN I hate waking to the... Chorus Monday Morning don't wanna wake up. 
I hear you calling but were heading for a break up 
Weekend, yeah I party till the late night 
One little kiss and you know were gonna make up Monday Morning staring at the Ceiling 
Clothes gone so I got this bad feeling 
Last night? we ain't got no clue 
So just hit rewind and redo Monday morning Woah Oh, Woah Oh, Woah Oh Oh Oh, 
Woah Oh Oh Whoa Oh Whoa Oh 
I wrote this song on 
Monday morning 
Woah Oh Woah Oh Woah Oh Oh Oh 
Oh Oh Oh, Woah Dont wake me up on Monday Morning Verse 2: Can somebody help me? 
I'm walking like I'm still drunk 
Thinking how I'ma make through the next week 
Hearing from my boss is a drag though 
Blah Blah is what I hear when I'm in the zone 
I don't care what you doing, just go and live it up 
And be ready, the weekend we're bout sip it up 
Double the fun we're gonna mix it up 
To all my who party and couldn't get enough 
Working like a slave, that's ROOTS baby 
But I party like a rockstar TOO baby 
Alex, they wanna RAGE like it's EDC 
Let's give it to em, let em know that's it's free to be 
Who you want, on the weekend, then it's back to the... Chorus Monday Morning don't wanna wake up. 
I hear you calling but were heading for a break up 
Weekend, yeah I party till the late night 
One little kiss and you know were gonna make up Monday Morning staring at the Ceiling 
Clothes gone so I got this bad feeling 
Last night? we ain't got no clue 
So just hit rewind and redo Monday morning Woah Oh, Woah Oh, Woah Oh Oh Oh, 
Woah Oh Oh Whoa Oh Whoa Oh 
I wrote this song on 
Monday morning 
Woah Oh Woah Oh Woah Oh Oh Oh 
Oh Oh Oh, Woah Dont wake me up on Monday Morning
