Cant forget, cant give in 
What went wrong? 
Cause you said this was right 
You fucked up my life Im sick of always hearing 
Sappy love songs on the radio 
This place, its fucking cursed 
In its plague and I can never escape 
When my heart, it explodes I cant forgive 
Cant forget, cant give in 
What went wrong? 
Cause you said this was right 
You fucked up my life Im kicking out fiercely 
At the world around me 
What went wrong? 
Im kicking out fiercely 
At the world around me 
What went wrong? Im kicking out fiercely 
At the world around me 
What went wrong? 
Im kicking out fiercely 
At the world around me 
What went wrong? Im kicking
