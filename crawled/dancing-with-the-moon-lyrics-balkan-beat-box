Para Manuela!:) Don't know where we're going* 
But I know I saw in your eyes 
My life growing 
To unite with u 
And the time is towing us to age 
And tossing years 
But we're still glowing 
Like we never knew 
We took a decision 
To have no definition 
And our ammunition 
Is to keep our love true 
We chose to share a vision 
More then we envisioned 
While this song is playing 
I want to dance with u 
So put on that record that we use to listen to 
When we found the truth 
A golden soft memory in blue 
To repaint it, in me and in u 
So put on that record that we use to listen to 
When we found the truth 
I'm dancing in your garden 
To ease up all that's harden 
plant a seed this morning 
To see a flower bloom 
Words need not be spoken 
Sleeping souls have woken 
And this song is not more then 
a blooming after noon 
For there is no other 
For me u are the mother 
A perfect sound of ever 
In a perfect tune 
As night slowly approaching 
The sun is set for love 
And when I see u smiling 
I'm dancing with the moon So put on that record that we use to listen to 
When we found the truth 
A golden soft memory in blue 
To repaint it, in me and in u 
So put on that record that we use to listen to 
When we found the truth 
A golden soft memory in blue 
To repaint it, in me and in u Don't know where we're going* 
But I know I saw in your eyes 
My life growing 
To unite with u 
And the time is towing us to age 
And tossing years 
But we're still glowing 
Like we never knew
