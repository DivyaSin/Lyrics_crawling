Everyday I wrest 
With you on the walls 
More and more 
You're just two foot small 
I don't know why 
What you want from me 
If I find out 
I will set you free Oooo, oooo, oooo, aahhh, aaahhh 
Oooo, oooo, oooo, aahhh, aaahhh In the back 
I've been watching 
All of you have been talking too 
What can I say to all of you 
That you already knew Oooo, oooo, oooo, aahhh, aaahhh 
Oooo, oooo, oooo, aahhh, aaahhh
