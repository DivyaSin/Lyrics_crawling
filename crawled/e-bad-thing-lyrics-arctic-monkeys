Do the bad thing 
Take off your wedding ring 
But it won't make it that much easier 
It might make it worse Oh, the night's like a whirlwind 
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me, but it's alright 
She's sayin' that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me 
He's not the jealous type 
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away 
But when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say 
I've been before 
And all these capers make her too forward to ignore 
Well, she's talkin', but I'm not entirely sure, oh Do the bad thing 
Take off your wedding ring 
But it won't make it that much easier 
It might make it worse Oh, I'm standing at the bar and somebody's partner's talkin' to me 
But I don't know that is what she isn't 
She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true 
And I knew how she could have anyone she wants 
And I'm strugglin' to think of an immediate response Like, I don't mind 
Be a big mistake 
For you to wait 
And let me waste your time 
Really, love, it's fine 
Really, love, it's fine And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy 
Oh, but she carried on suggestin' a struggle to refuse 
She said, 'it's the red wine this time, but that is no excuse.'
