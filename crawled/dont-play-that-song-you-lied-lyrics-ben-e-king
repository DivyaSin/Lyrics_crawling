Don't play it no more 
Don't play it no more 
Don't play it no more 
No no no no no no no Don't play that song for me 
It brings back memories 
The days that I once knew 
The days that I spent with you Oh no! don't let it play 
It fills my heart with pain! 
Please stop it right away! 
I remember just what it said 
It said "darling I love you" (You Know that you lied!) 
"Darling I love you" (you know that you lied!) 
"Darling I love you" (you know that you lied-you lied you lied lied lied) 
Remember on our first date? 
You kissed me and you walked away 
You were only 17 
I never thought you'd act so mean 
But baby you told me you loved me 
You told me you cared! 
You said "ill go with you darlin' almost anywhere" 
But baby you know that 
"Darling I love you" (You Know that you lied!) 
"Darling I love you" (you know that you lied!) 
"Darling I love you" (you know that you lied-you lied you lied lied lied) Don't play it no more 
Don't play it no more 
Stop it baby! no no no no no no no 
Don't play it no more! Baby Please! don't play it baby! 
Don't play it no more! no no no no no no Stop it baby! 
You know that you lied! 
You know that you lied! 
You know that you lied! Stop it baby!
