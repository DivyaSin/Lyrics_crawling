Daylight falls too hard 
I can't believe my eyes 
What, what have I done? 
Should've never lost control 
I smashed away the good old days 
And I can never go home 
I wish that I could Tear out a page 
Take back the words that got away 
I'll take the blame for one solitary life Cold fright, something's wrong 
I thought it was my right 
What, what have I done? 
I can't mend what I've torn apart 
I cut the line one last time 
And now I've fallen too far 
I wish that I could Tear out a page 
Take back the words that got away 
I'll take the blame for one solitary life No excuse, no surprise 
Morning has broken me down and cut me to size I wish that I could tear out a page 
Take back the words that got away 
I'll take the blame for one solitary life 
One solitary life No place left to hide 
One solitary life
