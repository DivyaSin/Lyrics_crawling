My stain glass soul, all consumed 
Drown in denial, choke on the truth 
My swollen tongue, has left me dumb 
Tune in on my confusion 
Bitter words, not meant to hurt 
Game over, start again 
Waiting, that was my mistake 
Timing, too little too late 
Courage is pressure over grace 
Freedom a smile, on tortured face 
My golden tongue, from blackened lung 
?My tears are the color of your tongue 
All's not well that ends not well 
The credits strike the side 
Waiting, that was my mistake 
Timing, too little too late 
I can't see you 
Won't you save your breath 
I can't hear you 
Won't you save your breath 
I can't hear you 
Won't you save your breath 
Drown in denial, choke on the truth 
Drown in denial, choke on the truth 
Drown in denial, choke on the truth 
Drown in denial, choke on the truth
