It's knowing what they want of me that scares me 
It's knowing having followed, I must lead 
It's knowing that each person there compares me 
To those in my past whom I now succeed But how can whatever I do for them now 
Be enough, be enough Aida, Aida 
All we ask of you 
Is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage 
To ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do 
Aida, Aida Your robe should be golden, your robe should be perfect 
Instead of this ragged concoction of thread 
But may you be moved by it's desperate beauty 
To give us new life for we'd rather be dead Then live in the squalor and shame of the slave 
To the dance, to the dance Aida, Aida 
All we ask of you 
All we ask is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage 
To ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do 
Aida, Aida Aida 
Aida, Aida 
Aida, Aida, Aida I know expectations are high and almost beyond my fulfillment 
But they won't hear a word of a doubt or see signs of weakness 
My nigh on impossible duty is clear If I can rekindle my ancestors' dreams 
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough 
(Aida, Aida, Aida, Aida, Aida, Aida) 
It's enough
