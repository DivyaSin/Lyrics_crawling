How I regret what I must do 
But you've left me no choice 
Though I still strain 
I can't recall the beauty of your fey voice Now that I've heard come through the walls 
A song I've heard many times 
I must return all you gave me 
In the company of swine We had found sacred ground 
Oh, we had found sacred ground 
You burn down I thought you sang so tastefully 
But now I see I was wrong 
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave 
So, please cut the love song How I regret what I must do 
But you must be replaced 
For I cannot go on suffering 
Such simple and common tastes When you met my eyes 
You sang to me of passion, pain and will 
When I blinked you turned away 
To kiss the hand of filth We had found sacred ground 
Oh, we had found sacred ground 
I'll burn down I thought you sang so tastefully 
But now I see I was wrong 
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave 
So, please cut the love song Tell me, who will hear your voice 
Your song, when the smoke has cleared 
And the lights are gone? 
Tell me, who appears when I'm gone I thought you sang so tastefully 
But now I see I was wrong 
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave 
So, please cut the love song I thought you sang so tastefully 
I see I was wrong 
This serenade turns to filth when I leave 
So, please cut the love song, cut the love song
