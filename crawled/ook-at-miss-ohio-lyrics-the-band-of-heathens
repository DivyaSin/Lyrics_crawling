Oh me, oh my, oh, won't you look at Miss Ohio? 
She's running around with her rag-top down 
She says she wants to do right, just not right now 
Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy 
Running around with the rag-top down 
Yeah, I'm gonna do right, just not right now 
Had your arm around her shoulder, like a regimental soldier 
Mamma's pushing that wedding gown 
Yeah, she wants to do right, just not right now 
Oh me, oh my, oh, won't you look at Miss Ohio? 
She's running around with the rag-top down 
She says I wanna do right, just not right now 
I know all about it, so you don't have to shout it 
I'm gonna straighten it out somehow 
Yeah, I wanna do right, just not right now 
Oh me, oh my, oh, won't you look at Miss Ohio? 
She running around with her rag-top down 
She says I wanna do right, just not right now 
Yeah, she wants to do right, just not right now
