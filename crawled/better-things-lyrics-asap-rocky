Don't give a fuck about your man 
I'm just seeing what it's hitting for 
(Bitch I'm sayin') How you fronting on a kid though 
You should fuck with me girl 
You know what you need girl 
See I got used to livin' life up on my own, yeah 
And searching lovely for a wife to call my own, yeah 
It's all I think about at nights when I'm alone, yeah 
Swear that I can't get no rest in California Swear that life is just a whole bunch of vices 
Niggas biting off of my shit, my dick 
Stay up in your chick ride stick without a license 
Tell her hold on like some vice grips 
Might just call her, let her ride with a baller 
Look up on her face was priceless, wonder what my type is 
Well tonight Mrs. lightskin with a light mix, or a light switch 
White chick, darkskin complexion and she righteous 
I take a dyke chick if she like dick 
I kissed the dyke chick and I liked it 
Fucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch 
Light this Light it light it, puff it puff it, pass it, pass it 
(moving on to better things) 
Just sit back and relax one time, clear your mind 
'Bout to send me back to my old ways 
Know what I mean I've been puffing, rolling up 
Cop a lot and pourin' up 
Plus my niggas know the plug 
A generation's thrown on drugs I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth 
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out 
Kicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out 
Spit my kids out, jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce 
Ride with a nigga mane, and you know I stay fly like the jigga mane 
And it figures, 'cos here is something you can't understand 
How I could just kill a man, anyways 
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes 
Animosity is better off your chest, yes 
Guess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh 
Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts Light it light it, puff it puff it, pass it, pass it 
(moving on to better things) 
Inhale exhale, relieve your mind of stress 
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP I've been puffing, rolling up 
Cop a lot and pourin' up 
Plus my niggas know the plug 
A generation's thrown on drugs
