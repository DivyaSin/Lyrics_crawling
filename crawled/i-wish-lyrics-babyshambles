I sit alone almost every night 
I watch those trains roll on by, out of sight No, it's not the same old story, it's news to me 
I'd say so it's the not only way to be 
I worked in town on nothing for free 
Nothing left in this place for, life's offering me 
I wish to God, I just wish that I Got no money in my pockets you see 
Gimme no, gimme no, gimme no, gimme no 
No money in my pockets you see 
Gimme no, gimme no, gimme no, gimme no It's not the same old story it's news to me 
I would say so but the only way to be out 
I'm typing almost every night 
I watch my dreams float by, out of sight 
I wish to God that I just been stabbed Got no money in my pockets you see 
Gimme no, gimme no, gimme no, gimme no 
No money in my pockets you see 
Gimme no, gimme no, gimme no, gimme no It's not the same old story it's news to me 
I would say so but the only way to be out 
I'm typing almost every night 
I watch my dreams float by, out of sight 
I wish to god that I just been stabbed Gimme no
