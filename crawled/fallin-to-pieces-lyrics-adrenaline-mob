Say goodbye to yesterday 
What doesn't matter anyway 
All I had was washed away but that's the way it goes 
Spend my time building walls just to sit around and watch them fall 
So damn hard when you lose it all but that's the way it goes 
Deep in a hole and I'm so far down and heaven is just so far away 
I'm reaching out can you hear me shout 
Here I am come and take me away Sometimes you want to go 
Sometimes you gotta fly 
Sometimes you want to just lay down and die 
When it feels like your life's fallin' to pieces 
All alone, lost in time, there you sit and slowly lose your mind 
And it feels like your life's fallin' to pieces 
Wo yeah People spend when money flows 
Easy come and easy go 
Now how the hell was I supposed to know but that's the way it goes 
Now people think I'm out of touch, huh 
I hear they say I drink and smoke too much 
Well I don't care cause I don't judge and that's the way I roll 
You spend your whole life building dreams 
Just to have it taken away 
You build your castle brick by brick just to watch it crumble away Sometimes you wanna go 
Sometimes you gotta fly 
Sometimes you want to just lay down and die 
When it feels like your life's fallin' to pieces 
All alone, lost in time, there you sit and slowly lose your mind 
And it feels like your life's fallin' to pieces 
Wo yeah Sometimes you wanna go 
Sometimes you wanna fly 
Sometimes you want to just lay down and die 
When it feels like your life's fallin' to pieces 
All alone, lost in time, there you sit and slowly lose your mind 
And it feels like your life's fallin' to pieces 
Wo yeah 
Wo yeah Feels like I'm fallin' 
Feels like I'm fallin' 
Feels like I'm fallin' 
Feels like I'm fallin', fallin' 
I'm feeling like I'm fallin' to pieces 
It feels like I'm fallin', fallin' 
I'm feeling like I'm fallin' to pieces
