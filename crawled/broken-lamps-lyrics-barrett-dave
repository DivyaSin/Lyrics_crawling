Twenty-one, and single now 
She decorates my side 
Suffers from the oxygen, 
Sits at home and cries 
Knowing that she's gone leave 
It's just a question when. 
Broken lamps and turned up amps 
Here we go again. 
Twenty-five, she's married now 
Two kids by her side 
Another year I limp on stage 
Chicago the umpteenth time 
Birthday cards that never come 
And Christmas at a friends. 
Broken lamps and turned up amps. 
Here we go again. 
Forty-five, she's single now 
The kids are on their own 
I come in bloody from the road 
The records sell no more. 
Come to you with fret cut hands 
That reach out for amends 
Broken lamps and turned up amps 
Here we go again 
Broken lamps and turned up amps 
Here we go again 
Broken lamps and turned up amps 
Here I go again.
