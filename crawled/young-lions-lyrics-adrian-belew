Hot tribal night 
Underneath fluorescent skies 
Bonfires rage strange 
Wild, waving, shouting Picasso faces In the guise of a lioness 
The wind kisses her burning dress 
You can feel her animal eyes 
You can hear them cry 
"Be the jewel around my neck, 
Never a tear on my burning dress." Lying paralyzed 
A brave prey who lays dying 
And is surrounded by angry spirits 
Hunters, guns, drums, and elephants Why is this night quiet? 
Filled with trees, filled with eyes 
As she prowls around my feet 
She throws back her head dress and cries 
"Now you will be mine, 
Be my young lion."
