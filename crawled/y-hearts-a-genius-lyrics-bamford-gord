I've never been accused of being brilliant 
My intellect is nothing to brag on 
My IQ's sitting somewhere in the middle 
Right there between ol' Bubba and average Joe I think my heart must be a genius 
'Cause it somehow made me fall in love with you 
Yea, my buddies drop their jaws 
They just look at us in awe, every time they see us 
My heart's a genius I can't say that I'm the one who did the thinking 
I was falling long before I had a clue 
There's a master mind to this perfect situation 
So I might as well give credit where it's due I think my heart must be a genius 
'Cause it somehow made me fall in love with you 
Yea, my buddies drop their jaws 
They just look at us in awe, every time they see us 
My heart's a genius They say a heart ain't nothing but a muscle 
Quite simply just designed for pumping blood 
But I swear there's something going on in mine girl 
Einstein ain't got nothing on my love I think my heart must be a genius 
'Cause it somehow made me fall in love with you 
Yea, my buddies drop their jaws 
They just look at us in awe, every time they see us 
My heart's a genius I think my heart must be a genius 
'Cause it somehow made me fall in love with you 
Yea, my buddies drop their jaws 
They just look at us in awe, every time they see us 
My heart's a genius Yea, my buddies drop their jaws 
They just look at us in awe, every time they see us 
My heart's a genius
