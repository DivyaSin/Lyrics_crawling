Bloodred sky 
Bloodred fields 
The sun in its last breath 
Providing the shadows of the trees 
A moment to dance before death 
Still - Their makers dance 
In the cold breeze 
That gives to me the stench Of blood not yet cold 
And torn dead flesh I raise my hammer of war 
To call my vulture 
Up high it flues from the fields 
From its kingdom it sees 
The most wonderful sights 
Dead men - Wounded worms 
The remains of a conquered land 
My slaughtery and victory My hammer shall not yet rest 
From the north I hear 
Hordes of young men 
How unaware they are of their peoples 
Angel of death 
Their blood shall paint my armour 
As I slay them all brutally Down the hill they ride 
I greet them with my warcry 
As I slam my hammer into the grown 
Come to me mortals My wary hatred engraves 
Fear in their faces as they see their death 
I am war, I am death 
My hammer crushes skulls and bones 
Screams of fear 
My swords thirst driwbs in blood 
Tears and begging for mercy 
I laugh and kill 
I am the god of war 
I am Ares
