Let me get it straight, I should focus on the things above 
So why do I insist on possessing what will only weigh me down 
You said, "Separate yourself from all the treasures of this world" 
And now I'm starting to understand what I should do [Chorus] 
I give it all away 
Because it's what You said 
Until there's nothing left, I give it all away 
I give it all away 
Until there's nothing left 
Because it's what You said, I give it all away 
I give it all away Pieces of me are all in disarray 
And they are only held together by the threads I weave 
Inside my head 
But when I separate myself from all the troubles of this world 
I see my cares and fears and worries all dissolve [Chorus]
