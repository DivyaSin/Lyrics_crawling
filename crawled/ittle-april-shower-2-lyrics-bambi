Drip, drip, drop 
Little April shower 
Beating a tune 
As you fall all around Drip, drip, drop 
Little April shower 
What can compare 
To your beautiful sound 
Beautiful sound 
Beautiful sound 
Drip, drop, drip, drop Drip, drip, drop 
When the sky is cloudy 
Your pretty music 
Will brighten the day Drip, drip, drop 
When the sky is cloudy 
You come along with a song right away 
Come with your beautiful music Drip, drip drop 
Little April shower 
Beating a tune 
As you fall all around 
Drip, drip drop 
Little April shower 
What can compare with your beautiful sound Drip, drip drop 
When the sky is cloudy 
You come along, come along with your pretty little song 
Drip, drip drop 
When the sky is cloudy 
You come along, come along with your pretty little song Gay little roundalay 
Song of the rainy day 
How I love to hear your patter 
Pretty little pitter-patter 
Helter-skelter when you pelter 
Troubles always seem to scatter Drip, drip drop 
Little April shower 
Beating a tune 
As you fall all around 
Drip, drip drop 
Little April shower 
What can compare with your beautiful sound
