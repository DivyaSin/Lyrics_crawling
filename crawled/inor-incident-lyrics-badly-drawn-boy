There's nothing I could say to make you try and feel OK 
And nothing you could do to stop me feeling the way I do 
And if the chance should happen that I never see you again 
Just remember that I'll always love you I'd be a better person on the other side I'm sure 
You'd find a way to help yourself 
Then find another door 
To shrug off minor incidents 
Make us both feel proud 
I'd just wish I be there to see you through You always were the one to make us stand out in the crowd 
Though every once upon a while your head was in a cloud 
There's nothing you could never do to ever let me down 
And remember that I'll always love you
