I've got chills. they're multiplyin'. 
Strange vibrations in my head 
And I can feel disintegration 
Like flies livin' in my bed 
Ow 
There were three dots in formation 
Eerie sights along the road 
And there were signs and indications. 
Split in two, then spun around disappeared 
Ow 
I've got chills. they're multiplyin'. 
Strange vibrations in my head 
And there were signs and indications, 
Like flies livin' in my bed. 
Ow
