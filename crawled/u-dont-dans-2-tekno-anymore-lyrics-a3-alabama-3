Last train to Mashville Girl, you got on board 
Packed up your medicines, left without a word 
Now you're strung out in Suburbia, waiting for that call 
You just chill out by yourself behind your front door 
You lost the plot again, where you are now ain't clear 
It's a misty morning memory, the road that took you here 
The special K keeps the chills away with your needle and your spoon 
Staring at the wall, sharin' your score with no one And U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
I don't see you under the strobe light on the dance floor 
It's been awhile since I saw you ultraviolet smile 
And U don't dans to Tekno anymore Take it way: (Dwayne Love) 
Bein' a lover man and a DJ 
Lotsa girlz come down to front when I'm on the 1's and 2's 
There was this one particular girl though, she was so beautiful, she used to knock my eyes out every damn time 
One night, she took this funny little heart-shaped pill and just died, right there in front of me 
Now she don't dans to tekno, anymore U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
U don't dans to tekno, 
So sad since you let go 
And U don't dans to Tekno anymore (Yeah, I'll tell you what) 
the 808 and the 303 ain't the friends they used to be 
You got no time for sweet 909 
You said goodbye to Chicago 
Detroit City, Lord you let 'em go 
And there ain't no guests at the borderline (All the people sing it) 
And U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
I don't see you under the strobe light on the dance floor 
It's been awhile since I saw you ultraviolet smile 
And U don't dans to Tekno anymore U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
(Lord Above) 
U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
U don't dans to Tekno, 
So sad since you let go 
And U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
U don't dans to Tekno 
Hip-Hop or Electro 
U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
U don't dans to Tekno anymore
