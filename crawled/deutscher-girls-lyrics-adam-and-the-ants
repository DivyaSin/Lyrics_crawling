We'll do the Tango 
We'll try the Fox Trot 
I'll eat a mango 
You drink a straight scotch 
You know I told you 
You could be classy 
So why did you have 
To be so nasty? Remember the curls 
Of the Deutscher Girls? 
A love of mine 
From down on the Rhine I'll fill your bath with 
The finest champagne 
I'll lick your skin dry 
I cherish your name 
The stakes get higher 
As you dress sparsely 
So why did you have 
To be so nasty? I love your blonde hair 
I kiss your pigtails 
And I could not share 
The scratch of your nails 
And though you mark me 
Your eyes so glassy 
Oh why did you have 
To be so nasty?
