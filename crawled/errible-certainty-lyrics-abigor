Die! Slowly you're dying From this contagious disease Once you're 
Infected there's no hope of a cure Your passing is a sure thing Your 
Thoughts are empty and hopeless Nothing is left for you now Having 
To live with this terrible certainty Praying is all you can do It's Vicious and crippling and slowly, Your life will end But how long 
Will it take to save us from the plague With fatal convulsions the 
Plague is reaching for us God knows! What will it take to save us 
From the plague Contracted by blood The virus can be in us all You're one of it's 
Victims, but then thousands more 
And they won't be the last So many civilizations before The mighty, 
The proud and the brave 
The poor, the rich - Indiscriminate Soon they'll all end in
