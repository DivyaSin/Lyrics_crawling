the searchlights have stopped, 
that means the helicopters 
have stopped searching for me. i finally got to see the sky. (got to see the sky) x3 and I finally got to see the sky bright red with brilliance, 
just like the blood that came 
shooting out of your eyes. bright red like brilliance x2 
bright red I finally got to see the sky x3 
and i finally got to see the sky if you wont look at me you wont look at anyone. x2 the comparison is astounding. 
as the grass turned the color of the sky you told me you were sorry. 
turned the color of the sky, you told me you were sorry x2 
turned the color of the sky you told me you were wrong. but thats what they all say. 
thats what they all say (thats what they all say) on your knees and tell me you can live without me. your empty sockets will serve as my love. x2
