A bloodstained shirt, seductive smile, 
With eyes full of hate and murders in style. 
The sky turns red, the air is cold, 
With one last chance to do as I'm told. This city is far from here. 
Now turn back, turn back. 
I'm scared, but in the bright lights we fade into the rearview mirror. 
This is the last attempt at a mere goodbye. It's just beginning. 
Does this story have an end? 
Can you feel my empty heart inside a box and barely beating? 
The walls are closing in. So take my hand, we'll run forever 'til it ends. 
Look what I've done now, you're dying from love and you're bleeding. 
Why can't I just wake up from this life? 
'Cause I'm dreaming. Look what I've done now, 
I'm sick of this town and I'm leaving. 
Why can't I just wake up from this life? 
'Cause I'm dreaming. It doesn't matter much. 
All those mistakes we made. 
We're through now and we are leaving town tonight. 
Outside a broken dream, I feel unusual but safe there, 
Like nothing can stop us now. 
So take my hand, we'll run forever 'til it ends. 
Look what I've done now, you're dying from love and you're bleeding. Why can't I just wake up from this life? 
'Cause I'm dreaming. 
Look what I've done now, 
I'm sick of this town and I'm leaving. Why can't I just wake up from this life? 
'Cause I'm dreaming. 
Your sultry eyes, your common kiss, 
I'm in disguise, it's something I miss. Your lipstick smears, I'm feeling grey, 
With not much time to take me away. 
This city is far from here. 
Now turn back, turn back. I'm scared, 
But in the bright lights we fade into the rear-view mirror.
