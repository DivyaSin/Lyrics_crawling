I'm not paranoid - don't/they 
No I'm not afraid - stop/won't 
But I sometimes wonder - fight/win 
What is on your mind - back [Chorus] 
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head 
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head 
The gun in your hand is the gun at my head 
The gun in your hand is gonna kill me dead 
We'll attack, we'll attack 
We'll attack, we'll attack 
We'll attack, we'll attack 
We'll attack, we'll attack Got me running into walls - don't/they 
Say good things - stop/won't 
Say bad things - fight/win 
Because you're unpredictable - back [Chorus] Do you want to die - no 
Do you want to die - no 
Do you want to die - no 
I don't want to die [Chorus]
