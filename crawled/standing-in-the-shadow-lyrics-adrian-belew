How could you look so cool 
And make me feel so hot 
How could you start me up 
And never let me stop 
And when you touched my hand 
And when you plugged me in 
I said "you turn me on" 
But you forgot to turn me off Standing in the shadow of your love 
So hot, I'm burnin' up 
Standing in the shadow of your love And when you look in my eyes 
And you make me feel blind 
How could you be so good 
And make me want you so bad 
And when you touch my hand 
And when you plug me in 
And then you call my name 
I forget who I am Standing in the shadow of your love 
So hot, I'm burning up
