You have always thinking of her 
You're in love and you don't know what to say 
But I saw her at the fair and she feels the same way 
She was married by the merry-go-round The merry-go-round 
How merrily we go round 
How merrily we go round 
The merry-go-round He was the first one of the day 
He was the last one of the night 
Oh hold me tight, hold me tight 
They said you were wrongened 
But I can see in your eyes 
How you are gentle and wise 
And you had the good stuff 
Oh there's a parade of girls outside 
That boy's so shy 
Why'd you punch out his lights? He was the first one of the day 
He was the last one of the night 
Oh mop it up, she'll be alright 
Mop it up, she'll be alright 
There's a parade on the hall outside 
Come on and feel the air outside
