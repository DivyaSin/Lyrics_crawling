The man in the moon has a thousand different faces 
The man in the moon changes colors each day 
He's watching us all, the big and the small 
Can he see just you and me searching for my destiny? Mercy, mercy 
You've gotta have pity on me 
Have mercy on me 
Mercy, mercy 
Wanna be free and happy 
Have mercy on me Do you believe we can travel into the future? 
Do you believe there's a man in the sky? 
We're making him sad, the good and the bad 
Can he see just you and me searching for my destiny? Ohh Mercy, mercy 
You've gotta have pity on me 
Have mercy on me 
Mercy, mercy 
Wanna be free and happy 
Have mercy on me I don't wanna be just one in many faces 
I want you looking at me, sit down and take a look 
Put me into motion give me something to believe 
Mmm, hmm, mmm 
Mmm, hmm, mmm Mercy, mercy 
You've gotta have pity on me 
Have mercy on me 
Mercy, mercy 
You've gotta have pity on me 
Have mercy on me Ohh, mercy, mercy 
You've gotta have pity on me 
Have mercy on me, mmm 
Oh, mercy, mercy 
You've gotta have pity on me 
Have mercy on me
