Take me in my dreams recurring 
Cheerful as a childhood dance 
Into one more taste of freedom 
One more longing backward glance In the sway of somber music 
I shall never, never understand 
Let me slip into the sweeter 
Chorus of that other land The gods love Nubia, the beautiful, the golden 
The radiant, the fertile, the gentle and the blessed 
The pain of Nubia is only of the moment 
The desolate, the suffering, the plundered, the oppressed The gods love Nubia, the glorious creation 
The songs roll sweetly across the harvest plain 
The tears of Nubia, a passing aberration 
They wash into the river and are never cried again
