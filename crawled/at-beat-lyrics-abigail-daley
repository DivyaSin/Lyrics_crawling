Lets go, 
Hear that beat, 
Move your feet, 
Come over next to me, 
Let yourself free, And feel that beat 
Sing out loud, 
Drop it because youre proud, 
Show what you are, 
Cause baby youre a star, That beat will change you, 
Lets see what you can do, 
Get crazy, 
Baby, 
Cause you can, 
Im your biggest fan, Lets dance to that beat, 
Come on move your feet 
Well go all night, 
Gonna move just right,
