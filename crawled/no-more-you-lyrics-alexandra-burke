I wish I could freeze you. 
I wanna freeze your smile. 
So I can see it. 
A million years from now. You're my inspiration. 
I'll paint your face in my dreams. 
My future is base in your light in my heart. 
Scared of what I've become. If you faint from my eyes, I'll be lost in the dark. Now I stare at my deepest fear. 
Tried to escape from this nightmare. 
But I'm trapped here, unraveling, forever. 
Who's gonna hold me together?
