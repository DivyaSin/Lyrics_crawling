I'm Driving Home 
The first Time I'm feeling alone 
Since I let you go 
I don't know what I'm gonna do But my life is starting again 
My life is starting again Six months of pain 
Six months of only rain 
Now that 
My clouds are breaking I 
Know that I'll be ok, I'm ok Cause my life is starting again. 
My life is starting all over again 
And my heart is starting to mend 
My life is starting again You changed 
Into someone that I didn't know 
And it broke my heart 
To let you go 
But I let you go And now my life is starting again 
My life is starting all over again 
And my heart is starting to mend 
My life is starting 
My life is starting again And it is such a shame to me 
That this is what we came to be 
But now that I'm alone again 
I'm more me than I ever have been And my life is starting again 
My life is starting all over again 
And my heart is starting to mend 
My life is starting 
My life is starting again
