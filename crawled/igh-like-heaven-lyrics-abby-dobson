Youve got the world at your feet 
Youve got them dancing in the street 
Youve got them wrapped around your fingertips 
You never tried to be a star 
Cos you were happy where you are 
Brighter than the galaxy Youre jumping over 
These four leaf clovers 
Youre high like heaven now And there are locks around your head 
A choir of angels round your bed 
And when you sleep you fly above this land 
You wake with scratches on your feet 
But your secrets safe with me 
Cos there are things that theyll just never understand Youre jumping over these four leaf clovers 
Youre high like heaven now 
They want to own you 
But theyve never shown you 
A reason to come down Youre just like a bird 
And you fly so high 
You break like a child 
When you fall from the sky La la la la, la la la la And they wanna rescue thee 
But there are ropes they cannot see 
The gods will never ever lose their grip 
Many men have tried before 
But felt like soon as they leave shore 
They summon seas to sink their pretty ship But youre jumping over 
These four leaf clovers 
Youre high like heaven now 
They want to own you 
But theyve never shown you 
A reason to come down They want to own you 
But theyve never shown you 
A reason to come down La la la la, la la la la... 
High like...
