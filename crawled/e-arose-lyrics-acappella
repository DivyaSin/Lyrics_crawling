Spoken: 
On a dark cold day, Jesus died on Calvary on a cross - nailed by his hands 
And feet. Buried in the tomb, never to rise. But little did they know he 
Would rise again. Jesus lives. Low, low in the grave He lay 
Jesus my Savior 
Waiting the coming day 
Jesus my Lord Oh, and vainly, vainly they watched His bed 
The bed of my Jesus 
And vainly, vainly they sealed the dead 
Jesus my Lord Death cannot keep it's prey 
Jesus my Savior 
He tore the bars away 
Jesus my Lord Up from the grave 
Yes, He arose 
Hey hey hey hey hey 
My Jesus lives He arose, yes He arose, yes He arose (up from the grave He, up from the 
Grave He arose) 
He lives forever (up from the grave He, up from the grave He arose) Chorus: 
Up from the grave He, He arose (He arose) 
With a mighty triumph o'er His foes (He arose) 
He arose a victor from the dark domain 
And He lives forever with His saints to reign 
He arose (He arose) 
He arose (He arose) 
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Christ arose! Repeat Verses 1-3 (with energy) Repeat Chorus He arose (He arose) 
He arose (He arose) 
Hallelujah (x7) 
He arose!
