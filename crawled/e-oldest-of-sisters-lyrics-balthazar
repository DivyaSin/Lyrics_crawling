I'm not sure is it how you would say yes 
Your room's still open but I didn't miss the steps 
Cause when I went nearby to see what I've missed 
There was your doorman challenging me to confess Friend of mine 
My o-old friend, refine 
My o-old friend, well tide 
My o-old friend of mine 
But I get someone behind, oh Oh, you gave me shelter, saying: "Fool, you must not learn" 
What you've kept close will be left here to burn 
The oldest of sisters, she was the greatest one to earn 
So, I wrote her this letter in advance of my return Friend of mine 
My o-old friend, refine 
My o-old friend, well tide 
My o-old friend of mine 
Well, I get someone behind, oh 
As I get someone behind
