silence.... 
croud of the silver dance 
presence of silence 
Don't be alone tonight Take both hands we clap the flavour 
I will paint you 
Nights through the mastervision silence 
I will paint you Blue is the canvas 
Night of the silver dance 
Presence of silence 
Don't be alone tonight Take both hands we clap her claim her 
I will paint you 
Right through the masturbation silence 
I will paint you Arrogance is sold, arrogance is cold 
I will paint you 
Trying to get the stars of fashion, fashion 
I will paint you I am visible 
I am invisible 
I am visible 
I am invisible I am visible 
I am invisible 
I am visible 
I am invisible I am visible
