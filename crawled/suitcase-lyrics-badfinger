Suitcase, suitcase, follow me 'round 
Bootlace, bootlace, tie me down 
Money for fun, yeah, golden crown 
It's all inside a game we've been playing for so long Driver, driver, go too fast 
Miser, miser, make it last 
Pusher, pusher, on the run 
It's all inside a game we've been playing for so long And I'm sorry to be leavin' 
Yeah, that's all I get to say 
'Cause I'm sorry to be leavin' today Well I'm sorry to be leavin' 
But that's all I get to say 
'Cause I'm sorry to be leaving today (Driver drive) Driver, driver, go too fast 
Miser, miser, make it last 
Pusher, pusher, on the run 
It's all inside a game we've been playing so long So long
