Pushing my way through these crowded streets 
Trying not to be swept away 
Fighting just to keep this crowd from hiding you another day 
So maybe, this time I'll find you 
Maybe, this time I'll push through 
To see you today, today [Chorus] 
Won't you take me away, Won't you take me away 
Cause I need some time to get away, 
Where only you could ever 
Take me away,away,away 
Away Too many days I've been distracted 
Watch these crowds push you away 
I'm so tired of feeling empty 
Without you, I waste these days 
So maybe, this time I'll find you 
Just don't stop calling me to you 
I'll find my way today [Chorus] Maybe this time I'll find you yeah 
Find you today, today [Chorus]
