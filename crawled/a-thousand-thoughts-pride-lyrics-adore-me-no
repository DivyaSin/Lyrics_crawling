One look beyond the stars 
tears all the oceans apart 
Rasorblades joining the feast 
Their dirty little secrets standing right beside of me Was that something real infront of me 
when I looked back 
And I'm allready sleeping 
Far from everything that keeps me here 
Misery can't touch me anymore 
In this world, I can't escape no more Take me away from here 
Step by step and the holes are almost near 
Finding the key to every door 
Wanting you, I've wanted you 
to stay for evermore Was that something real infront of me 
when I looked back 
And I'm allready sleeping 
Far from everything that keeps me here 
Misery can't touch me anymore 
In this world, I can't escape no more Tried so hard to kill the pain 
but in the end it's all in vain Anything that still remains 
All in Vain 
Anything that still remains 
All in Vain I see it clearly now 
Just stay for evermore 
I see it clearly now just stay for evermore Lost in the world of a thousand thoughts 
I will lay me down 
Holding your heart here in my hand 
I will go to sleep 
I will lay me down 
I will lay me down
