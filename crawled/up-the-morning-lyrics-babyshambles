Up the morning, up, up the morning Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning Everytime I see your face 
It makes me sad, it makes me chase 
Chase my love across the world 
Even though you're not it's taste 
Simple, evil, I don't walk alone Everytime I see your face 
It makes me cry, it makes me wait 
Waited far too long 
And you were over me 
But it's ok, cause I know, where you will go, I will go Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning 
Up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning And if I, if I could go 
Back in time 
And if I, if I could go 
Back in time 
I'd go to show, what did I show? 
I would not show 
The nights and the fights when I came rumbling out the door 
Well what was I supposed to do? 
Where's a boy supposed to, supposed to go? Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning 
Up the morning, up, up the morning
