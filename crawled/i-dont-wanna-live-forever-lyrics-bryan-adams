All I want is a real fast car 
I wanna go too fast, wanna go too far 
Wanna take a bite of this sweet, sweet life 
While the gettin' is good, and the time is right 
I wanna fill my cup, I wanna drink it up Yeah, I don't wanna live forever 
I just wanna go for broke 
Gonna ride through any kind of weather 
Go out in a cloud of smoke 
I don't wanna live, don't wanna live forever 
Don't wanna live, don't wanna live forever All I need is a good excuse 
You can cut my reins, you can turn me loose 
Gonna pull my weight, I'm gonna push my luck 
Gonna go down fightin' when my time is up 
You know, I don't care, I'm gonna get my share Oh! I don't wanna live forever 
I just wanna go for broke 
Gonna ride through any kind of weather 
Go out in a cloud of smoke 
I don't wanna live, don't wanna live forever 
Don't wanna live, don't wanna live forever 
Ow I wanna fill my cup, I wanna drink it up 
Yeah, I don't care, I wanna get my share I don't wanna live forever 
I just wanna go for broke 
Gonna ride through any kind of weather 
Go out in a cloud of smoke 
I don't wanna live, don't wanna live forever 
Don't wanna live, don't wanna live forever Don't wanna live forever 
Don't wanna live forever 
Don't wanna live forever 
Don't wanna live forever 
Don't wanna live forever 
Ow
