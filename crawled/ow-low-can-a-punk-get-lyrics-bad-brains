I didn't mean to rip off. I thought it was a get off in mine. I tried to make the scence off. The plan was doomed to set off on time. The time that I was wastin' I spent on only chasin in the pits, and now I pay the price to make the sacrifice of the fool. I was on me. I chose not to be, cheated on part of the thrill, bargain was not fulfilled. lost in a crazy scheme that got strapped up in my dream. And now my times run out, what's it all about. Another DOA can you help me, how low can a punk get. My, My, My How low can a punk get?
