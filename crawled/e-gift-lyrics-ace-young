Lady, I was all alone 
I didn't know which way to go 
You came into my empty life 
Erased the pain and gave me hope 
Oh yeah You set me free 
Just one look into your eyes opened the world to me 
You gave your soul and body, girl, so selflessly 
Took a lonely man right by the hand into the light 
You saved my life Baby your love is all I need 
Girl you mean everything to me 
I can't let you go 
I've got to let you know 
Baby your love made me believe 
You saw the good I had in me 
You're the air I breathe Girl I'm grateful for the gift of your love 
Your touch 
Girl I live for your love 
I thank you for the gift of your love

By the gift of your love Girl I'm crazy 
When I see you smile 
You bring me back to what is real 
You show me 
What I'm livin' for

And the answer to the prayer that I've been waiting for 
Oh, right down to my core Baby your love is all I need
