(Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle) Same old shit, just a different day 
Out here tryna get it, each and every way 
Momma need a house, baby need some shoes 
Times are getting hard, guess what I'ma do 
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard

Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard Big bank in my pocket 
Double up with my profit 
See this shit than I cop it 
Gimme that there and than drop it 
Homie, hold up with my mojo 
Peep the whip and the logo 
Twenty four's and they low pro

Nigga ain't no doubt about it 
Riding round with that rocket 
Load it up and I cock it 
Send bout a couple off in your noggen 
And hear them eight o' eights and they knocking 
Whole club and they rocking 
Rose in them buckets 
All my homies up in here vibing 
Nigga big shit in my household

Creeping off in that Tahoe 
All about their Delagione 
Nigga don't stop the party 
We be getting naughty 
Old kimosabe homie's chiefing cause I'm Marley Same old shit, just a different day 
Out here tryna get it, each and every way

Times are getting hard, guess what I'ma do 
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard Okay now, all I know is hustle 
Get it off the muscle

Make my bitches stomp her 
Alpha zeta mega, better no-one really on it
