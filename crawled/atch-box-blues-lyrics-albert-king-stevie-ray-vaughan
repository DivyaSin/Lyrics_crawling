Now, this tune should be easy for you to deal with 
All you gotta do is remember back home, 
You know what I mean 
When you was sitting out behind the house 
Or practicing on your own guit feble Tryin' to get things together, 
And you couldn't make up your mind 
Kinda half-way knew what you wanted to do 
But you didn't have it all together But you did know you wanted to travel 
(That's right!) 
Yeah, I remember those days real good 
(I know) Didn't have really many clothes 
Didn't know nobody to call to sing for you 
So you had to get out there in no time, you know 
(so) You don't make no tiffanies, you say 
"I'm goin'... 
And I know I got a great time, but I'm goin' anyway" 
Whatever happens 
(What happens?) 
I gotta pay my dues somewhere Listen: 
Dreamed that I was lucky, 
But I woke up cold in hand 
Hey, I dreamed that I was lucky, darling, 
But I woke up cold in hand I dreamed I had you all by myself, 
But now I know you found you another man Oh, that's why I wonderin' 
Will a matchbox hold my clothes? 
Hey, sometimes I wonder, darling 
Will a matchbox hold my clothes? 
You know I haven't got so many 
But I got so far to go If you gotta good woman, 
You better pin'er up to your side 
If you gotta good lady, fellow, 
You better pin'er up to your side Because if she flag my train, budy 
I'm beyond the (live and well ??) Oh, that's why I wonder 
Will a matchbox hold my clothes? 
Hey, sometimes I wonder, darling 
Will a matchbox hold my clothes? 
You know I haven't got so many 
But I got so far to go, yeah I see you might do something with it 
(I hope so) 
Yeah, take it 
You know, fix it like it, you know
