It's been a year since we last met 
But you're still clear in my mind 
You gave me things I can't forget 
You gave me love I still can't find 
Oh Laura I miss you so 
Oh Laura 
Oh Sometimes I see you in my dreams 
When I wake up my troubled mind yeah 
I found a new love for myself 
You know I do the best I can 
Oh Laura I miss you so 
Oh Laura 
Oh I hope that we meet again 
Oh I've rehearsed the things I'd say 
And if that should never be 
I'll love you 'til I'm blown away 
Oh Laura I miss you so 
Oh Laura 
Oh yeah 
I miss you so 
Oh Laura 
I miss you so 
Oh Laura 
(sometimes I see you in my dreams)
