Last train to Nashville Girl, you got on board 
Packed up your medicines, left without a word 
Now you're strung out in Suburbia, waiting for that call 
You just chill out by yourself behind your front door You lost the coat again, where you are ain't clear 
It's a misty morning memory, rolled up to your hair 
The special K keeps the chills away with your needle and your spoon 
Staring at the wall, sharin' your score with no one And u don't dans to Tekno anymore 
I don't see you under the strobe light on the dance floor 
It's been awhile since I saw your ultraviolet smile 
And u don't dans to Tekno anymore Take it way Bein' a lover man and a DJ 
Lotsa girlz come down to front when I'm on the 1's and 2's 
There was this one particular girl though, she was so beautiful 
She used to knock my eyes out every damn time One night, she took this funny little heart-shaped 
Pill and just died 
Right there in front of me 
Now she don't dans to Tekno, anymore U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
U don't dans to Tekno, so sad since you let go 
And u don't dans to Tekno anymore Yeah, I'll tell you what 808 and 303 ain't the friends they used to be 
You got no time for sweet 909 
You said goodbye to Chicago 
Detroit said, Lord, you let 'em go 
And there ain't no guests at the borderline All the people sing it And u don't dans to Tekno anymore 
I don't see you under the strobe light on the dance floor 
It's been awhile since I saw your ultraviolet smile 
And u don't dans to Tekno anymore No, u don't dans to Tekno anymore 
U don't dans to Tekno anymore 
U don't dans to Tekno, so sad since you let go 
And u don't dans to Tekno anymore U don't dans to Tekno 
Hip-Hop or Electro 
And u don't dans to Tekno anymore 
And u don't dans to Tekno anymore
