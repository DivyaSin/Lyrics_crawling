Deck the halls with boughs of holly 
Fa la la la la, la la la la 
This the season to be jolly 
Fa la la la la, la la la la Outside the carolers start to sing 
I can't describe the joy they bring 
'Cause joy is something they don't bring me My girlfriend is by my side 
From roof are hanging 'sicles of ice 
Their winey voices get irritating It's Christmas time again So I stand with a dead smile on my face 
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste 
Oh, God, I hate these Satan's helpers And then I guess I must have snapped 
Because I grabbed a baseball bat 
And made them all run for shelter It's Christmas time again 
It's time to be nice 
To the people you can't stand all year 
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer You people scare me 
Please stay away from my home 
If you don't want to get me down, just leave the presents 
And then leave me alone Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve 
'Cause the cops came and arrested me 
They had an unfair advantage And even though the jail didn't have a tree 
Christmas came a night early 'cause 
A guy named Bubba unwrapped my package It's Christmas time again 
It's time to be nice 
To the people you can't stand all year 
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer You people scare me 
Please stay away from my home 
If you don't want to get me down, just leave the presents 
And then leave me alone I won't be home 
I won't be home for Christmas 
I won't be home 
I won't be home for Christmas I won't be home 
I won't be home for Christmas 
I won't be home 
I won't
