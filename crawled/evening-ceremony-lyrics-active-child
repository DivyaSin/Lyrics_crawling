Even if I wanted to love you 
Would you love me? 
Even if I wanted to fall for you, 
Would you fall for me? 
Even if I never meant to hurt you, 
Would you hurt me? 
Even if I wanted to pray for you Hold me, hold me close, 
Never let go 
Tell me what you need, and I promise I'll take control Even if I wanted to run with you, 
Would you run with me? 
Even if I wanted to hold you 
Even if I never meant to hurt you, 
Would you hurt me? 
Even if I wanted to pray for you. Holy, Holy ghost, 
Where have you gone? 
Middle of the night, I feel your presence taking control So many reasons that we could never get caught 
I tried to tell you but you didn't wanna stop 
I tried to tell you but you didn't 
I tried to tell you but you 
So many reasons that we could never get caught 
I tried to tell you but you didn't wanna stop 
I tried to tell you but you didn't 
I tried to tell you but you Hold me, hold me close, 
Never let go 
Tell me what you need, and I promise I'll take control Even if I wanted to love you 
Would you love me? 
Even if I wanted to fall for you, 
Would you fall for me? 
Even if I never meant to hurt you, 
Would you hurt me? 
Even if I wanted to pray for you
