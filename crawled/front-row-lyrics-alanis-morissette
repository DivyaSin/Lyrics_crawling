(I know he's blood but you can still turn him away you 
Don't owe him anything) Do you go to the dungeon? 
To find out how to make peace with your days in the dungeon 
Writing a letter to you didn't make me feel any more peaceful than how I felt when we weren't speaking 
Because I didn't cop to what I did 
I can't love you because we're supposed to have professional boundaries. 
I'd like you to be schooled and in awe 
As though you were kissed by god full on the lips [Chorus] 
I'm in the front row 
The front row with popcorn 
I get to see you 
See you, close up (I'm too tired to recount the 
Unpleasantries one by one 
Minute I want to banish you 
The next I want to be on 
A deserted island with you along with my three favorite CDs 
Ambivalent yet in your 
Bed we've yet to acknowledge what really happened) Slid into the ditch 
I have this overwhelming loss of ambition 
We said let's name thirty good reasons 
Why we shouldn't be together 
I started by saying things like "you smoke" "you live in new jersey" 
You started saying things like "you belong to the world" 
All of which could have been easily refuted 
But the conversation was hypothetical 
I am totally short of breath for you 
Why can't you shut your stuff off [Chorus] (and I laughed until my lungs hurt 
I love how you bust my chops 
You don't always feel seen sometimes you feel erasable 
Unfortunately I cannot reciprocate in my current state 
I think we should be careful of how much time we spend together) For a while while I'm speaking 
To you know how much you hate to be interrupted, maybe spend some time alone 
Fill up your proverbial cup so that it doesn't always have to be about you 
I've been wanting your undivided attention 
I like the fact that you're nothing like me 
Are you not burdened by the lack of perspective people have of your charmed life seemingly [Chorus] (you never meant to be ungrateful 
Nor held up to be whipped or wept for certainly not analyzed 
Prodded at more ways than one 
Apparently you've been misrepresented 
Dealing with the concept of arrows being 
Slung towards your outrageous fortune) Hey I'm not mad at you guardian 
I'm mad at myself for spending so much time with you and your Jekyll and Hydeness 
I'm glad I figuratively slapped you on the wrist 
You laughed a wicked laugh and said "come here let me clip your wings!" 
(I know he's blood but you can still turn him away you 
Don't owe him anything) 
"raise the roof" he yelled "yeah raise the roof!" I yelled back 
(unfortunately you needed a health scare to reprioritize.) 
No thanks to the soap box 
Having me rile against them 
Won't make an ounce of difference [Chorus] (oh the things I've done for you 
Many a stitch a friend 
A man's been left for you 
Oh the books I've read for you 
The tongues I've bitten for you 
Many a new city for you 
Many a risk taken for you 
Not a single regret)
