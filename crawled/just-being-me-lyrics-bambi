My own opinion about living life 
Doesnt really mean its right 
We all have different ways to live a day 
I always rush to paint my nails 
Go outside when it begins to hail 
Make excuses why i'm too busy 
Always need to get my way 
Or i'll scream for a friggin day 
In the end i guess i should give up 
My brothers raised me up tough 
So i beat all the bois up 
Teachers got too angry to fast 
Give me patience give me trust 
Add that up u got love 
Simple math the only kind i can do I wanna party 
I wanna sing 
I wanna be crazy 
Lazy 
a lil bit dazy 
Thats just being me 
And thats all u'll need If i miss u for a day or two 
Doesnt mean i did forget you 
People get so paranoid these days 
So i sleep every other day 
Theres too much time i can waste 
Doing nothing but i have so much fun 
Wishing i would grow a few 
Inches maybe one or two 
But i guess i'll deal with it anyway 
When i look into a mirror 
I still think nothings dearer 
Then the way i look 'cause i dont care 
I dont get intimidated 
Just a lil discriminated 
But what can u do I wanna party 
I wanna sing 
I wanna be crazy 
Lazy 
a lil bit dazy 
Thats just being me 
And thats all u'll need
