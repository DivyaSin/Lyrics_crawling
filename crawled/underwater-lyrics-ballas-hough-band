When your sky is falling down 
And your green is turning brown 
And you can't go any longer 
When your friends are all away 
And you lose track of the days 
And you're not getting any stronger I remember when you held me underwater 
I can't help it, but it's something I don't wanna be a part of But my eyes cry gently, and I can't hide 
You make feel so lost 
So lost inside 
And you don't get it, how hard I've tried 
You make me feel so lost, 
so lost inside Well, that's how I'm feeling 
Every midnight, every morning 
And lately it's been starting to really get old 
Oh, I miss you but believe me I won't be calling 
After your last performance 
It's really getting old I remember how you held me underwater 
Feeling helpless, and it's something I don't wanna be a part of But my eyes cry gently and I can't hide 
You make me feel so lost 
So lost inside 
And you don't get it, how hard I've tried 
You make me feel so lost 
So lost inside Why do I always feel alone 
When you're standing here by my side? 
Why does it never feel like home? 
Well, when I look in your eyes, 
It's no surprise that this heart is never healing 
I know I'll be fine 
Said I know I'll be fine I remember how you held me underwater 
Feeling helpless, and it's something I don't wanna be a part of But these eyes cry gently and I can't hide 
You make me feel so lost 
So lost inside And you don't get it, how hard I've tried 
You make me feel so lost 
So lost inside
