So close so far we see who we are 
We've come so far but we still bleed we still scar 
We can't let go of these memories buried whole 
What makes us us what makes us close You can't create you can't unfold 
A bond that can not be broken 
One word one voice 
One word one choice 
We still bleed we still scar.
