even if it rains and the sun won't shine. 
(sun wont shine) 
whatever the weather you'll be mine. all of this noise distracts me, 
fear him now, and let there be light. through the worst weather, i'll make sure we're together. 
when the sky begins to hail, we will prevail. [we will prevail] 
the beauty in the eye of the storm 
is where i stand when i feel your grace 
i forget about my pride and my place 
just take me from here. [take me from here] even if it rains and the sun won't shine. 
(sun wont shine) 
whatever the weather you'll be mine. 
[you'll be mine] 
let's watch the rain fall and wash away our innocence in the clouds i hear the chorus sing hallelujah. im tired of this, 
the walls are closing in on me. 
i need an escape, don't stand in my way. through the worst weather, 
i'll make sure were together. 
when the sky begins to hail. we will prevail. even if it rains and the sun won't shine 
[sun wont shine] 
whatever the weather you'll be mine. 
let's watch the rain fall and wash away our innocence in the clouds i hear the chorus sing hallelujah. 
we are the herd, and he is our shepherd. we are the herd we're in this together. 
put the south in your mouth and swallow. we are the herd, and he is our shepherd. we are the herd we're in this together. 
he whose with out sin casts the first stone but who are you to judge.
