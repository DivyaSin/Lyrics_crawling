You know it's all been said before 
Melancholy words that fade with the morning sun 
I always say that you're the one 
Somehow I'm always left undone Dreams are never like you think 
Cause dreams don't really know what it is you really need 
Love sees what you could never see 
Now I see you 
And I never knew 
What love could do [Chorus] 
This is my very first love song 
I'm gonna sing it for you 
This is my very first love song 
I'm gonna sing it for you I know that this is gonna last 
No matter how the change may come I'll have you 
To lean on 
I see it more each passing day 
What we've become 
How wonderful 
To feel this love [Chorus] I feel it in my soul 
I know it's gonna grow 
I feel it in my soul 
I know it's gonna grow 
I feel it in my soul [Chorus]
