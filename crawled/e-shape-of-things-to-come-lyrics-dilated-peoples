Ay, yes y'all 
The only thing constant is change 
With that, it's the shape of things to come, yeah Yo, I'm the open-est emotions, I'm a river in straight 
A crystal clean lake, yo, the essence of skin 
The form of a luminescent bright light fluorescent 
(You got light?) 
Don't wait till it's dark to ask questions 
I been sparkin' in sections and blessing mics with my presence 
Since many were pre-pubescent puberty adolescent 
Perhaps you need a lesson in, addressin' with respect an' 
Too many feel inadequate without their little weapon It's like I got the whole world against me, need to get intensely 
A head full of headache he's and a hand full of sissies 
Them so flimsy so why there one MC 
There wasn't one before hasn't been one since me 
A gangster of love, I come from up above 
I give the mic a tug, I give the world a hug 
I give the skies a kiss, I give suckers a kiss 
Some people like my old styles better than this but Yo, I'm Spacey like Kevin and some do knowledge of seven 
Praise Jesus and Jah, Buddha, Allah or just Heaven 
Yeah, and some like it moderate and some like a lot of it 
Whichever way I go we got somethin' to get you move up out of it 
Some will be statistics and some will be reverends 
Dimes become pennies like dimes become eleven 
To some we kind of thought of it, as teaching the dumb 
Ace-One and dilated, the shape of things to come I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares 
Triangles to test if indeed you're prepared 
This is the shape of things to come 
This is the shape of things to come I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares 
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared 
This is the shape of things to come 
This is the shape of things to come I wax 'em I tax 'em, here's Iriscience, ask him 
From Arkansas to Aspen, the futuristic jazzmen 
I'm telepathic, movin' through hella traffic 
I know my demographics, see how this was crafted and drafted 
There's precision in the incision 
I'm not Christian or Catholic or any other religion 
I'm just man with a steel in his hand 
I shoot the gift from blessed to spark where it land And it landed in the sand where the pyramids blaze 
And this is how the dictionary defines such a place 
A polyhedron with a polygonal base 
Median and common vertex, triangular face 
Who came in the home and ripped the cats stole 
Stripped the limestone to line they fine home 
I cram to understand, their dirty deeds in song 
While we bringing you the shape of things to come I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares 
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared 
This is the shape of things to come 
This is the shape of things to come I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares 
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared 
This is the shape of things to come 
This is the shape of things to come Aiyyo, I center punch punchlines, shine when it's crunch time 
I back to beat box, rap battles at lunchtime 
I sketch a piece and fill it in with design 
Ooh no, Aceyalone, raw bright like sunshine 
Platform squad, standin' on the brink 
Yo I touch the world, got three but two blink 
Rakaa aka Iriscience lenscrafters 
And blend with hash the self defense master Yeah, it's too bad we control fire, wind 
I know that you bad you batted a thousands I remember 
Who's the baddest with the apparatus tell me again 
Take ahold of your heart without penetratin' the skin 
See I didn't invent it, I just perfected it 
I never intended to really connect with it 
But once I got in it, I redirected it 
Now I change the world and get respect with it and a check with it It ain't nothin' new under the sun 
Fool, I ain't afraid of the size of your gun 
The flesh is weak plus they speak foul tongue 
Take the breath from their lungs as they swung 
And they hung and they sunk I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares 
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared 
This is the shape of things to come 
This is the shape of things to come I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares 
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared 
This is the shape of things to come 
This is the shape of things to come Yes y'all 
Yes y'all 
Yes y'all 
Yes y'all
