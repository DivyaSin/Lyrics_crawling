I hate music, but I like to sing 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaa! 
But that's not music! Not what I call MUSIC, no sir! Music is a lot of men with a lot of tails making lots of noise like a lot of 
Females 
Music is a lot of folks in a big dark hall where they really don't want to be 
At all with a lot of chairs and a lot of heirs and a lot of furs and diamonds! 
Music is silly I hate music...but I like to sing
