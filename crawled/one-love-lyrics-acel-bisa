Higher than the sky above you 
clearer than blue 
brighter than the rays of sunshine 
warmer than what you feel 
more than all the wonders you see 
it's the most wonderful thing brighter than the living colors 
of flowers you see 
sweeter than the touch of water 
flowing from the mountain spring 
more than all the wonders you see 
it's the most wonderful thing one love 
i love you so 
love is the beautiful one 
i love you so 
love is the beautiful one 
all we need is love 
real love marvel at the sight of greenfields 
amazingly seen 
watch the colors of the rainbow 
it's miracle you see 
more than all the wonders can be 
but there's more than that one love 
i love you so 
love is the beautiful one 
i love you so 
love is the beautiful one 
all we need is love 
real love clearer than what you could feel 
more than what you've ever dreamed 
this is better than your everything one love 
i love you so 
love is the beautiful one 
i love you so 
love is the beautiful one 
all we need is love 
i love you so 
love is the beautiful one 
i love you so 
love is the beautiful one 
all we need is love
