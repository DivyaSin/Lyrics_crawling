Take me somewhere safe 
Somewhere far away 
To regain the strenght to trust a single fucking thing I say 
I'm picking myself up again 
I'm picking myeself up 
This precious life is the last chance we have 
We must try to make the best of it 
I quit as my patience wears thin 
I'm lost but I'll never give in.
