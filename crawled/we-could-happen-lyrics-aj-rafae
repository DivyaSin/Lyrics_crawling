Verse 1: 
I'll hold the door 
Please come in 
and just sit here for a while. 
This is my 
way of telling you I need you in my life. It's so cold 
without your touch. 
I've been dreaming way too much 
Can we just 
turn this into reality. Chorus: 
Cause I've been 
thinking 'bout you lately. 
Maybe you could save me, 
from this crazy world we live in. 
And I know we could happen, 
cause you know that I've been feeling you. Verse 2: 
Storms they will come 
but I know, 
that the sun will shine again. 
He's my friend, 
and he says that we belong together. 
I'll sing a song, 
to break the ice. 
Just a smile from you would suffice. 
It's not me, being nice 
but this is real tonight. Chorus: 
Cause I've been 
thinking 'bout you lately. 
Maybe you can save me, 
from this crazy world we live in. 
And I know we could happen, 
cause you know that I've been feeling you. 
I know you want me. Bridge: 
There's no other, 
there's no other love. 
That I'd rather have, 
you know. 
There ain't no one, 
there ain't no one else. 
I want you for myself. Chorus: 
I've been 
thinking 'bout you lately. 
Maybe you can save me, 
from this crazy world we live in. 
And I know we could happen, 
cause you know that I've been feeling you. 
I know you want me. I've been 
thinking 'bout you lately. 
Maybe you can save me, 
from this crazy world we live in. 
And I know we could happen, 
cause you know that I've been feeling you. 
I know you want me to. 
I know you want me to.
