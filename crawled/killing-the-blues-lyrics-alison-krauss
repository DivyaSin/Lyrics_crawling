Leaves were falling, just like embers, 
In colors red and gold, they set us on fire 
Burning just like moonbeams in our eyes. [Chorus:] 
Somebody said they saw me, swinging the world by the tail 
Bouncing over a white cloud, killing the blues. Now I'm guilty of something... 
I hope you never do 
Because there is nothing 
Sadder than losing yourself in love. [Chorus] Now you've ask me... just to leave you 
To go out on my own 
And get what I need to. 
You want me to find what I've already had. [Chorus 2x]
