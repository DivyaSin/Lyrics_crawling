I will die for you baby 
I will cry for you baby 
I'm on my knees for you baby 
Oh won't you please give me some of your love I got eyes for you baby (oh yeah) 
I'd go blind for you baby (oh yeah) 
I will steal for you baby (oh yeah) 
If you just give me some of your love Some of your love 
Keep my soul intact 
Some of your love 
Keep the storm clouds back 
I don't think I could ever come back 
If you don't give me some of your love She showed me things (oh yeah) 
That I never knew (oh yeah) 
They've been there forever (oh yeah) 
But it's the first time that I flew Some of your love 
Keep my soul intact 
Some of your love 
Will keep the storm clouds back 
I don't think I could ever come back 
If you don't give me some of your love You're the stars in my sky (oh yeah) 
And there's no wonder why (oh yeah) 
Now the moon's coming out 
My heart start to race 
There was never a doubt 
Just the smile on your face 
Your beautiful soul 
Your beautiful face 
One sweet kiss 
And I just gotta say (Oh yeah) I will die for you baby (oh yeah) 
I will cry for you baby (oh yeah) 
I'm on my knees for you baby (oh yeah) 
Oh won't you please give me some of your love (Oh yeah, oh yeah) 
(Oh yeah)
