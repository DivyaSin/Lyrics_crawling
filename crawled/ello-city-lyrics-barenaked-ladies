Hello city, hey Another night at the palace 
'Cause there is nothin' else to do 
Oh oh, ah ha 
The same people, the same drinks and 
The same music, the same quicksand 
I think this harbor town is waist deep and sinkin' fast Hello city, you've found an enemy in me 
Whoa oh, whoa oh (ba dum tum tum hey hum) 
Hello city, hello city, hello city, hey Second night at the warehouse 
And my mock turtleneck just reeks 
Whoa oh, whoa oh 
From the Liquor room to the change room 
To the doom and gloom of the hotel room 
I think this seaside beer hall should sink into the bay Hello city, you've found an enemy in me 
Whoa oh, whoa oh (ba dum tum tum, ba dum) 
Hello city, hello city, hello city Maybe I caught you at a bad time 
Maybe I should call you back next week 
Maybe half the fault is mine that the sun didn't shine on Barrington Street It's 3 o'clock in the morning 
And I'm hungry so let's eat 
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa Climb down three flights 
Too the street lights 
And the Bar fights 
We're just takin' in the sights 
I hope tomorrow that I wake up in my own bed Hello City, You've found an Enemy in me 
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa 
Hello City, Hello City Hello City hey What a good place to be 
Don't believe them, cause they speak a different language 
And it's Happy hour again 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
It's Happy hour again 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Hello City, eh 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
Hello City, eh
