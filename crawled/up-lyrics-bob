Sometimes I get high to free my mind 
Is that alright? 
Right right right right 
Sometimes I get drunk, to past the time 
Is that alright? 
Is that alright? 
Right right right right Let's roll up something, let's pour up something 
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something 
Let's pour up something 
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something 
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something 
Let's pour up something Sometimes I get high to get you off my brain 
Is that alright? 
Right right right right 
Sometimes I like to get wasted 
Sometimes I like to get faded 
Sometimes I like, what? 
I forgot what I was finna say 
Right right right right Let's roll up something, let's pour up something 
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something 
Let's pour up something 
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something 
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something 
Let's pour up something Let's roll up something, let's pour up something 
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something 
Let's pour up something Before the hoes' ever noticing 
Bank was broken, full of overages 
Who's the foul mouth spoke of this? 
My heart was cold, so emotionless 
Here here here, I can't hear my own thoughts 
Yeah yeah yeah, silence every phone call 
Too much thinking, and too much time in the attic 
Too much drink, and too much weed for my habit 
Too much passion, and too much swag for the average 
Don't need to explain if you can't change what happened 
Oh, loose hand shakes and fake smiles 
More knives in my back than a steakhouse 
Feeling like Em in 8 Mile 
Lose yourself right now, I'm spaced out 
Friends pretending they ain't enemies 
Haters be whispering 'cause they envious 
Numb all the pain I got in my memories 
Who got the pill that they had in Limitless? 
And now who says, now who says I can't get stoned? 
And who cares, who cares, who's right, who's wrong? 
If you find and be clear, a new life with new air, a new flight with new stairs 
You might move on, and get faded 
You might move on, and upgrade it 
You might move on, and just get that bullshit out of the way 
Right right right right Let's roll up something, let's pour up something 
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something 
Let's pour up something, right right right right 
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something 
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something 
Let's pour up something, right right right right
