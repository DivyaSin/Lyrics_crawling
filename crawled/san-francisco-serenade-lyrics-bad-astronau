We run like it kills us to stay 
If judge, I'd be nothing 'till the day that I stopped you 
He's tried as these things might seem to anyone else 
I wrote them down to document My wealth is you 
My wealth is you Excessive city we can't afford to stay 
But home to the same somehow safe now we can afford to leave 
Transformation and tragedy needs conclusion 
Our world marches to drums of death You're my rest 
Stories will sleep 
Say goodnight to them 
And know it's ending Slow my mind 
Silence the truth 
Take my broken hands 
Watch the world remain The stories read of hospitals and alcohol 
And empty households 
The bars were steamed in honesty 
While your retreat 
Resisted me The buildings fail on everything and everyone 
Fed incoherent 
Our time is now 
We'll be there You're my death 
I'm your disease 
Together we will bleed 
devotedly conceive La la la la 
La la la la Take my broken hands 
Watch it all ending 
We watch it all ending
