Can you hear us when we scream 
Of our burdened beliefs ending all sanity? 
The wrong to right indeed I wonder 
The promise to break instead to suffer Can you see us when we bleed 
With wounds a mile deep spraying profusely? 
The pain to feel indeed it grows 
The tables are turned instead to fuel Something inside us fades 
When weakness turns into trying 
We all must carry on 
For the slaughtered and the dying Can you feel us when we kill 
Everything that you have built? 
We must stop at nothing 
The wrong to right, ha, indeed I wonder 
The promise you broke instead you suffer 
Suffer, suffer, suffer Something inside us fades 
When weakness turns into trying 
We all must carry on 
For the slaughtered and the dying now Something inside us fades 
When weakness turns into trying 
We all must carry on 
For the slaughtered and the dying now We all must carry on 
For the slaughtered and the dying 
We all must carry on 
For the slaughtered and the dying now
