It's a story with every breath, and every bookend is choking to death. This is the age of the sick and the dying, the age of the buried and burning. And we sat and wited in silencce as the words got louder and louder. You brought this on yourself. With blindfold and gags, this game was mapped out from the moment we came to. Your heroes are liars and your gods are rotting as if they were never even there. This should have been the year of the tried and true, not another stone washed face trading himself for the heartless red white and blue. I hope you got the chance to sell your hopes and dreams before he got to you, because if not, he'll just steal them without even the blink of aneye. Your first mistake was thinking that they would never remember you, let alone give a shit. That's how it goes in this age. And by now I bet you're wishing that you had never signed that line, and that you were back at home in that hellhole that you left behind. This is the age of the sick and the dying. All the eyes are on you. I hope they didn't make you burn any beds. I hope they told you that your leader lied through his teeth. I'm sure the'll make you believe it'll all be worth it in the end. I'm sure they never told you they sent you on a kamikaze mission. The end is never when you expect it.
