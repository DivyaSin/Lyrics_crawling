Right now 
Well it's finally time to face my fears 
Gonna get the hell out of here 
And create a fresher atmosphere 
But the consequences clear There's a furnace set on high 
And the yearning undefyed 
But it's time to turn the tide 
It's social suicide Like you 
Perseverance is a useless tool 
Just a patron on a ship of fools 
Painting interest in the cast and crew 
Why you've broken every single rule There's a furnace set on high 
And the yearning undefyed 
But it's time to turn the tide 
It's social suicide Shadows entertain me 
I don't want it masses 
Shadows explain their known reactions 
I don't even know if I can ever find truth 
But I'm sure it won't come from far away There's a furnace set on high 
And the yearning undefied 
But it's time to turn the tide 
It's social suicide
