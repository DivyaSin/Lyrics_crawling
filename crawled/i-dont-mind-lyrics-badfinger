Birds sing and doorbells ring in answer 
People say it's a lovely day outside 
I don't mind, I've got my way of living 
Even if it's only for the ride I don't mind if people find me lazy 
I could say it's only for the fun 
Step inside and see if I can make you 
After all it's only just begun You don't know me, what's on my mind 
You can't show me what I can't find Days, nights, alright, it's easy 
Breaking time and making rhymes for you 
I don't mind, I've got my way of giving 
Even if it's all I ever do Step inside and see if I can make you 
Even if it's only for the ride You don't know me, what's on my mind 
You can't show me what I can't find
