Please simplify how I'm supposed to do this 
I'm all alone in this intervention 
I'll poison waterfalls with tree sap and piss to stand up! 
I take these vitamins so I can forget 
About the pointless thoughts taking precedence 
My imagination makes me useless to stand up and say This is only going to break my heart 
This is only going to tear me apart 
This is only going to break my heart 
So come on! I've lost my mind many dozen a' times 
I had a heart scan and thought I was going to die 
Disease and doctors threw me a sign 
To stand up! 
I'm a critic and a hundred years old 
A product of dysfunction, 
"Oh pity," I'm told 
I'm never good enough to fill up my bowl 
To stand up and say This is only going to break my heart 
This is only going to tear me apart 
This is only going to break my heart 
So come on!
