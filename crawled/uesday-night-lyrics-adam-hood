I'm always hoping for a good time 
But it never happens on a Tuesday night 
two weeks and I'm here in the same place the same rhythm for most of my life my heads aching from everyone's cigarettes my hands hurting from the steel strings five hours and it never did bother me that I was the only one listening My life should drive me crazy living every day like I do But I'm so glad for someone like you I can come home to. I spent my whole life searching for a road tailing me everywhere now I want to spend some time with you baby but it's so hard when I'm never there it takes everything to follow my heart sometimes I'm so afraid yea, but if my life ever does hurt you baby I'll pull the breaks and stop the train I know we're tired and lonely, but love is gonna pull us through and I'm so glad for someone like you I can come home to.
