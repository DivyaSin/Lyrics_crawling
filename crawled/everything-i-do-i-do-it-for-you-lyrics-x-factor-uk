Look into my eyes 
You will see 
What you mean to me 
Search your heart 
Search your soul 
And when you find me there, you'll search no more Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for 
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for 
You know it's true 
Everything I do 
I do it, do it for you Look into your heart 
You will find 
There's nothing there to hide 
Take me as I am 
Take my life 
I would give it all 
I would sacrifice Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for 
I can't help it 
There's nothin' I want more 
Oh, ya know it's true 
Everything I do 
I do it for you There's no love 
Like your love 
And no other 
Could give me more love There's nowhere 
Unless you're there 
All the time 
All the way You can't tell me it's not worth fightin' for 
You can't tell me there's nothin' I want more 
Oh, I would die for you 
I'd lie for you 
I'd walk the wire for you 
Ya I'd die for you ya know it's true 
Everything I do- I do it for you
