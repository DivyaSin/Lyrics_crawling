Close your eyes 
It's time to dream 
Of all the places that you've never seen 
You can walk and you can fly 
Through the walls and over the sky Sleepy time baby 
Now lay down your head 
Cuz if you're off to dreamland 
You've got to get to bed You can move a tree or grow a flower 
Build a castle just where ever you are 
Make it all happen what ever you think 
Just like magic you can do it in a wink Sleepy time baby 
Now lay down your head 
Cuz if you're off to dreamland 
You've got to get to bed You can be what ever you want 
As tall as a giant or as small as a ant 
Your favorite hero will be your best friend 
And anything that you want is at your command Sleepy time baby 
Now lay down your head 
Cuz if you're off to dreamland 
You've got to get to bed Sleepy time baby 
Now lay down your head 
Cuz if you're off to dreamland 
You've got to get to bed Sleepy time baby 
Now lay down your head 
Cuz if you're off to dreamland 
You've got to get to bed
