Look for Ocean in the Sky 
Like the soft deep of High 
In the danger 
Goblin will fascinate 
Taste it don't be afraid 
Leave me easy 
If you call me and wait 
Does your light emanate 
Don't betray me 
As wind blows us away 
All the more I've to play 
May me open 
My gleam infernal star 
Like me feel who you are 
In the fire 
I see through Goblin's game 
Sky to Earth sticks again 
Play with danger 
As wind blows us away 
Leaving immortals' stay 
Don't betray me 
You win...You win...
