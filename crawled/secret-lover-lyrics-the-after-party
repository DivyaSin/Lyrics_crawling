Yeah yeah hey, 
Oh ohhh 
Yeah yeah, yayyy 
Desperate, and in love 
I was young and I just couldnt get enough 
Gave you my love and fancy things 
You gave your love away for free 
And kept it quiet, you snuck around 
But I know youre in the bedroom getting down 
You probably think youre good with lies, 
But, baby, secrets never hide 
I can almost hear you say 
[Chorus] 
You cant catch me, na na na na na 
Try and find me, na na na na na 
Youll never find me, try to find me 
With a secret lover, oh its impossible X 2 
Baby, you broke my heart, 
Now I realize its been broken from the start 
I used to think that love was real 
Now I feel the way you feel 
Oh, heated, with secret lust 
With passion I emprace a simple touch 
It only leaves me wanting more 
Now youre not my only 
Ahahaha, what a whore 
Everybodys got something to hide 
Youre not the only one good with lies 
[Chorus] 
You cant catch me, na na na na na 
Try and find me, na na na na na 
Youll never find me, try to find me 
With a secret lover, oh its impossible X 2 
They say the truth will set you free 
But I dont think that is true 
Cause the truth has shattered me 
It turned me into you 
I can almost hear you say 
[Chorus] 
You cant catch me, na na na na na 
Try and find me, na na na na na 
Youll never find me, try to find me 
With a secret lover, oh its impossible X 2
