Little brother's in the backyard revin' up the engine 
Tuning up for Saturday night 
Be a dirt track mogul 
Racing round the oval 
Passing everything in sight 
But come Sunday mornin we'll all pile in 
And head down the road to church 
Mamma in the back hangin on for dear life 
Cursing brother on every curve Number 34 painted on the doors 
Flames on the fenders 
STP stickers 
A Hurst shifter four on the floor 
The preacher shuts his eyes 
Starts preying hard 
When brother cuts a donut in the church house yard 
The congregation roars for number 34 When brother was a baby 
We knew he'd be a racer 
He loved the smell of gasoline 
He could say Max Dumsdy 
Before Dad and Mummy 
He could even say Valvoline 
He took the family car to the demolition derby 
When he was just fifteen 
He said don't worry mamma 
I'll fix it up good 
Now we've got a mean machine With number 34 painted on the doors 
Flames on the fenders 
STP stickers 
A Hurst shifter four on the floor 
Even mamma now and then gets behind the wheel 
And pops second gear and makes the rubber peel 
A hot mamma for sure at number 34 
The preacher shuts his eyes 
Starts preying hard 
When brother cuts a donut in the church house yard 
The congregation roars for number 34 
A hot mamma for sure is number 34
