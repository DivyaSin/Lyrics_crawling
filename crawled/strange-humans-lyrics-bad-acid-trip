We humans are getting pretty strange 
And maybe we forgot how to use our brains 
And fearing your self and all those around 
And we're all living in a system of a down 
Can't you see you're just like me 
There's no reason to hate 
Lets laugh and have some fun before it's too late 
I don't think you even know 
Why it is you hate me so 
Spending your life living a lie 
That they provide and you buy 
We've become trapped in our shells 
Putting our selves through mental hell 
Why do we live this way 
Change ourselves and sieze the day
