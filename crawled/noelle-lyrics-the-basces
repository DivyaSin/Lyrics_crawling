All these days dreaming of 
the things you want to leave behind 
All this time was not in vain 
Spring will always come again Now you're near, 
are you happy just to be there? 
so close and miles away Noelle, oh Noelle 
It's not the time to say goodbye 
Noelle oh Noelle 
The shine of your smile 
will always keep your dreams alive All the things you've said and done 
They seem to be so far away 
Only when the feelings grow 
You know there's nothing left but pride Now it's time 
to find the places where the letters 
keep all the words inside Noelle, oh Noelle 
It's not the time to say goodbye 
Noelle, oh Noelle 
The shine of your smile 
will always keep your dreams alive Noelle, oh Noelle 
The shine of your smile 
will always keep your dreams alive
