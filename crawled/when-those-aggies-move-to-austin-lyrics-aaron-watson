G D C 
You're the devil's daughter in disguise 
G D C 
So don't try to hide the fire in your eyes 
D C G 
You must be stupid cause you just don't have a clue 
D C D 
Even hell frozen over is warmer than my love for you Chorus: 
G D C 
When all those Aggies move to Austin 
G D C 
And Beaumont is covered in snow 
G D C 
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo 
C D G 
Darlin' then you can come back home G D C 
You sure can shake your little round behind 
G D C 
But your hour glass figure won't buy my time 
D C G 
You know how to work it Lord knows it's worked before 
D C D 
This time you leave your butt will have the imprint of the front door Chorus: Bridge: 
F G 
When Fort Worth is east of Dallas 
F G 
And Texans forget the Alamo 
C D G Em 
When Lubbock opens up a ski resort 
F D 
And the Brazos is straighter than an arrow Chorus: 
G D C 
When all those Aggies move to Austin 
G D C 
And Beaumont is covered in snow 
G D C 
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo 
C D G 
Darlin' then you can come back home 
Em 
But don't hold your breath 
C D G 
then you can come back home
