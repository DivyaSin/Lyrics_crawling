Ladies, you're damn right 
You can't read a man's mind 
We're living in two tribes 
And heading for war 
Well, nobody's perfect 
We all gotta work it 
But fellas, we're worth it 
So don't break the law Your call's late, big mistake 
You gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take 
Next time, read my mind 
And I'll be good to you 
We're gift-wrapped kitty Kats, 
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back 
Let's go, Eskimo 
Out into the blue.... Come take my hand, understand that you can, 
You're my man & I need you tonight Come make my dreams 
Honey, hard as it seems 
Loving me is as easy as pie (Aii) I'm just a Love Machine 
Feeding my fantasy 
Give me a kiss or three & I'm fine 
I need a squeeze a day 
'Stead of this negligee 
What will the neighbours say this time I've been going crazy while you sleep 
Searching for a language that the 2 of us can speak 
So, Mr. prehistoric make your wheel 
& I'll breathe underwater 'cause I like the way it feels Your call's late, big mistake 
You gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take 
Next time, read my mind 
And I'll be good to you We're gift-wrapped kitty Kats, 
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back 
Let's go, Eskimo 
Out into the blue.... Come take my hand, understand that you can, 
You're my man & I need you tonight 
Come make my dreams 
Honey, hard as it seems 
Loving me is as easy as pie I'm just a Love Machine 
Feeding my fantasy 
Give me a kiss or three & I'm fine 
I need a squeeze a day 
'Stead of this negligee 
What will the neighbours say this time? Oh, it's very new 
Can anybody tell me what to do 
Oh, this feeling's very strange 
Can anybody tell me what's your game (Oh) A little education 
(Oh) to give you motivation 
(Oh) We'll turn the situation round 
(Oh) 'cause I don't wanna change ya 
(Oh) Making you a stranger 
(Oh) I'll only re-arrange ya for now (Oh) I'm just a Love Machine 
(Oh, to give you motivation 
(Oh) I'm just a Love Machine (Oh) I'm just a love machine 
(Oh, to give you motivation 
(Oh) I'm just a Love Machine (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
