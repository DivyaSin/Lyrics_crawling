It Never Rains in Southern California 
Listen To The World 
Listen to the world, the world, the world 
Listen to the people cry 
Listen to the world, the world, the world 
Do you ever wonder why 
We don't see eye to eye? English doesn't flow enough 
Chinese isn't slow enough 
Russian we don't know enough 
To tell them how we feel All those preachers tellin' you 
You're religious, good for you 
Perfect for the whole world too 
If they know what's good for them Oh, listen to the world, the world, the world 
Listen to the people cry 
Listen to the world, the world, the world 
Do you ever wonder why 
We don't see eye to eye? Did you ever listen to the TV ad-man's spiel? 
Love is just another way to make another deal Don't you feel a bit ashamed 
For the politician's game? 
Yet we signed beside his name 
And put him where he is Oh, listen to the world, the world, the world 
Listen to the people cry 
Listen to the world, the world, the world 
Do you ever wonder why 
We don't see eye to eye? The voice of the people should echo far and wide 
Instead of keeping what they feel bottled up inside Let the people have their say 
Tomorrow isn't far away 
It should be better than today 
If we raise our voices Oh, listen to the world, the world, the world 
Listen to the people cry 
Listen to the world, the world, the world 
Did you ever wonder why 
We don't see eye to eye? Listen to the world, the world, the world 
Listen to the people cry 
Listen to the world, the world, the world 
Did you ever wonder why 
You don't see eye to eye? Listen to the world, the world, the world 
Listen to the people cry 
Oh, listen to the world, the world, the world 
Did you ever wonder why 
You don't see eye to eye? Listen to the world, the world, the world 
Listen to the people cry...
