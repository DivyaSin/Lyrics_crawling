You get up every morning 
From your alarm clock's warning 
Take the 8:15 into the city 
There's a whistle up above 
And people pushin', people shovin' 
And the girls who try to look pretty 
And if your train's on time 
You can get to work by nine 
And start your slaving job to get your pay 
If you ever get annoyed 
Look at me I'm self-employed 
I love to work at nothing all day 
And I'll be Taking care of business every day 
Taking care of business every way 
I've been taking care of business, it's all mine 
Taking care of business and working overtime 
Work out If it were easy as fishin' 
You could be a musician 
If you could make sounds loud or mellow 
Get a second-hand guitar 
Chances are you'll go far 
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows 
People see you having fun 
Just a-lying in the sun Tell them that you like it this way 
It's the work that we avoid 
And we're all self-employed 
We love to work at nothing all day 
And we be Taking care of business every day 
Taking care of business every way 
I've been taking care of business, it's all mine 
Taking care of business and working overtime 
Take good care of my business 
When I'm away, every day whoo! You get up every morning 
From your alarm clock's warning 
Take the 8:15 into the city 
There's a whistle up above 
And people pushin', people shovin' 
And the girls who try to look pretty And if your train's on time 
You can get to work by nine 
And start your slaving job to get your pay 
If you ever get annoyed 
Look at me I'm self-employed 
I love to work at nothing all day 
And I'll be Taking care of business every day 
Taking care of business every way 
I've been taking care of business, it's all mine 
Taking care of business and working overtime Takin' care of business 
Takin' care of business 
Takin' care of business 
Takin' care of business 
Takin' care of business
