I used to feel so dark inside 
So evil, bad and gloomy 
But now the sun is coming out 
And joy is rushing through me I feel good, he feels good 
Oh so good, oh so good 
I used to be a bad boy but now I am glad to be good 
Oh so good I used to be a bad boy 
Always running from the cops, so bad 
But now I am a good boy 
I hope it never stops So much goodness in my heart 
I don't know where to start 
I wanna clap my hands, jump for joy 
Run around and play like a human boy 
I feel a happy and nice, groovy and funny I wanna help an old lady across the street 
I wanna volunteer to pick up litter 
Help people out 'cause I'm not bitter 
I wanna make new friends, such a quilt 
Teach at a school that I have built I feel good, he feels good 
Oh so good, oh so good 
I used to be a bad boy but now I am glad to be good 
Oh, so good He feels good, he feels good 
Oh so good, oh so good 
I used to be a bad boy but now I am glad to be good 
Oh so good
