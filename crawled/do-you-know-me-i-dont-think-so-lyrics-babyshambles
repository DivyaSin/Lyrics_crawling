Do you know me? I don't think so! 
Do you know me? I don't think so! 
You romanticize the dark and gloomy past 
Trying to escape from the underclass 
You darkened the bright and beautiful day 
You're breaking my heart in every way 
And tell me everything is dandy and fine 
You're no friend of mine I took you in and you stole from me 
But you still got everything I need 
You're walking so tall, you're looking so mean 
You're walking so tall, you're looking so mean 
But you tell me everything is dandy and fine 
You're no friend of mine Do you know me? I don't think so! 
Do you know me? I don't think so! 
You romanticize the dark and gloomy past 
Trying to escape from the upper class 
You darkened the bright and beautiful day 
You're fucking up my head in every way 
And tell me everything's dandy and fine
