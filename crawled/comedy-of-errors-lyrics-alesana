I've been here before am I losing my mind 
Look at me, tell me i'm crazy 
We're in danger 
Follow me and you'll see things are not what they seem 
Take my hand or don't you trust me 
We are in danger and i'm the one to blame At the edge of man's reason there exist designs to escape reality 
The tesseract calls to me 
Cosmic strings shall be mine to pull 
Failure met by failure 
Try again, try again 
Still she calls to me Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams 
I promise fantasies can be more than words that we have buried alive 
The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more 
I'm never closing my eyes 
Forever one with the night Hush sweet baby don't say a word 
I'm ignoring destiny for reasons I can't tell you 
We try to fool our minds 
How long do we wait for salvation 
Is it a sin to wonder 
Get off your knees Failure met by failure 
Try again, try again 
She's insane 
Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams 
I promise fantasies can be more than words that we have buried alive 
The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more 
I'm never closing my eyes 
Forever one with the night Can you hear me, can you see me 
Can you hear me, can you see me 
Can you hear me, someone's talking 
Can you see me, someone's watching Delusions of grandeur, where the hell am I? save me from myself 
'Cause I can no longer play this morbid game 
Just when I thought it was over, here we go 
Galaxies welcome me inside I'm insane 
Oh the horror, oh the panic 
Paranoid and deranged, I am a god 
Psychotic and ashamed, why, why Can you hear me, can you see me 
Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams 
I promise fantasies can be more than words that we have buried alive 
The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more 
I'm never closing my eyes 
Forever one with the night 
I'm never closing my eyes 
Forever one with the night It was a dark and stormy night 
I've traveled near and far, raced with all the stars 
Now alone i'll be, subtle tragedy 
If I had one more chance to just explore 
I would take your hand and do it all again
