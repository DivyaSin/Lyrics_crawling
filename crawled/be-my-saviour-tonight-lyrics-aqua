"Be My Saviour Tonight" If you lay your hands on me 
Telling me words I really like to hear 
Like I love you (like I love you), like I miss you (like I miss you) 
Just be my savior tonight I'm gonna rock on the floor, like it's saturday night 
Going wam bam baby, put your tongue off for me 
Record on, volume up, lights on, lights off 
Come closer, let me see what's inside of that dress And slow, let's go, we are putting on a show 
What's inside of my head, baby you ain't got a clue 
I am the only one, you are the only one 
We are the, we are the, w-we are the only one If you lay your hands on me - go baby go 
Telling me words I really like to hear 
Like I love you (like I love you), like I miss you (like I miss you) 
Just be my savior tonight If you crawl on top of me - go baby go 
Telling me words I really like to hear 
Like I want you (like I want you), like I need you (like I need you) 
Just be my savior tonight I'm gonna move up and down 'till your body hits the ground 
Give me something, give me something baby, something tonight 
Pull 'em down, rip it off, bubble up my top 
It's a steamy hot night in the night fg-club My head explodes and you're dancing with the pole 
And dirty little cream, you're the fantasy dream 
You are the lonely one, I am the lonely one 
We are the, we are the, we are the lonely ones If you lay your hands on me - go baby go 
Telling me words I really like to hear 
Like I love you (like I love you), like I miss you (like I miss you) 
Just be my savior tonight If you crawl on top of me - go baby go 
Telling me words I really like to hear 
Like I want you (like I want you), like I need you (like I need you) 
Just be my savior tonight It's a lonely feeling being me tonight 
I can almost hate myself going crazy inside 
If you just came closer I could feel your vibe 
Going up, so I can feel it like it's saturday night It's a lonely feeling being me tonight 
I can almost hate myself going crazy inside 
And I want you 
And I want you If you lay your hands on me - go baby go 
Telling me words I really like to hear 
Like I love you (like I love you), like I miss you (like I miss you) 
Just be my savior tonight If you crawl on top of me - go baby go 
Telling me words I really like to hear 
Like I want you (like I want you), like I need you (like I need you) 
Just be my savior tonight
