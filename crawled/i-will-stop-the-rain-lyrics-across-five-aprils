You make me wanna scream.Save today...just break away.What's making you want to stay?Is it me?You swear talk days are over.I just can't be your lover.Bury me in the back of the yard with dirt.Raise a glass tip your hat and toast to the past.Don't strike a deal with me go ahead and stay on your knees.Last thing I'll say to you,Catch a cab,hop a train cause,you and me are through.I'm sick of living every day of life like I'm the one to blame.My life is mine to own I'm gonna take this time for me to take it back.I gave you everything.I don't even wanna wear this ring.You should of,should of,spent more time on me.All together strong as ever you can hear me sing.Hey,hey baby why can't you just break away.Was it something he said?Take this chance to get away.Stop forgetting the pain.You may not live another day.Just hop a train,some day I will stop the rain.Just know that come what may.One word and I'm on my way.You can live through this pain.I will stop the rain.Hey,hey baby why you can't just break away.Was it something he said?Take this chance to get away.Stop forgetting the pain.You may not live another day.Just hop a train,some day i will stop the rain.
