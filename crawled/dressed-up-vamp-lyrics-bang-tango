Outside there's this flickerin' sound 
I can feel it rising above me, above the ground My eyes, they gleam like fluorescence signs 
As I start across the sky, I can smell freedom 
Prepare to cross the line 
Ridin' hard on my rock 'n' roll machine Well, I'm dressed up the 90's 
And I'll always come clean 
A body of perfection made of the richest kind 
I'm seeking out a hero, the hero of my mind, so I need a kiss, I need a kiss 
I need to feel your plain cold lips 
I need a kiss, I need a kiss 
I need to feel your cold, cold lips Well, I'm dressed up, dressed up, dressed up 
Vamp tonight 
Well, I'm looking for love 
And a lonely bite Well, I'm dressed up, dressed up, dressed up 
Vamp tonight 
Well, I'm looking for love 
On this lonely, lonely night The voices that surround me 
They're my untamed friends 
I'm a true believer in 
Livin' to the very end, so All dressed up and I'm runnin' ravaged 
I'm lookin' for that one last bite 
I'm dressed up and I'm ready to fly 
An eager one to satisfy 
A broken heart to mystify Well, I'm dressed up and I'm ready to fly
