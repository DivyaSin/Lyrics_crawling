well, he's a no good for nothing 
but she wishes he was good for something 
besides his behind looking so fine 
in those wragler jeans 
well all her friends can't help but stare 
at his blue denim derie'er 
wish that they were in her boots 
if you know what i mean 
and it may sound crazy 
but those wrangler butts 
drive the cowgirls nuts 
well he lays around all day long 
stays out at night until the break of dawn 
comes crawling in dragging 
mud across her floor 
well she'd love to kick him out 
but she can't help but thinking about 
all the women who are waiting line 
for his 33/34's 
and it may sound crazy 
but those wrangler butts 
it aint healthy if they fit too tight 
you know this could hurt a man 
by the end of the night 
it's a powerful thing 
if they fit just right 
all the ladies know it's a mighty beautiful sight 
well he's never been one for anything 
that involves books 
he aint got much going for him besides his good looks 
you see he always stays in trouble 
when it comes down to romance 
it aint a joke when they say the boy 
survives by the seat of his pants 
and it may sound crazy 
but those wrangler butts 
drive the cowgirls nuts 
yes it may sound crazy 
but those wrangler butts 
drive the cowgirls nuts
