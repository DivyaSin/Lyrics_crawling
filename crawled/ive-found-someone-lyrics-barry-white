It's not everyday 
You can find something in your life 
That is worth all the money in this world 
Happiness And for the first time in my life 
I find it hard for me to express myself 
Or the way I feel 
It's plain to see why I want to scream 
Makes me want to holler 
Makes me want to shout 
It makes me want to sing lyrics of love 
And joy and happiness Never thought I'd find someone who'd blow my mind..yea 
Like you do 
And never thought I'd see the day 
That it could be so true yea Yes I found someone, yeah 
Someone that I can give my love to 
And do all the things I've longed to do 
Girl I've found out it's you, it's true 
It's true, it's you Never have I known the kinda love you've shown 
In my life 
An don't believe its something that I've ever felt 
Yes I know why 
It's all because I 
I've, I've found someone, yeah yeah yeah 
Someone that I can reach out and touch Your smiling face, it means so much 
Girl you'll be the one I need 
When things go wrong 
I'm gonna need your faith 
To keep me strong Oh I don't care, I don't care 
I don't care what you do 
Gonna take the rest of my life 
Take a chance on you
