verse #1: 
Give us a chance we're never afraid to try 
We'll be like rockets shooting across the sky 
Don't need to explain that's just the way that we vibe 
Give us a chance we'll light up the darkest night Chours #1: 
So keep on chasing the dark side of the moon (OH OH OH) 
Keep replaying your dreams till they come true (OH OH OH) 
'Cause we('re) here, we here to stay, nothing getting in our way 
We'll keep chasing the dark side of the moon Verse #2: 
Give us a dream, there's no sleeping till we die 
We are the future, we're not a slave to time 
Don't need anybody telling us we can't fly 
Give us a dream we'll light up the darkest night Chours #2: 
So keep on chasing the dark side of the moon (OH OH OH) 
Keep replaying your dreams till they come true (OH OH OH) 
'Cause we('re) here, we here to stay, nothing getting in our way 
We'll keep chasing the dark side of the moon, the dark side of the Bridge: 
Moooooooooooon Chasers, we're raising up our flag 
We're Moooooooooooon Chasers, we don't give up so fast Chours #3: 
So keep on chasing the dark side of the moon (OH OH OH) 
Keep replaying your dreams till they come true (OH OH OH) 
'Cause we('re) here, we here to stay, nothing getting our way 
We'll keep chasing the dark side of the moon, the dark side of the moon
