I want make me feel 
Like I'm in space with the stars 
Make me feel all right 
What do you want now? 
Before I need to go 
You know I needed to say 
Why don't you like me now? 
Why don't you like me now? 
Why don't you like me? (2) 
What I've heard 
Is all these little lies 
Why do they say them? NOW! 
OOOOOH! 
Why don't you like me now? 
Why don't you like me now? 
Why don't you like me? (2) 
All this time 
I've been bind sided 
Why won't it seem 
To be the same 
Why don't you like me now? 
Why don't you like me now? 
Why don't you like me? (2)
