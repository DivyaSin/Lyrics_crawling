Love and marriage, love and marriage, 
go together like a horse and carriage, 
this I tell you brother, 
you can't have one without the other. Love and marriage, love and marriage, 
it's an institute you can't disparage, 
ask the local gentry, 
and they will say it's elementary. Try, try, try to separate them, 
it's an illusion, 
try, try, try and you will only come, 
to this conclusion. Love and marriage, love and marriage, 
go together like a horse and carriage, 
dad was told by mother, 
You can't have one, you can't have one 
You can't have one without the other.
