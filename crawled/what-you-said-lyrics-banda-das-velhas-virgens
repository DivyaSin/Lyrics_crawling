Musica por: Paulo Carvalho 
Baby, now you'll gimme what you said 
Baby, now you'll gimme what you said 
You promissed me your body 
Now I'm here I come to get 
Baby, don't you even lock your door 
Baby, don't you even lock your door 
Tonight I'll catch what's mine 
Even if must come through floor 
You promissed your body 
You promissed your mouth 
You promissed to suck 
Like no one around 
Baby, now you'll gimme what you said 
You promissed your body 
Now I'm here I come get 
Suck, suck me, suck me, baby 
Suck, suck me, all night long 
Tonight I'll catch what's mine 
Don't you try to say I'm wrong (not wrong, baby)
