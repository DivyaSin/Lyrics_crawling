Who needs a dream? 
Who needs ambition? 
Who'd be the fool 
In my position? 
Once I had dreams 
Now they're obsessions 
Hopes became needs 
Lovers possessions. Then they move in 
Oh so discreetly 
Slowly at first 
Smiling too sweetly 
I opened doors 
They walked right through them 
Called me their friend 
I hardly knew them. Now I'm where I want to be and who I want to be and doing what I 
always said I would and yet I feel I haven't won at all. 
Running for my life and never looking back in case there's 
someone right behind to shoot me down and say he always knew I'd fall. When the crazy wheel slows down 
Where will I be? Back where I started. Don't get me wrong 
I'm not complaining 
Times have been good 
Fast, entertaining 
But what's the point 
If I'm concealing 
Most of my thoughts 
All of my feeling. Now I'm where I want to be and who I want to be and doing what I 
always said I would and yet I feel I haven't won at all. 
Running for my life and never looking back in case there's 
someone right behind to shoot me down and say he always knew I'd fall. When the crazy wheel slows down 
Where will I be? Back where I started.
