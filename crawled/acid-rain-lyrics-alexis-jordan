It ain't hard to tell, I excel and prevail 
Young niggas rising hell but talk well 
Make sales, I managed to re-fake jail 
Blast on the road to success was... 
But here we are, breathing, fuck demons 
Never get caught sleeping, I'd rather be caught dreaming 
Now me and my niggas be flying across seas 
Laughing at the days we used to rack tall T's 
Now we rock shows up in London, wondering 
How they even heard of me 
Never did occur to me if I get to the top one day 
Lotta niggas gonna be sending shots my way 
Could've been the worst that I shot then say 
Across the bear hoes you never got complain 
One day, though, some day is on 
One day you're here, next day you're gone Wake up with the fear of living for another day 
Tell myself that it's nothing that I can't take 
Your strength is the sickness I can't hide 
I try to be invisible to him 
Make no noise, tip toe through everything 
Hell's fury feeds the fear inside It's like acid rain in a hurricane 
Might hear your call to bring you cover 
It's a crown of thorns leaving me torn 
Might hear your call to bring you cover I made choices that I cannot live with 
I regret not choosing over him 
I'm suffocating in this life 
Don't know if I can survive this weather 
And you turn up with your arms and umbrella 
I send a farewell tonight It's like acid rain in a hurricane 
Might hear your call to bring you cover 
It's a crown of thorns leaving me torn 
Might hear your call to bring you cover My life could be a movie let me write the script 
It would be something truly never read like a crypt 
... with clothes full of hoes like a pimp 
Far from a flower but I rose like a blimp 
Now who we gonna cast for the roles in this flick? 
Only bad hoes getting shows for the tricks 
Who gonna play the lead, though? Will Smith? Maybe 
Second thought, fuck it, ain't nobody gonna play me 
Yo, some day is on, one day you're here, next day you're gone 
One day you're here, next day you're gone I know the risk has come, I know I can run into your arms 
I know you'll come to save me from harm 
It's like acid rain in a hurricane 
Might hear your call to bring you cover 
It's a crown of thorns leaving me torn 
Might hear your call to bring you cover
