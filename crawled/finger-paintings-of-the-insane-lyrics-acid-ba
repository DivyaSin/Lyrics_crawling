Turning the knife buried in your stomach 
I woke up alive black with stain 
Glistening and new the sunset's coming 
Finger paintings of the insane 
Come on and sterilize me 
Kneel down and idolize me 
Suck me, fuck me, resurrect me 
Rut me, cut me and infect me 
Slice me, dice me I wanna die screamin' 
The thoughts of dead babies wiped away with my semen 
Bleed me, feed me and inject me 
Feel me, kill me then dissect me 
The pigs will squeal their blood will drain 
Finger paintings of the insane 
Slice the throat of authority 
Imagining infinity 
Greasy smoke billows into the sky 
Coach roach dreams, the human dust of pain 
Twitching screaming hide your razor face 
Finger paintings of the insane 
Bloody mountain momma rockabilly machine 
Kiddy porn lover with a mouth for disease 
Giddy 'up honey my rubber fuck doll 
When your candle's snuffed out I'll burn brighter than before 
Pink poinsettias for emotion that died 
A chilling wargasm that feels like cyanide 
Her pussy bleeds sunshine, rabid for flesh 
As each raindrop plunges to its death
