Once upon a time is how it always goes 
But I'll make it brief 
What was started out with such excitement 
Now I'd gladly end with relief 
In what now has become a familiar motif: That nothing is good enough 
For people like you 
Who have to have someone take the fall 
And something to sabotage-- 
Determined to lose it all Critics at their worst could never criticize 
The way that you do 
No, there's no one else, I find, 
To undermine or dash a hope 
Quite like you 
And you do it so casually, too Cause nothing is good enough 
For people like you 
Who have to have someone take the fall 
And something to sabotage-- 
Determined to lose it all Ladies and gentlemen-- 
Here's exhibit a 
Didn't I try again? 
And did the effort pay? 
Wouldn't a smarter man 
Simply walk away? It doesn't really help that you can never say 
What you're looking for 
But you'll know it when you hear it, 
Know it when you see it walk through the door 
So you say-- 
So you've said many times before But nothing is good enough 
For people like you 
Who have to have someone take the fall 
And something to sabotage-- 
Determined to lose it all
