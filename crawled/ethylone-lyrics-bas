I've been doing the wrong drugs all along Good things don't happen to good people 
People never change 
Pupils dilate my frame 
Make my vision so exquisite 
While my cousin dead and gone 
I can't wait to go and visit 
Father time, don't deny me 
I just need a couple minutes 
Exercise my better nature 
I've been holding up these bridges 
Nigga's always take advantage 
Olive branches start to splinter 
Giving way, withering, turnin' colder than the winter 
And my city, bit the center 
Feels no pity, this for me, this for me 
I'm just reaping what I sow 
And I've been sewing for my nigga's in the snow 
And let them know I be sewing 
Never slow to know your pain 
I'll be back before you know it 
Left the town a drug dealer 
Came back a fucking poet 
Let me grow I need to leave this shit alone 
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along 
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from 
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone Last week I bought a testing kit, I wish they made 'em for people 
The way these nigga's be actin' they should be castin' a sequel 
Niggas phony they only give you dap just to reach you 
I know ain't the first homie to have to tackle these issues 
Hov told me the evils 
Got the best of him then, they get the best of me now 
Without a Reasonable Doubt 
When niggas acting irrational, hard to reason it out 
I had to kick down the doors, I had to leave a few out 
Door mat I need to leave this shit alone 
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along 
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from 
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone It's okay 
My bitches know I'm a fiend 
But that's okay 
They just love me for me 
They just love me for me 
(Methylone) I need to leave this shit alone 
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along 
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from 
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone I need to leave this shit alone 
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along 
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from 
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
