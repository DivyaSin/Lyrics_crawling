Big men get all her love 
With things they must do 
I just called her, love 
Over you, baby And big men want big things, babe 
And names on the door 
But all I want is you, babe 
Nothing more 'Cause I've got the world to hold me up 
I've got the sky to keep me down 
And no work on the earth is quite big enough 
To risk this man around I won't say, yes, when I mean, no 
I'll never talk when they say, no 
I'll catch your eye, let's see 
Your love here with me and this no one can destroy Oh, yeah Pick me get big thrill 
Looking down on me 
But someday 
Until they realize, then they'll see That big men are small, babe 
Just take away their dough 
But I can't do nothing 
No, no, oh, no 'Cause I've got the world to hold me up 
I've got the sky to keep me down, no, no, no, no 
Control a man that's free and I know I'm free 
I'm gonna say it loud 'Cause I've got the world to hold me up 
And I've got the sky to keep me down, yeah, oh yeah
