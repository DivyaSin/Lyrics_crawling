"Get off that stuff," she said, 
"And I'll stone you instead." 
"Unchain yourself, said she, 
"And tie yourself to me." 
I'm on the floor. 
I play with knives. 
You can call and ask your wife. 
She's been over once or twice 
Likes to use me, 
And I'm her slave. 
But, I don't need no chains 
I'll behave. 
Give me more of what I've come to expect. 
Wrap your love around my neck. 
Understand me when I say 
You'll deny me.
