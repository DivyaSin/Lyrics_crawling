Art of Virtue 
Adrienne Young / Will Kimbrough Gonna start a revolution, 
Made of action, not of words 
Practicing the Art of Virtue 
A joy ride on the learning curve Gonna keep my eyes wide open 
Till I have something to say 
Start to put my house in order 
Save some money for a rainy day Gonna do just what I ought to 
Finish what I say Ill do 
Spend my time on something useful 
Worry less and speak the truth Id like to learn some moderation 
Know just when enoughs enough 
Meditate on being tranquil 
Injure none and bear no grudge I let go of my resistance 
Son of God is inside me 
Im waitin for the real thing, honey 
Aint nothin wrong with chastity If I could walk the path of Jesus 
Live each day the best I can 
Follow in those humble footsteps 
I might reach the promised land Gonna start a revolution 
Made of action, not of words 
Practicing the Art of Virtue 
A joy ride on a learning curve Come and join this revolution 
Made of action, not of words 
Practicing the Art of Virtue 
Its all the rage, oh have you heard?
