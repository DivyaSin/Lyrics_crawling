We started playing at seventeen 
Another part of a bigger scene 
We used to wear a shirt back then 
Said fuck you man we don't care We looked back 
We didn't see you following 
We looked back 
Where did you go 
We looked back 
We didnt see you following 
We looked back 
A rivers gonna flow There were times as good as it gets 
& there were those disasterous sets 
We always had a story to tell 
Maybe you tell it as well We looked back Thanks for coming if you were there 
It is something that we will always share 
We're sorry if we let you down 
It ain't always funny being a clown We looked back on times gone by A song for you all.
