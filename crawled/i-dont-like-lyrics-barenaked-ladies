I can eat pork until the cows come home 
And cheese like it's going out of style...but it's not 
I like just about every type of vegetables 
I like raisins and nuts and seeds and olives and pickles and fruit and beef and bread 
But I don't like salmon [Talking] I jump from a plane with a parachute 
Scuba to the ocean floor 
Driven super fast in a racing car 
I've bungee jump and zip-lined, I've crossed roped bridges over raging rivers 
But I don't like those spiny rides [Talking] I can fly my very own airplane 
And I've been to the summits of mountains 
I've been to the top of the CN tower 
I can work on a ladder, I can climb a tree, I can look out the window of a really tall building 
But if I stand close to the edge of a railing or up on a roof or something, I realize 
I don't like heights so much [Talking]
