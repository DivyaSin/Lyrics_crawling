Returned Please pick me up 
And keep me safe in your arms 
I've been down for too long 
With no ground beneath my feet And I miss the things you do 
And all the sounds you used to make 
Now my heart is wide open 
And I'll find my way back to you I'll find my way back to you 
I'll find my way back to you
