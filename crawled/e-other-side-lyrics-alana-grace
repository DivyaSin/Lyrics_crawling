I found the poison under my skin, 
Creeping in slowly, feeding everything. 
I feel so close yet so far away 
Staring at life; this prison of sheltering 
It's killing me... I-I-I wanna break free from these walls and say 
Goodbye-i-i to the feelings that I've known before. 
I try-i-i to fight back the urge to hideaway 
And let it, let it, let it open my eyes 
To the other side. The glass is breaking; I'm not afraid. 
The noise it's making is taking my breath away... 
This water's cool, but I'm not alone 
And something's moving underneath my feet... 
It's sinking me... I-I-I wanna break free from these walls and say 
Goodbye-i-i to the feelings that I've known before. 
I try-i-i to fight back the urge to hideaway 
And let it, let it, let it open my eyes 
To the other side Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh- Floating away... on a star; 
Passing through clouds and rose colors 
Oh... starting over. 
I'm never coming down... I-I-I (x2) It's killing me... 
Just set me free... 
Set me free! I-I-I wanna break free from these walls and say 
Goodbye-i-i to the feelings that I've known before 
I try-i-i to fight back the urge to hideaway 
And let it, let it, let it come on inside. I-I-I wanna break free from these walls and say 
Goodbye-i-i to the feelings that I've known before. 
I try-i-i to fight back the urge to hideaway 
And let it, let it, let it open my eyes 
To the other side... Oh-oh-oh-ho-oh-oh-oh Skat humming
