I think about the life I live 
A figure made of clay 
And think about the things I lost 
The things I gave away And when I'm in a certain mood 
I search the house and look 
One night I found these magic words 
In a magic book Throw it away 
Throw it away 
Give your love, live your life 
Each and every day And keep your hand wide open 
Let the sun shine through 
'Cause you can never lose a thing 
If it belongs to you There's a hand to rock the cradle 
And a hand to help us stand 
With a gentle kind of motion 
As it moves across the land And the hand's unclenched and open 
Gifts of life and love it brings 
So keep your hand wide open 
If you're needing anything Throw it away 
Throw it away 
Give your love, live your life 
Each and every day And keep your hand wide open 
Let the sun shine through 
'Cause you can never lose a thing 
If it belongs to you Throw it away 
Throw it away 
Give your love, live your life 
Each and every day And keep your hand wide open 
Let the sun shine through 
'Cause you can never lose a thing 
If it belongs to you 'Cause you can never lose a thing 
If it belongs to you 
You can never ever lose a thing 
If it belongs to you You can never ever lose a thing 
If it belongs to you 
You can never ever lose a thing 
If it belongs to you
