Suffer me.This is the last time i hold myself from anger.There is no such thing as a 1 true love.I'm constantly looking towards something better;it makes no sense for me to look above.Baby rosemary,what have you brought today for me,this life has nothing for me tell me if your up to trade.I'll take anything you offer today I'm feeling brave.Oh tell me are you willing,I want the finer things.I'll take this gift your giving and take all the hell it brings.I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything.I'm the one who owns you I want to be your king.Dark night dark sky...I'm ready for your offer;serve it to me silver plate.This is the feast of ages;tonight we dine on perfect hate.Oh tell me are you willing.I want the finer things.I'll take this gift your giving and all the hell it brings.I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything.Be the one who controls you I want to be you king.I want you to suffer.I'm just still looking for a trade.The deal I have is not working he never even hears me speak and with this new lack of concern new management i seek.Oh tell me are you willing I want the finer things.I'll take this gift your giving and all the hell it brings.I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything.Be the one who controls you I want to be you king.Suffer unto me,I want you to suffer unto me,cause I'll be the new designer.I gave you everything you gave away.I gave you everything,thing to say.Suffer unto me.
