I wake up every morning, bright and early 
Roll out of bed but I'm never quite alone 
Tension is pulling me in all directions 
And I'll be done once you use me as a rope 
Sometimes the pressure will just drive you crazy 
At any time I could explode 
I need some piece of mind, it's got me tired 
Don't wanna lose it, but I'm turning down that road I need a moment cause I've spread myself to thin 
We all need a moment in our lives 
Works hard, the days too long 
And that's just where it begins 
Tension has had us all this time I sit in traffic every single morning 
Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind 
Making the money so I feed my family 
But I can't raise them, 'cause I ain't got the time 
I got no free days on my busy schedule 
I turn the page and it's the same 
Don't like my situation, you don't either 
Don't wanna look back scared, I will get away I need a moment cause I've spread myself to thin 
We all need a moment in our lives 
Works hard, the days too long 
And that's just where it begins 
Tension has had us all this time But every now and then 
I drive alone 
And over all 
Hot summer days 
A gentle breeze that feels alright 
Home alone 
And I can't feel the pain 
Only strain 
Enjoy the sights 
I feel alive 
When actually here just feels alright 
Far from home I need a moment cause I've spread myself to thin 
We all need a moment in our lives 
Works hard, the days too long 
And that's just where it begins 
Tension has had us all this time
