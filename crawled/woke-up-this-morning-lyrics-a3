Well you woke up this morning 
Got yourself a gun 
Your mama always said you'd be 
The choosen one She said, you're one in a million 
You've got to burn to shine 
But you were born under a bad sign 
With a blue moon in your eyes And when you woke up this morning 
All that love had gone 
Your papa never told you 
About right and wrong Hey but you're, but you're looking good, baby 
I believe that you're feeling fine, shame about it 
Born under a bad sign 
With a blue moon in your eyes 'Cause you woke up this morning 
Got a blue moon in your eyes 
Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes When you woke up this morning 
The world turned upside down 
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same 
Since the blues walked into town But you're, but you're one in a million 
'Cause you got that shotgun shine, boom 
Born under a bad sign 
With a blue moon in your eyes, yeah Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes 
Yeah, you woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes When you woke up this morning everything was gone 
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong 
Ringing like some bell from your head down to your toes 
Like some voice trying to tell you there's something you should know Last night you was flying but today you're so low 
Times like these makes you wonder if you'll ever know 
Meaning of things as they appear to the others 
Wives, husbands, fathers, sisters and brothers Don't you wish you didn't function, wish you didn't think 
Beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink' 
Well you do make up your mind to go on, 'cos 
When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone 
Everything you had was long gone You see I woke up this morning 
Woke up this morning 
Woke up this morning 
You wanna be, you wanna be the chosen one tonight 
Yes, you know it because you, you just can't help yourself Woke up this morning, yeah, yeah 
Woke up this morning, yeah, yeah 
Woke up this morning and you did it girl 
You got yourself a gun 
You got yourself a gun 
You got yourself a gun
