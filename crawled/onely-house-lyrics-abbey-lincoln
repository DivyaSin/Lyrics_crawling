At night when everything is quiet 
This old house seems to breathe a sigh 
Sometimes I hear a neighbor snoring 
Sometimes I can hear a baby cry Sometimes I can hear a staircase creaking 
Sometimes a distant telephone 
Oh, and when the night settles down again 
This old house and I are all alone Lonely house, lonely me 
Funny with so many neighbors 
How lonesome you can be Lonely town, lonely street 
Funny, you can be so lonely 
With all these folks around I guess there must be something 
I don't comprehend 
Sparrows have companions 
Even stray dogs have a friend The night for me is not romantic 
Unhook the stars and take them down 
I'm lonely in this lonely town, in this lonely house The night, the night for me is not romantic 
Unhook the stars and take them down 
I'm lonely in this lonely town, in this lonely house 
At night when everything is quiet
