they want us to tell them 
what to burn into the groove 
we're just gonna sit 
and let them make the first move 
the radio obsession 
doesn't mean shit to me 
i don't like first impressions 
and i don't watch much tv i don't want to think about it 
who, what, when, or where 
i don't want to think about it 
i don't really care 
i don't want to think about 
creating something new 
i don't want to think about it 
because i've got much better things to do i don't want to think about it 
i don't want to see 
i don't want to know 
the kind of fool they'll make of me 
the public gets what they deserve 
not what they demand 
unless we all decide to be a business, not a band i don't want to think about it 
who, what, when, or where 
i don't want to think about it 
i don't really care 
i don't want to think about 
creating something new 
i don't want to think about it 
because i've got much better 
things to do - just like you
