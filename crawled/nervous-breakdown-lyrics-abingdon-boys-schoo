Tell me why, you never gonna take the ride, 
Don't know why, you never gonna stay in sight, 
I just wanna know what the hell is goin' down What can I do to make you feel right, 
What kinda fool if I make you cry, 
Give me a break! 
You'd better change your stupid ways, 
Before I go away I just wanna hold you tight, 
I just wanna feel your sigh, 
Wanna be with you tonight, 
So baby, don't let me down 
I know how to satisfy, 
I know you want me tonight, 
Never show me what's inside, 
You cause my nervous breakdown Time is right, I'm gonna get you playin' high, 
It's alright, I'm gonna get you shinin' bright, 
Really wanna know what the hell you're feelin' now What can I do to make you feel right, 
What kinda fool if I make you cry, 
Give me a break!

Wanna kiss you through the night, 
So baby, don't let me down
