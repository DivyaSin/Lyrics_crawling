Did you ever see the concrete stares of everyday? 
The lunatic, the hypocrite are all lost in the fray Can't you see their lives are just like yours? 
An unturned stone, and undiscovered 
Door leading to 
The gift of hope renewed 
Eternity for you 
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer The business man whose master plan controls the world each day 
Is blind to indications of his species of his species' slow decay People blow their minds 
They choose to resign 
This deformed society is part of a design 
It'll never go away 
It's in the cards that way 
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer
