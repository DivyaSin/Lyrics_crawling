What would the neighbors say 
If they could take the walls away 
See you naked with a whip in your hand 
What would your friends all do 
If they could look inside of you 
See your pretty face conceals a beast within 
Don't make a bet unless you're sure you can cover it 
Don't light a fire if you're afraid to watch it burn 
I bet that pretty ring you wear upon your finger 
Has left it's share of scars on the backs of many, many men ... Chorus Don't count your money if you're gonna spend all of it 
Don't hunt for happiness if you're afraid to make the kill 
You have a way of making money vanish overnight 
It doesn't scare me, it's an entertaining skill ... What would the neighbors say 
If they could take the walls away 
See you naked with a whip in your hand 
What would your friends all do 
If they could look inside of you 
See your pretty face conceals a beast within
