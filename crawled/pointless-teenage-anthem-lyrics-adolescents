This is a pointless teenage anthem 
About how great things used to be 
The kind that tugs your heartstrings 
Like rhythmic atrophy A pointless teenage anthem 
We're not allowed to grow 
Past the pointless teenage tantrums 
Like the kind I used to throw Round, round, round 
Just keep spinning around 
Down, down, down 
Spinning upside down 
Pound, pound, pound 
Pound it to the ground 
Sound, sound, sound 
Like its something new they've found A pointless teenage anthem 
Is what they expect from me 
To hold on to the youth they lost 
In 1983 A pointless teenage anthem 
To keep the old school young 
So they can slam around and round 
Lament what they've become A pointless teenage anthem 
Really shouldn't be too tough 
I've written fifty other ones 
More than enough So here's a toast to happiness 
To life and liberty 
Life's a blast, throw off the past 
Irresponsibility
