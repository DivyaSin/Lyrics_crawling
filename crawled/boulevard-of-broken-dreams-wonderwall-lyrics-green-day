[Original] 
I walk a lonely road 
The only one that I have ever known 
Don't know where it goes 
But it's home to me and I walk alone [Oasis(Band)] 
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you [Original] 
I walk this empty street 
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams 
Where the city sleeps 
And I'm the only one and I walk alone [Oasis(Band)] 
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you gotta do 
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now [Chorus 1:Greenday(Band)] 
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me 
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating 
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone [Travis] 
Every day I wake up and it's Sunday 
Whatever's in my head won't go away 
The radio is playing all the usual 
And what's a Wonderwall anyway * [Oasis(Band)] 
Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is 
out 
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt 
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now... [Original] 
I'm walking down the line 
That divides me somewhere in my mind 
On the border line 
Of the edge and where I walk alone [Oasis(Band)] 
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you [Original] 
Read between the lines 
What's fucked up and everything's alright 
Check my vital signs 
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone [Oasis(Band)] 
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you 
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you gotta do [Chorus 2: Oasis(Band)] 
And all the roads we have to walk are winding 
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding 
There are many things that I would like to say to you 
But I don't know how [Hook]

I walk this empty street

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you [Original] 
I walk this empty street 
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams [Oasis(Band)] 
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you gotta do [Original] 
Where the city sleeps 
And I'm the only one and I walk a... [Chorus 1:Greenday (Oasis)] 
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me (maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me) 
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating (maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me) 
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me (maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me saves me) 
'Til then I walk alone [Eminem]**[Aerosmith]**REMIX 
Sing with me; sing for the year (Sing it!) 
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing with me, just for today 
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away...
