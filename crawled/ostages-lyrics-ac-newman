All these things growing, we don't stay the same size 
We slow down and we speed up sometimes 
It will surprise, it will surprise you when you get the good news 
You get what you want and you don't know what to do It is a blurred line between taking on one more victory lap and being on the run 
It's just our path, now watch us fly, just a blur going by 
Watch us fly, by now we've got hostages, too 
And if we don't get what we want, well, you don't know what we'll do What to do with the silvery mirror of the new reign 
With the wrinkles in our little stars, time and time again 
High fives all around, we can speed up or slow them 
You worked like a charm, why'd you think you were broken? We're lucky, lucky because we don't like to lose 
We went crawling through the failures for clues 
And we bet both lives, you can put yours with mine 
Bet both lives, used them for hostages, too 
And if we don't get what we want, well, you don't know what we'll do
