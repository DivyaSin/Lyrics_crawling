When it seems there nothing no more 
You come in into my life 
You bring out the best in me 
I can be myself when I am with you 
Every time I look at you, 
My heart misses a beat I have had the time of all my life and I owe it, all to you 
Just can't picture being me without you I love how your body feels next to mine 
I love how I see myself through your eyes 
The way you gat me going, going crazy 
You make me going beyond crazy inside 
So I wanna make you mine (oh mine) 
I wanna make you mine (oh mine) 
I wanna make you mine My life will never be same 
'Cause girl, you came and changed 
And everything I own I give 
Forever I wanna stay with you 
With my heart I look at you 
But you getting further away I have had the time of all my life and I owe it, all to you 
Just can't picture being me without you I love how your body feels next to mine 
I love how I see myself through your eyes 
The way you gat me going, going crazy 
You make me going beyond crazy inside 
So I wanna make you mine (oh mine) 
I wanna make you mine (oh mine) 
I wanna make you mine I love how your body feels next to mine 
I love how I see myself through your eyes 
The way you gat me going, going crazy 
You make me going beyond crazy inside 
So I wanna make you mine (oh mine) 
I wanna make you mine (oh mine) 
I wanna make you mine
