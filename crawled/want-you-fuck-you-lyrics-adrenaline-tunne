I never worry about you. 
I never wanted to wander through. 
I think I might just run away. 
Feeling the pressure, I just can't stay. So goodbye, 
goodbye Want You! 
So Bad! 
Fuck You! 
So Mad! I've never felt so much hurt. 
But now it's over you can hit the dirt. 
I'm not lying, it's all true. 
'Cos the fact, I hate you. So goodbye, 
goodbye Want You! 
So Bad! 
Fuck You! 
So Mad! Want You! 
So Bad! 
Fuck You! 
So Mad!
