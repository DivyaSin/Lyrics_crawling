The silent image of a poetic light the 
Crescent moon enhances the 
Blackened night my eyes are bound to 
The beauty that I see the moon's 
Magnetism - it beckons me pores of 
My mind rise and fall in lnation lost in 
A spell entranced in lunar fixation 
Alters the rhythms and the tides of 
The oceans eclipsing hemispheres of 
My emotions moon enters in its new 
Phase-governs both the nights and 
The days bathe in its heavenly rays - 
Strange allure the one that I praise
