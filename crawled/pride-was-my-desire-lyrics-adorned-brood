I killed the beasts on my fathers side 
My dagger sled into the black hearts 
Courage and power I felt, power killed the greed 
Pride was my desire, fear I defeat Blood spread in this night 
The ground soaked from the blood 
Death, shining so bright 
Blood on the hands in this night There was might, I feel might 
Might, about life and death 
Might, to extinguish the life of the beasts 
Might, to kill with my hands Might, to crush my enemies 
Might, about life and death 
Pride was my desire 
Blood I feel on my hands
