Expectations and possibilities 
Don't need no crystal ball across the probability 
I plan to take you home, do what you do to me 
Come be my roller-coaster got you where we supposed to be [Chorus] 
Watch out 
I'm digging 
Why don't give it a try 
Deep down 
Can you feel it 
You know I've been right 
Better hold tight 
We gone turn it round 
And around 
And around 
And around 
And around Expectations of what you giving me 
You've got me head to toe, your wet arm hold your arm on me 
Why don't you satisfy my curiosity, 
Come be my romeo, you've got me where I wanna be yea [Chorus]
