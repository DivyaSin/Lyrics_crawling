I'm having a notion. 
It's a strange, the strangest emotion. 
I'm all wrapped up with my head in the clouds. 
The sweet child thinks he doesn't deserve me, but I'm not that proud. 
I'd walk for miles to see that handsome face; 
To be with you baby I'd go anyplace. 
So you say that you ain't got money, well I don't care. 
'Cause I'm so in love with you, honey. 
What I got, I'll share. 
Take me by the hand, help me move my mountains aside. 
Help me understand that love is stronger than... 
It'll serve you longer than pride. 
Now father, lend me your strength. 
I know you think I'm weak, but I'm not ashamed. 
'Cause I'm in love, and I'll tell you it's real. 
I may be young but I know what I feel. 
So you think he's gonna up and leave me? I disagree. 
He said that he'd give up the world just to please me, and care for me, he'll 
Take me by the hand, help me move my mountains aside. 
Help me understand that love is stronger than... 
It'll serve you longer than pride. 
When I first looked in his eyes, I felt this chemistry. 
And much to my surprise, here's a man full of beauty, and free of greed. 
And I'll stand by him 'cause he's all that I need. 
The sweet child thinks he doesn't deserve me, but I'm not that proud. 
Said it once, but I don't think he heard me, so I'll say it out loud...
