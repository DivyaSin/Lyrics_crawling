There's a blueberry pancake flying in the sky 
I can see it! I can see it! There's a castle in the cloud and it's floating on by 
Can you see it? Can you see it? With my imagination I can see it! 
With my pencil crayons I can draw it! 
On a piece of paper I can show it to you. 
I can show it to you There's a purple hippopotamus riding on a bike 
I can see it. I can see it. There's a spaceship over my house at night 
I just know it. I just know it. With my imagination I can see it! 
With my pencil crayons I can draw it! 
On a piece of paper I can show it to you! 
I can show it to you. 
Draw, draw, drawing. Na na na na na. 
Draw, draw, drawing. Na na na na na. 
My imagination. My imagination. 
My pencil crayons. My imagination.
