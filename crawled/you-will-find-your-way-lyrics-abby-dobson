You know youre past 
A mid-way mark 
Yeah its too late 
To turn back Tomorrow will be 
Clean of this day 
Dont worry so much 
You will find your way And you wish it would rain 
Cos youre thirsty again 
But it wont hurt a bit 
Like a kiss on your lips 
Take a bite, heres a light 
Theres a hole in the night 
Just go through 
Its for you 
Itll be alright Theres still time 
If we run 
Some reasons are 
Best forgotten 
The night wont wait forever 
It keeps getting better 
And better Hold me close 
Pull me near 
There is nothing to fear 
Let it go 
Like a song 
Cos the frost is all gone 
Theres a light in your eyes 
You can drop your disguise 
Cos youre so brand new 
And theres so much loving to do Look at you now 
Youre high as a kite 
Head full of stars you are 
Travelling light Youre on your own 
But youre not alone 
If you look around 
You will find you are home And you wish it would rain 
Cos youre thirsty again 
But it wont hurt a bit 
Like a kiss on your lips 
Take a bite, heres a light 
Theres a hole in the night 
Just go through 
Its for you 
Itll be alright Hold me close 
Pull me near 
There is nothing to fear 
Let it go 
Like a song 
Cos the frost is all gone 
Theres a light in your eyes 
You can drop your disguise 
Cos youre so brand new 
And theres so much loving to do Theres so much loving to do 
Theres so much loving to do 
Theres so much loving to do
