Midnight in Montgomery, 
Silver Eagle, Lonely Road, 
I was on my way to Mobile, 
For a big new year's eve show, 
Stopped for just a minute, 
To see a friend outside of town, 
With my collar up, I found his name, 
And felt the wind die down, 
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat, 
Took me by surprise, 
Wearin' shiny boots, a nudie suit, and haunted, haunted eyes, 
He said friend it's good to see you, 
It's nice to know ya care, 
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, 
Was he ever really there? [Chorus] 
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery, 
Just hear that wipperwill, 
See the stars light up the purple sky, 
Feel that lonesome chill, 
'Cause when the wind is right, 
You'll hear his song, 
Smell whisky in the air, 
Midnight in montgomery, 
He's always singin' there, Well I climbed back on that eagle, 
Took one last look around, 
Red tail lights, shadow moves slow across the ground, 
And off somewhere a midnight train, is slowly passin' by, 
I can hear that wistle moanin', 
I'm so lonesome I could cry, [Chorus] He's always singin there Well Hank's always singin' there.
