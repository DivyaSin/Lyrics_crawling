[The Chronicler of Antediluvia:] 
Long ago, before the Third Great Cataclysm reshaped the face of creation, 
one nation rose above all others in the antediluvian world... Atlantis. [The Atlantean Quorum:] 
Hear the call Atlanteans, proud we stand forever, 
Mightiest of warriors, we sail across the sea. 
Conquering the ancient world, a legacy eternal, 
Raise the arcane sigil high, steel and sorcery! 
Blessed with immortality, dreaming spires of majesty, glory crowns our destiny! [The Host of Z'xulth:] 
Your realm is lost... it shall be devoured by the sea! [The Chronicler of Antediluvia:] 
And so it was written in the stars, astride the world would stand the children 
of Atlantis!
