I'm a gangsta my nikka from my head to my feet 
Ever since I was a youngin I been livin in the streets 
Keep it movin you don't wanna get it goin with me 
I can get your whole family wiped out for less than a g 
The og stands for organized general 
Street educated and graduate into a criminal 
I make it rain but I ain't talkin about money from the sky 
I'm talkin bout everybody dyin 
When the whole city gone I'm the king of the ghetto 
Zro is a one man team in the ghetto 
Somthin somthin somthin I'm gettin green in the ghetto 
A million dollars never still seen in the ghetto 
A trrunk full of artilary ready to reach out and touch somebody 
I'm insane in the membrane I don't have positive thoughts the only thing I can picture is f**kin up somebody 
Walk like I'm red because I know I can 
Ain't got a reason to fear it if its a man 
45 in my left hand if it in my right hand+ 
357 in my other hand 
(Wy)cause I never figured me out a trigger happy nikka you can not fuck me 
'Cause I'm bout to open your motherf**kin ass up like a christmas gift 
'Cause there ain't no love no love Ro and trae asshole by nature no doubt 
Motherf**kers can you stand the rain We gone shut your block down 
Tell me nikka can you stand the rain 
Can youuu stand the rainim a gangsta my nikka from my head to my feet 
Ever since I was a youngin I been livin in the streets
