Today is a new day 
No time to live in the past 
I guess now I know 
No time to live with regrets 
Mistakes I have made 
Got to get on with my life 
My choice, no one else 
It's time to live in today Today I have made a beginning 
And with God, I know 
Everything will be ok Today is a new day 
Exciting or blase? 
Is it routine and a chore? 
Or a promise of something more? 
Life gets upside-down 
And sometimes turned around 
But He's given us a change 
So put your trust in Him today
