I've already spent 
Time in delirium 
I've already been 
To the other side and back again Will this ever be? 
The same will this ever mean anything 
Will this ever be? 
Anything more than a broken daydream And what makes us behave in this way? 
Move 
Don't think just move in this way 
And what makes us behave in this way? 
Move 
Don't think just move in this way 
Move And what makes us behave in this way? 
Move 
Don't think just move in this way 
And what makes us behave in this way? 
Move 
Don't think just move in this way 
Move The loss of sound the silence waits 
The loss of sight the darkness waits 
The loss of touch the coldness waits 
Don't think just move 
Move Don't think just move.
