WRITTEN BY KEVIN BACON Sitting in this trailer park tonight 
Still basking in the memory of that glorious fight 
It hit me when she stepped into the ring 
Floating like a butterfly and I still feel the sting CHORUS 
I got it bad for an Arm Wrestling Woman 
I'm going mad for an arm wrestling girl 
I gotta steel my courage lay it on the line 
But I got to make her mine 
She gently puts her elbow on the block 
She's ninety per cent Joan of Arc and ten per cent jock 
She works the crowd she knows New York's her town 
Gets that twinkle in her eye and lays that mother down CHORUS Lonely nights make fantasies run wild 
She's with me and she's with child 
And I will love her evermore 
And I will rub her when she's sore 
And I will share her with the world 
That's just the way it is with an arm wrestling girl 
Standing in this ice cold parking lot 
To tell her my intentions will take all that I've got 
Maybe she could love me probably not 
But you can't put the points up if you don't take the shot CHORUS
