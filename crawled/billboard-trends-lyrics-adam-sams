I am the cost and I am the loss 
I am the wreck that became your cross 
The burden you bore that cursed your lot 
The blood-stained, buried dreams that you sought I am the face of the billboard trends I am the pulse in the words that lend 
To easy false entitlement 
And paranoid establishment 
I am the face of the billboard trends 
Where the highway takes your money spent 
To those like me, the devil's friend 
And the accident pays my rent I am the greed, the selfish thief 
The dollar-sign theme is my lonely creed 
I am the silent, sickening melody 
Of our backwards ideology 
The submarine-deep, subconscious dream I am the face of the billboard trends I am the pulse in the words that lend 
To easy false entitlement 
And paranoid establishment 
I am the face of the billboard trends 
Where the highway takes your money spent 
To those like me, the devil's friend 
And the accident pays my rent I am the face of the billboard trends 
Making you numb to the billboard trends I am the pulse in the words that lend 
To easy false entitlement 
And paranoid establishment 
I am the face of the billboard trends 
Where the highway takes your money spent 
To those like me, the devil's friend 
And the accident pays my rent
