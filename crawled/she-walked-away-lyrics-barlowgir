She couldn't take one more day 
Home was more her prison now 
Independence called out 
She had to get it A fight was all she needed 
To give her reason 
She slammed the door with no goodbye 
And knew that it was time Now she's driving to fast 
She didn't care to glance behind 
And through her tears she laughed 
It's time to kiss the past goodbye I'm finally on my own 
Don't try to tell me no 
There's so much more for me 
Just watch what I will be [Chorus] 
She walked away 
Couldn't say why she was leaving 
She walked away 
She left all she had believed in Not a day goes by 
For the ones she's left behind 
They're always asking "why?" 
And thoughts of her consume her mind God please let her know 
The love we tried to show 
We'd promise anything 
If you'd just bring her home [Chorus] Tell her we love her 
Tell her she's wanted 
And one more thing God 
Tell her please, come home 
Please, come home [Chorus: x2] The choice is yours alone now 
Tell me how this story, ends
