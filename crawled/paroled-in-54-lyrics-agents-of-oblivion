Summer blood for fighting dogs 
Mardi Gras nineteen fifty-four 
Oh no - he never liked Lincoln at all my child 
I always thought the sun was just some hole in the sky 
Till now As we float this corpse ashore 
Paroled in 54' The four whores of the apocalypse laugh 
Houses burning full of yellowed photographs 
Of our children in fear disappearing from the ledge 
Is God just an echo i hear in my head yeah As we float this corpse ashore 
Paroled in 54'
