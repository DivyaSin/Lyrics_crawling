Jump as you go 
Go inside the room 
Just for a bit 
Can't you see 
I watch as you go by 
While all the others try 
For awhile Why can't you stay 
On my place 
These things you can't see 
Now that you're gone for a bit 
I know you're not the same 
It's hard for me to blame Well, I won't know 
If I'll ask you to stay 
Would you let me go? 
And I won't have your way 
You know they took it down 
The things you'd say (say...) Have you seen 
We touched an empty gleen (?) 
With the place of my regret 
We could have watched the stains 
Another night remains 
After all... You and I know 
The trees go by below 
As high as we fly 
One more time 
I'm not beneath the wind 
I'm not beneath the world You are all I know 
And I don't want you stay 
Oh won't you please let go 
I wouldn't have you that way 
(?) 
If you won't ask me to pay Ohh
