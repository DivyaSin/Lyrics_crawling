I'll never really understand why I believe you 
You're so sly and underhand, I think I'll leave you now 
With everything I stole since we met 
I stole no kisses, just some books and the odd cigarette 
I never liked South London anyway 
It must be true what they say Oh well, you've scuppered all my best laid plans 
I can't believe you just dismiss my pleas right out of hand 
I can't believe you've listed everything I stole since we met 
But I stole no kisses, just some books and a butterfly net It's raining, 
(Now it's sunny) 
It's raining, 
(Now it's sunny) I never liked twisted hate anyway
