Everything I ever had 
I let it slip away 
Every dream I ever dreamed 
Was crossed until today 
For I have seen tomorrow 
Where my future lies 
I see it every time 
When I look into 
Your beautiful eyes Oh, I'm holding on now 
I'm holding on now Love, don't let me go 
Love, please let me know 
Have you been waiting 
Just the way that I've been waiting Love, don't let me go 
Love, please let me show 
How much I want to 
Be the one who loves you now Maybe I was too afraid 
To show my broken heart 
Fading in the shadows 
And my world just came apart Looking at you now 
I feel what I never felt before 
But I'm finally ready 
To risk it all once more Love, don't let me go 
Love, please let me know 
Have you been waiting 
Just the way that I've been waiting Love, don't let me go 
Love, please let me show 
How much I want to 
Be the one who loves you now You can believe in taking chances 
Oh... 
Baby, take this one with me 
Can't you see what I see 
I'm holding on Oh, love, don't let me go 
Love, please let me know 
Have you been waiting 
Just the way that I've been waiting Love, don't let me go 
Love, please let me show 
How much I want to 
Be the one who loves you now Please let me show 
How much I want to 
Be the one who loves you now Mmh Be the one who loves you now.
