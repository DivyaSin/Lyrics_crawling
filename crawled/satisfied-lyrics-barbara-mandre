I've got that old time religion got that old time religion 
And that is why I'm satisfied 
Now you ask me if I'm happy do I have peace within 
Do I worry bout tomorrow when I reach my journey's end 
Well I'm satisfied with my Jesus when he knocks I let him in 
He'll go with me through the valley for I know he is my friend 
Satisfied satisfied no troubles can ever get me down 
When my eyes are closed in death with my Jesus I'll be at rest 
Then you'll know I'm satisfied 
[ fiddle ] 
Now if my friends they all forsake me and they turn me from their door 
If they sow no seeds of kindness make the thorns in my path grow 
Well it won't matter over yonder when I reach the other side 
I'm a gonna sit down by my Jesus satisfied satisfied 
I'm satisfied satisfied... 
I've got that old time religion got that old time religion 
And that is why I'm satisfied
