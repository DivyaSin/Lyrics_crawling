Give it a try and we can make it so high 
You'll never feel this way again 
Wipe off your sorrow and pain, come into my heart Just give it the time, should work out fine 
We can make it, we can break it 
It's not a command, just give me your hand 
We can break it, whoa oo We can take it, take it Give it a try and then change your desire 
You'll never make love on your own 
Now that the love seed is sown 
Don't put out the fire Give it the time, we can work out fine 
We can make it, we can break it 
It's not a command, baby, give me your hand 
We can break it, we can take it
