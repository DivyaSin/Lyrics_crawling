Tossin' and turnin' 
There's a fever so deep inside The fever is burnin' and I'm lying awake at night. 
How I want you to kiss 
Want your body to move And I want you to touch 
Gonna break every rule. It can't be wrong to be in love 
It can't be wrong 
So don't say no. 
I have been waiting for so long 
So can't we do it now. Hungry for love 
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi In the heat of the night 
Hungry for love 
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi Won't you stay by my side? 
Tell me that I am just your lovin' man 
Cause all I want is you. 
Would you like to spend the night with me? 
Tell me that you do 
Cause I'm hungry for love. Over and over my emotions are runnin' wild 
Make me your lover 
Let me take you back home tonight. 
How I want you to kiss 
Want your body to move And I want you to touch 
Gonna break every rule. I can imagine how it feels 
And we are lying skin to skin Heaven is just one word away 
So can't we do it now? Hungry for love 
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi Tell me that I am just your lovin' man How I want you to kiss 
Want your body to move And I want to touch 
Gonna break the rules. It can't be wrong to be in love Hungry for love 
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi Hungry for love
