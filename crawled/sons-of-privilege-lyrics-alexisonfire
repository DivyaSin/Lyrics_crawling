America blearing in my ears all day 
America, I don't see the glory of your ways 
The oldest money flows through a bloodline 
We'll see if your empire stands the test of time Don't wanna, I don't wanna

Can't tell the wolves from the sheep Sweet Lady Liberty 
You are the lost though you are free

The swine, they writhe and praise the infallible regime Don't wanna, I don't wanna 
Be a slave to the sons of privilege 
Don't wanna, I don't wanna 
Be a slave to the sons of privilege Sweet Lady Liberty 
You are the lost though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep Sweet Lady Liberty 
You are the lost though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the Lost though you are free in America

It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time Sweet Lady Liberty 
You are the lost though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep Sweet Lady Liberty 
You are the lost though you are free 
And what hides beneath 
Can't tell the wolves from the
