She haunts me in dreams 
I see her silhouette dance across landscapes of golden light and autumn 
...In my dreams... Her soft eyes see through my tortured soul vanishing any hope for fantasy 
The things I'd give, to prove myself to her, to make her see... Jaded eyes awake as her selfish words rain from such placid lips 
Still I kiss her silken flesh Frigid air leaves me breathless 
Foolish agony fills my lungs as I try to scream for her 
I confess...I scare myself 
Through the howling wind, on my knees, I cry...listen to me... I'm broken by her silence to a love unseen 
Blood soaked feathers rain down my wingless angel 
So broken falls gracefully from the sky 
To waiting arms...to waiting arms... Frigid air leaves me breathless 
Foolish agony fills my lungs as I try to scream for her 
I confess...I scare myself 
And you're my fault through the howling wind 
On my knees, I cry...listen to me... Such foolish agony fills my lungs 
As I try to scream for her jaded eyes 
Wake to the sounds of my voice as I scream for her 
In dreams I've seen her silhouette dance across golden light and autumn...in my dreams... Skies so burdened let her go...as cold rain falls 
So does she my desires wither, broken once more often hands take one so fair ...She haunts me...
