Don't waste your time, lookin' over your shoulder 
Those loves from the past ain't gettin' no closer 
When I look in my future, you're all I can see 
So honey don't go lovin' on nobody but me Nobody but me, gonna love you like you oughta be loved, darlin' 
Nobody but me, gonna cry if you ever leave 
Now you can do what you want to, but I'm askin' pretty please 
Don't go lovin' on nobody but me I took my time to tell you how I feel 
Just because I took so long, don't mean that it isn't real. 
I ain't got no diamond, but I'm down on my knees, honey 
Don't go lovin' on nobody but me Nobody but me, gonna love you like you oughta be loved, darlin' 
Nobody but me, gonna cry if you ever leave 
Now you can do what you want to but I'm askin' pretty please, honey 
Don't go lovin' on nobody but me Nobody but me, gonna love you like you oughta be loved, darlin' 
Nobody but me gonna cry if you ever leave 
Now you can do what you want to, but I'm askin' pretty please, honey 
Don't go lovin' on nobody but me Don't go lovin 'on nobody, but me
