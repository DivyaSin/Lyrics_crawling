Hangin' with my sweet amour 
She came out with a lion's roar 
Yellin' "I'm goin' to the corner store," 
Be back at quarter to four 
"Don't slam you pinkies in the drawer" 
She can be like a maiden from the days of yore 
Hangin' out at Studio 54 
Break-dancin' on the slick, brick disco floor 
With Lionel Richie 
Who, by the way, was a Commodore 
One time she gave mouth-to-mouth to a snaggle-tooth boar 
Who couldn't breathe right since the Vietnam War 
Then she played Chinese Checkers with Skeletor 
And went camping with Eva Gabor 
She's my sweet Beatrice 
She's my sweet Beatrice 
She's my sweet Beatrice 
And, she's coming home 
I got a picture of her down by the seashore 
Wearing a bikini made of purple velour 
Her hair's up like Conway Twitty's pompadour 
With the smile of Guy LeFleur 
She got the ups and the downs like an elevator 
But deep inside she's a marshmallow s'more 
Can bake a cake as big as Jupitor 
Either/or, neither/nor 
She'll share it with your Labrador 
She can run faster than a blazing meteor 
Loves Winnie the Pooh and his friend Eeyore 
Can make a pipe out of an apple core 
That's a trick she learned from Roberto Parrish 
Down in Ecuador 
You know why? 
She's my sweet Beatrice 
She's my sweet Beatrice 
She's my sweet Beatrice 
And she's coming home 
Well, for sure, she opened the door 
Whipped out a three-foot fishing lure 
Sexually, that made me feel insecure 
Like the time I was a roadie 
On Elton John's tour 
She said "Let's go catch some Piscatore!" 
I said "Beatrice, you don't eat fish no more" 
She said "By G-d, you're right!" 
So we took ourselves a snore 
And when we woke up 10 hours later 
We made "Love Du Jour" 
She's my sweet Beatrice 
She's my sweet Beatrice 
She's my sweet Beatrice 
And she came home 
She likes to clean out the attic every now and then 
She's gonna knit me a brand new golfing bag 
We gonna watch ourselves a John Wayne movie 
Then we gonna free all the doggies at the kennel 
She gonna try on my third grade mittens 
She'll keep 'em on even though they're way to small 
Well, she ain't never gonna hurt me 
She ain't never gonna let me down 
She ain't never gonna tell nobody 
I'm afraid of birds and spiders 
Well, 
Bea-Bea-Bea-Beatrice 
Bea-Bea-Bea-Beatrice 
Bea-Bea-Bea-Beatrice 
Bea-Bea-Bea-Beatrice 
Bea-Bea-Bea-Beatrice 
Bea-Bea-Bea-Beatrice 
And she loves Pat Summerall
