hey listen.. 
yeah i just got one thing to say. 
i wanna talk about something that means a fucking lot to me. 
it's a matter of pride the way that i feel when there's betrayal. 
where the fuck is your head man? 
and just how much does this mean to you? 
what does this mean to you? 
it's my life. 
it's my solid rock. 
it's the one truth that i can beleive. 
commited to myself, committed to you 
it's a matter of pride the way that i feel when there's betrayal. 
it hurts so bad every time i have to see that shit! 
am i the only one left? 
my friends told me i should let it ride.. 
i feel stronger inside. 
yes, i am much stronger.
