(holly knight/ mike chapman) 
Producer for bonnie: desmond child I call you when I need you 
And my heart's on fire 
You come to me, come to me 
Wild and wired 
You come to me, give me everything I need You bring a lifetime of promises 
And a world of dreams 
You speak the language of love 
Like you know what it means 
And it can't be wrong 
Take my heart and make it strong Cause you're simply the best 
Better than all the rest 
Better than anyone 
Anyone I ever met 
I'm stuck on your heart 
I hang on every word you said 
Tear us apart 
Baby I would rather be dead
