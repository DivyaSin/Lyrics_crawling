This isn't what I've imagined 
This isn't what I've had in mind 
And there it happened 
Reached out and cut the line And oh, oh we're on our way 
In the night I'll stay I've got a diamond heart that you can't break 
No matter how hard you chip away 
Save your strength and I'll be fine I hope you know my blood is running 
Circles right round your mind 
I should have seen it coming 
It was worth every second of my time And oh, oh we're on our way 
In the night I'll stay I've got a diamond heart that you can't break 
No matter how hard you chip away 
Save your strength and I'll be fine Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa I've got a diamond heart that you can't break 
No matter how hard you chip away 
Save your strength and I'll be fine Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
