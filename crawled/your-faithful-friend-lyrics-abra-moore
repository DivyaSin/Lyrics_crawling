Try if you can and if you can't 
Sing if want and if you can't 
Make a sound 
Go on and on and on 'til you can't go on 
And on any longer Cry if you can and if you can't 
Fall to the ground without a sound 
Hold on and on and on won't you hold on 
An don and on, don't you let go Cause I will be around 
To catch you when you're down You see, it's all about hope, so don't lose 
Sight now 
It's all about faith, so don't give up on me 
It's all about trust, lifting you up, I'm 
Holding you safe 
Under my wing Try if you can an if you can't 
Sing if you want, and if you can't 
Make a sound 
Go on and on and on 'til you can't go on 
And on any longer Cry if you can and if you can't 
Fall to the ground without a sound 
Hold on and on and on won't you hold on 
An don and on, don't you let go 'Cause I will be around 
To catch you when you're down 
I will be around
