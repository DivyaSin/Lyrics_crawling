I hope you don't mind 
That I know your life 
Because I read it every day 
And all of your faults 
Make me feel so good 
Because the media stole my brain 
It's so nice to have someone tell me what to think 
What is it for, do we want more, do we want more? 
And on and on it goes 'till all of us are sucked in. 
So shut it off and see we're missing out on living I am so done 
Listening to you 
Time for you to go 
Time for you to go, whoa 
No more wasting my life 
On this world's addiction 
Time for me to take 
You to find your place 
I am letting go 
Time for you to go Isn't it nice to know 
That the media will sway our votes 
'Cause seriously we've got to see 
That they choose what we know 
Our morals get thrown away 
For the next big thing we've got to see 
What is it for, do we want more, do we want more? 
And on and on it goes till all of us are sucked in 
So shut it off and see we're missing out on living I am so done 
Listening to you 
Time for you to go 
Time for you to go, whoa 
No more wasting my life 
On this world's addiction 
Time for me to take 
You to find your place 
I am letting go 
Time for you to go We're missing out on His voice 
We've traded God for ashes 
We've got to think for ourselves 
Where's our passion? I am so done 
Listening to you 
Time for you to go 
Time for you to go, whoa 
No more wasting my life 
On this world's addiction 
Time for me to take 
You to find your place 
I am letting go 
Time for you to go
