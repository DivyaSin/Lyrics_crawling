Musical ladders 
Leaning on mountains 
Bathed in white laughter 
Under the sun Somebody's birthday 
Came stumbling towards us 
Wrapped in green gladness 
Under the sun We're gonna to make it through this war tonight 
Someone hold this child up to the light Prostitute fingers 
Fumbling with matches 
Tucked in red couches 
Under green moons Mexican waitress 
Got caught in the crossfire 
Of militant families 
Bursting with jews We're gonna break it to your folks tonight 
Kind of hope your pops don't hear me right 
Ooh yeah
