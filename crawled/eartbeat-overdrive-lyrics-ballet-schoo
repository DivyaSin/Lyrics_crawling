You know you catch my eye 
I see you looking my way 
Waiting for you with a heartbeat overdrive And everyone here knows why 
I gotta do this my way 
Coming for you with a heartbeat overdrive Hey, woohoo, hey, woohoo, oh yeah 
Hey, woohoo, hey, woohoo, oh yeah 
I should tell, I should tell 
I should tell you but I can't tell 
I should tell, I should tell 
I should tell you but I can't tell Hey, woohoo, hey, woohoo, oh yeah 
Hey, woohoo, hey, woohoo, oh yeah 
I should tell, I should tell 
I should tell you but I can't tell 
I should tell, I should tell 
I should tell you but I can't tell you Crescent moon high in the sky 
I'm starting something with this guy 
Feeling right, starry starry night night 
My heartbeat overdrive Cause I got one thing on my mind 
I've been crushing like orange and ice 
Waiting for you 
With a heartbeat overdrive Hey, woohoo, hey, woohoo, oh yeah

I should tell you but I can't tell 
I should tell, I should tell 
I should tell you but I can't tell you You know you catch my eye 
I see you looking my way 
Waiting for you with a heartbeat overdrive And everyone here knows why 
I gotta do this my way 
Coming for you with a heartbeat overdrive
