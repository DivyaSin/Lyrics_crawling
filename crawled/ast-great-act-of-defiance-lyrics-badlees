No money man is gonna carry us 
No Corporate hand is gonna bury us 
If we had convictions we'd be dangerous Don't want their creed to guide our consequence 
Don't want their shadow casting darkness on our future tense 
They'd make a killing but we're making sense With the last great act of defiance 
To preserve us well 
Heaven or Hell we're gonna know we left our mark Can't live no life that pushes thorny crowns 
No New York minute's gonna tear us down 
You and me, hell we're the guts of this town With the last great act of defiance 
To preserve us well 
Heaven or Hell we're gonna know we left our mark Don't want no heart attack like my old man 
53 and a policy to help my mother live 
They never paid him back for working long 
Company man but they could give a damn 
For what he had to give Another evening on the Stockton road 
Dreamin' plans for the greatest story ever told 
We'll spit on all the cards they haven't shown With the last great act of defiance 
To preserve us well 
Heaven or Hell we're gonna know we left our mark
