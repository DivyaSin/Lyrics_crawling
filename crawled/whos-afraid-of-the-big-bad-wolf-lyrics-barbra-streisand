Who's afraid of the big bad wolf 
The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf 
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf 
Tra la la la la Long ago there were three pigs 
Little handsome piggy wigs 
For the big, bad the very big, very bad wolf 
They did not give three figs Number one was very gay 
And he built his house with hay 
With a hey hey toot he blew on his flute 
And he played around all day Now number two was fond of jigs 
And so he built his house with twigs 
Hey, diddle diddle he played on his fiddle 
And danced with lady pigs Number three said, "Nix on tricks 
I shall build my house with bricks" 
He had no chance to sing or dance 
'Cause work and play don't mix Ha, ha, ha, the two little do little pigs 
Just winked and laughed ah, woo Who's afraid of the big bad wolf 
The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf 
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf 
Tra la la la la Came the day when fate did frown 
And a wolf blew into town 
With a gruff huff puff, he puffed just enough 
And the hay house fell right down One and two were scared to death 
Of the big bad wolf's breath 
By the hair of your chinny chin I'll blow you in 
And the twig house answered yes No one left but number three 
To save that piglet family 
So when they knocked, he fast unlocked 
And said come in with me Now they all were safe inside 
But the bricks hurt wolf's pride 
So, he slid down the chimney and oh, by Jiminey 
In a fire he was fried Oh, oh, oh, the three little free little pigs 
Just winked and laughed, ah, woo Who's afraid of the big bad wolf 
The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf 
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf 
Tra la la la la Tra la la, tra la la 
Tra la la la la la la la la la la 
Who's afraid of the big, big, big 
Bad wolf
