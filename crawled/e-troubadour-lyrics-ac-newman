You walk the broken stones still warm, the sunlight calculates its form 
Some quick shadow newly worn, the idea spinning in your arms 
Could it be we've won? At the various routes of promise have converged 
The troubadour is here, you heard, the youngest son, alive with firsts 
About to learn, about to burst, but still turning from the worst From the fight and the flight that was too late one night 
That stopped me at the door, that stopped me at the door 
Too late to be what you were just before 
It stopped me at the door, stopped me at the door 
Oh, you couldn't know unless you'd been there before The child king recklessness it fades, floored like all the service trays 
The nurses take them all away, you're all done counting what you've made 
It is enough and nothing, paid A kiss is blown, a kiss to cry for till one day it makes you smile 
It will take time, a long, long while, the country's in its dream of gold 
You're flashing young and old You're going right to your flight, it's leaving tonight 
It stopped me at the door, it stopped me at the door 
Oh, you couldn't know unless you've been there before 
It stopped me at the door, stopped me at the door 
Too late to be what you were just before It stopped me at the door, stopped me at the door
