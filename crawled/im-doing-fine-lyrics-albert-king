I can remember the times 
When I used to cry 
And then I saw a man one day 
And he didn't have no eyes You see I'm doing fine 
Lord, I'm doing fine, fine, fine 
After all, yes I have The police gave me a ticket 
It made me mad as hell 
When I went to pay my fine 
A man got six months in jail I'm doing fine 
Lord, I'm doing fine, fine, fine 
After all, yeah, yeah Just because you couldn't buy me a steak 
It put me in a bad mood 
I read the paper this morning 
I see, while people was eating dog food You see I'm doing fine 
I'm doing fine, fine, fine 
After all, yes I am
