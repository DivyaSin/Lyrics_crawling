Sitting in the sun 
Waiting for life begin 
Looking for a sign 
Where it starts and where it ends And the trees sway to and fro 
Like the friends we've come to know 
Stand tall grow as one 
Come together one by one 
Above the wind thy will be done 
Stand tall grow as one 
Sitting in the sun Sitting in the sun 
Baring to the fates my back 
We shall all but pass 
Through pale rewards may wane and wax Veiled in obscurity 
Is the answer hard to see 
Stand tall grow as one 
Come together one by one 
Above the wind thy will be done 
Stand tall grow as one 
Sitting in the sun 
Stand tall and grow 
Together everyone
