The nights has strange moonlight 
It's so confusing 
Alone I watch the sky 
Tired and breathing But if you want me 
I won't be so alone 
You can always 
Fool the sun And if you want me 
I won't be so alone 
You can always 
Bring the fun The sea is my best friend 
We're always crying 
When crawling in the sand 
Tired of breathing But if... The night has strange moonlight 
The sea is my best friend 
When crawling in the sand 
Tired of breathing But if... 
But if...
