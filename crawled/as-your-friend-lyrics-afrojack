I just can't live anymore like this 
My heart just opened up the door again 
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings 
Don't ask me why 'cause there are too many things. And now we're standing on the edge 
Looking like here we go again 
It used to be old me but today 
I woke up as your friend As your friend, as your friend, as your friend 
I woke up as your friend, 
As your friend, as your friend, 
I woke up as your friend Oh lil' mama, I can feel your fire 
You poisonous lady, let me take you higher 
And I don't care if it's a bad time 
Just label me the bad guy tonight 
And now we're standing on the edge 
Looking like here we go again 
I used to be your man but today 
I woke up as your friend I came to party hoping that you would fall in love 
Don't mean to put no pressure on you 
Everybody loving madly 
And the DJ, he's getting drunk 
Trying to get next to you And now we're standing on the edge 
Looking like here we go again 
I used to be your man but today 
I woke up as your friend As your friend, as your friend, as your friend 
I woke up as your friend 
As your friend, as your friend 
I woke up, I woke up as your friend 
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend 
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend 
I woke up as your friend I'mma fuck that pussy 
I'mma fuck that pussy 
I'mma fuck that pussy And now we're standing on the edge 
Looking like here we go again 
I used to be your man but today 
I woke up as your friend I'mma fuck that pussy 
I'mma fuck that pussy 
I'mma fuck that pussy
