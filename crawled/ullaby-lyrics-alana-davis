At night as we lay down to sleep 
I wonder what you'll show me 
I think of you 
and the thoughts that you keep 
And I, I wonder do you know me 
Everything that I have 
is broken in two 
Everything that I am 
revolves around you 
And you just don't understand 
What a girl goes through Everyone believes in something 
Though we give it different names 
You can search the world for that one thing 
But it's all the same Lay your body down 
Come and let me bring your 
body down 
Listen to my voice 
the only sound 
As I lullaby you, 
lullaby you down As the moon rides away from the sun 
She takes all his light and reflects it 
I relate them to us just for fun 
There's a parallel that's unexpected 
Every star in the sky, 
reminds me of you 
Twinkling in my eyes, 
The way that you do 
And I don't know why 
I get so blue Everyday is filled with changes 
No matter where you go 
Living in a world of strangers 
So we go for what we know Lay your body down 
Come and let me bring your 
body down 
Listen to my voice 
the only sound 
As I lullaby you, 
lullaby you down Everyone believes in something 
But it's all the same 
Attitude will keep me going 
So I guess I can't complain Lay your body down 
Come and let me bring your 
body down 
Listen to my voice 
the only sound 
As I lullaby you, 
lullaby you down
