Step into the club as people stand 
And you can feel it in the atmosphere 
Tonight's the night, champagne are nice 
I see the passion that is in your eyes Who do Alcazar? You can be a star 
It's your destiny 
Wishing to crowd, shout and make it loud 
Dancing ecstasy I love the DJ, the DJ loves me 
The discs are spinning, he's looking at me 
I love the DJ, he's setting me free 
He plays my music at disco melodies I love the DJ, the DJ loves me 
The discs are spinning, he's looking at me 
I love the DJ, he's setting me free 
He plays my music at disco melodies When I look at you I loose control 
I feel your music inside my soul 
You turn me on, you spin me round 
I'm so addicted to that disco sound Who do Alcazar? You can be a star 
It's your destiny 
Wishing to crowd, shout and make it loud 
Dancing ecstasy I love the DJ, the DJ loves me 
The discs are spinning, he's looking at me 
I love the DJ, he's setting me free 
He plays my music at disco melodies I love the DJ 
I love the DJ

I love the DJ 
Set me free I love the DJ, the DJ loves me 
The discs are spinning, he's looking at me 
I love the DJ, he's setting me free 
He plays my music at disco melodies I love the DJ, the DJ loves me 
The discs are spinning, he's looking at me
