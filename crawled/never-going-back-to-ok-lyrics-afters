It's not the end but it feels like it is 
I'm waking up like I'm back from the dead 
I'm stepping out and it feels so free 
But as long as I'm moving it's alright I feel alive and it hurts for a change 
I'm looking back it's hard to believe 
That I was cool with the days that I wasted 
Complacent and tasteless and bored 
But that was yesterday We're never going back to ok 
We're never going back to easy 
We're never going back to the way it was 
We're never going back to ok This discontent, like a slap in the face 
A mediocre I've had enough of this place 
This party's over and I'm moving away 
From the frills of your Beverly Hills 
That was yesterday We're never going back to ok 
We're never going back to easy 
We're never going back to the way it was 
We're never going back to ok We're here to stay 
This is our time 
My only life 
Our chance to live Yeah, we're never going back to ok 
We're never going back to easy 
We're never going back to the way it was 
We're never going back to ok We're never going back to ok 
We're never going back to the way it was 
We're never going back to ok 
We're never going back to ok
