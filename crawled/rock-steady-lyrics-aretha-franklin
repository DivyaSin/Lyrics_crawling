Rock steady, baby 
That's what I feel now 
Just call the song exactly what it is 
Just move your hips with a feeling from side to side 
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride 
While you're moving, rock steady 
Rock steady, baby 
Let's call this song exactly what it is 
What it is, what it is, what it is) 
It's a funky and lowdown feeling (what it is) 
In the hips from left to right (what it is) 
(What it is) what it is I might be doin' 
(What it is) this funky dance all night 
(Put your hands up in the air) 
(Got a feelin' you ain't got a care) 
(You gotta take this burn)? 
That tear we all inside)? Rock steady, rock steady baby 
Rock steady, rock steady baby Jump and move your hips with a feeling from side to side 
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride 
While you're moving, rock steady 
Rock steady Let's call this song exactly what it is 
(What it is, what it is, what it is) 
It's a funky and lowdown feeling (what it is) 
In the hips from left to right (what it is) 
What it is is I might be doin' (what it is) 
This funky dance all night, ah 
(Put your hands up in the air) 
(Got a feelin' you ain't got a care) 
You gotta take this burn)? 
(That tear we all inside)? Rock steady baby, rock steady, woo
