I can take what I feel 
cause I know its real 
and I know I love you 
and you came in my world 
and showed me whats real 
and I know my heart is yours to hold [chorus] 
cause you, you gave me hope 
and you, you showed me you cared 
and you said I was your best friend 
then you told me you'd love me forever so here 
please take my hand 
cause you are my heart 
and I wanna give it to you 
cause I wanna lay by your side the rest of my life 
today will you please be my wife will you [chorus] 
cause you, you gave me hope 
and you showed me you cared 
and you said I was your best friend 
then you told me you'd love me forever 
yeah you told me you'd love me forever [x2]
