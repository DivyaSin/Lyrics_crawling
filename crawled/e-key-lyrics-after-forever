The eyes, looking so cold 
Condemn failure 
And seek for perfection 
will never be attained They're judging the denying face which stares back 
A bewildered revelation Show me objectivity 
And let these eyes judge again You cannot touch what you can't ever obtain 
I'm inexhaustible 
As well as empty in my bitter search My words are yours, 
my voice speaks for your thoughts 
I am your mirror without remorse, 
your reflection without doubts I fall and fall 
I must learn from the bruises 
The scars will be my guide There's no excuse in ignorance 
No time for weakness or regret 
Face your mirror without doubt 
Your reflection without remorse If knowledge was wisdom 
And wisdom the key to inner rest 
Teach me...
