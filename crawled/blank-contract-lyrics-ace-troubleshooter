God: Here ya go, boy, sign the form 
Just sign on the dotted line 
Don't you worry about petty details 
It'll be alright in time 
Me : Hey wait a sec, this contract's blank 
You know there's nothing written here 
God: That's ok, I'll fill it in later 
Just be sure to lend an ear All I want is your heart, no promises 
Trust in Me with your heart, mind, and strength 
And the rest will follow Me: Hey wait a sec, God 
How'd You get out of the box I put You in? 
You know for a while I've been comfortable 
Living in my sin 
God: You know, son, you've been living two-faced 
You've really made it into an art 
I'll give you true love, true peace, true freedom 
Just give me your heart Me: I love only You, Lord 
I want more of You, Lord
