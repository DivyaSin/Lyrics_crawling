Oh, if I had a big 'ol eraser 
I'd start from today 
And go back through life's pages 
And correct a lot of things 
Yeah, steppin' on toes with my foot in my mouth 
Yeah, thought I was the king 
But that was back 
Back when I knew everything Yeah,a good hard head and no regrets 
Is what I thought made the man 
But now life's hard knocks is about all I've got 
And sorry's what I am 
Yeah,I had my old worn out opinion 
Oh,and I sure made it plain 
But that was back 
Back when I knew everything So what you say forgive and forget 
One more chance is all I need 
Yeah, this 'ol loose cannon is a mighty long shot 
This time I'm askin' please 
Yeah that's right I was wrong 
Now all that I can say 
Is that was back 
Back when I knew everything A little too big for a britcher 
But life's a whittled me down to size 
I just hope there's enough of me left to apologize So what you say forgive and forget 
One more chance is all I need 
Yeah, this 'ol loose cannon is a mighty long shot 
This time I'm askin' please 
Yeah that's right I was wrong 
Now all that I can say 
Is that was back 
Back when I knew everything Oh, that was back 
Back when I knew everything
