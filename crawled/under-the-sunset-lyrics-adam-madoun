[Verse 1] 
There's million girls around the world 
But she's the only one i could see 
Girl let me swim into your soul 
Cuz baby i feel you're my whole [Chorus] 
Look, there is a spot where we can go 
And yeah we gonna kiss under the sunset 
Oh yeah we gonna look beautiful together 
You don't need to miss this chance baby [Verse 2] 
My heart aches with hunger for you 
I can't stand it when you look at me (Yeah) 
I'm desperate for you 
I need a rescue 
You drive me insane (Insane) X2 
Cannot resist your charms 
Somebody help me out 
You could do it now 
Be mine tonight [Chorus] 
Look, there is a spot where we can go 
And yeah we gonna kiss under the sunset 
Oh yeah we gonna look beautiful together 
You don't need to miss this chance baby [Bridge] 
I 'll do whatever you want 
I'll order what you want 
Call me, i'll be there shortly 
We 'll make a wonderful journey I 'll do whatever you want 
I'll order what you want 
Call me, i'll be there shortly 
We will make a beautiful journey I know you want me baby...Yes
