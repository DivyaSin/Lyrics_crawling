Every year I get the same feel 
Christmas come I wanna pack my backs and flee 
Wanna get away from new york 
Wanna find another place to be So we're having a reggae christmas 
- down in jamaica we're having a good time too 
Hey man, we're having a reggae christmas 
A merry christmas and a reggae new year to you Christmas is nice in germany 
If you like being up to your knees in snow 
It's just as cold up in canada 
We gotta find another place to go 
So...so we're having a reggae christmas 
- down in jamaica We're having a good time too. 
Hey man, we're having a reggae christmas 
A merry christmas and a reggae new year to you. 
And so now we're down in kingstontown 
But I get that someday I know 
Gonna meet my friends down in kingston town 
And those good times gonna rock 
And those good times gonna roll. 
We're having a reggae christmas 
- down in jamaica 
We're having a good time too.
