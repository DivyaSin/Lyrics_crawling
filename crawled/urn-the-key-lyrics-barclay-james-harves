You build me up 
Then you make me fall 
With a little more love 
You could make it easy 
I'm standing here 
With my back to the wall 
I keep holding on You've been around 
That's what I've heard 
With a little more time 
We could get together 
You hang around 
In your own little world 
I keep holding on A light shining in my life 
A fire that is burning 
I've never been this way before 
You know that the time is right 
To keep the flame burning 
Turn the key and you'll open the door Give me more You shoot me down 
My defenses are low 
With a little more love 
You could make it better 
I'm standing here 
Wondering where do we go 
I keep holding on A light shining in my life 
A fire that is burning 
I've never been this way before 
You know that the time is right 
To keep the flame burning 
Turn the key and you'll open the door Give me more A light shining in my life 
A fire that is burning 
I've never been this way before 
You know that the time is right 
To keep the flame burning 
Turn the key and you'll open the door
