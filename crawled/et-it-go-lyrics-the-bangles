One thing or another 
Your head is filled with questions, 
sights and sounds 
Distractions always get you down Turn around 
Trying to remember 
Where you were the day before North and south and east and west 
Where to go 
When it's over 
When it's done 
Let it go Frightened by the numbers 
All the possibilities 
Changing minds you hope to find 
One more dream
