Lover of mine, 
you can't unlie your lies. 
The wires will compromise 
and your tallest tales will send them into winds. Intertwined, 
your tangled threads with mine. 
But I want my wrists untied. 
From the tips of your 
tallest tales heights. Oh now, your call was vibrant and 
rich and sweet to pull me down. 
Oh now, it sings to me in an ocean 
storm song to pull me down. 
To pull me down. Malicious eyes 
to sabotage my mind. 
Tortured by the butterflies. 
But your tallest tales will kill them over time. Sinking light. 
Got desire to hold me tight. 
Freedom flashes across my eyes. 
But your tallest tales will keep me safe at night. Oh now, your call was vibrant and 
rich and sweet to pull me down. 
Oh now, it sings to me in an ocean 
storm song to pull me down. Oh now, your call was vibrant and 
rich and sweet to pull me down. 
Oh now, it sings to me in an ocean 
storm song to pull me down. 
To pull me down. Oh, you're bringing me down. 
With your siren sounds. 
Oh, you'll make me drown. Oh now, your call was vibrant and 
rich and sweet to pull me down. 
Oh now, it sings to me in an ocean 
storm song to pull me down. Oh now, your call was vibrant and 
rich and sweet to pull me down. 
Oh now, it sings to me in an ocean 
storm song to pull me down.
