Here you come again 
Just when Im about to make it work without you 
You waltz right in the door 
Just like you done before 
And wrap my heart round your little finger 
Here you come again 
Just when Im about to make it work without you 
You look into my eyes 
And light those dreamy eyes 
And pretty soon Im wonderin 
How I came to doubt you 
All you gotta do 
Is smile that smile 
And there go all my defenses 
Just leave it up to you 
And in a little while 
Youre messin up my mind 
An fillin up my senses 
Here you come again 
Lookin better than a body 
Has a right to 
An shakin me up so 
That all I really know 
Is here you come again 
An here I go 
All you gotta do 
Is smile that smile 
And there go all my defenses 
Just leave it up to you 
And in a little while 
Youre messin up my mind 
An fillin up my senses 
Here you come again 
Lookin better than a body 
Has a right to 
An shakin me up so 
That all I really know 
Is here you come again 
You talk about life, you talk about death, 
And everything in between, 
Like it's nothing, and the words are easy. 
You talk about me, and you talk about you, 
And everything I do, 
Like it's something, that needs repeating. 
I don't need an alibi or for you to realize, 
The things we left unsaid, 
Are only taking space up in our heads. 
Make it my fault, win the game 
Point the finger, place the blame 
You toss me up and down, 
It doesn't matter now. 
'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again. 
This is not about emotion, 
I don't need a reason not to care what you say, 
Or what happened in the end. 
This is my interpretation, 
And it don't, don't make sense. 
And there go all my defenses 
Just leave it up to you 
And in a little while 
Youre messin up my mind 
An fillin up my senses 
Here you come again 
Lookin better than a body 
Has a right to 
An shakin me up so 
That all I really know 
Is here you come again 
An here I go 
'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again. 
This is not about emotion, 
I don't need a reason not to care what you say, 
Or what happened in the end. 
This is my interpretation, 
And it don't, don't make sense. 
Here you come again 
It don't make sense 
Here you come again 
It don't make sense 
This is my interpretation 
And here you come again
