There is no such thing as fire and brimstone. When the rains come, so will the floods and Noah will be your grave. Help promote the de-evolution of the human race. Continue the search because we are not ownable, we are not programmable, we cannot be controlled. Search manufacture or remanufacture. I've lost my train of thought again, can't remember yesterday from the back of my hand. But I can see your future and it does not contain me. When the world ends, we will all relive our childhoods, and our rebirth will begin.
