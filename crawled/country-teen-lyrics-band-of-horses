The night is wasted 
Sorry and passed out on the lawn 
Hours later 
You couldn't get him on the phone 
And when he got back home 
All the lights were on I can hear you 
Now and then the sound is almost gone 
Well, I'd be near you 
If you were willing to be near anyone 
It's never you at all 
And when the sky begins to fall Will you get to the point and walk away, girl 
You've been cutting it close for far too long 
There's an innocence lost throughout the day, girl When you're flipping a coin, you're half away, girl 
I know it would be good if I could only pick a side 
You know when somebody goes somebody stays, girl
