the sound of the engine 
the feel of the tires 
your hands on a wheel and the smell from the fires 
streetlights and headlights on a road that goes nowhere 
she left you, she left you but you know she's still out there 
and somehow it always seems like you are waiting for something and somewhere they're dancing the night away madly 
and their sweat fills their eyes as they're clutching so sadly 
so you struggled for words you could never find somehow 
but there's nowhere to hide coz the secrets's out now out now 
out now it's out now 
out now somehow it always seems like you would wake up from a dream 
she never knew you 
she only knew what she heard 
so just once you'd pull her close 
and you'd whisper the words but you hated yourself 
for the things that you gave her 
but you stole with your mind 
when your heart was impure 
so you think you'll forget 
all these nights like a sickness 
and there's nothing for miles 
everywhere in the darkness but somewhere they're dancing the night away madly 
and the tears fill your eyes as you clutching her sadly 
and you searched in yourself 
but could not find an answer 
now the feeling grows inside of you like a cancer 
and roar the engine on a road that's just endless 
and her ghost is with you everywhere in the darkness 
you struggled for words you could never say somehow 
but there's nowhere to run coz the secret's out now out now 
out now it's out now 
out now somehow she always knew
