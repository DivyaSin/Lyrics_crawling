A thousand words for why I love you 
Girl, I could go on all night telling you why it'll be true 
Let's stretch out on my leather couch under our 18 by 22 
I cannot try to explain it 
Baby how can say it to you Girl you're the rest of my life and all 
And you come whenever I call 
Girl I just wanna say it 
I thank you from the bottom of my heart 
That's why [Chorus] 
Baby, what you are to me 
No one else can be 
Oh, and I think I'm in love baby 
Oh oh, baby just can't stop this feeling 
From taking over and over 
And I know I can't stop it girl, you're mine 
You're mine, yeah I can understand how you want your space 
Give it all some time to let it soak into your mind 
Searching all my life for a woman like you 
Gonna do exactly what my precious heart tells me to Oh girl, you're the rest of my life and all 
And you come whenever I call, girl 
And baby I just wanna say it 
I thank you from the bottom of my heart [Chorus] I know that you've been hurt before 
By men who swear it all 
But I just wanna say 
Wanna take it day by day 
I'm gonna pick you up whenever you 
Pick you up whenever you fall [Chorus: x3] Vamp out
