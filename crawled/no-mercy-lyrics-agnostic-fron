Hypocrite we had a deal. 
Nothing ever fucking real 
Never trust the outsider. 
It's proven once again 
You can say what you want to say 
No forgiveness no mercy 
Or you can just go straight to hell 
No forgiveness no mercy It was nothing but a big charade tired of 
Playing these fucking games 
Can't wait to see your tombstone slate may 
Have been fooled but never played Fuck you I don't need you! Turns out I'm better off anyway tomorrow is another day 
I don't need no sympathy from someone living in a fantasy
