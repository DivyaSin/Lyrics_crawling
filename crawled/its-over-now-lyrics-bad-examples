Id like to remember you the way you look this very moment 
But now were past it and Im memorizing that you were in it 
Someone has to make the move to say good-bye so say good-bye 
Its over now, its over now, its over now ... 
Your eyes are still off-center on your face, its strange to mention 
Its been a year or so since Ive been aware of your imperfections 
I cant imagine loving someone else but I will work it out 
Its over now, its over now, its over now ... 
Well make the same mistakes again weve got our methods down 
Its over now, its over now, its over now ... 
When I was seventeen I felt emotions unknown to mankind 
The love I had, the pain I felt began when it was mine 
Now as the end approaches I roll my eyes No, not again. 
Its over now, its over now, its over now ... 
And if you change your mind just call me 
And if you change your mind Ill be here 
Youve got about a week or so until forever disappears ... 
Id like to remember you the way you looked the day we met 
But as youre walking out the door Im starting to forget 
Ill always love you until someone else gets my attention 
Its over now, its over now, its over now ... 
Well make the same mistakes again weve got our methods down 
Its over now, its over now, its over now ...
