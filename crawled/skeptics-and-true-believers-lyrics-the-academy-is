Don't be so scared, we will not lead you on like you've been doing for weeks. 
So you're selfish, and I'm sorry. 
When I'm gone you'll be going nowhere fast. [Chorus:] 
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you, 
'cause I wouldn't believe you if you said the same to me. 
Near death, last breath, and barely hanging on. 
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you? Don't be scared to take a second for reflection, 
to take a leave of absence, see what you're made of. 
So I'm selfish, and you're sorry. 
When I'm gone you'll be going nowhere fast. 
So who's selfish, and who's sorry? [Chorus] Someone, somewhere said some things that may have sparked some sympathy, but don't believe. 
Don't believe a word you've heard about me. 
Don't be so scared. It's harder for me. [Chorus] Someone, somewhere said some things that may have sparked some sympathy, but don't believe. 
Don't believe a word you've heard.
