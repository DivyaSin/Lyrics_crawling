WHO WANTS TO BE A POPSTAR? Folks always tellin' me, on the web you'll find the key 
Try social networking, so we all can see 
You can be a big star, flash your online business card 
They'll see you near and far, practically for free But I don't know why people try to 
Live just like an open book 
Callin' out their nasty secrets 
Just to make you look? Who wants to be a popstar? 
Who wants to be famous? 
Who wants to be on display all night and day 
With cameras flashin' bright Who wants to hog the spotlight 
Wearin' clothes that are too tight 
You can buy off the rack, and stay on track 
To live an honest life Who wants to be a popstar? 
Oh oh, it just ain't right Folks always tellin' me, get yourself up on TV 
Live your "idol" fantasies, Be a superstar 
It's the new reality, shows about just you and me 
People watch you eat an' sleep, Fame's no longer hard Makes me mad when people run their 
Mouths so loud into their cellphones 
Everyone talkin', no one listnin' 
To their borin' lives Who wants to be a popstar? 
Who wants to be famous? 
Who wants to be on display, all night and day 
Your scandals brought to light Who wants to have the right nose 
Just for strikin' the right pose 
Who says you can't have enough of useless stuff 
Just have an honest life Who wants to be a popstar? 
It just ain't right I don't see why people need to 
All compete for fame and fortune 
Tellin' stories overstuffed with doggone silly lies 
But the crazy details make them stars in their own minds Who wants to be a popstar? 
Who wants to be famous? 
Who wants to be on display all night and day 
With cameras flashin' bright Who wants to hog the spotlight 
Wearin' clothes that are too tight 
You can buy off the rack, and stay on track 
To live an honest life Who wants to be a popstar? 
Who wants to be famous? 
Who wants to be on display, all night and day 
Your scandals brought to light Who wants to have the right nose 
Just for strikin' the right pose 
Who says you can't have enough of useless stuff 
Just have an honest life Who wants to be a popstar? 
Oh! It just ain't right
