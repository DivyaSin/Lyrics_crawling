Can't eat,can't sleep 
All I do is think about you 
Hold on, what's this feelin' 
That's my heart your stealin' 
That's okay my baby, I don't want it back 
What's this chemistry, such intensity 
And good emotion gettin' through [Chorus:] 
It's your sweet love, I'm feelin' it 
Can't get enough, go figure it 
Madly, deeply, baby I'm fallin' 
Head over heels, I'm livin' it 
Heart and soul, you're givin' it 
I'm thinkin' that 
I'm diggin' it Come on keep it comin' 
Think you're onto somethin' 
So strong, so right, it's gotta be real 
You're breakin' down the walls and fences 
There's a powerful sense of 
Good emotion gettin' through [Chorus x 2]
