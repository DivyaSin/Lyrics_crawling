You say you want the truth 
But you can't take it 
So I give you lies 
I give you lies 
You say you want the best 
But you destroy it 
So I keep it inside 
I keep it inside I'll tell ya something 
It's a double-edged sword you're giving 
And I can't see the truth in living 
When we hide behind a wall of fear 
And you don't see it 
It's a twisted dream you believe in 
And what's the use in pretending 
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear So there I said it 
And I won't apologize to you anymore 
Cause I'm a grown-a** man 
And I won't live again 
And I'm sick and tired of living in your shadow 
So there I said it 
I won't apologize to you anymore 
Cause I'm a grown-a** man 
And I don't understand 
Why I should be living in the shadows 
So there I said it You wanna hear my voice 
My mind, my demons 
But not too much 
Or you'll give up I'll tell ya something 
It's a double-edged sword you're giving 
And I can't see the truth in living 
When we hide behind a wall of fear 
And you don't see it 
It's a twisted dream you believe in 
And what's the use in pretending 
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear So there I said it 
And I won't apologize to you anymore 
Cause I'm a grown-a** man 
And I won't live again 
And I'm sick and tired of living in your shadow 
So there I said it 
I won't apologize to you anymore 
Cause I'm a grown-a** man 
And I don't understand 
Why I should be living in the shadows 
So there I said it
