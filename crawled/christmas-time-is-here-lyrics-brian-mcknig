Well the snow is beginning to fall 
And the day of Thanksgiving has come and gone 
Silver bells begin to ring 
Hear little children sing 
Silent Night was never just a song Stockings are hung by the chimney with care 
It's the most wonderful time of the year 
Ice cream castles in the sky 
There is happiness in their eyes 
'Cause Christmas time is here Ring a ding-ding Wrapping presents 
Hearts reflect the fire's glow 
I have you underneath the mistletoe 
And all is fine 
Fall down like rain upon me 
Give me something I can feel 
So then I'll know 
Then I'll know this is for real Stockings are hung by the chimney with care 
It's the most wonderful time of the year 
Ice cream castles in the sky 
There is happiness in their eyes 
'Cause Christmas time yes 
Christmas time yes 
Christmas time is here
