I am weak, but Thou art strong 
Jesus, keep me from all wrong 
I'll be satisfied as long 
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee Just a closer walk with Thee 
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea 
Daily walking close to Thee 
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be Take my hand Lord Jesus take my hand 
Take my hand Lord Jesus take my hand 
'Cause there's a race to be run 
There's a victory to be won 
Every hour give me power to go through When my feeble life is o'er 
Time for me will be no more 
Guide me gently, safely o'er 
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore Just a closer walk with Thee 
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea 
Daily walking close to Thee 
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be Just a closer walk with Thee 
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea 
Daily walking close to Thee 
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be 
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
