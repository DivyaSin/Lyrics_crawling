Why constantly put us on trial 
What gives them the right to revile Hatred and fear 
All at work here 
Attacking everything that you hold dear Don't be afraid 
If freedom is late 
Justice will shine on our fate Don't close your eyes, my baby yeah 
Whenever your heart has had enough 
Don't close your eyes, my darlin' yeah

You'll miss the surprise

Life's becoming all that you dreamed of What suspicion will they now exploit 
So the world frightens and disappoints Hatred and pain 
Descend into shame 
Fighting your courage with madness and blame Miracles need 
A moment to breathe 
Before they make you believe Don't close your eyes, my baby yeah 
Whenever your heart has had enough

They pray 
To bury the hatchet for good in your back Believe 
Destiny bends toward the light that we see

When you are under attack - Set yourself free Don't don't close your eyes 
Don't don't believe their lies, the 
Sun will, sun will rise
