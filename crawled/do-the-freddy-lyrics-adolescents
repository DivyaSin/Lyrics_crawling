1, 2, Do the Freddy! Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
Hunch your shoulders, bulge your eyes, 
Jump around and don't ask why! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
First you wander, then you linger, 
If you get bored, chop off your finger! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy! 
Do the Freddy!
