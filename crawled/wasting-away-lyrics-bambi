I wasted my tears 
I wasted my Time 
Wishin u were here 
And u were mine I shoulda known 
It all came too soon 
U came w/ the sun 
And left w/ the moon 
I wish i had noticed 
Ur smiles were distant 
Then i would have stopped myself 
Before i kept wishin I wasted my tears 
I wasted my time 
Wishin u were here 
And u were mine I woke up one day 
With u at dawn 
I just closed my eyes 
And you were gone 
I trusted too much 
And gave u my heart 
But i didn't know 
U would break it apart
