I got nothing 
There's no sense in looking back 
All my yesterdays went up in flames 
Now I'm gonna 
Just forget what's in the past 
I don't even recognize their names Two undiscarded lives, a simple proposition 
Everyday a little pain 
Survival's up to me, since every time I 
Open my eyes the world remains I got nothing (got nothing) 
Too bad (too bad) 
But I'm happy cause that's all I have (that's all I have) 
I got nothing (got nothing) 
They want (they want) 
No false dreaming, I practically just won Looking out their 
Windows from their easy chairs 
I can see they think they got it beat 
They just see a 
Drifter in some worn out clothes 
Not someone who'd taste so good to meet I'm more ashamed of them than what I'm wearing 
Not reaching past the window ledge 
There's a view of life that we're not sharing 
'cause they won't walk out to the edge I got nothing (got nothing) 
Too bad (too bad) 
But I'm happy cause that's all I have (that's all I have) 
I got nothing (got nothing) 
They want (they want) 
No false dreaming, I practically just won.
