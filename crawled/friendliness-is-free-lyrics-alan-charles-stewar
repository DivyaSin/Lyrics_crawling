I've got to be honest and say with my hand on my heart 
that whatever I try it just seems to keep falling apart 
she's finding it hard to forgive 
I know I'm a man who has sinned 
she says I've been sailing a little too close to the wind CHORUS 
set me adrift in the indian ocean or in the mediterranean sea 
the wind in my hair the sun on my face and friendliness is free 
let me loose on the caribbean or on the blue aegean sea 
it's the perfect time a wonderful place 
and it's the last you'll see of me I'm out of my head dreaming of maybes and mights 
too many sidestreets too many bar-room nights 
she says that my chances are slim 
I've been playing a game I can't win 
I guess I've been showing too many sheets to the wind CHORUS 2 
push me out in the indian ocean or in the mediterranean sea 
the wind in my hair the sun on my face and friendliness is free 
throw me a line in the caribbean or down the south pacific way 
it's the perfect time a wonderful place and that's where I'm gonna stay (stay with me) 
GUITAR SOLO this nuclear winter will bring a young man to his knees 
gripped by inertia caught in its ice cold freeze 
she says that the future looks thin 
but I believe it's a time to begin 
I'll be setting my sails into the teeth of the wind CHORUS 3 
sailing away in the indian ocean or in the mediterranean sea 
the wind in my hair the sun on my face and friendliness is free 
drop me off in the caribbean or in the blue aegean sea 
it's the perfect time a wonderful place and friendliness is free
