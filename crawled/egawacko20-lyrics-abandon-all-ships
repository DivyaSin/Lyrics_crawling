Even if it rains, and the sun won't shine, sun won't shine. 
Whatever the weather you'll be mine. All of this noise! 
Distracts me! 
Fear him now! 
Let there be light! Through the worst weather. 
I'll make sure we're together. 
When the sky begins to hail, 
We will prevail. WE WILL PREVAIL!! The beauty in the eye of the storm! 
Is where i stand when i feel your grace! 
I forget about my pride, and my place! 
Just take me from here! OH! [x2] When... the sky turns grey... 
I'll pray for, a better day. 
A better day. 
Let's watch the rain fall, 
And wash away our innocence. 
In the clouds i hear the chorus sing. 
Hallelujah... Put the south in your mouth and swallow. We are the herd and he is our sheppard!! [x2] He whose without sin cast the first stone! But, who are you to judge?! 
Who are you to judge!?
