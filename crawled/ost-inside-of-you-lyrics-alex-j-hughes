All these sleepless nights, my mind just wanders 
A bitter end ignites my surrender 
How I need you, Im shattered like before 
Still funny how youre all Im ever after In her beauty I will lose myself tonight 
Im lost inside, Im lost inside her eyes (inside her eyes) 
Wishing the lies I told myself came true 
I must be lost, lost inside of you (inside of you) The stars have never shined their light on me 
It breaks my heart in pieces cant you see 
Cross my heart and hope to die itll ease the pain itll ease my mind 
Did you expect me, not to fall for you? In her beauty I will lose myself tonight 
Im lost inside, Im lost inside her eyes (inside her eyes) 
Wishing the lies I told myself came true 
I must be lost, lost inside of you (inside of you) (Bridge) In her beauty I will lose myself tonight (diamonds) 
Im lost inside, Im lost inside her eyes (inside her eyes) 
Wishing the lies I told myself came true 
I must be lost, lost inside of you (diamonds)
