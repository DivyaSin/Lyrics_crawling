It's real and I feel it every single night 
The problem is hidin' it don't add up 
Let nothing' break us apart 
Don't let it... Love has a way, it's a healer 
It can soothe and mend even a broken heart 
Give you hope in your darkest hour 
To look ahead and see there'll be brighter days Love will keep us together (I know...) 
Love will keep us together (Love will...) 
Love will keep us together (Ooo...) 
If nothing else ever could 
I know it will Love has its staying power 
It (Oo) thrills, fills you it builds up (Oo) 
From the morning to the late (Oo) night (Ah Ah Ah Oo-Oo) 
It can heal and appeal to the true at heart (See I understand it commands my attention) 
Impossible to ignore (and it's yours if you're willing) 
It's the joy and the feeling we all hope for 
It brings us together and makes everything better Love will keep us together (I know...) 
Love will keep us together (Love will...) 
Love will keep us together (Ooo...) 
If nothing else ever could 
I know it will Keep it, cherish it deeply 
I know it will (Keep us together) 
'Said I know it will (Keep us together) 
Oooo it will (Keep us...ahh ahh ahh) ad lib over chorus Love will keep us together (I know...) 
Love will keep us together (Love will...) 
Love will keep us together (Ooo...) 
If nothing else ever could 
I know it will 
Love will keep us together (I know...) 
Love will keep us together (Love will...) 
Love will keep us together (Ooo...) 
If nothing else ever could 
I know it will 
Love will keep us together (I know...)
