I'm being shadowed by a shady stranger 
Someone's always lookin' over my shoulder 
I'm frightened just to walk around the corner 
Your eyes upon me everywhere I'd tell my friends but they're all losing my temper 
They keep on telling me I should know better 
Sometimes I wonder if my mother sent you 
She said she'd always be right there Lookin' over my shoulder(x2) Another morning and I'm sure I saw you 
Behind the bushes with a photo camera 
My doctors tell me that is paranoia 
But I can't shake this feeling that you're there Lookin' over my shoulder(x8) Now I go to sleeping now with one eye open 
One of these days I'm gonna catch you lurking 
Behind the curtains with evil intention 
But I can't get away from my own mind I'm being shadowed by a shady stranger 
(feels like) 
Someone's always lookin' over my shoulder 
(so scared) 
I'm frightened just to walk around the corner 
(last night) 
Your eyes upon me everywhere Lookin' over my shoulder(x6)
