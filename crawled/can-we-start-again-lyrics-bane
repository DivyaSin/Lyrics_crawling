Can we start again, go back to what it meant back then, open minds and open hearts, the things that set us apart x4 Was it more than words/and do they still 
apply/and do you still believe/well so do I x2 I was a 15 year old kid with nowhere to fit in, I just wanted to skate, listen to my Suicidal tape/when someone told me about a place where the strange were accepted, and judged by what's inside, A scene of truly open minds Can we start again, go back to what it meant back then, open minds and open hearts, The things that set us apart Somewhere, somehow, everything has changed, look at what we've gotten ourselves caught up in The same mindless clicks, the same high school shit, all the walls you scream about breaking down /I've watched you build brick by brick I was a 15 year old kid with nowhere to fit in I just wanted to skate, listen to my Suicidal tape/when someone told me about a place, where the strange were accepted, and judged by what's inside, a scene of truly open minds, ARE WE STILL THE SCENE OF OPEN MINDS Do you still believe - I do x2 I do x2 Look beyond the 3 chords that fill your lives, look beyond the gossip and the lies, look beyond the dullest of outsides, look beyond/Try harder See what's inside This burning in my heart, born under the same songs that you know 
But our blood will never blend until you let those doors go
