I try and find a key so I can sing or say 
A little of my peace in a subtle way 
This guitar I can barely play 
Yet I still strum along 
And I yearn to hear your thoughts 
Maybe a little praise 
At first that's what I got 
But it never seems to stay 
And for a time I kept it caged just to let it go I thought I'd come such a long way 
I thought I'd broken some brand new ground 
But still I live with the same fate 
Again and again, year after year 
And I'd be pleased with just your company 
Stuck to the walls in here just hanging around 
Until we feel there's nothing more to see 
We'll get the hell out of here I knew that all the while you tried to stay the same 
Same hair, same scent, same smile 
And when it came time, you loved the change 
And you embraced it so 
For now we'll drive this lathe and with an honest try 
We'll go against the grain 
And I think we'll find it's best that you and I have changed 
And we'll just let it show 
Oh god we'll let 'em know
