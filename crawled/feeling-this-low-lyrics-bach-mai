I heard there was another man another pair of blue eyes to take my place 
I heard there was another girl another person that I would have to face 
Someone who knows someone who's heard 
That I'm the one, the reason why you hurt 
And there they faced me 
There they scowled 
There they turned me away cause 
I am not allowed I'm just the bad guy, I'm just the soulless jerk 
Why the whole relationship took a turn 
I can't feel the pain, I'm not supposed to hurt 
I'm not alone because I was first 
To push away, 
to make you cry 
I'm the one, the sole reason why 
We're gone I know that I am the reason/ I know that you are the reason 
Why we are feeling this low/ Why I am feeling this low 
I was bringing us down / Cause you were bringing me down 
But I let go/ But you let go 
Took it one step further 
And left alone/ And left me alone I know that I left you reeling/ I know that I was left reeling 
falling and feeling this low 
But now you are holding yourself up/ But now I am holding myself up 
You've got a new man/ I have a new man 
You've got a new life/ I have a new life 
It seems all right I heard there was another man 
There was another girl 
A brand new life a whole new world 
Maybe a scene where we can just be friends 
A whole new light 
We'll see how it ends 
The clock is ticking 
I'll be there waiting 
I'll see you then I know that I am the reason/ I know that you are the reason 
Why we are feeling this low/ Why I am feeling this low 
I was bringing us down / Cause you were bringing me down 
But I let go/ But you let go 
Took it one step further 
And left alone/ And left me alone I know that I left you reeling/ I know that I was left reeling 
falling and feeling this low 
But now you are holding yourself up/ But now I am holding myself up 
You've got a new man/ I have a new man 
You've got a new life/ I have a new life 
It seems all right I have to say that I'm sorry for all the pain and suffering from the time before 
But now I see that the choice was right 
And you deserved a better life 
Than I could give 
My dreams felt wrong 
Least that's why we are gone.
