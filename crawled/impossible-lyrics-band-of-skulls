Everyday I'm disappearing 
Out of sight and out of hearing 
It's impossible 
It's impossible 
To be invincible 
To be invincible More and more it happens daily 
My first name's george and the second bailey 
It's impossible 
It's impossible 
To be invincible 
To be invincible I am a man 
I am a man 
I am a man 
I am a man 
'Cause you said I am 
Yeah So cut me out of the family photo 
Who would have thought of sinking so low 
It's impossible to be invincible 
But maybe it's possible to be impossible 
I am a man 
I am a man 
I am a man 
I am a man 
'Cause you said I am 
Yeah
