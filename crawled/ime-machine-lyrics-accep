The hands keep on turning, the pendulum just swings 
Prisoners upon this rock, flying without wings 
Captured in a moment, still the hours chimed 
Joining closer as it shifted with the sands of time Paranoid dimensions, guilt falls into place 
Driven by an unseen force, swelling into space At beyond the rainbow, cross the Milky Way 
Passengers without a choice, slowly turning grey On through the night, shine on forever 
Going insane as we ride the time machine Waiting for no one, relative to none 
Answering to not a thing, except the rising sun Bouncing on this fabric, at the speed of light 
Connecting points of futures past, is its only plight Passengers without a choice, hanging by a string 
Spending with a hands of time, flying without wings
