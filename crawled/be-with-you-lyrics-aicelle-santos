The moment we met 
I just couldn't explain 
I find myself drawn to you naturally 
When I saw your eyes everything changed 
And somehow I knew 
you were different from the rest Is it wrong that I feel this way? 
I don't know if I should walk away 
But my heart tells me otherwise, 
for once in my life I want to do what feels right No matter what they say, we belong together 
No matter what I do, can't stay away from you 
No matter what they say, we should be together 
All I wanna do is to be with you All I want to do is to be with you This may not be our time 
And the world may not be on our side 
But our love is written in the stars Ohh... All I want to do is to be with you 
All I want to do is to be with you Is it wrong that I feel this way? 
I don't know if I should walk away 
But my heart tells me otherwise, 
for once in my life I want to do what feels right No matter what they say, we belong together 
No matter what I do, can't stay away from you 
No matter what they say, we should be together 
All I wanna do is to be with you All I want to do is to be with you (All I want, all I want is to be with you) 
All I want to do is to be with you 
(All I want, all I want is to be with you) (All I want, all I want is to be with you) 
All I want to do is to be with you 
(All I want, all I want is to be with you)
