Oh little boy, asleep in my arms tonight 
Under the stars so bright 
King of Kings 
What tidings of comfort and joy He brings Son of man from Heaven above, You fell 
Jehovah Emanuel 
Upon a midnight clear 
I feel the love It must be love 
It's got to be His love 
It must be His love 
That brought You here Because of His love that's why you're here 
To give us hope for tomorrow 
To take away the sorrow and fear 
To wipe away the tears and love because of His love Special one, Who came to set all men free 
Now all Heaven and earth will sing 
Behold the newborn King 
It's all because of His love It must be love 
Got to be His love 
It could only be His love 
That brought You here Because of His love, that's why you're here 
To give us hope for tomorrow 
To take away the sorrow and fear 
To wipe away the tears and love because of His love Oh, close to my heart, I hold the sleeping savior 
He came to chase all the darkness away 
If there might be things, I don't understand 
I'll just keep holding on to Your hand Because of His love, that's why you're here 
To give us hope for tomorrow 
To take away the sorrow and fear 
To wipe away the tears and love because of His Because of His love, that's why you're here
