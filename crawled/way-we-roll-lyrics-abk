Roll, Roll, woo Hey, ho (hey, ho) 
I'm always out of control 
Steady moving this is how we roll 
Only streets know where we go 
Cause I ain't got to stay in one place The wheels on a bus go round and round 
Smokin' different weed from town to town 
I guess I'll see you when I get there 
Have it rolled up cause you know how I love them blunts Man, I got 10's and 20's whatever you need 
But since you're my homie dog, you smokin' for free I got mad love from my people for my people 
Actin' the same cause we all see equal 
No different, we bleed the same 
So when you see, quit bein' all strange Hey, hey, what's up man? What's up dog? I didn't want to bother you or nothing 
But I wanted to say, what's up you know? What's up, yeah Just wanted to tell to keep doing what you're doing 
Which is real Whoo! 
Whoo! 
Whoo! Hey, ho (hey, ho) 
I'm always out of control 
Steady foolin' this the way we roll 
Only streets know where we go 
Cause I ain't got time to stay in one place Back on the streets with a new release 
Road Fools all day man fuck the police (fuck 'em) 
Let's go, let's go is what we be thinkin' (let's go) 
Back to the hotel so we can start drinkin' 
You know this night has just begin 
Road Folls in this bitch call a friend (holla back) 
Don't be nervous just relax
