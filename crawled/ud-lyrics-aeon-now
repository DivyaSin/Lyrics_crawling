This word is an old rusted tool 
to erase disdain 
from this golden fool 
swallow seeds bourne on the wind 
when confusion sets in 
when confusion sets in the river drowns the straggled bride 
honor is mist rolling torpedo tide 
traded for sticks with a hole in her side 
all saviors die 
all saviors die I shed a broken tear 
the river is near 
the river is near 
and true love overcomes fear 
redemption is here 
redemption is here the dreamland wolf is stillborn 
what by blind tyranny has torn 
that heartless snub once was deep love 
and the snub once was deep love
