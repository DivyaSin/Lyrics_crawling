Merry Christmas baby 
Be sure to treat me nice 
Merry Christmas baby 
Be sure to treat me nice 
I feel just like I'm living 
Living in paradise Now you see I feel real good tonight 
Got music on the radio 
I feel real good tonight 
Got music on the radio 
I feel like I wanna kiss you 
Underneath the mistletoe Now listen 
Santa came down the chimney 
Half past three 
With lots and lots of presents 
For my baby and me Merry Christmas baby 
You sure do treat me nice 
And I feel just like I'm living 
Living in paradise Now Santa came down the chimney 
Half past three
