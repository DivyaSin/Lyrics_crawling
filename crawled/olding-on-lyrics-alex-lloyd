Blistered and worn 
Been ripped up, been torn 
You held your breathe, you passed the test And I will always love you And I won't let go, in the undertow 
If your in too deep I'm holding on 
Every blow by blow, how'd we get so low 
I would not trade something so strong Your arms stretched out 
Need love there's no doubt 
Escaping the pain, no need to explain And you don't have to doubt it And I won't let go, in the undertow 
If your in too deep I'm holding on 
Every blow by blow, how'd we get so low 
I would not trade something so strong Holding on, 'til you come back home 
Holding on, without you I'm alone 
Holding on, 'til I breathe you in 
Holding on, to be with you again And I won't let go, in the undertow 
If your in too deep I'm holding on 
Every blow by blow, how'd we get so low 
I would not trade something so strong Holding on its holding on its holding on in the undertow 
Holding on its holding on its holding on to something so strong Lyrics Written By: A. Wasiliev
