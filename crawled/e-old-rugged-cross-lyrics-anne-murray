On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross 
The emblem of suffering and shame 
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best 
For a world of lost sinners was slain So I'll cherish the old rugged cross 
'Till my trophies at last I lay down 
I will cling to the old rugged cross 
And exchange it some day for a crown O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world 
Has a wondrous attraction for me 
For the dear lamb of God left his glory above 
To bear it to dark cavalry So I'll cherish the old rugged cross 
'Till my trophies at last I lay down 
I will cling to the old rugged cross 
And exchange it some day for a crown
