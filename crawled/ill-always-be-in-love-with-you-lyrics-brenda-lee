Sweetheart if you should stray a million miles away I'll always be in love with you 
And though you'll find such bliss in someone else's kiss 
I'll always be in love with you 
I can't do anymore I've tried so hard to please 
But let me thank you for such tender memories 
I wish you happiness but for me sweetheart I guess I'll always be in love with you 
[ sax ] 
I'd like to wish you happiness but for me sweetheart I guess 
I'll always be in love with you
