It looks like we've worn this down 
Trampled and tattered and tossed around 
It looks like we've dragged this out 
as far as the eye can see now 
It seems like I've sold my soul 
For a sure shot at love or so I was told 
Remorse for the days that came 
Days that I can't regain I'll stay a little longer if it takes more time 
To work on all the problems that you've had in mind 
So lift those shoes that drag so slow 
Or save me the trouble if you're just gonna go 
And find yourself a place in another time 
Where things feel so much different 
And I hope you're right 
As for myself, I just don't know 
I'll fade into the background, I'm laying low Oh oh, hey hey, we've gotta find ourselves someway 
Oh oh, hey hey, we've gotta find ourselves someway 
Oh oh, hey hey, we've gotta keep ourselves someway
