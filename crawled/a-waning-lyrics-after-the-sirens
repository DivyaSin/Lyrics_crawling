You are what I've wanted at the closest, 
at the furthest away. When I was bound by compass marks, 
You engaged me in the tallest grass 
with the tines of a savage wreath. 
(Oh, my savagery, my savagery!) And in the convalescence, 
after my heart was flayed, 
divorced in a thick of thorns 
and then began to heal, 
You peeled open my wounds... 
And I cannot accept Your offer. Lover, I ache to, 
but I cannot accept Your offer.
