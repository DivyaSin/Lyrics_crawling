Another day begins 
In the kingdom of routine and misery 
Their tactic is successful 
Take those tiny crumbs of happiness 
And be grateful Jump and scream 
Another dumb rebellious teen 
Their ties will tie your mind 
Blow up the sky 
Adulthood is declined Take a shot of euphoria 
Smash away every phobia 
We sing this song about 
What they call "utopia" [Chorus] 
Break free 
Escape this pitiful reality 
Despise the concept of normality 
Let's make some noise 
This world is not enough 
Rise up it's time to let some rage erupt 
Nothing can stop us now 
Cause even if it's tough 
Anything less than everything 
Is just not enough Maybe some anxiolytics 
Would make this cage disappear 
Throw up serotonin 
And smash this beautiful vitrine 
World-wide insanity 
This is the glory of humanity 
Paper pieces paper numbers 
It's time to wake up 
From this slumber Take a shot of euphoria 
Smash away every phobia 
We sing this song about 
What they call "utopia" [Chorus] 
Break free 
Escape this pitiful reality 
Despise the concept of normality 
Let's make some noise 
This world is not enough 
Rise up it's time to let some rage erupt 
Nothing can stop us now 
Cause even if it's tough 
Anything less than everything 
Is just not enough Take a shot of euphoria 
Smash away every phobia 
We sing this song about 
What they call "utopia" Take a shot of euphoria 
Smash away every phobia 
We sing this song about 
What they call "utopia" -Solo- [Chorus] 
Break free 
Escape this pitiful reality 
Despise the concept of normality 
Let's make some noise 
This world is not enough 
Rise up it's time to let some rage erupt 
Nothing can stop us now 
Cause even if it's tough 
Anything less than everything 
Is just not enough
