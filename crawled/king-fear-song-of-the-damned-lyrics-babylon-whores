Pray tell me 
Wise Trevrizent 
Are not the good ones all dead 
In shallow graves 
In distant lands 
Banished from castles of the Grail Into the mansions of the Sun 
Where Doom is housed in golden rooms 
In amber dreaming 
Kept by silent halls 
Like all crystal 
There is to fall In girun i mus nocte et consuminur igni 
ingirunimusnocteetconsuminurigni 
In girun i mus nocte et consuminur igni Pray tell me 
Wise Trevrizent 
Is not our life like our love 
Treasured and clung to with tooth and nail 
Yet uncomplete until let go of
