Loosen your mind, 
open back up to me. 
We would be fine, 
if this were not up to me. What can I do? 
What can I do for you? 
I'll do all that I can, 
all that you'll let me do. Never again, never again will I let you go. 
Never again, never again will I let you go. You turned around, 
you turned around on me. 
You changed your mind, 
for something you found in me. Never again, never again will I let you go. 
Never again, never again will I let you go. Never again, never again, 
Never again, never again.
