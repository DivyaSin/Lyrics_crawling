One time, one chance 
To make me believe 
In people who are 
Mean to be 
I spent seasons, days and night 
Hiding from destiny 
I wasn't looking for you 
How dare you exist? I was hoping you were a mistake 
That maybe Lord listen wrongly my pray 
But you said "Hi, there" 
All I get "It's been too long" 
Possibility's off this game 
We challenge laws and flames 
So what? Don't be nervous you belong with me 
If music brought us here 
we can't just quit 
Guitar, strings and hearts 
We cannot beat 
John already introduce us fine 
Now it's time to use his kinda fire 
To burn our rooms 
and slow dance with desire I was hoping you were a mistake 
That maybe Lord listen wrongly my pray 
But you said "Hi, there" 
All I get "It's been too long" 
Possibility's off this game 
We challenge laws and flames 
So what? I'm leaving with no phone 
Or your name in a napkin 
I'm getting away regretting this moment 
The talk we never started 
And tricks life plays on everybody 
We'll meet again 
We'll create our story Aren't you curious? 
At least a bit anxious 
Picture how would be a night in the woods 
We could be reckless 
Crazy and jealous 
In a silent neighborhood Don't be nervous you belong with me 
If music brought us here 
we can't just quit 
Guitar, strings and hearts 
We cannot beat 
John already introduce us fine 
Now it's time to use his kinda fire 
To burn our rooms 
and slow dance with desire
