Well you come up stairs but not to talk 
You stay a little while and you do a little walk on home I hear you downstairs smoking cigarettes, I hear your talking shit 
Cuz you ain't got nothing to talk about at all So you took me to the party you got me alone 
Said you wanna feel good cuz and you feel like you're gonna explode I don't care I can't pay attention, and I don't give a damn about your intentions at all Pass me the whiskey, Pass me the gin 
Pass me whatever there's drink left in Well I don't care if it's 7 in the mornin' 
For all I care it could be the second comin' You said you couldn't take it anymore 
You can't live like this, it's a really big deal I don't care I can't pay attention, and I don't give a fuck about your intentions at all Well alright, we're always alright 
We're alright, we're always alright 
We're alright, we're always alright, alright, ready alright
