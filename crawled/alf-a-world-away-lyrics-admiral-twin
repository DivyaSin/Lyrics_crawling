You don't have to say you need me 
We've been down that road before 
Need always leads to trust, you know 
And trust is a game we don't play well And you don't have to say you want me 
Wanting makes you weak and pale 
Blink once if you want to be near me 
Twice if you'd rather I live in Hell I would beg you not to leave me but you're here 
I would tell you to walk out on me today 
But you're half a world away You don't have to say you forgive me 
I don't wanna make you a liar 
You've said it so many times before 
Thus quoth the raven nevermore And you don't have to say you love me 
That's a fire you've come to hate 
It used to warm your throat like wine 
But now you're burning my valentines I would beg you not to leave me but you're here 
I would tell you to walk out on me today 
But you're half a world away Oh, you're half a world 
You're half a world away 
Oh, you're half a world 
You're half a world away I would beg you not to leave me but you're still here 
I would tell you to walk out on me today 
But you're half a world away Oh, you're half a world 
You're half a world away 
Oh, you're half a world 
You're half a world away
