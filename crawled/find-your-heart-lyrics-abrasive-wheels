Our world is cut to pieces 
We are endangered species 
All this fighting, this warring, this constant friction 
We fight for so called order 
We send our sons and daughters 
All this bloodshed, this hatred, this fucking slaughter But there must be a way 
We can live without hate 
We don't have to fight for everything we've got 
Is this the price you want to pay They feed us propaganda 
Disguise the real agenda 
It's all about money, the arms deals, the oil you greed for 
It's time for all religions 
To live without division 
It's our choice, hear out voice, scream until they listen But there must be a way 
We can live without hate 
We don't have to fight for everything we've got 
Is this the price you want to pay 
Don't let the system tear us apart 
Open your eyes and you'll find your heart 
Be part of the cure and not the disease 
'cause how can you bleed if you ain't got a heart But there must be a way 
We can live without hate 
We don't have to fight for everything we've got 
Is this the price you want to pay Lay down your guns (lay down your lives) 
Lay down your bombs (lay down your pride) 
Lay down your arms (lay down for your country) 
Lay down your guns (lay down and die) But there must be a way 
We can live without hate 
We don't have to fight for everything we've got 
Is this the price you want to pay 
Don't let religions tear us apart 
Open your eyes and you'll find your heart 
Be part of the cure and not the disease 
'cause how can you bleed if you ain't got a heart
