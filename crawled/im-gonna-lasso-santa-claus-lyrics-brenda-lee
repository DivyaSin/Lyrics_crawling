I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus 
And I know just why because 
I'm gonna pull, pull, pull, on his beard 
Pull, pull, to see if it's real I'm gonna tick, tick, tickle him on the tummy 
Because he laughs so funny 
He's so jolly and so fine 
When he comes around on Christmas time I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus 
And the reason is because 
I know a boy and girl he never goes see 
He never brings 'em toys like he does for me I'm gonna pop, pop Santa Claus 
With my water pistol gun 
And then I'll take his bags of toys and run 
And bring to all the kids who don't have none I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus 
And I know just why because
