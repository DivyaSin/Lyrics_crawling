The girl works at the store, sweet Jane St. Clair 
Was dazzled by her smile while I shopped there 
It wasn't long before I lived with her 
I sang her songs while she dyed my hair Jane, divided, but I can't decide which side I'm on 
Jane decided only cowards stay, while traitors run 
Jane, Jane I'd bring her gold and frankincense and myrrh 
She thought that I was making fun of her 
She made me feel I was fourteen again 
That's why she thinks it's cooler if we'd just stay friends (she thinks it's cooler being) Jane doesn't think a man could ever be faithful 
Jane isn't giving me a chance to be shameful 
Jane, Jane I wrote a letter, she should have got it yesterday 
That life could be better by being together 
Is what I cannot explain to Jane The girl works at the store, sweet Jane St. Clair (still dazzled by her smile while I shop there) 
Still dazzled by her smile while I shoplift there (the girl works at the store, sweet Jane St. Clair) 
No promises as vague as Heaven (no promises as vague as Heaven) 
No Juliana next to my Evan (no Juliana next to) Jane, desired by the people at her school and work 
Jane is tired, 'cause every man becomes a lovesick jerk 
Jane, Jane (come on)
