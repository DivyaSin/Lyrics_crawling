Pretty, if the sun won't shine 
I'll be coming out to meet you 
I'll be there to make you mine Pretty, if the rain will pour 
I'll be knocking at your window 
I'll be begging you for more It is as if you've come along too soon 
And I'm trying to fit you in 
But I can't seem to find the room Cutie, if it all falls through 
We can piece it back together 
I can learn to trust you too You're just too good to lose 
And I can't refuse 
So don't make me choose 
Between the two I'm fed up in here 
In my atmosphere 
Don't you know who you are 
You're my shooting star Pretty, teach me wrong from right 
'Cause in love there are no answers 
And in life there is no lie Pretty, if the sun won't shine 
Now you've come this far to meet me 
And I know, I know you're mine You're just too good to lose 
And I can't refuse 
So don't make me choose 
Between the two I'm fed up in here 
In my atmosphere 
Don't you know who you are 
You're my shooting star Don't you know who you are 
You're my shooting star
