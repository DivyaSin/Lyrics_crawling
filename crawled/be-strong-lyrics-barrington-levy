Oh, na, na, na I've tried my best, never to stop love you 
Be there for you, oh 
You make my life so miserable 
Jealousy and problems, coming to our lives We've been together for so long 
And we have been through so much Try to do right 
But everything I do, seems to go wrong 
If I didn't love you baby 
I'll be long gone 
I need you now, I need you to be strong 
Be strong, be strong, be strong Oh, na, na, na Every time I go out, she always accuse me 
Smelling me and telling me, who's perfume is that 
Why don't you trust me, you know I'm faithful 
I only looking at other girl, but babes I don't touch We've been together for so long 
And we've been through so much Try to do right 
But everything I do, seems to go wrong 
If I didn't love you baby 
I'll be long gone 
I need you now, I need you to be strong 
Be strong, be strong, be strong Oh, na, na, na We've been together for so long 
And we've been through so much Try to do right 
But everything I do, seems to go wrong 
If I didn't love you baby 
I'll be long gone 
I need you now, I need you to be strong 
Be strong, be strong, be strong Oh, na, na, na 
Be strong, be strong, be strong
