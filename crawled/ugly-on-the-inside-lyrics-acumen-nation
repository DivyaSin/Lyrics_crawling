maybe you'll find me saying a prayer for you 
and maybe you'll find me saying a prayer for you 
because you know you cant believe 
what your daddy says what's right for her 
'cause you you know your mamas lying 
every time she says this hurts him more than you 
and you're beauty and your money will not matter here 
because you cant buy trust 
and you cant seduce fate 
and you cant steal love 
and you damn well cant buy me to rip the caster from the mold 
to see it cracking in the cold 
to hear it screaming in the fire
