Say hello to a week of feeling better 
Say goodbye to all of the things that you couldn't bare 
And I will lie and see where this will take me now 
So I will turn off, turn off my phone 
To be alone Hello hello and I can't believe that I found more 
More than I bargained for 
More than I bargained for I never thought that for a moment that I could believe 
There is a better way out for me 
Yet the best thing about this 
Is that there's nothing to breathe down my neck 
While I'm trying trying, to figure my head out 
I'm trying trying to Hello hello and I can't believe that I found more 
More than I bargained for 
More than I bargained for
