Last Friday night down at the road house 
Booth in the back, they sat alone 
Holding hands like two young lovers 
Her hair was grey, his hair was gone 
She said to him "I'm getting older 
A pretty girl, no more to be 
Heaven knows I'm not a treasure" 
He softly said "You are to me" 
"You are to me a girl in spring time 
The one I met so long ago 
A moment captured for a lifetime 
That's what I see you are to me" 
He said to her "My work is done now 
And all that's left are memories 
Heaven knows, I'm not important" 
She softly said "You are to me" 
"You are to me a boy in spring time 
The one I met so long ago 
A moment captured for a lifetime 
That's what I see you are to me
