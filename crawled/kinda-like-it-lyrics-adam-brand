Don't know what it is but I kinda like it 
Maybe it's love 
Maybe it's not 
Don't know what it is but I kinda like it 
Kinda like it a lot She slid across the front seat 
Unlocked the door for me 
She was waiting in the car 
I couldn't wait to get in 
First night going so right 
Put her pretty little hand in mine 
All I knew it felt so good 
What I was feeling right then Drove down to golf links road 
Pulled out on the 18th hole 
Slow danced on the green grass 
Stole a little kiss 
Closed her eyes and held me tight 
Felt the wheels spinning in my mind 
When I kissed her again she said, I could get used to this Little more than I want to 
Little more than I should 
Little more than I ought to 
But damn it feels so good 
Oh damn you feel so good
