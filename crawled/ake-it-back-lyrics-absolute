Ladies 
Take It Back Back Back Back Back Back 
(Repeat) Take ya money back 
Take ya Pussi back 
Take everythang from ya man back 
Take it Back 
Take ya car from him 
Make him walk again 
Let his shoes run over to the side 
What he bought for you 
You can keep that too 
Or pawn it for a quick lil flow 
His cell phone that you keeping on 
Let the shyt get cut off Chorus Take it back 
No matter what the ni99a say 
No matta what games he play

Thats when enough is enough 
He must got life in a blender 
He phucked up Chorus
