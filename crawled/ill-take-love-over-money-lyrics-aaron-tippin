Have I got the deal for you 
Would you like to have a T-bone steak and lobster 
Served on the finest china 
Accompanied by a bottle of the world's greatest wine 
Served in a crystal glass, alone Or, would you rather have a Big Mac 
An order of fries, a cherry pie 
Underneath a big oak tree 
Sitting on a blanket 
Snuggled up to the one you love I'll take love over money 
Forget the green, give me honey 
Some people work, work, work their lives away 
But I'll take love over money any day Okay, check this out 
You're on the streets of Paris 
Standing right underneath the Eiffel Tower 
Surrounded by all the magical things 
The city of romance has to offer, but you're all alone Or, would you rather be at the state fair 
Standing in line for the Tilt-A-Whirl 
Eating cotton candy, mmm, that's good 
Drinking a Dr. Pepper and stealing a kiss 
From the one you love I'll take love over money 
Forget the green, give me honey 
Some people work, work, work their lives away 
But I'll take love over money any day Okay, now think about this 
There it sits, a low, flowing, red, slick 
Candy apple, rocking sled of a Ferrari 
Price tag $205 and some change 
But no one and I mean absolutely no one 
Will ever be in the passenger seat with you Or, would you rather have a 1989 
Mud gray, 150 extended cab with four-wheel drive 
And sitting right next to you as close as the law will allow 
Chewing bubble gum, singing in your ear 
Along with Lynyrd Skynyrd, is the one you love Yeah, I'll take love over money 
Forget the green, give me honey, honey 
Some people work, work, work their lives away 
But I'll take love over money any day Yeah, love over money 
Forget the green, give me honey 
Some people work, work, work their lives away 
But I'll take love over money any day
