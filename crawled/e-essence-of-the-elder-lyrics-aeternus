leaving the dismay of the world behind traveling in the essence of chaos a journey beyond death time and matter dissolving about me your blood pulses with a thousand years of existence flows through my veins standing proud before those who's ageless blood their spiraling souls empower me visions of chaos illuminating the shadows of old as endless links weaved each thread providing a spectrum of lives into a web of existence a union of blood, a union of souls an endless bond sworn and upheld over the fields you bled red i walk with you through fires that finally devoured you through your dreams and your nightmares as eagles we fly as wolves we run as your blood and honor flow through me so will i honor you through incarnations of strength leaving the dismay of the world behind eternally traveling in the essence of time a journey beyond death time and matter dissolving about me
