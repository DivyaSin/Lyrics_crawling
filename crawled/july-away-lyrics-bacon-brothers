WRITTEN BY MICHAEL BACON Sweet July's not welcomed here 
Here the trees are green all year 
They don't need her summer's glow 
In this land of ice and snow 
Lakes of steel frozen flat 
July comes and changes that 
Smashing with her warm sun rays 
Tilts the docks and heaves the highways Chorus 
July you're a young girl 
July It's an old world 
My heart races when I see you nearing 
But I know I'll soon be hearing 
The sad songs the mad songs 
The everything is bad songs 
Won't you fly away 
July away I once had a girl so fair 
With eyes of blue and golden hair 
Don't know why she let me go 
To this land of ice and snow
