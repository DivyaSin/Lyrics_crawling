He wanted someone who loves the land as much as he does 
Someone who knows the blessin' of a good hard rain 
Somebody simple and strong that he knows he can count on 
Soft as the wind, you're bold enough to bless his name That's why God loves cowboys 
I believe there's a place in his heart 
'Cause when the herd needs tendin' 
The fences needs mendin' 
He knows they'll work hard 
On his great big ranch called life 
'Cause they love and take care of all it's creations 
From the horses they ride 
To those broken hardened honky tonk angels 
Ooh that's why God loves cowboys He knew they'd need room to breathe and freedom 
So he gave em' Texas and those big Montana skies 
He was there when he heard those prayers 
Coming from shying 
Right beside that young man on his last ride That's why God loves cowboys 
I believe there's a place in his heart 
'Cause when the herd needs tendin' 
The fences needs mendin' 
He knows they'll work hard 
On his great big ranch called life 
'Cause they love and take care of all it's creations 
From the horses they ride 
To those broken hardened honky tonk angels 
Ooh that's why God loves cowboys Ooh those cold nights get lonely 
He needs more than just a good fire keeping him warm 
Ooh there's nothing more holy 
Than a love of a woman weather life storm That's why God loves cowgirls 
I believe there's a place in his heart 
'Cause when the herd needs tendin' 
And the fences needs mendin' 
He knows they'll work hard 
On his great big ranch called life 
'Cause they love and take care of all it's creations 
From the horses they ride 
To those broken hardened honky tonk heroes 
Ooh, that's why God loves cowgirls 
Ooh, that's why God loves cowboys
