This following program is dedicated to the city and people of 
San Francisco, who may not know it but they are beautiful and so 
Is their city this is a very personal song, so if the viewer 
Cannot understand it particularly those of you who are European 
Residents save up all your bread and fly trans love airways to 
San Francisco U.S.A., then maybe you'll understand the song, it 
Will be worth it, if not for the sake of this song but for the 
Sake of your own peace of mind. Strobe lights beam create dreams 
Walls move minds to do 
On a warm San Francisco night 
Old child young child feel alright 
On a warm San Francisco night 
Angels sing leather wings 
Jeans of blue Harley Davidsons too 
On a warm San Francisco night 
Old angels young angels feel alright 
On a warm San Francisco night. I wasn't born there perhaps I'll die there 
There's no place left to go, San Francisco. Cop's face is filled with hate 
Heavens above he's on a street called love 
When will they even learn 
Old cop young cop feel alright 
On a warm San Francisco night 
The children are cool 
They don't raise fools 
It's an American dream 
Includes Indians too.
