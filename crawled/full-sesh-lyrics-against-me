Do you bite your tongue, when you hear them say? 
Do you bite your tongue, and wait for your chance? 
Do you bite your tongue, and push thought from mind? 
Focus is locked, attention is fixed. Do you want to battle with, me? (x3) 
You cannot match determination, like, this. Do you bide your time, so patiently? 
Do you bide your time, and wait for your chance? 
Do you bide your time, and keep intent, hidden? 
And when the strike comes it's gonna be deadly. Do you want to battle with me? (x3) 
Like a whore plotting revenge, on the trick.
