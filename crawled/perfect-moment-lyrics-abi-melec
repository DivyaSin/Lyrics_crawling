Here with you just breathing heaven 
Caressing twilight in your eyes 
And the moments kiss in still framed bliss. 
Here with you I don't want to miss 
A single dream in the starlight mist now 
It's the perfect moment. We are angels in the shadows 
Leaving heaven innocently 
We are falling deeper in this 
Paradise of all these moments.
