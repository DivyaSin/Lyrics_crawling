How many miles to Babylon? 
Three score and ten. 
Can I get there by candle-light? 
There and back again. 
If your feet be nimble, 
If your tread be light, 
You'll get there and back again 
All by candle-light. Daddy's gone a-soldiering 
Far across the sea. 
When will he come back again 
Back to you and me? If the winds are willing, 
If moon shines bright, 
That's when he'll come back again 
All by candle-light. Fingers at the window-pane; 
Footsteps in the wood; 
The scent of dust on summer rain; 
Shadows on the wall. While the wind calls softly, 
While the moon shines bright, 
Like a phantom there he stands 
In the candle-light. The sand is in your yellow hair; 
The sun has scorched your skin. 
Your uniform so fine and fair 
The wars have worn it thin. If your heart is willing, 
If the time is right, 
Say you'll never leave again 
Lie by me tonight. Come see there's little left of me 
But longing for my love, 
And to see the child I never saw 
I thank the stars above. Weary of the killing, 
Ravaged by the fight; 
I must go before the dawn 
Snuffs the candle light. How many miles to Babylon? 
Three score and ten. 
Can I get there by candle-light? 
There and back again. 
If your feet be nimble, 
If your tread be light, 
You'll get there and back again 
All by candle-light.
