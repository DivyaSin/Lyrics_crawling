This is a song and a clapping game 
It's so much fun to play 
You can do with a group 
You can do it by yourself 
You can do it 'most everyday Just listen now 
I got it The good thing about this clapping 
Is that the rhythm will never, never change 
But the things we're about to clap on 
May seem a little strange On your tummy now 
On your shoulders 
On your knees now 
On your hips now Here is the end of the clapping song 
It's sung in many lines 
Just to make us feel good and the very last time 
Everybody claps with your hands Here we go now 
For the last time 
Yeah
