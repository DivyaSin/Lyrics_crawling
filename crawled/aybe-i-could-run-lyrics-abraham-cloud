Maybe I Could Run There's a little man inside my head 
telling me its time I get ahead 
Says that I've been missing the good things 
that life has to give Better buckle down, dress for success get a better job behind a desk Time to stop your dreaming and find some secure little nest Maybe its a fact that a poor boy is under the gun......... but Maybe I could run Maybe I could Run from the feeling that there's nowhere left to run Look at all the cars passing me by , Windows full of kids , out for a ride , People with a mission in life and the courage to lie 
God I'm all alone here on the fence, First I'm turning right , then to the left , in camouflage they cage you with sweet smells of boundless success Maybe i could Run, Maybe I could Run Maybe I could run from the feeling that there's nowhere left to run and I'll hide from what I must do and hope that it all gets done Here within my humble home I can't relax my thoughts will roam, I know I'm here too much alone but danger waits outside I'm told and aren't we all just passing time ? you paint I write , we'll be denied our choices . chance , achievement fate , awaiting judgment (the part I hate . to risk , to try to fall and fail . Too Much too soon will be the nail , driven through this precious flesh , I hope I haven't said too much 'cause it can and will be used against any man who takes the test to find that there's no other side , there's only time until you die ...... could i be wrong to believe in the sun ? I'd rather run , I'd rather run, Maybe i could Run, Maybe I could Run Maybe I could run from the feeling that there's nowhere left to run
