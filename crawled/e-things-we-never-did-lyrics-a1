You and me 
We sit and talk of friendship then I ask 
If you can see 
If we could be together forever I see the light die in your eyes 
Because you're scared you'll hurt 
So you don't want to try [Chorus] 
Well take a chance and come home with me 
You could stay for eternity 
If you try then at least you'll see 
Then you'll never regret the things we never did You turn to me 
I see your eyes 
And somehow they cease to shine 
You smile at me 
Yet I can see 
You don't think we can make it You see the light die in my eyes 
Because I'm scared to lose you 
I wish you would try [Chorus] I see the light die in your eyes 
Because you're scared you'll hurt 
So you don't want to try [Chorus] You'll never 
You'll never regret the things we never did The things we never did
