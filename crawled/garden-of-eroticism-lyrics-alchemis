Through the abundant life. 
Your ability release my infidelity. 
Swollen ovaries of temptation. 
Shall I dare submerge my self with this obsession? 
Trapped by lust, nudity an obscenity. 
Shading its darkness with light. 
Fooled I am drawn toward the gates of jade. 
Garden gates forever trap me. 
Forever to tend her fields. 
Rewarded with the fruits of life. 
Take another bite. Fate seizes me. 
I am punished by my loyalty to her desire. 
Garden of eroticism. hemaphrodelia. 
Punished by my loyalty to her Salacrophobia - tetostrodelia
