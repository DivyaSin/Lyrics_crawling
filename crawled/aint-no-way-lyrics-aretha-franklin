Ain't no way for me to love you 
If you won't let me 
It ain't no way 
For me to give you all you need 
If you won't let me give all of me I know that a woman's duty 
Is to help and love a man 
And that's the way it was for them 
Oh but how can I, how can I, how can I 
Give you all the things I can 
If you're tying both of my hands Oh it ain't no way (ain't no way) 
It ain't no way (ain't no way) 
It just ain't no way baby (ain't no way) 
Ain't no way baby 
It ain't no way for me to love you 
If you won't let me Stop trying to be 
Someone you're not 
How come it's true there's a man 
Who payed too much for what he got 
And if you need me like you say, say you do 
Oh then, then, then don't you know that I need you Oh, it ain't no way 
I tell you that it ain't no way 
It ain't no way, it ain't no way baby, no 
It just ain't no way 
It sho' ain't no way 
It ain't no way for me to love you 
If you won't let me No way, if you won't let me 
Ain't no way
