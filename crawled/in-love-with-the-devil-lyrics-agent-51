This one's for the girl who's always spending. 
This one's for the girl who never showed up to her wedding. 
6,000 miles away my heart is mending. 
I rolled this dice, I payed the price and that's my happy ending. [Chorus:] 
I've been waiting for so long, 
doctor tell me what went wrong, 
as the dating, always waiting, once again, 
and doctor said "You're in love with the devil." 
I'm in love with the devil, 
You're in love with the devil, 
I'm in love with the devil, 
I believe she's a devil, 
You're in love with the devil. 
You're the devil's go. Today I made a breakfast in bed. 
She smiled at me then she showed to me the 2 horns on her head. 
I'd kiss her but she's hot to the touch. 
I'd phone her but a call to tell just cost too damn much. [Chorus] 2 horns, big smile, red lips, she's hipnotized with you again!!!!! [Chorus]
