Take me in your arms and never let me go 
Whisper to me softly while the moon is low 
Hold me close and tell me what I wanna know 
Say it to me gently, let the sweet talk flow 
Come a little closer, make love to me Kiss me once again before we say goodnight 
Take me in your lovin' arms and squeeze me tight 
Put me in a mood so I can dream all night 
Everybody's sleepin' so it's quite all right 
Come a little closer, make love to me When your near, so help me, dear 
Chills run up my spine 
Don't you know, I love you so 
I won't be happy till your mine When I'm in your arms you give my heart a treat 
Everything about you is so doggone sweet 
Every time we kiss you make my life complete 
Baby doll, ya know ya swept me off my feet 
Now's the time to tell you, make love to me 
Now's the time to tell you,"Hey Baby" make love to me
