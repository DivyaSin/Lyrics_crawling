Her name was Lola 
She was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair 
And her dress cut down to there She would merengue 
And do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar Across the crowded floor 
They worked from 8 'til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? At the copa 
Copacabana 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) At the copa 
Copacabana 
Music and passion were always the fashion 
At the copa 
They fell in love His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, 
He saw Lola dancing there And when she finished, 
He called her over 
But Rico went a bit too far, 
Tony sailed across the bar And then the punches flew 
And chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gunshot 
But just who shot who? At the copa 
Copacabana 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) At the copa 
Copacabana 
Music and passion were always the fashion 
At the copa 
She lost her love (instrumental) Her name is Lola 
She was a showgirl 
But that was 30 years ago 
When they used to have a show Now it's a disco 
But not for Lola 
Still in the dress she used to wear 
Faded feathers in her hair She sits there so refined 
And drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind At the copa 
Copacabana 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) At the copa 
Copacabana 
Music and passion were always the fashion 
At the copa 
Don't fall in love COPACABANA!
