If you knew, what you do 
When no one's in the dark room 
But me and you 
A brilliant disguise It's the taste of the chase 
I do confess, it's the mess 
That feels so right [Chorus:] 
Come on a Monday 
Come on a Tuesday 
They'll never know 
Pop off a cork for Wednesday 
Play with me Thursday 
But you'll always be his girl Come on a Monday 
Come on a Tuesday 
They'll never know 
Pop off a cork for Wednesday 
Stay with me Thursday 
But you'll always be his girl 
His girl Friday, his girl Friday, his girl Friday 
His girl Friday, his girl Friday, his girl Friday Just a kiss, he won't miss 
I know your gonna miss this 
As long as you live 
When you were mine Bite your lip, pull me in 
It's not the sin, it's the mess 
That feels so right [Chorus:] If you knew, what I knew 
You'd think that it's Friday 
As I look, all of you [Chorus:]
