Just how far does the universe go 
Does it ever end, you say you want to know 
Just how high can you count 
Before the numbers all runs out Who built the Pyramids 
Do aliens exist 
Where does God come from 
One more phenomenon 
But if you know how strong my love is 
And your heart and mind can comprehend 
Just how long I'm gonna feel like this 
Then you'll know what infinity is 
Then you'll know They say that time goes on and on 
Even after we're long gone 
And there's a black hole up in space 
That pulls so strong, light can't escape They'll find the answers to all those mysteries 
But they won't understand what's between you and me
