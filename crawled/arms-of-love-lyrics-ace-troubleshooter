Night and Day I have called out Your Name 
Trying to find my way back to Your heart 
I've been searching in vain 
'cause all I need to do is to silently listen for You 
To hear Your gentle voice calling me back to You 
Between the gray and the blue And now I'm standing on Your holy ground 
'cause at Your feet I have laid my whole life down And now I'm in Your precious arms of love 
Nothing can ever separate me from the Father above It doesn't take much rain for my heart to get filled with pain 
But Lord, You're watching over me 
I see I've worried in vain 'cause You've taken my shame away
