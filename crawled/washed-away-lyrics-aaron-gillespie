Let your water rise 
Till were drowning here in you 
Capsize us in the tide of your grace So let your spirit soar 
Like a banner over us 
Please God of love come to this place Draw us close, closer than before 
There's nothing else we want more Just to see your face 
And to feel your embrace 
Wrap us with your love and mercy; come fill us cause were so thirsty 
For your touch God we need you so much 
Let your glory fall like rain; till were washed, washed away Let your music play 
We wanna dace with you 
There's nothing like your song over us So let your children sing 
We join the melody 
And with all of heaven we cry out You are only Lord God Almighty 
We are desperate, we are so hungry Just to see your face 
And to feel your embrace 
Wrap us with your love and mercy; come fill us cause were so thirsty 
For your touch, God we need you so much 
Let your glory fall like rain; till were washed, washed away Holy holy lord God almighty 
You were you are and you are to come 
Holy holy lord God almighty 
You were you are now we come Just to see your face 
And to feel your embrace 
Wrap us with your love and mercy; come fill us cause were so thirsty 
For your touch, God we need you so much 
Let your glory fall like rain; till were washed, washed away You Jesus are washed away, Yeah You are washed away, Yeah You are washed away
