I knew the weather was supposed to turn gray 
But i didn't know it'd never go away 
Until i answered when my telephone rang 
Bad days coming my way 
'cause i heard my baby saying 
She's gonna be leaving me 
Bad days must be on my tracks 
'cause i heard my baby saying 
She won't be coming back 
Bad days 
Followed by those awful nights I could've told you she was tired of my ways 
I had no more surprises up my sleeve 
But when she went away it sure surprised me, oh 
Bad days must be on my back 
'cause i sense my baby's never 
She's never coming back 
Bad days must be here to stay 
'cause it seems so long since she 
Since she went away 
Bad days 
And always those awful nights So this morning when i slept so late 
I couldn't move beneath the heavy weight 
I heard somebody at my backyard gate, oh 
There she was coming through the haze saying 
"hold me, baby, and i hope i'm not too late" 
Bad days are never coming again 
Because i heard my baby say she's 
She's never leaving me 
Happy days 
And no more of those awful nights
