Nights fly away 
Just for moment get me up 
Easy girls turn to grey 
In their heaven's there's no God 
Walking down empty road 
Don't remember who you are 
Oh, an ordinary queen 
Just have to find the way to home 
Let me lose the dream 
Just have to find my steps alone 
To go home 
Fly home! 
Night's jelly-fish 
Turns her starless face away 
Through the deadblack polish 
Appears the blood of bornin' day 
So I may see the land 
Embark today on silver shell 
I take no stock in dreams 
Two purple eagles draw the boat 
Over every sea 
An' all my members want to love 
All I want 
I want 
Lead me into love 
Cool fire 
Lead me over God 
Love-spire 
Walking over me 
On highway 
Over every sea 
I'll learn to love 
(Walking down empty road 
Don't remember who you are) 
Need neither nights 
Nor the sirens' nighty-mesh 
Nowhere place and no time 
In the cities of the flesh 
To hide away as the touch 
Just behind a secret's back 
You, ordinary queen 
My island is your pure face 
Carnal sirens scream 
But all my members interlace 
With you 
This is true 
Over every sea 
By eagles 
Walking on the sea 
Like Peter 
Ordinary queen 
No siren 
Ordinary queen 
She spoke to me
