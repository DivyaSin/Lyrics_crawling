Another Day Comes Due 
When I Look Back Into 
All That I Didn't Do And When The Night Is Through 
Its When My Eyes Turn Blue 
And Rain Down 
And Look To You And What You Have For Me 
You've Got To Believe Theres Something More 
In Just This Life Of Uncertainty 
Opportunity is Knocking At My Door (Chorus) 
And I Dont Know Where To Go 
All I Know 
Is You're Takin Me 
And Im Following Your Lead 
I Dont Know Where The Road 
Is Gonna Go 
Or So Im Told 
You Are Takin It With Me I Wondered What Was True 
I've Questioned All I Do 
Because Of You 
I Thought Im Through 
With Innocence Miles Away 
Im Taking Day By Day 
Finding Strength 
In All You Say The Love I Found So Strong 
The People Around Me Like My Mom 
Im Finding Passage Through This Maze 
And Im Finally Seein Better Days (chorus)1x Your Takin It With Me 
I Am Following Your Lead 
Your Takin It with Me 
And I Will Go There With You Too (chorus)1x All I Want Is To Follow You 
And Walk With You 
In Love With You 
Ill Go There With You Too All I Want Is To Follow You 
And Walk With You 
In Love With You 
Ill Go There With You Too
