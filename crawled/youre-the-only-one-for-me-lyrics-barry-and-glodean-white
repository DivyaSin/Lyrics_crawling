"You're The Only One For Me" Lyrics 
Barry & Glodean White You're that face, you're that smile, you're that once in awhile 
You're the only one (the only one for me) 
Your eyes, your hair, I would you anywhere 
You're the only one for me (the only one for me) 
You are like no one else, in a class by yourself 
You're the only one (the only one for me) 
I can feel it in my heart, even though we're far apart 
You're the only one (the only one) You're my make believe, yeah 
You're my wildest dreams come true 
You're my fantasies 
I never thought I'd find you 
The elements are right 
It's gonna take us forever and ever 
So let's start tonight 
I just want to be with you Your eyes, your hair, I would know you anywhere 
You're the only one (the only one for me) 
I can feel in my heart, even though we're far apart 
You're the only one for me (the only one for me) 
And you're like no one else, in a class by yourself 
You're the only one (the only one for me) 
You're that face, you're that smile, you're that once in awhile 
You're the only one (the only one) We'll take the stars, yeah 
And caress the heavens 
Passions of love 
We're gonna feel it together 
The elements are right 
It's gonna take us forever 
So, let's start tonight 
I just want to be with you You are like no one else, in a class by yourself 
You're the only one (the only one) 
Your eyes, your hair, I would know you anywhere 
You're the only one for me (the only one for me) 
You're that face, you're that smile, you're that once in awhile 
You're the only one (the only one) 
I can feel in my heart, even though we're far apart 
You're the only one (the only one) I just want to be with you You're that face, you're that smile, you're that once in awhile 
You're the only one for me 
Your eyes, your hair, I would know you anywhere 
You're the only one for me 
You are like no one else, in a class by yourself 
You're the only one (the only one) Repeat chorus until end
