Tell me what I got to do so I can make it alright 
Tell me what I got to do so I can sleep through the night 
I need a change just to get you out my head 
And I feel so strange like a part of me is fucking dead 
So let me be, let me breathe 
I just need this to end 
I don't need you, don't need them 
I don't need a friend 
I need a break I need some space I just need to be alone 
I need to take some time so I can think all on my own 
I should of known about the things you did behind my back 
I saw some flaws in what you said but I didn't ask 
I let it go until this day it's something I regret 
The time will pass the pain will ease but I won't forget Chorus 
It once was ours but now it's all mine 
I took it too far laid it all on the line 
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you 
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you 
It once was ours but now it's all mine 
I took it too far laid it all on the line 
Say this is my song 
This is my song! 
Say this is my song 
This is my song! My brains scattered, broken flowin over hopes that I held inside 
Scripted every lyric for the appearance of a selfless crime 
Simplify the cadence like nursery rhymes you can follow 
Kept all the receipts so you can return the time that you borrowed 
I want every minute, every second of every fucking moment reimbursed 
And I noticed you're feeling worse 
And it's only what you deserve, I'm over getting deserted 
I rolled it flipped it reversed it cuz I'm a totally different person 
You told me it wasn't working I insisted you should listen 
So much for being perfect now I'm cursing all your kisses 
Should of ran up in your purse and boosted all your fucking lipstick 
To take back every shade of all of the colors of love that I'm missing 
Withdrawals are one of the symptoms of a bitch 
With an addiction for a dude getting abused 
Now I'm confused like who's the victim 
This fairy tale won't end like it started, oh so magically 
Cuz I know that she can't live happily ever after me It once was ours but now it's all mine 
I took it too far laid it all on the line 
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you 
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you 
It once was ours but now it's all mine 
I took it too far laid it all on the line 
Say this is my song 
This is my song! 
Say this is my song 
This is my song! It's got you running, yeah, running away 
It's got you flipping out when you hear it play 
It's just the feeling man it brings it all back 
You fucking pussy, just be a man gotta take it back, Yeah 
You feel the bass line, hear the kicks and dirty synth 
You aint sharing this with nobody am I making sense 
This is the turn around this is that revival shit 
Put it in your mother fucking throat spit it, fuck that bitch! 
Ahh it feels better don't it, you get it want it 
You get it grab it got it go, now go ahead and flaunt it 
Cuz aint nobody gonna take this away 
This is epitome of living free and it's here to stay 
It once was lost in the bind that we held 
Then my whole fucking world came and went to hell 
It once was him and her and he and she 
Wanna hear the whole world come and say it with me It once was ours but now it's all mine 
I took it too far laid it all on the line 
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you 
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you 
It once was ours but now it's all mine 
I took it too far laid it all on the line 
Say this is my song 
This is my song! 
Say this is my song 
This is my song!
