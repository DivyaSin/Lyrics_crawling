Tugs 
From your straining lungs 
Under the sweating sun 
as you're puddle leaping dodging though the rush Crushed 
Under a leaden chest 
Trying to catch what's left 
of the breath that's slipping, tearing through your flesh Taking the good that's left 
Using the flame you get 
Feeling the weight of it There's hope in the shambles 
There's hope in the shambles 
There's hope... Stuck 
Swallowed into space 
Trying to find your faith 
As it shivers with the stormy break and Drained 
From your freezing toes 
To your empty soul 
Finding warmth is now bereft to the open Feeling the sunlights grace 
Soaking into your face 
Taking it day by day There's hope in the shambles 
There's hope in the shambles 
There's hope in the broken 
There's hope against all hope 
There's hope...
