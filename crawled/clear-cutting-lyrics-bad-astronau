Started breaking some of the rules, then you broke them all 
I know that thers's a way in your head, you can't win them all 
And I can't take this all to bed, just as you expected 
Your self-fulfilled prophecy's already leading to the next 
Tree to climb up from the depths 
You reach the top, you're done with him 
It sounds familiar, it's all been done 
Now I see you around around the bends 
I'm not to sure you still have it 
Another old insult for me signed personal friend
