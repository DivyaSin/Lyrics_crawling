Yeah 
Sometimes, i just wanna fly away. 
They say i can't. 
I can't skate, i can't surf. I ain't from the streets the beach is my turf. 
I can't sing, wish i could write the words but i can't think i'm addicted off the herbs. 
I can't remember the last time i seen ya. I hope it went well cause i can be a piece of work. 
I can't promise if i be a jerk. I think i get it from my momma. 
Imma... 
I wanna do better at least let me try. I wanna be your new sweater when the Summer dies. I wanna fly and you can be my Lois Lane. When they tell me i can't, i tell them I can. 
I can be a love that fills ya. I can be a drug that heals ya. I may not be superhuman but i can be your superhero. i ca- i could be your superhero. I ca- i could be your superhero. I may not be superhuman but i can be your superhero. Hero. 
I can't type. i can't dance. I can't fight unless you messin' with my fam'. 
I can't lose but it's like i can't win when you lookin at me starin like i did it again. 
I can't remember the last time i seen ya. I hope it went well but i'm a believer. I can't promise i won't leave in the caddy. I peace when it's tough i think i get it from my daddy.
