My veins begin to freeze 
as I adapt to cryogenic sleep 
slowly losing consciousness 
in the grasp of high-technology I'm falling through the scrying window 
spinning through a spheric world 
confluent, psychedelic 
flashing visions clear Holographic, schematic 
molecular, reversal 
transmutation, acceleration 
access access access to myself I am on a journey 
through the sanctum of myself 
I am searching 
for the secrets of my soul 
I am experiencing 
the depths of my mind 
I'll find entrance to inner dominion I chase myself through the maze 
just to find what's in it 
facing the mirror of emotions 
the spectrum of my spirit Revive memories, impale oblivion 
I am present, in my own mind Seconds freeze, vacuum time 
reality denied 
collapsing mind, trapped inside 
forever I will die? I am running mindless through the maze 
as I face the entrance to the gate 
behind the gate there's just another maze 
this is eternity, I am forced to face 
I see the image of my spirit spectrum 
every color has turned black or grey 
there are no limits to how much a soul can suffer 
I will experience for an eternity
