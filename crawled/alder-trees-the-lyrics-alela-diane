I can hear the elders whispering in words so sweet and low 
The alder trees were listening to songs been sung before 
My friend and I collecting skeletons of leaves 
Making tiny piles, oh, and sifting through the weeds Wind blows the tiny green, tiny green 
Wind blows the tiny green, helicopter seeds 
Wind blows the tiny green, tiny green 
Wind blows the tiny green, helicopter seeds Oh, wandering in days unfolding 
With hats fashioned of mud and snake skin 
Oh, wandering in days unfolding 
With hats fashioned of mud and snake skin 
Of mud and snake skin As I think about the ladies who weren't allowed to sing 
Sewing all their pretty rows of thread instead of singing 
And what about the black braided sisters of Mariee? 
We sat upon their grinding rock as children used to be Beneath the knotted pine, knotted pine 
Beneath the knotted pine at the garden's edge 
Beneath the knotted pine, knotted pine 
Beneath the knotted pine at the garden's edge Oh, laughing, little girls clapping 
Ghosts weaving our hair to baskets 
Oh, laughing, little girls clapping 
And ghosts weaving our hair to baskets 
Our hair to baskets I can hear the elders whispering in words so sweet and low 
The alder trees were listening to songs been sung before 
My friend and I collecting skeletons of leaves 
Making tiny piles, oh, and sifting through the weeds 
Making tiny piles, oh, and sifting through the weeds
