Remember when remember 
You and me in fields of blue and white 
And I would never take it back The stand-offs and the make-ups 
On the bench our scene for hours and hours 
And I would never take it back 
And I would never take it back for all the gold in the world On and on and on she leads me 
On and on forever, time will run back 
On and on and on she leads me 
On and on forever, time will run back 
And fetch the age of gold All that I have to hold your hand 
In mine and lose all sense of time 
And I would never take it back So close your eyes, I'll kiss you 
And I'll hold you tightly until dawn 
And I would never take it back 
And I would never take it back for all the gold in the world On and on and on she leads me 
On and on forever, time will run back 
On and on and on she leads me 
On and on forever, time will run back 
And fetch the age of gold Remember when, remember 
You and me and time On and on and on she leads me 
On and on forever, time will run back 
On and on and on she leads me 
On and on forever, time will run back 
And fetch the age of gold Time will run back and fetch the age of gold 
(Time will run back and fetch the age of gold) 
Time will run back and fetch the age of gold 
(Time will run back and fetch the age of gold) Time will run back and fetch the age of gold 
(Time will run back and fetch the age of gold) 
Time will run back and fetch the age of gold
