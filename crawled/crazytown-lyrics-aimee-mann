I guess this movie mustve opened wide 
another girl who threatens suicide 
you called the cops but then she denied every word 
and you know youll be the one whos paying the tab for her 
youre out there trying to flag a cab 
and for who? 
a girl who lives in Crazytown 
where craziness gets handed down 
Who? whoevers gonna volunteer 
will only end up living here A plot like this will always have a twist 
the girls a dream who never did exist 
just like the last one, and she enlisted a fool 
and you thought, Oh, its all fun 
when youre writing songs for her 
but now son, youll be posting bond, and for who? 
a girl who lives in Crazytown 
where craziness gets handed down 
Who? whoevers gonna volunteer 
will only end up living here and you dont want to go that route 
cause thats not what youre all about 
but you just cant seem to get out of it 
youre still out there, raising a doubt, 
and for who? 
a girl who lives in Crazytown 
where craziness gets handed down 
Who? whoevers gonna volunteer 
will only end up living here
