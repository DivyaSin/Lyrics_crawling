Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money 
Maybe we're ragged and funny 
But if you travel along 
Singing a song side by side Oh, we don't know what's coming tomorrow 
Maybe it's trouble and sorrow 
But we'll travel the road 
Sharing our load side by side Through all kinds of weather 
What if the sky should fall? 
Just as long as we're together 
It doesn't matter at all When they've all had their quarrels and parted 
We'll be the same as we started 
Just traveling along 
Singing our song side by side My sentiments exactly 
I know what you're saying 
Yes I know what you're saying We ain't, what if the sky should fall 
And well it doesn't matter at all 
I know what you're saying 
They've all had their quarrels and they've parted 
Yeah but we are the same as we started I know that's right 
Traveling along 
Singing our song 
Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money 
And we may be ragged and funny I know that's right but it makes no difference 
Because we'll be traveling along 
Always singing a song 
Singing a song, side by side Sure feels good to have a friend 
(Side by side) 
Side by side 
Through thick and thin 
And thin again Ragged and funny 
Without the money 
Without the money 
We still friends 
Friends till the end 
We still friends 
Side by side We'll be traveling 
Traveling along 
Spending all the money we ain't got 
Well I know how that is 
We always do that kind of thing anyway 
(I got a credit card) Oh, traveling along 
Oh, singing a song 
(New York, Chicago) 
New Ireland 
Los Angeles 
Paris, France 
London, England 
Greece I got Madrid, I got Madrid 
And Italy, Texas 
Yes, yes, yes
