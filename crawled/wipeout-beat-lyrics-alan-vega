I saw a Mayan, (?) 
On the other line. 
He's looking this guy 
Looking at this guy 
Tapping his feet to some, 
To some song. He looked like he couldn't see nothing 
And his eyes are so empty 
Eyes are so empty but uh, 
He hurts and I know. Yeah yeah and he, 
He got off now. 
He looked at all the people on the magic ride, he says, 
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen

And let me tell ya. 
Tell ya. I can't see nothing now, you know.

And I left my eyes 
In an American war yesterday. Oh yeah, I can hear. 
Mmm I can hear the angels in the heavens, 
Singing a hallelujah, hallelujah song for you. It's the wipeout beat
