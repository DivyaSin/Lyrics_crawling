Written by Kevin Bacon "Written from the perspective of a young man attending Woodstock '99." KB Me and Joey came a long way, to hear that singer 
Play the one that we know so well 
He got up there and gave us the finger 
Told me and Joey to go straight to hell Me and Joey in a blacktop garden 
A big old burnin' sun above 
And the fires will soon be starting 
But this ain't no summer of love Me and Joey had a good time with some farmer's daughter 
Left her lyin' in a muddy hole 
You charge an arm and a leg for a bottle of water 
Well hey, I guess that's rock and roll Me and Joey in a blacktop garden 
A big old burnin' sun above 
And the fires will soon be starting 
But this ain't no summer of love Now me and Joey's in his dad's car, overheating 
Two hundred miles I-95 
Joey's dad gives him a hell of a beatin' 
Says we was lucky just to be alive 
Someone's knockin' on the back door, momma's crying 
And my head is hurtin' mighty bad 
Tell you old man, and I ain't lyin 
Best damn time I ever had Me and Joey in a blacktop garden 
A big old burnin' sun above 
And the fires will soon be starting 
But this ain't no summer of love
