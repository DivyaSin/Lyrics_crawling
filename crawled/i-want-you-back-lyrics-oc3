Baby girl I know that you're still feeling me 
It's been a long way girl I ain't leaving you 
I know you thinking money has changed this fella 
But I ain't change I'm the same old fella 
Remember the piggy bank in the closet that I bought you 
Imma confess yes baby I stole it 
And you knew it 
You never want to blame a fella that you love, trust and you roll with 
But I'm a fly boy now let me transport you 
I'm not trying to brag I just want to love and trust you 
They say love is blind so you got me all wonder 
But I ain't Stevie Cus I like to see my girl's under 
And how she smiles when I stroke her hair back 
Girl you're my heart and I need you back 
I'm a type of guy what I say is a fact 
Yeah I know is a fact Cus I need you back It's been a minute since we last spoke baby 
know in my heart that your still my lady 
I want the good life so I move shady Another night another show I'm wavy 
When I'm alone all my thoughts drive me crazy 
wrote you a note hope you haven't replaced me I've been to new york 
Paris M.I.A 
Kingston town where the girls don't play 
ATL girls lean like A 
but the LDN's where the bad girls stay
