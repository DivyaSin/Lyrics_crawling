Search and youll define 
The sky between the lines 
I could never tell truth from victim 
Escapes a tired line 
Knock knock somethings creeping 
Laying down the land smear on the wicked 
Now if youre ready to bleed 
Turn your head turn your head 
From the right follow me 
Give chase to my shadows disarmed with a whisper 
No gun in my hand whatever happened to honor brother 
Fight me man to man look me in the eye 
I got a family a feed 
Will i learn from this what can you teach me 
Its out of control the times are crazy 
We dont care who sits on the throne 
Doesnt matter to most of us 
Just dont mess with the status quo 
Lies paint my picture everyday 
Every stones been thrown 
Lay siege to my kingdom 
My covers blown your blind dealing with death 
Every dollar a headstone 
Where the rich get richer 
The poor just multiply 
Thats smart divide and conquer 
I keep em entertained while you steal their hard earned mule 
Was there ever a time we dreamed for something better? 
Right now sounds real good 
But your telling me to wait for fairer weather Let it rain fire from the sky heaven help us (do you truly believe) 
Only the strong should survive 
With permission i make this my personal mission 
Save me from the fire Yes sir yes maam i get the picture 
We educate the masses 
Whos gonna be cooking our dinners 
Such a waste of time 
Thinking we have to raise our own sons and daughters 
When you can pay below the minimum 
Shoot that man may i follow up that order 
But all this talk dont come cheap 
We all know what has to be done 
Our very own personal revolution 
Revolution revolution revolution 
Revolution revolution revolution 
Revolution revolution revolution Let it rain fire from the sky heaven help us (do you truly believe) 
Only the strong should survive 
With permission i make this my personal mission 
Save me from the fire Now here you come walking into my part of town 
Telling people you have such a solution 
Quick fix you got a story 
Boy meets girl - stop they have kids 
Poppa works while ma raises the ten babies 
Shes praying every night that theyll one day hit the jackpot 
9 lucky numbers win the lottery a million gets me out of this hole 
But when the well dries up oh where do i go 
Little pablo doesnt even know how to read or write 
Im starving sweet ana so i can get a good price for her 
2 down 8 to go oh wait hes got good skin tone got nice smile 
An accent but kinda smells though 
So where do you think youre going talking that kind of talk 
That doesnt happen not on my watch no that doesnt happen 
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls 
Lets give em a fighting chance and see where this all goes 
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls 
If i dont do nothing lets see where this all goes 
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls 
They got front row seats dont tell me they know 
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls 
They dont need you donation what about education 
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls 
No amount of praying gonna change their woes Let it rain fire from the sky heaven help us (do you truly believe) 
Only the strong should survive 
With permission i make this my personal mission 
Save me from the fire
