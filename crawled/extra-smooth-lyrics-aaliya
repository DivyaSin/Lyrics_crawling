(so?) 
He got big brown eyes, so he look nice 
(oh) 
Coming on strong, six pack showin' 
(oh) 
He's too cool, for his own shoes 
Nothing rude, but way too short for me 
He tryin' to be 
Extra smooth, extra smooth 
Extra cool, extra cute 
If I'm supposed to talk to you 
Be your boo 
(be your boo, be your boo) 
Don't come trying to be extra smooth (so) 
He got line for line wasting my time 
Running round tryin' to catch my eye 
(eye) 
Disturbing my groove, tryin' to be smooth 
Get the boot Boy you can go ahead 
And work on yourself another quick romance 
A little too hot for me 
You act like you've already got the number Won't you quit tryin' to be? 
Extra smooth, extra smooth 
(hey?) 
Extra cool, extra cute 
(cute?) 
If I'm supposed to talk to you 
Be your boo 
(be your boo, ohh?) 
So don't come trying to be? 
Tryin' to be extra, extra, extra smooth 
(see he want to be 
See he want to be smooth) 
Extra, extra, extra cool 
(see he trying to be 
See he trying to be cool) 
I won't talk to you 
Won't be your boo 
(talk to you 
Won't be your boo) 
Extra, extra, extra 
Tryin' to be extra, extra, extra smooth Tryin' to be extra, extra, extra smooth 
(see he want to be

Extra, extra, extra cool 
(see he trying to be 
See he trying to be cool)
