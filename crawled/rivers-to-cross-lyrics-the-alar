Early one morning 
Across the fields of dawn 
Crooked is the shadow 
That falls on my land 
Storm clouds overhead 
Like birds of prey in wait 
How can we undo 
What cannot be undone 
I feel the darkness heavy 
Heavy on my heart 
There's distance between us 
Tearing us apart How many rivers must I cross? 
Somehow, somewhere I will find a way 
How many rivers must I cross? 
Somehow, somewhere I will find a way to cross I see the proud black mountain 
Beneath an angry sun 
Under drowning valleys 
Our disappearing tongue 
How many battles must we fight 
Before we start a war? 
How many wounds will open 
Before the first blood falls? 
Once the banks are broken 
Floods must surely come 
Once the land rips open 
Rivers of blood will run How many rivers must I cross? 
Somehow, Somewhere I will find a way 
How many rivers must I cross? 
Somehow, somewhere I will find a way to cross How many battles must we fight 
Before we start a war? 
How many wounds will open 
Before the first blood falls? How many rivers must I cross? 
Somehow, Somewhere I will find a way 
How many rivers must I cross? 
Somehow, somewhere I will find a way to cross
