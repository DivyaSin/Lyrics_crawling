The smiles as she walked in the room 
Have all turned into frowns am I too quick to assume 
That the love is no longer in bloom? 
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune To what they did before, her heads red raw 
And the ending doesn't sound like they're happiest around 
When you sobbed before it felt much more like the product of a squabble 
Now there's reason for it to be something more And no would be, oh, it's uncertain 
Whether the curtain has shut for good 
She says, "see if it's still raining 
I'm not dressed for it and if you loved me" 
And I interrupt to receive the scowl and stare 
But still decided to stop her there Would it be outrageous to say 
We're either shouting or we're shagging? 
Locked in tempestuous phase 
At least that's how we felt yesterday 
The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery
