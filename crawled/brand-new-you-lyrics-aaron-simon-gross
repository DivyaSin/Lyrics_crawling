I saw the cover and i judged the book, 
I turned away without a second look 
but now, now, now, 
I see a brand new you 
(you you) 
I see a brand new you I told myself I'd better run and hide 
I never noticed what was there inside, 
but now, now, now, 
I see a brand new you 
(you you) 
I see a brand new you And I can't stop myself from loving 
every 'itty 'bitty thing you do 
(Do Do) 
I see a brand new you 
(you you) I never knew that you could understand, 
But I looked up and you reached out your hand. 
And now, now, now 
I see a brand new you! I opened my eyes 
And there's a great big world around. 
I opened my eyes 
And just look, just look, 
Look at what I've found! Na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, nine, na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na 
Na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, nine, na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na 
Na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, nine, na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na 
Na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, nine, na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na 
Na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na, na 
Na-na, na, na-na, na, na-na, na, na 
Na-na, na 
Na-na, na 
Na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
Yeah! I opened my eyes 
And there's a great big world around. 
I opened my eyes 
And just look, just look, 
Look at what I've found! Ooh Ooh! 
I see a brand new you! 
Ooh! 
I see a brand new you! 
Ooh! 
I see a brand new you! (fade out)
