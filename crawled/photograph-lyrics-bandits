Picture me while I'm jumping out the window 
Picture me while I'm flying over you 
Picture me with a flower as my uhhhh-uh 
Picture me while I'm standing on the rooftop 
Picture me what do you want me to do 
Picture me a looking into you 
looking into you 
looking into you Photograph, Photograph 
I'll never be the same 
Photograph 
Just for a laugh Picture me counting raindrops on the meadow 
Picture me while I'm dancing on the moon 
Before, between and while and after noon 
Picture me telling stories to a river 
Could it be I can see although I'm blind 
Picture me getting smaller by the hour 
Slowly losing my mind (slowly losing my mind) Photograph, Photograph 
I'll never be the same 
Photograph 
Just for a laugh
