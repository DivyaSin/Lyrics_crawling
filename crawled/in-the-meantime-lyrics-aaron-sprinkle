She waits alone 
She gets tired 
As the day falls down 
She seems uninspired 
She won't wait 
Much longer 
And the tears held back 
Make her stronger In the meantime I get open eyed 
To my lowly state of mind The kindest thing 
That she's seen 
Is an open mouth 
Without a scream 
At her feet 
Like water 
The reflection there 
Is getting darker In the meantime I get open eyed 
To my lowly state of mind 
If I can't hear her 
Will I ever know 
A love that's meant to grow
