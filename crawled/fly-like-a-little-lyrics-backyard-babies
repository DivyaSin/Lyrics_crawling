Coming down on a sunset street 
I live my life with a silver needle 
Feels like I'm falling 
'Cause I'm trapped in a ball and chain Coming down with a silky steel 
The worst kick I took was when you hit my wheels 
I'm alive going down to paradise Little sister won't you follow me down 
Fly like an angel on the seven seas 
Baby, can't you see that I'm born to loose Fly like a little dove, dove, dove 
And I'm under your skin 
I wanna be your man 
Come on and show me what you can do Well, I'm lost in your arms again 
Take me home to your mamas bed 
My little sister cocaine 
Won't you come and love me Superman came and saw me chained 
I called the devil by his name 
And felt your blood in my veins 
It's what it takes to be your man 
To be your man Little sister won't you follow me down 
Fly like an angel on the seven seas 
Baby, can't you see that I'm born to loose Fly like a little dove, dove, dove 
And I'm under your skin 
I wanna be your man 
Come on and show me what you can do 
What you can Little sister won't you follow me down 
Fly like an angel on the seven seas 
Baby, can't you see that I'm born to loose Fly like a little dove, dove, dove 
And I'm under your skin 
I wanna be your man 
Come on and show me what you can do 
I wanna be your man Come on and love me 
I wanna feel you 
I wanna be your man Come feel
