Well the sky broke in two 
I found you dancing alone 
Then the room filled up with you 
And a song we both know That's when you caught me with your eyes 
Sending shivers down my spine 
And then you whispered in my ear and said 
I can feel it too 
And then you pulled me into you Tonight 
I got you where I want you 
Closer I can tell you anything 
You're the song that I sing 
Tonight 
Let the music take us over 
We'll fall into forever 
All is right 
Cause I got you where i want you 
Tonight, tonight Through all of science and history 
Well nothings ever stuck with me 
But now i'm locked on to you 
And i'm holding on to 
The only thing i know 
And now i'm never letting go Tonight 
I got you where i want you 
Closer i can tell you anything 
You're the song that i sing 
Tonight 
Let the music take us over 
We'll fall into forever 
All is right 
Cause i got you where i want you 
Tonight, tonight The whole world could fall away 
But you, and i 
No we won't be afraid Tonight 
I got you where i want you 
Closer i can tell you anything Tonight 
Let the music take us over 
We'll fall into forever 
All is right 
Cause i got you where i want you 
Tonight I got you where i want you 
Tonight
