I am not gonna sing a song without love 
Its not worth singing oh-oh 
Love is just like a song 
Its better when all the bells are heard ringing oh-oh 
Lift the music up higher 
Well form a band and a choir 
Ill sing, a song for the Lord, a song about love 
Thats what Im singing oh-oh-oh I am not gonna sing a song without hope 
Cuz people are crying oh-oh 
Hope is just like a song 
Its better when every person is trying oh-oh

Give the gifts they need I am not gonna sing a song without faith 
Cuz faith is for seeking oh-oh 
Faith is just like a song 
Its better when all of us are believing oh-oh
