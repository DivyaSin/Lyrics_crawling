louie's living with a fire in his blood 
and it burns like a mother fucker 
I've picked him up off the ground when his 
cells were down and now its getting 
tougher to stay motivated when the ends 
in sight and the world keeps draging you 
down everyday is another fight things 
aren't the same cause he's not around 
sometimes life is like a circle pit you keep 
running round and round and sometimes 
you just fall down and fall flat on the 
ground sometimes life is like a pile of shit 
but one thing that stays the same is the 
mayhem and the pain that keeps running through 
my veins I watched my friend Greg slip away 
with a bump and a bottle I watched him decay 
I could have tried to stop him yesterday now his ashes 
are floating in Biscayne Bay and I listen to the 
music we made everytime his face starts 
to fade apart of me died in the van that day 
on tour I missed his funeral by just one day
