You've got to give a little, take a little if you want to get a little lovin' 
And do all the things that make your man feel right 
And if you give a little, take a little then you're gonna get a lotta lovin' 
And you're never ever gonna have to spend another lonely night If he needs a little lovin' then hold him 
'Cause if you don't, the fires of love are gonna get a little cold and dim 
And if his day don't go your way then take it with a little smile 
After all it's the ups and downs of love that make it all worthwhile You've got to give a little, take a little if you want to get a little lovin' 
And do all the things that make your man feel right 
And if you give a little, take a little then you're gonna get a lotta lovin' 
And you're never ever gonna have to spend another lonely night Never mind the times when his feet feel the need for freedom 
Just as long as they bring him on home to you when you need him 
To show you care, you gotta be there when he laughs or when he cries 
There's no mistaking givin' and takin' is the very best part of life You've got to give a little, take a little if you want to get a little lovin' 
And do all the things that make your man feel right 
And if you give a little, take a little then you're gonna get a lotta lovin' 
And you're never ever gonna have to spend another lonely night You've got to give a little, take a little if you want to get a little lovin' 
And do all the things that make your man feel right 
And if you give a little, take a little then you're gonna get a lotta lovin'
