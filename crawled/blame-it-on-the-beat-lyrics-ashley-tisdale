Usually im miss pretty please, im nice then pray down on my knees, never get to hot or act to cold. Im the poster girl with self control. [Chorus] 
But now im making noise (like I never do) and dancing with the boys (maybe even you) As soon as my body hears that rhythm, something starts happening to my system. I'm moving my feet like the flours on fire, screaming to my girl yeah lets get wild. Setting off, a chain reaction, forgive me I cant stop dancing. Oh blame it on the beat. Oh dont blame it on me. Oh when I act crazy. Blame it on the beat. Usually im perfectly behaved, never give you reason to complain. Then I hear the pounding of this track, start to move round like a maniac. [Chorus] Blame it on the beat. Blame it on the beat. All my men is out the door, when im hear fool on the floor. Jekyll and Hyde, I turn into my other side. Dont mean to make a scene, but im at the mercy of the power of the beat. Now sit down and watch me dance, watch me dance, watch me dance. 1234 Oh blame it on the beat. Oh dont blame it on me. Oh when I act crazy. Blame it on the beat. As soon as my body hears that rhythm, something starts happening to my system. Oh blame it on the beat. Oh dont blame it on me. Oh when I act crazy. Blame it on the beat. Blame it on the beat. Blame it on the beat.
