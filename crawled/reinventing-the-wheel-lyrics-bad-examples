(chorus) 
All the time that we have lost 
Love that we have missed 
Yeah, we stole everything that we could steal 
And I never thought it would come to this 
Oooh, reinventing the wheel... 
We're together but we're apart 
Every day we're drifting farther from our heart 
But I still love you 
Pull together maybe we can pull through Chorus We're together but we're alone 
Every day we're drifting farther from our home 
But I still love you 
Pull together maybe we can pull through Chorus And the wheel goes round and round 
And the clock goes on and on 
Now it seems like we have lost our direction 
Hold me now before we lose everything All the time that we have lost 
Love that we have missed 
Yeah, we stole everything, we stole everything 
And I never thought it would come to this 
Oooh, reinventing the wheel...
