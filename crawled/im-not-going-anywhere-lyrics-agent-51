My mind is flyin' round, still pulsing from the sound, oh yeah 
Forgot to lock the gate, close the book and seal my fate, oh yeah 
Gotta get back to that one place within my mind 
Inject the vein and count to ten and die 
And just forget that I'm alive 
I'm not going anywhere 
I may look a little worse for the wear 
But I'm not going anywhere 
Didn't mean to set things back, felt the pressure made me crack, oh yeah 
The blood flow just grinds to a screeching halt 
Gimme, gimme shock treatment and first degree assault 
Why don't you tell me it's my fault? 
Our minds are still blank, dying from the heat 
It hypnotizes, tranquilizes, carryin' the beat 
The lines sound too rehearsed, they're jumping on the train 
We're carrying the dying soldier, icing up his brain. Pain!
