greetings 
ok i'll make this short 
we in the house 
we got Mikah 9 Abstract Rude Peace 
Vic Hop Fat Jack and myself Aceyalone we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom 
bring them laughter after which bring them tears i seen it comin' and knew it was a plot 
legislation had a plan to kill hip hop 
i got wind from a snitch i kept in contact w/this 
bitch ass judge who was paid off 
soon after that he got laid off 
i'm lettin' niggas know you tryin' to stop a muthafucka's flow 
hold your black stallions and your black sheeps 
black clan aided a nigga and got heat 
we met up on Stepney and Market sparked it 
mapped out the target 
we gon' take out their number one sergeant 
young and strong we bailed up on their front lawn 
to kill the enemy 
remember me 
well if you remember me you'll remember 
i'm the one who broke into the pentagon took fouls planted bombs 
now i possess the blueprint 
i counter the message you sent 
no longer will you slander and tamper w/our music 
copies of the document we're xeroxed 
the ghetto took offense in defense of hip hop 
shot down rolled 'em up loc'ed up bailed out 
saved the day 
then into thin air i fade away 
scorpion we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom 
bring them laughter after which bring them tears the story had never been told until now 
as the glory of the kingdom come comes down 
disguised as a janitor the washman 
i swept and mopped the floors 
better yet i was a spook behind the door 
w/a perfect view from the bannister 
feeling like Lee Harvey 
'cept i got a hundred million years in me 
first thing i did was aim 
lock him in my scope 
squeeze 
bust his melon open now i'm pleased 
in the name of MC's 
already passed the time that they allotted me 
the housekeeper spotted me 
it was either her or me 
click clack 
she says i will not say what i see 
but i never could have trusted her so i busted her in her chest 
then laughed 
then headed for the elevator shaft 
but it was too late the jig was up 
there was pigs all in the building 
so i tried to escape to the fire escape from homicide 
yeah i killed him 
hangin' from the third story ladder 
i dropped and i felt my ankle shatter 
no time to lose juice from my bladder 
my mission was completed and that was all that mattered 
the van was parked a hundred yards from the scene of the crime 
but it was hard to run w/a broken foot 
just like i thought they blasted 
i took one to the gut 
i was laying there thinkin' about death 
just watchin' my blood spill out 
just then the van pulls up and i jump in 
and then we pull out (?lickin'?) shouts for the glory we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom 
bring them laughter after which bring them tears i walk in like a normal black 
gun peckin' jaw snatching 
slide 
they like the way i glide 
to the back break out my backpack and stack my shit up 
ah it's bulging now 
looked around heard a gun shot 
pow 
i looked down I whipped out my shit 
unloaded my clip 
jetting by the count i slipped 
tripped out 
landed on my hip crawled out 
i hit a tuck and roll up and out 
into a flip and boned out now i'm zonin' 
I'm nine glocks and seven 380's richer 
i'm fit to blow the foundation off this beyotch up 
synchronized for the race 
i push the button 
nuke the place 
timed myself dashin to the ride 
i hops inside 
keys already in the ignition 
i cranks it slaps it in drive 
fizorty-fizive seconds til dizamage 
ride be	-boy 
kingdom we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom 
bring them laughter after which bring them tears we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom 
bring them laughter after which bring them tears
