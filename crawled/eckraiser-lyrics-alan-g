Momma said you live and die by what you say 
Church-going, God-fearing families would always pay 
For a loose tongue - every word of craziness 
It could all get us some day I was just a squirt, and maybe I was 2 or 3 
Out with momma - and shoppin' at the grocery 
Hot and tired, I yelled out a devil word 
The look that momma gave me Momma screamed, "My son your mouth" 
Then gave a name to me 
She called me Heckraiser 
Trouble is as trouble does 
Momma yelled my name, it was: 
Heckraiser 
I just say stuff for fun 
Heckraiser 
Trouble is as trouble says 
Words always make a mess 
Heckraiser 
Her little son of a gun 
She said "You're a heckraiser, son" 3rd grade school room, had a friend whose name was Mark, 
Dressed like a bird in our play about Noah's Ark, 
Saw him standin' there in a big feathered suit, I said 
"Hey Mark, you big duck!" But that's not what came out or how it sounded 
Next thing I knew I was gettin' pounded 
50 classmates on the stage and fightin' 
Momma sighed "Boy, just shut up!" 
She called me Heckraiser 
Trouble is as trouble does 
Momma yelled my name, it was: 
Heckraiser 
I don't wanna sound dumb 
Heckraiser 
Trouble is as trouble says 
Words always make a mess 
Heckraiser 
Her little son of a gun 
She said "You're a heckraiser, son" Weeks ago, lookin' cool with a Lucky Strike 
Snuck into the barn with a guy who said his name was Mike 
Started makin' out when he said he was in love, I said 
"Whoa! I just wanna be friends." Didn't know I said the other F-word 
Mike threw a punch, the cigarette flew upward 
Barn caught fire, Cows and chickens all runnin' 
I knew my life had come to an end Momma was mad, saw her eyes lit up with flame 
I made up an excuse but she said "Careful what you say" 
Reminding me again: words are often cause for blame 
Then she grabbed me by the collar - called me by my favorite name Heckraiser 
Trouble is as trouble does 
Momma yelled my name, it was: 
Heckraiser 
I just say stuff for fun 
Heckraiser 
Trouble is as trouble says 
Words always make a mess 
Heckraiser 
Her little son of a gun 
She called me Heckraiser 
Trouble is as trouble does 
Momma yelled my name, it was: 
Heckraiser 
But I don't wanna sound dumb 
Heckraiser 
Trouble is as trouble says 
Words always make a mess 
Heckraiser 
Her little son of a gun 
She said "You're a heckraiser, son" Momma said, "Son your mouth will never fit ya 
Careful whatcha say, cuz your words will always git ya" 
Aw Heck!
