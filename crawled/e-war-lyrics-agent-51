I think it's time we stopped 
Worrying about the future 
In due time we'll all blow up 
But it makes no difference to me 
One day I ran into a man 
Who served his time 
Got purple hearts, wounded in Vietnam 
He said war was made for the buck 
And I believe every word he said: 
"They'll offer you the country 
And you're expendable what's more 
That's what they call fighting. 
What do you think world peace is for?" 
War - look around, make yourself at home 
The world's in hibernation - let's have a war 
War - blow up the this town, I've been waitin' for too long 
The world's in hibernation - let's have a war 
There's a struggle that's goin' on 
And there's pressure to stay on top 
When the economy starts to drop 
War will bring the money in 
A war is beautiful for all the money 
A war is beautiful for overpopulation too 
Bombs exploding, cannons loading 
We'll make the world a frying pan 
We'll all be playin' on the beach with 
Our atomic radiation suntan
