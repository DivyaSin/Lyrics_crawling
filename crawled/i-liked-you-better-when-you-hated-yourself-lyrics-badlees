We used to drink our Bacardi 
Behind the old school 
And bitch about dreams 
That would never come true 
Then you heard a callin' 
That I hadn't felt 
I liked you better 
When you hated yourself 
Now you spend lots of time 
At that natural foods place 
Buyin' fresh blocks of tofu 
Just like mom used to make 
You kicked your bad habits 
You're in perfect health 
But I liked you better 
When you hated yourself 
Change, it came a blowin' 
Like we never met 
Your inner child and you play games 
That I just don't get 
Somewhere it's written 
That this to shall pass 
But lately you've just been 
A pain in the ass..... 
Ask me if I care 
Well, I guess I still do 
Friends don't come easy 
Even assholes like you 
And that shrink of yours 
She can go straight to hell 
I liked you better 
When you hated yourself 
Last time I saw you 
You were on Donahue 
Discussing your book 
And eveything you've been through 
Now you've got your glamour 
Your fame and your wealth 
But I still liked you better 
When you hated yourself
