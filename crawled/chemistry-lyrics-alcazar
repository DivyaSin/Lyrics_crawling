Hey you, standing in the corner, looking like a loner 
Don't you want to be mine 
Hey you, dancing like a zombie, feel the rhythm like me 
Don't you want to be mine You know it's Saturday tonight, I got the fever 
(Fever) 
And when the music take control, you got to be there 
(Be there) Let's have a good time, forget about the reality 
'Cause you and I make chemistry 
Sometimes the best times of you are fantasy 
'Cause you and I make chemistry Hey you, put your hands on my hips, music?s loud so read my lips 
Don't you want to be mine 
So you, I knew the second I saw you, you and I are just so cool 
Don't you want to be mine, mine, mine, mine 'Cause when I look into your eyes I know you got it 
(Got it) 
And when you look into my eyes, you know I want it 
(Want it) Let's have a good time, forget about the reality 
'Cause you and I make chemistry 
Sometimes the best times of you are fantasy 
'Cause you and I make chemistry Good time, forget about the reality 
'Cause you and I make chemistry 
Sometimes the best times of you are fantasy 
'Cause you and I make chemistry I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love 
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love You know it's Saturday tonight, I got the fever 
(Fever) 
And when the music take control, you got to be there 
(Be there) Let's have a good time, forget about the reality 
'Cause you and I make chemistry 
Sometimes the best times of you are fantasy 
'Cause you and I make chemistry Good time, forget about the reality 
'Cause you and I make chemistry 
Sometimes the best times of you are fantasy 
'Cause you and I make chemistry I think I'm in love 
('Cause you and I make) 
I think I'm in love 
(Chemistry) I think I'm in love 
('Cause you and I make) 
I think I'm in love 
(Chemistry)
