Used to live uptown 
'til I hit the downtown 
Yea, people walking all around 
They come talking 'bout a hip town 
I step up to the street 
I step in time 
With the limousine 
I ship, ship, ship, shimmy the bell in my pocket But damn, I can't get over 
I just can't make a move 
Damn, I just can't get over 
I've got too much to lose on my mind Speak high crown 
Don't get down 
Don't let them put you in the ground 
Don't let them 
The people come walking all around 
Stewp up to the street 
Step in time 
With the limousine 
I ship, ship, ship, shimmy the bell in my pocket
