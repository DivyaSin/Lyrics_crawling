My fingers scrape the brainbag housed inside my skull 
My dead eyes closed my mind is seeing you below 
Raping the Multiverse 
I've found my way again and plunged into the black 
I fucked the cosmos and I'm never coming back 
Raping the Multiverse I filled my veins with toxic antidotes from outer space 
I bled the galaxy 'til reason fled without a trace 
I licked up hells and fire and time and space unkown 
I sought unconsciousness and then usurped it's throne I plunged my fist right down the throat of destiny 
I made the strands of time submit and cease to be 
Raping the multiverse 
Devoid of order blusters form in tunnels deep 
And wings of madness fly the universal freak 
Raping the multiverse I filled my veins with toxic antidotes from outer space 
I bled the galaxy 'til reason fled without a trace 
I licked up hells and fire and time and space unkown 
I sought unconsciousness and then usurped it's throne
