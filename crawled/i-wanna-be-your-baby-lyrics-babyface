I'm gon' put it out there, 
Lay it on the line, 
And even if it breaks my heart, 
I'm giving it a try. 
Not waiting for tomorrow, 
Confessing it today, 
So baby, here it goes, 
I'm out of time, 
It's do or die. I wanna be your baby, 
Wanna be your man, 
I wanna be your soldier, 
When you're too weak to stand. 
I wanna be your baby, 
Be the end of your day, 
Forever in your life, 
And ever by your side, 
Forever I'll stay. I'm hanging on a thread here, 
I don't care if I fall, 
But I ain't gonna foe, 
Even though, 
I don't know, 
If you feel me at all. 
I'm ready to be right, or wrong, with you. 
I'm ready for my heart, to win, or lose. 
I'm ready to give all I've got to you, 
Girl I want you to know. I wanna be your baby, 
Wanna be your man, 
I wanna be your soldier, 
When you're too weak to stand. 
I wanna be your baby, 
Be the end of your day, 
Forever in your life, 
And ever by your side, 
Forever I'll stay. So I'm saying I love you, 
Ain't holding nothing back. 
And I'm saying I want you babe, 
I hope you don't mind that. 
I'll wait on you forever, 
And girl I promise that. 
Oh baby,'cause I love you, 
I love you babe, 
I love you. I wanna be your baby, 
Wanna be your man, 
I wanna be your soldier, 
When you're too weak to stand. 
I wanna be your baby, 
Be the end of your day, 
Forever in your life, 
And ever by your side, 
Forever I'll stay. I wanna be your baby, 
Wanna be your man, 
I wanna be your soldier, 
When you're too weak to stand. 
I wanna be your baby, 
Be the end of your day, 
Forever in your life, 
And ever by your side, 
Forever I'll stay. I wanna be,
