I cover my heart, turn from the wind 
Button my coat, here comes the storm again 
What can I do but to trust in Him 'Cause I know the deeper my faith runs 
The stronger I become 
And the thunder, it may shake me 
But I always know that After the rain 
You can look to the sky again 
The clouds will give way 
To the light of the sun After the rain 
You know that you've made it through 
And you'll finally see the joy from the pain 
After the rain Everyone needs, everyone hurts 
Everyone feels the weight of the world sometimes 
But don't let the wind sweep your heart away 'Cause even the roughest waters cleanse 
So when they come again 
Let them serve as a reminder 
You can always know that After the rain 
You can look to the sky again 
The clouds will give way 
To the light of the sun After the rain 
You know that you've made it through 
And you'll finally see the joy from the pain 
After the rain Can't you see the hand of Jesus 
Reaching out for you? 
You never have to face the storm alone After the rain 
You can look to the sky again 
The clouds will give way 
To the light of the sun 
(Light of the sun) After the rain 
'Cause you know that you've made it through 
And you'll finally see the joy from the pain 
Well, after the rain You know that you made it 
(Look to the sky again) 
You know that you made it 
(After the rain) 
Hold on to the light 
(To the light of the sun) After the rain 
You know that you made it 
(I know) 
You know that you made it 
(So hold on, hold on) After the rain 
You know that you made it 
(Look to the sky again) 
You know that you made it 
(Bow down and pray) 
To the light of the sun After the rain 
(After the rain) 
You know that you made it 
(Know that you made it) 
You know that you made it
