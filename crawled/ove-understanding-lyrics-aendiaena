you say u love me 
and i think that's okay 
but there's one thing i got to complain 
a typical male thing 
u can't hear what my heart is sayin' 
and i fly into a rage 
but i forgive u ev'rything and that's why love and understanding 
could it be so hard to do 
what ever you're demanding 
i'm the one to see it through 
so give me some reasons 
to justify my love for u we're fussing and fightin' 
sometimes it's delighting 
but when u get me wrong all the time 
i'd like to jump out a speed train 
stay out in the cold rain 
'cause action speaks louder than words 
but i try to calm my nervs and that's why love and understanding...
