I have tried 
To make it on my own 
And I have survived 
But surviving is no rival 
For your love [Chorus] 
Now I know that it`s true 
There is no way I can`t be 
Without you 
Heaven knows that it`s true 
I can`t live in this world 
Without you Time you`ll find 
Can change your mind 
My eyes once could see 
Only want now to believe 
And thought we`ve tried 
I think we`d better face it 
A love like ours 
You know you can`t replace it [Chorus] Without you [Chorus] I wonder if there`s one chance 
It could be 
You can`t live in this world 
Without me 
Without me
