We haven't talked in a while. 
I stare out the window, mile after mile. 
You said I live in denial... Well so what if I cry like a child? 
I still melt in the wake of your smile, 
but you've been gone for a while. Sometimes I close my eyes and drive 
with the windows down and no lights 
and I can't tell you how it feels. Last night I waited with flowers, 
watching the sun set, hour after hour. 
Needless to say, I never found her. (I took a walk by the water 
but every now and then I falter) And I get carried away...
