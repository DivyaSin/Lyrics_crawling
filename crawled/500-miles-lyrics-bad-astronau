If you miss the train 
I'm on you will know that I have gone 
And I'm 500 miles from my home A hundred miles a hundred miles 
A hundred miles a hundred miles You can hear the whistle blow 
A hundred miles Not a shirt on my back 
Not a penny to my name 
No I can't go back home 
There's no way 500 miles 500 miles 500 miles 500 miles 
You can hear the whistle blow 
A hundred miles Hey if you miss the train I'm on 
You will know that I have gone 
And I'm 500 miles 500 miles 
I am 500 miles from my home
