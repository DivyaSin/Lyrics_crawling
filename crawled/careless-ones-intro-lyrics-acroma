I'm tired of living in the morning 
And I'm tired of living at night 
And I'm tired of searching for the meaning 
And I'm tired of wanting to be... I'm tired of living in the morning! 
And I'm tired of living at night! 
And I'm tired of searching for the meaning! 
And I'm tired of wanting to be wanted, to be wanted, to be..yeah..yeah..yeah Surrender.
