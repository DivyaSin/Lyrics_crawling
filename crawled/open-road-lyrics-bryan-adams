I'm sitting at the wheel I got a green light 
I'm not afraid of nothing, 
'Cause heart and soul I'm built for life So let the engines roar - Push the pedal down 
I want the white lines on my highway 
To lead me out of town I'm rolling on and on and on who knows where I'm goin' Life is an open road, 
It's the best story never told, 
It's an endless sky, it's the deepest sea 
Life is an open road to me 
Life is an open road to me I got headlights 
To guide me through the night 
I got the window down and the radio playing 
It makes me feel alive I'm rolling on and on and on who knows where I'm goin' Life is an open road 
It's the best story never told 
It's an endless sky, it's the deepest sea 
Life is an open road to me 
Life is an open road to me 
Yeah life's an open road Life is an open road 
It's the best story never told 
It's an endless sky, it's the deepest sea 
Life is an open road to me 
Life is an open road to me 
Yeah life's an open road oh yeah Yeah I'm built for life 
Life is an open road to me
