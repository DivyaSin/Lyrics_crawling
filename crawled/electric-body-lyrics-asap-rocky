[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky] 
Yeah this year we finna make a killin' 
Now the money stack up the to ceilin' 
All I know is payback, all I rep is A$AP 
Now we finna go offend the buildin' 
I can really give a fuck about your feelin's 
This would be a schoolboy and a rude boy too 
Not a jerk like the new boys, (groovin) like Schoolboy Q, nigga 
I done killed a few boys nigga 
Down a couple shots, turn it up another notch 
Countin' bitches in the spot and she faded 
Corsette top, and her new ass shots 
Couple Instagram likes, now she famous 
Nose job, workin' on some payments 
On a new car, now she finna trade it 
Next time shouldn't suck the nigga dick free 
Man I swear the small girls are my favorite 
(Oh my God, your cable's turned off 
Shouldn't have sucked the nigga's dick for free) 
Brand new Rari, finna race it 
I am not the nigga you should play with 
This shit turnin' into the races 
All I wanna see is green faces 
All I wanna count is green numbers 
Man that shit is weird, lookin' like the Matrix 
Gave 'em high power, Always Strive And Prosper 
Only took a little bit of patience [Hook] 
Shorty she like to pop ass high 
Popped her way up to first class high 
She clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, she drop it low 
Then she clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, down to the floor 
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet 
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet 
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet [Verse 2: Schoolboy Q] 
Ever seen a crib like this?, diamonds in my ear like wrists 
Pull off at the light like wuh, lookin' like a mil in that trunk 
Two seater got me lookin' all clump, hit a nigga wig on sight 
Suck a nigga mom off work, gettin' so high, I'm Christ 
Nigga ball so hard like Mike, I can whip that bitch like Ike 
I can fuck your bitch off hype, pink ring got bling all right 
I'm hot nigga, rock this ice, 14 almost got that strike 
14 almost did that time, 14 had a nine whole fly 
Keep small but the shit shoot fine 
Shoot a spine, make a nigga recline 
Start sparkin' and a nigga go blind, G (?) 
Do I got them hoes chirpin'? Yeah, do I put the work in? Yeah 
Do I got them hoes out workin'? Yeah 
Do I make 'em put the work in the Birkin? Yeah [Hook]
