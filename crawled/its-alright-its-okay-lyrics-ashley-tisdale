You told me 
There's no need 
To talk it out 
Cause it's too late 
To proceed 
And slowly 
I took your words 
And walked away No looking back 
I wont regret, no 
I will find my way 
I'm broken 
But still I have to say It's alright, okay 
I'm so much better without you 
I wont be sorry 
Alright, okay 
So don't you bother what I do 
No matter what you say 
I wont return 
Our bridge has burned down 
I'm stronger now 
Alright, okay 
I'm so much better without you 
I wont be sorry You played me 
Betrayed me 
Your love was nothing but a game 
Portrait a role 
You took control, I 
I couldn't help but fall 
So deep 
But now I see things clear It's alright, okay 
I'm so much better without you 
I wont be sorry 
Alright, okay 
So don't you bother what I do 
No matter what you say 
I wont return 
Our bridge has burned down 
I'm stronger now 
Alright, okay 
I'm so much better without you 
I wont be sorry Don't waist your fiction tears on me 
Just save them for someone in need 
It's way to late 
I'm closing the door It's alright, okay 
I'm so much better without you 
I wont be sorry 
Alright, okay 
So don't you bother what I do (yeah) 
No matter what you say 
I wont return 
Our bridge has burned down 
I'm stronger now 
Alright, okay 
I'm so much better without you (I'm better without you) 
I wont be sorry It's alright, okay 
Alright, okay 
Without you 
No matter what you say 
It's alright, okay 
Alright, okay 
Without you 
I won't be sorry
