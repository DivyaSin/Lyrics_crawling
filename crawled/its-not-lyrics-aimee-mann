I keep going round and round on the same old circuit A wire travels underground to a vacant lot And shrinks the picture down to a tiny dot Where something I can't see interrupts the current And from behind the screen it can look so perfect I keep waiting for a change but I don't know what But it's not So here I'm sitting in my car at the same old stoplight And all I have to do is to press the pedal So red turns into green turning into yellow But I'm just frozen here on the same old spot But I'm not No, I'm not The moment you try, you kiss it goodbye People are tricky, you can't afford to show Anything risky anything they don't know And let me fall into the dream of the astronaut Where I get lost in space that goes on forever So baby kiss me like a drug like a respirator And you make all the rest just an afterthought And I believe it's you who could make it better No, it's not But it's not No, it's not
