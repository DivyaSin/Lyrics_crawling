This is not another song about the reasons I am stressed 
This is not melody to get the feelings off my chest 
This is not a pop song written for the radio 
These are just my thoughts and what I'm praying for Chorus: 
If this is my story, If this is my song 
I wanna be a part of something beautiful 
If this is my journey, Show me your road 
Where ever you lead me in this world I wanna go There's just too many times I only think of me 
'Cause I get so consumed with my opportunities 
But when my life's work brings me to the feet of God 
I wanna hear him say I lived for his glory Chorus: 
If this is my story, If this is my song 
I wanna be a part of something beautiful 
If this is my journey, Show me your road 
Where ever you lead me in this world I wanna go Colors paint the evening sky 
The sun is shining giving light 
Stars light up the atmosphere 
But we're the reason God came here We are his story, we are his song 
A beautiful melody that shows the world his love 
When we're on this journey, when we're on this road 
We are a part of the greatest story ever told
