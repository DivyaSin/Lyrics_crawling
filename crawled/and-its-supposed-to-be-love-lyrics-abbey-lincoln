Hey, look what you have done 
Showing me the sun 
And now it's shining through 
It's nice to be with you 
Hey, I like the things you say 
And I like the way 
You do the things you do 
It's nice to be with you 
Each time that I give my heart 
To someone new 
They just turn it blue 
But this time is my time 
And my time is all the time 
I have to be with you 
So, please, never go away 
Say you're going to stay 
And make my dreams come true 
It's nice to be with you 
Each time that I give my heart 
To someone new 
They just turn it blue 
But this time is my time 
And my time is all the time 
I have to be with you 
So, please, never go away 
Say you're going to stay 
And make my dreams come true 
It's so nice to be with you
