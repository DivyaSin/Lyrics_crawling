Farther Along / Billy In the Low Ground 
Adrienne Young / Broken Drought Tempted and tried were oft made to wonder 
Why it should be thus all the day long 
While there are others living about us 
Never molested though in the wrong Farther along 
Well know all about it 
Farther along well understand why 
Cheery up my brother, 
Live in the sunshine 
Well understand it 
All by and by When death has come and taken our loved ones 
Leaving a hole so weary and drear 
Then do we wonder why other prosper 
Living so wicked year after year Farther along 
Well know all about it 
Farther along well understand why 
Cheery up my brother, 
Live in the sunshine 
Well understand it 
All by and by Faithful to listen to our loving master 
Just a few more days to labor and wait 
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing 
As we sweep through those beautiful gates Farther along 
Well know all about it 
Farther along well understand why 
Cheery up my brother, 
Live in the sunshine 
Well understand it 
All by and by
