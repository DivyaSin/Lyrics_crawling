Just another mother fucker dead for the wrong reasons 
He says he's coming back but he keeps on leaving 
He's breathing he's trying to keep his faith 
But he keeps on thinking that his life's just a waste 
Just another mother fucker that thinks he knows it all 
But this mother fucker don't know shit at all 
The smartest mother fuckers know they don't know nothing 
But they're always learning trying to understand something 
Just another politician that keeps on lying 
Another baby gone but the mother's still crying 
She's dying she just wants peace 
But there's death right here and there's war in the middle east 
And she really wants to know but there's nothing she can do 
Cuz in the daytime there's nightmares too 
The world's full of lies and schools a scam 
cuz they can't fucking tell me how to live or who I am Chorus 
Pick a line in time we watch em all fall 
Pick a side it's fine we watch em all fall 
Pick a life take mine we watch em all fall 
Watch them as they take em all 
Pick a line in time we watch em all fall 
Pick a side it's fine we watch em all fall 
Pick a life take mine we watch em all fall 
Watch us come and take em all Just another mother fucker trying to act so tuff 
And this other mother fucker trying to call his bluff 
Now these stupid mother fuckers know they can't back down 
Stupid fucker number one shot the other fucker down 
Just another bomb blowing up a building 
We don't see all the killings of millions 
They wanna lead but be careful where you follow 
They shadow all their lies till there may be no tomorrow 
We wanna believe that everything's fine 
That our rules and our values are on the same line 
And that everybody's knowing that everything is fine 
But you're just another person so na
