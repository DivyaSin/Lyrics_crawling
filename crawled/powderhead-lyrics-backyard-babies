I wanna get some sunshine 
Before the sun goes down 
I guess it doesnt matter to you 
Im so sick and tired 
But thats nothing new 
I guess it doesnt matter to you, no 
No, it dont matter to you 
`Cause I love myself, I dont love nobody else 
And I feel alright, feeling sonic high 
And when I touch myself I feel like someone else 
Ive lost all the visions I had 
All the problems, I am on my way to be damned 
`Cause youre damned, damned, damned 
I aint a powderhead 
I aint going nowhere 
I think Id rather be dead 
Than be your powderhead 
Well, do you think I love you 
When youre on the TV screen 
You see, it doesnt matter to me, no way 
And I saw that motherfucker in the strobe light 
And I kicked that motherfucker `til he ran out of sight 
I guess it doesnt matter to me, no 
No, it dont matter to me 
But it does to you who choses to fuck with me 
`Cause I aint no powderhead, wow 
`Cause I love myself, I dont love nobody else 
And I feel alright, feeling super sonic high 
And when I touch myself I feel like someone else 
Ive lost all the visions I had 
All the problems, I am on my way to be damned 
`Cause youre damned, damned, damned 
I aint a powderhead 
I aint going nowhere 
I think Id rather be dead 
Than be your powderhead 
Thats right, man
