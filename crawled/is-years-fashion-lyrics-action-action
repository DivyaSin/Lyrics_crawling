Head trip on the scene again 
Pumping in the veins of the rabid mouths to feed 
Head back, obsolete 
Trapped with the secrets that I cannot keep today You got it, intrusive 
Erratic, elusive 
Your heart aches, infliction 
Sporadic in an aging contradiction I have a dream, it's them and not me 
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh my 
Sugar my life, sweeten my tea 
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh my 
You've got your hands around my throat 
You've got your eyes inside my back 
You lied, you lied, oh Head spun by a thousand spiders 
Sucked into their late night infomercials 
Rolled back with every beat 
Bound to the bond of a greater feature feat You got it, intrusive 
Erratic, elusive 
Your heart aches, infliction 
Sporadic in an aging contradiction I have a dream, it's them and not me 
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh my 
Sugar my life, sweeten my tea 
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh 
You've got your hands around my throat 
You've got your eyes inside my back 
You lied, you lied, oh I have a dream, it's them and not me 
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh my 
Sugar my life, sweeten my tea, oh 
You've got your hands around my throat 
You've got your eyes inside my back 
You lied, you lied, oh
