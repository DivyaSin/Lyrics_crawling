Uhh 
I've become accustomed to goin' through customs 
Pound in my pocket hollerin', "Fuck them" 
I'm livin' that life that you only talk about 
I'm fuckin' them hoes that you only thought about 
I spend that money but you won't spend about 
As much that I made off my last single out 
Whatchu think of that? Niggaz, y'all know 
That I kill niggaz slow when I live for this dough 
Got labels sick, I know they hate that 
I'm makin' they artists push them dates back 
I don't need tattoos to prove I pack tools 
Go 'head and act fool and become dog food 
Memph Man, uh-huh, yeah that's me 
Same nigga that don't give a "Basically" 
And I'm still smokin', it be like that

Yeah, I'm finally put in the game, right where I should be 
And the gat laid right where it should be 
Violate, you be put where you should be 
Have your family and friends screamin', "How could he?" 
Walk the streets with a body on his back 
Ride around in a V with the shottie in the back 
And for y'all that swear, that I front for rep 
Only thing that I front is hoes and coke and clips of tef 
With a co-D, that's a, menace to the people 
Yeah we sold D and made a livin' off of people 
Ghetto, corrupted us, and we taught ourselves 
How to add and scale plus bag and sell 
And how to, aim and shoot and I got brain when the wrist locked 
Wherever the dot spot leave the tape 
You keep actin' like you can't die in a blaze 
And I let sixteen of 'em dive in your wake 
I'm from M.A.R.C.Y.
