When the lights are fading 
Slowly on another show 
And the crowd has gone 
The people cease to shout for more You'd better run 
Stop from cryin' all the time 
Don't you know, it's got to end? 
I thought you were a friend of mine Goodbye bright light 
City heading for the sun 
Where the southern girls are pretty 
And there's two for one You'd better run 
Stop from cryin' all the time 
Don't you know, it's got to end? 
I thought you were a friend of mine You'd better run 
Stop from cryin' all the time 
Don't you know, it's got to end? 
I thought you were a friend of mine Don't you know, it's got to end? 
I thought you were a friend of mine
