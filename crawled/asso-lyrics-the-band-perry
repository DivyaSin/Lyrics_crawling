When I first laid eyes on you 
Well, the night just felt so odd 
You looked at me and the stars lined up 
So I thought I'd heard from God 
And I gave him my best shot Loving you was like throwing a lasso around a tornado 
I tried to hold on to you 
Took a ride on a tilt-a-whirl that sits on top of the world 
Man, I thought I could show you 
I've always been afraid of flying 
But you can't blame a girl for trying Felt like a pearl when I was holding your hand 
So precious I forgot 
You could have any girl but I only wanted one man 
And you were everything I'm not 
Still I gave it my best shot Loving you was like throwing a lasso around a tornado 
I tried to hold on to you 
Took a turn on a high trapeze swinging over the deep 
I thought I could show you 
I've always been afraid of flying 
But you can't blame a girl for trying Like a vine bends a tree to the ground 
I won't hold you down 
I tried to climb just as high 
But I found all the clouds touch the ground 
In this small town Took a ride on a high trapeze swinging over the deep 
I thought I could show you 
That I've always been afraid of flying 
But you can't blame a girl for trying 
No, you can't blame a girl, hey
