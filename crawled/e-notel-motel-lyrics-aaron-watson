G C 
He starts to think when she winks that he's somewhere he shouldn't be 
G D 
He may be alone but at home someone's wearing his ring 
G C 
So he heads for the door and ignores the devil on his shoulder 
D G 
He'll do the right thing but someone's gonna break down and hold her 
Chorus: 
D C G 
And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel 
D C G 
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale 
D C G 
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell 
D C G 
There's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel 
G C 
Once again another man walks in and orders him drinks for two 
G D 
Despite his wife and picture perfect life he's to good to be true 
G C 
While he's flirting she'd swear he's working on a job out of town 
D G 
A married man, you know he's got no business messing around 
Chorus: 
D C G 
And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel 
D C G 
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale 
D C G 
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell 
D C G 
There's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel 
G C 
It's a five star chain or a run down dirt cheap no name 
D G 
With or without room service what done is the same 
Chorus: 
D C G 
And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel 
D C G 
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale 
D C G 
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell 
D C G 
There's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
