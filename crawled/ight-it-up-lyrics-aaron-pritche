There's a dirt road out where the blacktop ends 
Down past where the river bends 
Turn left when you see the barn 
That's Eddie's farm There's beer kegs and F-150s 
Country girls lookin' pretty 
Good old boys gettin' good and loud 
It's a rowdy crowd But it ain't a party 
We ain't set the scene 
Big Joe walks over to the brush pile 
With a can of kerosene And we light it up 
Tailgates down as a little, brown jug 
We're passing around 
Fillin' little, red cups It's powerful stuff 
Out in the sticks, we ain't shy 
Gonna set it off like the Fourth of July 
All week long's still a slow fuse burnin' 
But tonight we're gonna light it up 'Til Friday we're slazed to the same old grime 
But today we can all unwind 
Hey, everybody's feelin' fine 
In the firelight There's a redhead lookin' pretty smokin' 
Hot in a red and white polka dot dress 
Man, she sure looks fun 
Oh, here she comes Lord, I'd love to have her 
Teach me a thing or two 
That girl, she's a little firecracker 
How 'bout me and you? Light it up 
Tailgates down as a little, brown jug 
We're passing around 
Fillin' little, red cups It's powerful stuff 
Out in the sticks, we ain't shy 
Gonna set it off like the Fourth of July 
All week long's been a slow fuse burnin' 
But tonight we're gonna light it up Light it up 
Tailgates down as a little' brown jug 
We're passing around 
Fillin' little, red cups It's powerful stuff 
Out in the sticks, we ain't shy 
Gonna set it off like the Fourth of July 
All week long's been a slow fuse burnin' 
But tonight we're gonna light it up Yeah, we gonna light it up 
It's like a slow fuse burnin' 
Oh, light it up 
(Oh, oh, oh)
