If you want just let me know (cause I can turn you out) 
My envelope's about to explode 
I got what you need and you know (so we'll never have a doubt) 
If you want love just let me know so I can 
Turn you on (just turn me on, turn me on, turn me on) [Repeat: x3] 
Turn you on Baby when you're gone I don't know what to do 
cause ain't no other lady make me feel brand new 
And ain't no other woman that I want to pursue 
If you want my loving I'ma give it to you 
Let our bodies collide and me enter you 
Meet me online, take a little preview 
Sex on the net, got my girl in the nude 
And you know our connection is long overdue [Chorus] 
cause I got my needs and I need them right now 
And I'm here to rock the show 
And see I've been on the road on my fucking homeroom so please try and overload it 
After the show we can still rock come on and 
You loving (your loving) [Repeat: x3]

Lick your envelope bend behind

You know I love to love you love you perm'ny perm'ny

Till my turn you know that I'll be learning 
New love tricks to make you go (oh) 
My magic stick can make you go (oh)

Knocking on your door, you know what the visits for
