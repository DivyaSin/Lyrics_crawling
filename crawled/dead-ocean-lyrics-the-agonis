An Ocean waves hello 
Feathers decorate the air 
And sleeping giants approach 
An absolute nightmare not having footing to flee 
Suspended animation, face to face with the majesty 
Grotesque interest drew you near 
But sorrow and awe keep you here The Ocean suicides 
Here come the leeches gathering around their host 
Hard to believe it, arterial seacost 
King of carcass, I'll drown in is death 
Grotesque interest drew you near the towering monument 
Sorrow and awe keep you here while the Ocean breaks 
Flesh weighs more than atmosphere what' keeping them afloat? Still you stare, waiting for the shipwrecks and ghosts 
The moon mocks you with a knowing grin 
Or, is that the lure of a distant angler fish? 
Was your role fulfilled? Was that it? 
Are you face up or face down? 
Cardinal points are semantic 
Geometry is religion for mathematicians The womb that birthed us keep us close 
Rebellious organs give up early, abandoning ship 
The air feels hydrogen-heavy 
Your elements are individualizing 
Red algae pours across the panorama 
Colored film fills your eyes, matching the bed expanding beneath you 
With every once you lose 
You forget you ever feared you're physically free One who survives mass suicide gather the masses to blindly follow 
Intonations camouflage obvious idiocy 
Approachable outside to welcome them in 
Black holes set in spin 
A resource more valuable than we expect, 
Wrangled together to redirect 
I've been around this place before 
I recognize the heavy doors opening on the entrance way 
Molding a populace out of clay Stuck in the earth, we'll stay.
