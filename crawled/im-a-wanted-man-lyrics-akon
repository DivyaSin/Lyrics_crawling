Convict 
Convict I know people say that they never will 
Be the one to make you cry 
But Baby girl I cannot lie 
Your feelings will get hurt this time Believe me when I say 
That I'll never change the way I feel for you 
So baby let's not fuss or fight 
'Cause we just don't have that much time Pre-chorus 
'Cause I'm wanted, baby 
Should've told you a long time ago 
'Cause if I get caught up 
I just might not come home Chorus: 
'Cause I'm a wanted man 
Just wanna hold you in my arms 
'Cause one day I'll be gone 
'Cause I'm a wanted man 
When them boys come through it's so long 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone Verse 2: 
I know people say 
They could love you better than the last one ever could 
All I'm saying Ima try my best 
Baby you were so worth the test 
I know that you might not like the time 
I just hope that I thought up in your mind the whole night 
Baby I'm not just perfect 
I don't want you to forget Pre-chorus 
That I'm wanted baby 
Should've told you a long time ago 
'Cause if I get lined up 
I just might not come home Chorus: 
'Cause I'm a wanted man 
Just wanna hold you in my arms 
'Cause one day I'll be gone 
'Cause I'm a wanted man 
When them boys come through it's so long 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone So I apologize for hurting you in advance 
I shoulda told you everything 
It would've saved you a lot of pain 
But if I did it wouldn't be the same, yeah 
There will come a day when they will take me away 
When they do, I hope you never change 
I hope you'll be there just the same 
If not, I hope you find someone like me Chorus: 
'Cause I'm a wanted man 
Just wanna hold you in my arms 
'Cause one day I'll be gone 
'Cause I'm a wanted man 
When them boys come through it's so long 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
