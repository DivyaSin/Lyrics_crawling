I woke up to a feeling, it was cold by my side 
You had gone with the sunrise, leaving tears in my eyes 
I got up with a feeling of an emptiness inside 
To the noise of the sidewalk and the silence of my mind Well I walked out this morning, down a street with no name 
To a club called "The Loser", like a dog that's gone lame 
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view 
I took out life subscription - it's the only one they do I stepped out on the guard rail, saw the crowds slowly part 
Heard a voice shouting "Don't jump, please for God's sake let me move my car!" 
Felt a hand on my shoulder, heard a voice cry "Just in time!" 
Felt the quick push, felt the air rush 
Felt the sidewalk, fell in line
