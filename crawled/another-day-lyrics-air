Say goodbye 
Sunshine, daylight 
'Cause its just another day 
You'll re-live it anyway Give the time 
That goes, away 
'Cause its just another day 
You'll re-live it anyway You, you lost 
In space, in time 
'Cause its just another day 
You'll re-live it anyway 'Cause its just another day 
You'll re-live it anyway
