in the quest for the test to fulfill an achievement 
everybody's only in it for themselves 
when the fact of the matter is they just don't care 
to extend a helping hand to anyone else 
so tell me why, did you have to lie 
and try to make me all confused about the U.S.A. 
when the fact of the matter is you just don't care 
to comprehend or understand a single word I say 
I don't want to have I go against I 
oh let me tell you 
the same old story, no factual glory 
I against I against I against I 
and I say I don't like it, and I know I don't want it 
I against I against I against I 
almighty watching, almighty watching 
I against I against I against I 
and I say I don't like it, and I know I don't want it 
I against I against I against I 
I said who's gonna tell the youth about the drugs 
about the drugs, mugs, bugs, and the police thugs 
about the rotten stinkin' rackets and the fantasies 
around the nation, around the nations 
oh baby what you gonna do 
I tell you the truth is looking straight at you 
I got a brass continental with a 300 Z, two color t.v.s,now a video too 
I got a rest home in Jamaica for my fantasty, for my family 
around the nation 
around the nations 
what you gonna do.
