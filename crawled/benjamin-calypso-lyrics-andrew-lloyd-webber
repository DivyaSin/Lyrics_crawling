Oh, no, not he 
How you can accuse him is a mystery? 
Save him, take me 
Benjamin is straighter than the tall palm tree I hear the steel drums sing their song 
They're singing man you know you've got it wrong 
I hear the voice of the yellow bird 
Singing in the tree it is quite absurd Oh, yes, it's true 
Benjamin is straighter than the big bamboo 
No ifs, no buts 
Benjamin is honest as coconuts Sure as the tide wash the golden sand 
Benjamin is an innocent man 
Sure as bananas need the sun 
We are the criminal guilty ones Oh, no, not he 
How you can accuse him is a mystery? 
Save him, take me 
Benjamin is straighter than the tall palm tree 
La la, la la, la la, la la Oh, no, not he 
How you can accuse him is a mystery? 
Save him, take me 
Benjamin is straighter than the tall palm tree Sure as the tide wash the golden sand 
Benjamin is an innocent man 
Sure as bananas need the sun 
We are the criminal guilty ones Oh, no, not he 
How you can accuse him is a mystery? 
Save him, take me 
Benjamin is straighter than the tall palm tree Oh no, not he 
How you can accuse him is a mystery? 
Save him, take me 
La la, la la, la la, la la
