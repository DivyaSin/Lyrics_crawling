Im a tortured soul 
An ever-growing black hole 
Take away my peace of mind 
Rolling rock my astro sign (Chorus) 
Play my adolescent game 
Bitch or slut, its all the same 
Teen pride envelopes my brain 
Im a shelf stocked, lickable candy cane Carbon copy of my age 
Generation X is my cage 
Family laughs at my tears 
What have I become in such few years (Chorus) 
Play my adolescent game 
Bitch or slut, its all the same 
Teen pride envelopes my brain 
Im a shelf stocked, lickable candy cane Im a tortured soul 
An ever-growing black hole 
Trend is my middle name 
I advertise others fame (Chorus) 
Play my adolescent game 
Bitch or slut, its all the same 
Teen pride envelopes my brain 
Im a shelf stocked, lickable candy cane
