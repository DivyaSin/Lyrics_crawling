[Verse 1] 
Wasn't expecting such an ending 
I'm wounded, you've got my mind messed up (Yeah) 
All those crazy things you said drive me mad, 
You shocked me for real, how could you be so cold ? My heart's screamin out "Want this feeling to go away" 
I trusted you too much, now i'm feeling stupid 
You were playing with my heart 
I don't know what to do, that's why i wrote this song [Chorus] 
I'm lonely without you 
You took my heart & soul away 
I'm not the same person anymore 
I've got no one to talk to (Woah) I can't sleep no more 
Can't breathe no more 
What should i do 
to cheer myself up? 
Can't sleep no more 
Can't breathe no more 
What should i do 
to cheer myself up? [Verse 2] 
I've something to tell you 
Even though what happened 
I ain't gonna lie, i really care about you 
Yeah, my love is true 
But i have no clue 
If i'm gonna love somebody else besides you My heart's screamin out "Want this feeling to go away" 
I trusted you too much, now i'm feeling stupid 
You were playing with my heart 
I don't know what to do, that's why i wrote this song [Chorus] 
I'm lonely without you 
You took my heart & soul away 
I'm not the same person anymore 
I've got no one to talk to (Woah) Can't sleep no more 
Can't breathe no more 
What should i do 
to cheer myself up? 
Can't sleep no more 
Can't breathe no more 
What should i do 
to cheer myself up? [Bridge] 
Oh girl why you broke my heart? 
You broke my heart... 
Why you did that? I can't sleep no more 
Can't breathe no more 
What should i do 
to cheer myself up? 
X2 [Chorus] 
I'm lonely without you 
You took my heart & soul away 
I'm not the same person anymore 
I've got no one to talk to (Oh no) Can't sleep no more 
Can't breathe no more 
What should i do 
to cheer myself up? 
Can't sleep no more 
Can't breathe no more 
What should i do 
to cheer myself up?
