A cheap one 
To take you from here to heaven 
Do you believe that that will do for you? 
A quick one 
To unwind the slow turning hours 
Do you believe that that's what you deserve? You touch my arm with your hand 
And my secret eye sees your shirt on the floor 
And I pull away while trying to stay by your side And I'm tumbling, tumbling 
Out of the open arms of sin 
Tumbling, tumbling 
From ragtime to rags again Listen 
I'm thinking words I'm not saying 
This is not the time to betray my desire for you I'm sorry 
I led you into my indecision 
I was hoping that you could wash my confusion away You touch my arm with your hand 
And my secret eye sees your shirt on the floor 
And I pull away while trying to stay by your side And I'm tumbling, tumbling 
Out of the open arms of sin 
Tumbling, tumbling 
From ragtime to rags again Parting 
Torn from your side with a whisper 
We stare at the clock aware that it's too late Trust me 
Someday we will be lovers 
But somehow I wish that I'd shared a cheap one with you And I'm tumbling, tumbling 
Out of the open arms of sin 
Tumbling, tumbling 
From ragtime to rags again
