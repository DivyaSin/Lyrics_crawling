Needles and pins pierce my heart with their rusty spears 
Like my heart being scooped out and placed on a platter 
Set as this disgusting sight beating before your ever flaming eyes Looks can kill Every glimpse from you tears my heart a little more 
Leaving a hole in my chest, for me to cave in to 
The blood staining your teeth white 
Posing as your sweet tasting lipstick Stapled emotions to this mattress 
My mouth is dry and duct taped shut 
But the words are stamped on my forehead 
Crawl into my pores and make yourself comfortable 
Feel what I'm like on the inside 
An insect crawls in the desert Slept fourteen hours 
Eyes are burning 
Like holes in me draining life fluid Lighthouse lights easily attract you 
That kind of intensity shall only burn you 
This dim candle light would be more soothing 
But the dark glow only hurts your pretty eyes 
Just close your eyes and just feel my warmth My heart is empty 
Torn open and bled dry 
Safety pins 
Hold me together Staring at the stars 
All alone 
Lying here dreaming and set on fire Outside of everything untouched by your, 
Your little world 
Sick, I'm sick 
My heart is empty
