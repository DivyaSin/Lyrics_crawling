One day shy of 8 years old 
Grandma passed away 
I was a broken hearted little boy 
Blowin' out that birthday cake How I cried when the sky let go 
With a cold and lonesome rain 
Momma smiled said don't be sad child 
Grandma's watchin' you today 'Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven 
And her tears are pourin' down 
That's how you know she's watchin' 
Wishing she could be here now And sometimes if you're lonely 
Just remember she can see 
There's holes in the floor of heaven 
And she's watchin' over you and me Season's come and seasons go 
Nothing stays the same 
I grew up, fell in love 
Met a girl who took my name Year by year, made a life 
In this sleepy little town 
I thought we'd grow old together 
Lord, I sure do miss her now 'Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven 
And her tears are pourin' down 
That's how you know she's watchin' 
Wishing she could be here now And sometimes if you're lonely 
Just remember she can see 
There's holes in the floor of heaven 
And she's watchin' over you and me But there's holes in the floor of heaven 
And her tears are pourin' down 
That's how I know she's watchin' 
Wishing she could be here now And sometimes when I'm lonely 
I remember she can see 
There's holes in the floor of heaven 
And she's watchin' over you and me Well, my little girl is 23 
I walk her down the aisle 
It's a shame her mom can't be here now 
To see her lovely smile They throw the rice, I catch her eye 
As the rain starts comin' down 
She takes my hand says daddy don't be sad 
'Cause I know Momma is watchin' now And there's holes in the floor of heaven 
And her tears are pourin' down 
That's how you know she's watchin' 
Wishin' she could be here now And sometimes when I'm lonely 
I remember she can see 
Yes, there's holes in the floor of heaven 
And she's watchin' over you and me Watchin' over you and me 
Watchin' over you and me 
Watchin' over you and me
