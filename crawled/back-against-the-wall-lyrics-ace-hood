[Chorus] 
I got my back against the wall 
And it feels like all the times before 
The pass till the fall 
But today I stand and fight this war 
I got my back against the wall 
I won't break, I won't break, I won't break 
No, no, I won't fall 
With my back against the wall [Verse 1] 
Struggle in my eyes, guns in the stash 
Heart full of pride, sunny days past 
Monogram bags, Louis V. tags 
Money rule the world, I swear this shit is sad 
But I will get over that, and I will get over this 
See they remain to hate, but they'll get over it 
And my mama told me 
Yes she told me watch them friends you with 
Should of listened to her, they manure wasn't worth a shit 
But I'm too legit to quit, understand my arrogance 
Hit them where it hurts, I'm miss him for shit 
Back against the wall, but still I manage to ball 
Success is on my line, but still I manage to call 
I will never fall, that's my reply to all 
He gave me everything, that skies apply to all 
Soul of a beast, I'ma get them all 
Many days of pumps, but still I'm standing tall [Chorus] [Verse 2] 
Uh, and I'm sick of all you blood suckers 
Feel like I'ma lose it in this motherfucker 
Tell me where the booth at in this motherfucker 
So I can burn this bitch down, fireman sucker 
Too many days and sleepless nights 
I toss and turn and wonder why 
My money thoughts corrupted mind 
But I guess that's just how I'm designed 
Felt like I'm falling down, niggas timid to me all around 
But I still remain a beast 
Tell them come fuck with me now, I let you win the fight 
While I'ma die for war, pride and my respect 
I hope you die for yours, money then the power 
Continue doing chores, a back against the wall 
I penetrate a pause 
I'm never looking back, because the destruction caused 
Only know to win, you just check the score
