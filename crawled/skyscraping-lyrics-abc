It`s four o`clock 
And the bells are ringing 
The sun is in the sky 
I hear the song 
That the breeze is bringing 
I smile and close my eyes Slowly drifting 
Deeper and deeper inside 
I hear your voice 
Whispering softly 
We`re leaving the world outside * Just hold my hand 
And we`ll go skyscraping 
So high you and I 
If your mama asks you 
Say we`re just escaping 
We`re gonna be sky high Time flies 
But I don`t know where it`s going 
You vanish in the haze 
Sometimes I wish that life 
Could be everlasting 
These are our Polaroid days Slowly melting 
The sun slips from the sky 
I see your face 
But it`s fading quickly 
We`re leaving the world behind (* repeat 3 times) 
We`re gonna be sky high 
You and me, so high 
It`s gonna be all right
