Was I left behind, someone tell me, tell me I survived. 
Don't look so surprised that I'm home, but just for tonight. 
With rough hands and sore eyes, so don't speak, I am tired. 
Let's just live through this life. She says I swear too much, 
She says alot of things, 
Well I'd swear every other word if I could for her, 
I'd make an attempt. 
Sometimes love isn't about how much someone suits you. 
But how much you're willing to change to suit them. All my bones are dust 
Some people too damaged too much, too late 
And my heart's sealed with rust 
Some people too damaged too much, too late 
These hands will always be rough 
Some people too damaged too much, too late 
I know this won't count for much 
Some people too damaged too much, too late One day my hands were too soft, 
One day she said, I'm tired. 
One day her clothes were on my floor, 
One day, empty bottles. 
Well I'm not saying she's my last. 
I'm just saying that she could have been, 
It doesn't matter how rough these hands get. 
It doesn't matter cause I'm not her man. Rough hands, rough days, 
Rough hands, rough nights, 
Rough hands, rough season, 
Rough hands, rough fights All my bones are dust (rough hands, rough days) 
Some people too damaged too much, too late 
And my heart's sealed with rust (rough hands, rough season) 
Some people too damaged too much, too late 
These hands will always be rough (rough hands, rough days) 
Some people too damaged too much, too late 
I know this won't count for much (rough hands, rough season) 
Some people too damaged too much, too late
