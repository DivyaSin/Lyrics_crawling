Hey cowboy, I dig your blues 
You must have had a heavy day 
Hey cowboy, I dig your shoes 
I know they're walking heavenly ways Now, I know you well enough to say, "yeah" 
Yeah, yeah, to say, "yeah" 
Hey soldier, it's up to you 
To see you make it home today Now, I know you well enough to say, "yeah" 
Yeah, yeah, to say, "yeah" 
Hey soldier, it's up to you 
To see you make it home today "____ all his teeth 
Well, take your partners and dosey doh 
Be like me, and see how it goes"
