Don't need no ivory liquid. Don't want no afro sheen. 
Don't need the latest fashions. Don't want my hair to smell clean. I've got my automotion, 
I've got that superpotion. 
And if you think I'm going crazy, 
Then pretty baby it might be true babe. We don't need no first class. Don't need no second class. 
All of the best-of, all that can kiss my ass. I've got my claim to fame, 
I've got that positive flame. 
And if you think I'm going crazy, 
Then pretty baby it might be you babe.
