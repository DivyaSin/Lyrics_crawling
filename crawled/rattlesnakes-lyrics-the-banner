I check my hand, it's shredded and bleeding 
From holding broken glass punching echoes in the face 
Can't see you, eyes covered, not looking your ice blue eyes pierce like 
Lightning through the space 
Thirteen arrows tear tunnels right through me 
My fingers stuff the holes but the bleeding it persists 
Check my mirror its cracking distorted 
My vision could be questioned but the visage no doubt mine 
And now I'm teasing with these rattlesnakes 
I'm kissing cobras on the head 
I roll the dice despite my past mistakes 
Only the lucky end up dead 
I'll face the pain but the pain ain't mine 
I shouldn't walk this late at night 
Asking for trouble when I climbed that fence 
I'm out of my mind she's out of sight 
Hey mom I'm going out tonight so put my calls on hold 
Now joey no fights tonight, I'd bet shed wish I was 
Hey mom I'm going out tonight so tell em' I'm not home 
Now joey no trouble tonight, how does she always know.
