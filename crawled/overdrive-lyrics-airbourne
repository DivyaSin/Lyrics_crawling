Six days and I ain't seen a bed 
I'm hitting overdrive 
I got a death wish; I'm over the edge 
On a wild joyride 
'Cause it's too much speed and too much booze 
It's a suicide 
'Cause with every second wind I can't lose 
I've never been so alive First gear and I'm feelin' all right 
Second, third, fourth, fifh 
Never die [Chorus] 
Overdrive 
Foot to the floor 
Overdrive 
Give me more 
Overdrive 
Above the law 
Overdrive 
It's how I live my life Caffeine, nicotine, and whiskey 
It's barely enough 
Don't need a cue to sink my eight ball 
'Cause I only play rough, hard stuff Second wind and I'm still alive 
Second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth 
(Then) I'll never die [Chorus: x2] Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive 
Overdrive
