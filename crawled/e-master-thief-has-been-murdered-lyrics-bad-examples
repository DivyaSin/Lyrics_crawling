As a matter of fact, I did see that 
Wondering what you were trying to prove 
Caught in the act in a black and white photograph 
I'll never know how much he stole from you 
Rubies you begged him to take when he left 
I was jealous before but I suddenly understand 
Chorus: 
The master thief has been murdered 
Another legend revealed to be a man 
And all the women are weeping 
Because their diamonds are worthless once again 
Somewhere in the night a church bell is ringing out 
And paris is only an hour away 
We course through the night 
Like the blood from an angry heart 
Chorus 
Hush, baby, hush 
Wish upon your lucky star 
The romance has gone from the boulevard 
And the danger has fled back to the ghetto's embrace 
And this logical world has lost it's magical face 
Chorus 
Put your pictures away with your dreams and your memories 
Just give me your aching impermanent flesh 
Let your decadence rest, tomorrow's another day 
Somewhere in your eyes is a little girl 
Aching for something you never can keep 
Just lay yourself down 
Inspiration will come to you 
Chorus 
The master thief has been murdered(x4)
