Guys like me, we don't know how it feels 
Absentee even closing the deal 
For every player there's a payoff in the final reel 
But never with guys like me 'Cause, guys like me, we're real good at the gate 
You'll agree with the odds on the slate 
And put your money on a bona-fide heavy weight 
And take it off guys like me 
Take it off guys like me They'll pull you close but never really 
Looking warm but feeling chilly 
You'll describe us as impassioned 
When it's just a front we fashion 'Cause, guys like me, we all vow to become 
Clear and free of the fife and the drum 
And block the circulation till we're all completely numb 
Let's hear it for guys like me 
Let's hear it for guys like me 
Let's hear it for guys 
Guys like me
