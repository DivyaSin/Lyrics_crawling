With eyes wide open 
A new life hope 
I just realize it was no surprise 
My heart is broken you got me open 
It will heal in time I will be just fine 
I'm getting stronger, I'm hurt no longer My choice is right now 
I'll take it somehow Yalla Bina yalla Habibi yalla 
I said I said I'm sorry, said I'm sorry 
Yalla Bina yalla We eel Insha' Allah 
And I said com'on ask me, come on ask me Yalla Bina yalla Habibi yalla 
I said I said I'm sorry, said I'm sorry 
Yalla Bina yalla We eel Insha' Allah 
And I said com'on ask me, come on ask me My life is better it doesnt matter 'Cause I feel so free you're a memory 
I will love again 'cause I have a plan 
I'll find a girl that's right by the end of the night 
I'm getting stronger, I'm hurt no longer My choice is right now 
I'll take it somehow Yalla Bina yalla Habibi yalla 
I said I said I'm sorry, said I'm sorry 
Yalla Bina yalla We eel Insha' Allah 
And I said com'on ask me, come on ask me Yalla Bina yalla Habibi yalla 
I said I said I'm sorry, said I'm sorry 
Yalla Bina yalla We eel Insha' Allah 
And I said com'on ask me, come on ask me Yalla Bina yalla Habibi yalla 
Yalla Bina yalla We eel Insha' Allah Yalla Bina yalla Habibi yalla 
I said I said I'm sorry, said I'm sorry 
Yalla Bina yalla We eel Insha' Allah 
And I said com'on ask me, come on ask me
