Hangin at the mall w/ my girls and boys 
Goin in the store and playin w/ the toys 
Slidin down the hall gluin quarters to the ground 
Watch as people see em and then they band down 
Run in the cops, knock over canfood mountain 
Who knew u couldn't take the pennies from the fountain? 
Skatin down the halls and checkin out those skaters 
Running down the upside to the escolaters Dont try to change me 
Dont rearrange me 
I'm not some piece of art 
I aint to bright 
I aint to quick 
But u gotta be smart 
I dont want you 
To make me do stuff 
That aint fun 
But especially dont give me 
No Artificial love If its not wokrin out 
Just tell me and its thru 
And i'm gone 
Here comes the sun I left with the moon 
'cause i dont want u to stick around me 
If u dont care for me 
I dont need no sympathy 
I can take a heartbreak 
Or more 
But be honest and walk out the door 
Instead of not to appreciate 
U will start to hate 
Then u will start to see 
U wish u were honest to me Dont try to change me 
Dont rearrange me 
I'm not some piece of art 
I aint to bright 
I aint to quick 
But u gotta be smart 
I dont want you 
To make me do stuff 
That aint fun 
But especially dont give me 
No Artificial love
