I'm on the phone, you turn your back on me 
And we're all alone, why is this happening? 
I, I never thought I would be questioning 
The one I, one I love But here we are wrapped up in silence 
Can we sound the alarm? 
Both so defiant 
I don't know where to start 
I keep colliding with 
The one I, one I love Don't make it so hard for me to stay You should know better than that 
And before you go on breaking my heart 
And I fall even deeper in love 
And my lungs screaming out "Can you hear me?!" 
You should know better than that 
And here we are, here we are, oh If I could leave, I would be leaving 
Because I cannot believe what I am hearing 
Tell me how can it be I'm second guessing on 
The one I, one I love Don't make it so hard for me to stay You should know better than that 
And before you go on breaking my heart 
And I fall even deeper in love 
And my lungs screaming out 
"Can you hear me?!" 
You should know better than that 
And here we are, here we are, oh 
Here we are, here we are again Some forgive just to forget 
I've not forgotten yet 
I still believe in you 
But there's a crack in our cement 
This time it's permanent, permanent You should know You should know better than that 
And before you go on breaking my heart 
And I fall even deeper in love 
And my lungs screaming out 
"Can you hear me?!" You should know better than that 
And here we are, here we are, oh 
Here we are, here we are again You should know better than that 
And here we are, here we are, oh 
Here we are, here we are again You should know better than that
