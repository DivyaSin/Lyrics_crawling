I tried so hard but in the end I let you down 
You always will be with me 
I will wear your crown 
A time so brief from cradle to the grave 
I feel like giving in but for you I know I must be brave 
And carry on, carry on 
Just for you, I'll carry on They said that I could hold you for a little while 
Just time to kiss those lips that one-day would make a smile 
I don't know what was going through my mind 
To find the kind of strength that you should never have to find 
To let you go 
Let you go, letting go, letting go In the time we had, I blessed him with your name 
Now that he is gone this life won't be the same 
I ask of you to help me carry on 
If you ever need a reason, let this reason be the one 
To carry on, carry on 
Just for you, I'll carry on 
Carry on, carry on 
Just for you, I'll carry on
