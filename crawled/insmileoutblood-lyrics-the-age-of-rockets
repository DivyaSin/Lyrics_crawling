Let's you and I stay awake all night 
we can pretend we feel safe in bed 
we can drink till we're happy again 
a lifeless smile, with no in and no out I think I can 
can taste blood in 
in the back of my throat on day three without sleep 
we can pretend we don't envy the dead 
we can hold our wrists to the sky 
to greet a new day, with no in and no out
