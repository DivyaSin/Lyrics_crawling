A lonely avenue - it's raining in my heart 
No name no number girl - how can I try a start without you girl 
I'm lonely as a cloud - oh when your love falls down 
You'll make the sun keep shining - oh when you're just around, oh I know 
And whatever will be, I promise you love, forever my love Don't let me go, little darling 
Oh no no no no no, little darling, I miss you 
Don't let him know, little darling 
Oh no no no no no, little darling 
That I'm so in love with you 
Oh babe I'll never let you go 
We're flying high, we're flying low 
Oh babe there's one thing you should know 
Oh I'll never let you go, oh And when the sun goes down, my world is in your hands 
Our silver clouds we'll fly, just to the rainbow's end, you and I 
Only my shadow knows, love is on my side 
I fly around the moon, only to hold you tight, only you 
And whatever will be, I promise you love, forever my love
