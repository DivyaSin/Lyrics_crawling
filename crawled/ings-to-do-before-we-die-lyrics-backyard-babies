How would you feel if I was dead 
Not everyone will know what's ahead 
How could you know that I was sad 
'Cause little did you know what you had There was a time when I was young and blind 
Could not see 'cause of my one tracked mind 
There was a time when I was betting high 
Too many things to do before we die You're playing hide and seek 
What you find is yours and always to keep 
Revolution ain't for the weak 
Don't double cross a river too deep There was a time when I was young and blind 
Could not see 'cause of my one tracked mind 
There was a time when I was betting high 
Too many things to do before we die Always a beginning and always an end 
But not very often anything in between How can I make it on time 
There seems to be no reason no rhyme 
Can you face another day 
When you have nothing left to do or to say There was a time when I was young and blind 
Could not see 'cause of my one tracked mind 
There was a time when I was betting high 
Too many things to do before we die
