Well, you hit me like a flood, hit me like a drug in the ocean 
Give me four on the floor and six by the dozen 
Be the life of the party cause everybody's dying to meet you 
They say your body is a palace, but your mind doesn't get you 
And she said stranger (stranger) things have happened to me. I feel like ten men, 
Nine dead and one dying! Well, tonight I realized that it only takes a river to rouse up 
When every night of the week is decorated in [?] 
Back to another figure waiting for the riches to [?] 
She's hiding around the edges, it's cold in the middle 
And she said stranger (stranger) things have happened to me. I feel like ten men, 
Nine dead and one dying! 
I feel like ten men, 
Nine dead and one dying! 
Dying, dying, dying, dying, dying
