On the day I was born 
Set me father said he 
I've got an elegent legacy waiting for me 
It's a rhyme for your lips 
It's a song for your heart 
To sing it whenever the world falls apart Look, look , look to the rainbow 
Follow it over the hills and stream 
Look, look, look to the rainbow 
Follow the fellow who follows our dream It was a sumptuous gift 
To beguile to a child 
Or the lore of that song kept her feet running wild 
For you never grow old 
And you never stand still 
With whipper will singing beyond the next hill Look, look , look to the rainbow 
Follow it over the hills and stream 
Look, look, look to the rainbow 
Follow the fellow who follows a dream Strike one me heart and I roam the world free 
To the east with a lark 
To the west with the sea 
And I searched all the Earth 
And I scanned all the sky 
But I found it at last 
In my own true love's eyes Look, look , look to the rainbow 
Follow it over the hills and stream 
Look, look, look to the rainbow 
Follow the fellow who follows the dream Follow the fellow 
Follow the fellow 
Follow the fellow 
Who follows the dream
