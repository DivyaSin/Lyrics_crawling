I've tried my damnedest to get near you My ears are bleeding trying to hear you I'm lost in the middle of a cold rain And you're forests away Every state I've ever been Has greeted me with a bad beginning To swing you my way I stand in the pathway of a fast train I look around and nobody cares I look around and nobody's there I look around and nobody's there But every night like an army on a foray I try to keep myself contained My thoughts do invade I watch TV ignore the pain I look around and nobody cares I look around and nobody's there I look around and nobody's there You don't believe that I've been through hell You don't believe that I feel alone Cause I'm pretty together and doing well I look around and nobody's there Cause the people that pass me say hello I look around and nobody cares I look around and nobody's there
