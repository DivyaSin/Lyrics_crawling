I know the kind of love you're searching for 
You're looking for a love that lasts forever 
But holding me tonight you can't be sure 
I might be the answer you need 
We can make this dream come true 
I can make it real for you 
You won't find another who will love you like I do 
Cause I I want to get you in My World 
Lonely time when you've been cold and wishing 
You're living with a wal around your heart 
But you may never find the love you're missing 
Baby, baby, baby take your chance on me 
We can make this dream come true 
I can make it real for you 
You won't find another who will love you like I do 
Cause I I want to get you in My World 
All the time you're wasint holding back from me 
So much love here waiting can't you see 
We could be so good 
If you'd just come into my life 
We can make this dream come true 
I can make it real for you 
You won't find another who will love you like I do 
Cause I I want to get you in My World 
How can I get you into My World 
How can I get you into me 
How can i get you into My World 
(If there's a chance I'm gonna find a way) 
How can I get you into My World 
Why can't you find your way to me 
(I'm gonna keep on, keep on asking you)
