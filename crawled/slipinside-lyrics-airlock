It doesn't have to be this complicated 
Or is it just me? I cherish you it's true 
And this love, I value 
If it's not meant to be 
I'll bow to destiny 
And settle for friends Looking to the left, turning to the right 
My life is full of no regrets 
I'll settle, I'll settle for friends [Chorus] 
Friends, I'll settle for friends 
All I want, is to be your friend Friends, we can be friends 
All I want, is to be your friend You tell me you're not ready 
But I'm precious 
You don't want to start something 
You can't finish Sometimes we're blinded by desire 
What you want, not what you need 
Then it's too late 
To make ends meet [Chorus] Your friend, your friend (repeat)
