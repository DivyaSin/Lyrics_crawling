Sorcerers and shamans, weave your spells of war, 
Ensure our mighty sword-arms are the strongest and the quickest. 
Entwine us with great battle magic 'til we stand knee-deep in gore, 
And by all the gods, we'll ride to where the fray rages the thickest! 
(THE WAR-SONG OF THE WOLVES OF CAYLEN-TOR, 
AS HEARD AT THE BATTLE OF BLACKHELM VALE)
