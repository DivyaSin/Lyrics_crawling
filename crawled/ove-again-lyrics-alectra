Oh baby 
Oh baby 
Telling me you love me 
You must think I'm crazy 
You must be sleep talking 
You best be sleep walking 
out the front door and just keep walking You don't know me 
You don't love me 
All you're every saying is 
"Yo, I'm sorry" 
Like I should keep hurting 
You've got the wrong person 
Made up my mind and I'm goddamn certain I'll Shake shake shake you off my shoulder baby 
Fall down down down till you crash and break 
And for me 
I'll live to love again 
Make make making all the boys go crazy 
Love love love it when you say you hate me, I 
I'll live to love again Stop calling 
Stop texting 
Blowing up my phone, no 
I learned my lesson 
You're such a smooth talker? 
Well watch this girl walk her 
Pretty ass away and tell ya don't call her You don't know me 
You don't love me 
All you're every saying is 
"Yo, I'm sorry" 
Like I should keep hurting 
You've got the wrong person 
Made up my mind and I'm goddamn certain I'll Shake shake shake you off my shoulder baby 
Fall down down down till you crash and break 
And for me 
I'll live to love again 
Make make making all the boys go crazy 
Love love love it when you say you hate me, I 
I'll live to love again You let my love down hard 
And I found out that I 
Have a bullet proof heart Shake shake shake you off my shoulder baby 
Fall down down down till you crash and break 
And for me 
I'll live to love again 
Make make making all the boys go crazy 
Love love love it when you say you hate me, I 
I'll live to love again
