I was a silent partner. 
I found myself with the rabble who stood on the mount, 
hipshot, thinking, but not out loud: 
"There are too many prophets here." On the unlucky side of a stab in the dark, 
I took it in silence, I took it to heart. 
I carried it quietly over the wall. 
There were too many prophets there. I was behind it. 
Strike on, zero. 
Strike on, zero. I was a silent partner for once, 
and I had been split into two sections. 
Here is my heart and here is my song. 
There are too many prophets here. I am divided. 
Strike on, zero. 
Strike on, zero. I was a silent partner, 
I know the part of the forest where you shouldn't go. 
Now out of the woods and out in the day, 
I see there's too many prophets here. Strike on, zero. 
Strike on, zero. 
Strike on, zero. 
Strike on, zero.
