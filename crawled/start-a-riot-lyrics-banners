I will march down an empty street like a ship into the storm 
No surrender, no retreat 
I will tear down every wall 
Just to keep you warm 
Just to bring you home 
I will burn this city down for a diamond in the dust 
I will keep you safe and sound when there's no one left to trust 
Will you take my hand? 
We can make our stand If your world falls apart 
I'd start a riot 
If night falls in your heart 
I'd light the fire 
In the dark, when you sound the alarm 
We'll find each other's arms 
For your love, all you are 
I'd start a riot I will wade through the fire and smoke like sunlight through the haze 
I will fight till the flag waves white until my dying days 
Through the bombs and blasts 
We will take it back If your world falls apart 
I'd start a riot 
If night falls in your heart 
I'd light the fire 
In the dark, when you sound the alarm 
We'll find each other's arms 
For your love, all you are 
I'd start a riot I'd start, I'd start a riot 
I'd start, I'd start a riot 
I'd start, I'd start a riot 
I'd start, I'd start a riot Ooh, ooh If your world falls apart 
I'd start a riot
