You tell me lies and you wanna cheat behind my back 
A sense of decency's the only thing you ever lacked 
I was prepared to give, take and understand 
Until I found out, that you acted so underhand Think it's time, better move along. 
Sweet revenge, cos you done me wrong 
Maybe I better take a chance 
And look around for a new romance Vendetta Dansetta Vendetta Dansetta I say I tossed a coin just to see what I should do 
It's head I stay, tales I say goodbye to you 
You messed around now I'm making it my turn to decide 
I hate to think that you wanna take me for a ride (chorus) I see the coin as it goes spinning through the air 
Best out of three cos I thought that was gonna be fair 
It landed heads, and it made me wish that I was dead 
I think I'd better go and cut some" ukin" cards instead. (chorus)
