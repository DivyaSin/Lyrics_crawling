You were once 
My one companion 
You were all 
That mattered 
You were once 
A friend and father 
Then my world 
Was shattered Wishing you were 
Somehow here again 
Wishing you were 
Somehow near 
Sometimes it seemed 
If I just dreamed, 
Somehow you would 
Be here Wishing I could 
Hear your voice again 
Knowing that I 
Never would 
Dreaming of you 
Won't help me to do 
All that you dreamed 
I could Passing bells 
And sculpted angels, 
Cold and monumental, 
Seem, for you, 
The wrong companions 
You were warm and gentle Too many years 
Fighting back tears 
Why can't the past 
Just die? Wishing you were 
Somehow here again 
Knowing we must 
Say goodbye 
Try to forgive 
Teach me to live 
Give me the strength 
To try No more memories, 
No more silent tears 
No more gazing across 
The wasted years 
Help me say 
Goodbye
