The lonely days are over 
Lets meet in the middle 
Ill always be your shoulder, 
I think Ive found a way Im No longer trying find it 
Lets make it official 
I Cant wait another day 
Im wont give it all away 
Coz everytime your gone I miss you 
Oh and I cannot 
I hope you feel the same From the moment that I met you 
I knew you were trouble 
How could I forget you 
Youre always on my mind Im No longer trying find it 
Lets make it official 
I Cant wait another day 
Im wont give it all away 
Coz everytime your gone I miss you 
Oh and I cannot 
I hope you feel the same What else can I do 
Now I found you 
Except hold you tight No more silence 
I made my mind up 
No more wasting time Lets make it official 
I Cant wait another day 
I wont give it all away 
Coz every time your gone I miss you 
oh and I cannot resist you 
I hope you feel the same From the moment that I met you 
I knew you were trouble
