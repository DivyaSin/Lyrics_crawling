Running scared, and out of my mind 
No place is home 
On these streets I reach for the sky 
With a gun in my hand 
And the world in my sights 
I face every day 
But still you turn to look at me and say Hold me now hold me when 
We're running round in circles once again 
Hold me now hold me when 
We feel in need of comfort now and then 
Hold me now hold me when 
We're turning round and burning down Hide by day, and move on by night 
Wrap me in chains 
Set me free when there is no light 
You can't compete with these lies and deceit 
That's my evil way 
But still you dare to look at me and say Somehow these days have turned into years 
I'm finding it hard to reach you 
We can't begin to count the tears 
It's killing me but still I say 
Don't ever let this moment slip away
