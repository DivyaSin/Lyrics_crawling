Hey hey hey 
Someone comin at ya live to make u get down on the floor 
Baha men kickin down the door 
All u boys and girls sing along 
There's no place I'd rather be 
Than on my jet ski out at sea 
Lingering in the ocean blue 
And if I had one wish come true 
I'd surf till the sunset 
Beyond the horizon 
Everyone come ride the wave now 
Everyone come ride the wave now 
Flyin by on a Bahamas roller coaster ride 
(Baha Men rappin) 
There's no place I'd rather be 
Than on the seashore right we're free 
The golden sand is where I live 
And if I only had my way 
I'd play till the sunset beyond the horizon 
Catch a crew. come ride the wave now 
Everyone come ride the wave now 
Time to try the Bahamas roller coaster ride 
All day everyday 
(Baha Men rap) 
Kiss the water 
Kiss the water 
Kiss the water 
Kiss the water 
Ride the wave 
Ride the wave 
Now everybody now ride the wave 
Tick tock 
Ride the water 
Tick tock 
Wipe out 
Wipe out 
Everybody say wipe out 
There's no place id rather be 
Than on my jet ski out at sea 
Lingering in the ocean blue 
And if I had one wish come true 
I'd surf till the sunset beyond the horizon 
Catch a crew come rid the wave now 
Everyone come ride the wave now 
Flyin by on the bahamas roller caster ride 
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaatt!! 
(baha men rap) 
Flyin by on the bahamas roller coaster ride 
Flyin by on the bahamas roller coaster ride

Baha Men 
Represent 
Straight from the shores of nasa
