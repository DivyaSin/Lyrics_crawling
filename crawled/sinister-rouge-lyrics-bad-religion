Innocence Burned, Alive on the Stage 
Tortured and Dumped in nameless graves 
Centuries weighed, authority died 
Scattering seeds of bleach and lye Sinister Rouge 
Coming back for more to even the score 
Sinister Rouge 
Coming back for more to even the score Child molesters and Jesuits 
Holding secret conference 
Underneath the pontiff's nose 
And only god will ever know Sinister Rouge 
Coming back for more to even the score 
Sinister Rouge 
Coming back for more to even the score Give us this day our daily bread 
And then you'll see we'll not forget 
Lick the wounds, cleanse the land 
The modern world rejects your hands Sinister Rouge 
Coming back for more to even the score 
Sinister Rouge 
Coming back for more to even the score
