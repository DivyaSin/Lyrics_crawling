Verse 1: 
Sitting here all alone, yes I is 
Wondering when she coming home 
It's on my mind, why would you lie 
And I feel like dying, too big I'm about to cry 
I'm depressed, I'm getting lazy 
What ima do without my lady 
And I swear I'm going crazy 'cause I can't see you Chorus: 
I feel so much pain I can't even cry 
I feel like I wasted half of my life 
Baby girl I can't take it, all this time that I wasted 
My heart's so broke, it's like it's dead inside 
I feel so much pain I can't even cry 
It's like all the rain has washed all my pride 
Baby girl I can't take it, all this time that I wasted 
My heart's so broke, it's like it's dead inside BG Pastronama: 
It go up down round and round, love roller coaster 
It was fuck me now it's fuck you 
The other man supposed to bring us close but we separated 
Now I barely see your face and I fuckin hate it 
I can't love................... 
I don't wanna love again, man my heart's lazy 
Damn I miss you, you should call me baby 
Used to get excited when you call 
I guess it hurt because i gave you my all 
Ima be a man baby, ima stand tall 
Conscious when it comes to love, I don't wanna be involved 
Ima take it slow, so slow, so slow 
Cause it hurts when it fall 
It's gone take a sledge hammer, 
a couple bombs to knock down this love wall 
Pastronama Chorus: 
I feel so much pain I can't even cry 
I feel like I wasted half of my life 
Baby girl I can't take it, all this time that I wasted 
My heart's so broke, it's like it's dead inside 
I feel so much pain I can't even cry 
It's like all the rain has washed all my pride 
Baby girl I can't take it, all this time that I wasted 
My heart's so broke, it's like it's dead inside Snoop: 
All these feelings that I shared, I want them in return 
Trust never comes easy, it's sumn you gotta earn 
It's sumn you gotta learn, that ain't nobody perfect 
Sometimes I sit and wonder why you hurt me, was it worth it 
Too many lies, too many lies that I done told too many times 
From the start I told you I was gone ride 
But you thought I had a bitch on the side 
Two rights don't make no wrong, two wrongs don't make shit right 
But you fucked up, that's another bitch luck up 
Now my middle finger stuck up Chorus: 
I feel so much pain I can't even cry 
I feel like I wasted half of my life 
Baby girl I can't take it, all this time that I wasted 
My heart's so broke, it's like it's dead inside 
I feel so much pain I can't even cry 
It's like all the rain has washed all my pride 
Baby girl I can't take it, all this time that I wasted 
My heart's so broke, it's like it's dead inside
