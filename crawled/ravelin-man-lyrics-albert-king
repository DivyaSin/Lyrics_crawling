Left my home in Texas 
I moved to Arkansas 
Now if you think I'm goin' back again 
Oh my God, no, no 'Cause I'm a travelin' man, I say I'm a travelin' man 
I don't wanna lose this groove, I got to move 
I'm a travelin' man I've been in every town 
I've been to every state 
Tryin' to find a woman I love 
I'm searchin' for my mate I'm a travelin' man, hey, hey, I'm a travelin' man 
I don't wanna lose this groove, I tell you, I got to move 
'Cause I'm a travelin' man and I've got to go I'm alright 
Oh, come on I'm tired of runnin' 
From door to door 
The girl that I love 
She don't live here no more I'm a travelin' man, hey, hey, I'm a travelin' man 
If I don't wanna lose this groove, I got to move 
'Cause I'm a travelin' man Come on man, let's go 
I'm alright
