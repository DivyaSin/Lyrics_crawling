Hot caffeine is skimming the inside of my lips. 
In this old cafe, warming up my finger tips. Well my memories are vague 
in this melancholy, crowded cafe. Mmm, rainfall is slicing down the window pane. 
And blue walls are blending in with stormy haze. Well my troubles are strayed, 
in this melancholy, crowded, cafe. Yeah... My hopes and my fears 
on the edge of the table 
tell me what my destiny holds. Or should I leave it to fate gazers 
to view just what my crystal balls shows. Well my feelings are grey 
in this melancholy, crowded cafe.
