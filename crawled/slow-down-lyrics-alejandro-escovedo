Let me take your hand 
There's something I want to show you 
Close your eyes and you can hear 
The music in the wind 
Out on the pier 
That's the Ike & Tina Soul Revue 
I don't know what this means to you 
But it was everything to me I was free as the sun 
Shining on our faces 
Free as the light that comes down 
From some other places Slow down, slow down 
It's moving much too fast 
I can't live in this moment 
When I'm tangled in the past Won't you take my coat 
Baby, won't you wear it 
There's so much I, want to share with you 
Every little thing I am Put your arms around my body 
Feel your skin against my skin 
This is where my life begins 
Begins again with you The past is gone 
But it still live inside of me 
Hold on tight 
As we slip into this revelry Slow down, slow down 
It's moving much too fast 
I can't live in this moment 
When I'm stumbling through the past Slow down, slow down 
Yeah it's too fast 
The love in this moment 
Got to let go of the past Slow down 
It's too fast 
Live in this moment 
But I'm tangled in the past
