She's a funky feline machine 
Crazy cat inside your dream 
She's's a honey, she stings like a bee 
You're the punk and she's the queen She's an angel, she's a dove 
With a taste for villains blood 
Packing heat, strutting on the street 
Chew you up and make you meat 
Sexy feline machine You can't stop her 
Ya-ya-ya-ya 
Sexy feline machine 
You can't stop her 
Ya-ya-ya-ya She's a funky feline machine 
Crazy cat inside your dream 
She's's a honey, she stings like a bee 
You're the punk and she's the queen
