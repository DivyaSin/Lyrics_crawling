Slow down, this is such a blur 
Tell me what's the hurry now 
Have we been running round in circles 
Missing all that we could be? 
You say it's not too late We are words on pages that weve left unturned 
An ending no one's ever heard 
We are a story slowly unfolding 
Beautiful words I could walk across the ocean 
With you walking next to me 
And you could melt away this winter 
Now we're starting over 
We will see it's not too late We are words on pages that weve left unturned 
An ending no one's ever heard 
We are a story slowly unfolding 
Beautiful words That last when everything else has passed 
Even when all the stars are gone 
I know every single beautiful word 
That we were will live on I know it's not too late We are words on pages that we've left unturned 
An ending no one's ever heard 
We are a story slowly unfolding 
Beautiful words 
We are a story slowly unfolding
