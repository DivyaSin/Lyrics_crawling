Yeaaaaaa! 
Story goes 
He went down to the crossroads. 
He sat down and kept his eyes closed. 
Everyone has a price child, and what it cost him? 
Was his soul. (Beat Drop) You think you're gettin' away 
No escaping the deal you've made. 
You walked right into his plan 
Run as fast as you think you can 
Back from wherever you came 
Call the devil by any name 
Oh no! Now who do you blame 
Should've listened to what I say. 
What I say. 
What I say. 
YEAH! 
I don't know if I'll be coming home again, home again, No I don't know if I'll be coming home. 
Its a long road to hell without no soul. (Instrumental) (Beat drop) Just when do you think you're getting away? 
No escaping the deal you've made. 
You walked right into his plan. 
Run as fast as you think you can. 
Back from wherever you came! 
Call the devil by any name. 
Oh no! Now who do you blame? 
Should've listened to what I say 
What I say. 
What I say. 
YEAH! 
Let me tell you it's a hard road to hell without no soul. (Beat)
