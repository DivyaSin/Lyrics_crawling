Hammond-Hazelwood You had your faults, I had mine. Nothing's perfect, is it, baby? 
If we'd given it the time, could have worked things out, well, maybe 
Came to thinkin' what the hell 
Not to dwell up on the problems 
Our bodies came together well 
And that was all we cared More and more and more and more 
More of the people gave up looking for 
Avenues to happiness. You hear them say 
"The road to understanding was just too far away." While we watched the little things getting out of all proportion 
There was so much more at stake, but we paid it no attention 
I suppose if we had tried 
We'd have saved the pot from boiling 
But we went and let it slide 
Until we lost control And more and more and more and more 
More of the people gave up looking for 
Avenues to happiness. You hear them say 
"The road to understanding was just too far away." What was bad got worse, what was good just got forgotten 
Could have stopped it there and then, but, girl, we didn't cotton 
In the end we didn't care 
All the love flew out the window 
And I guess, just like you said 
It all got outta hand And more and more and more and more 
More of the people gave up looking for 
Avenues to happiness. You hear them say 
"The road to understanding was just too far away." More and more and more and more 
More of the people gave up looking for 
Avenues to happiness. You hear them say 
"The road to understanding was just too far away." More and more and more and more 
More of the people gave up looking for 
Avenues to happiness. You hear them say...
