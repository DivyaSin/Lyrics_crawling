Maybe I'm mistaken, or did I see it right? 
was that you in the corner, looking at me all night? 
So nice to meet you, I thought I'd come up and greet you 
Hey, how ya doin'? what's your name? I don't mean to be too straightforward, but I can't help myself 
It's you I wanna be with from now on I can't help but thinking we could just get along you see 
And we don't even need to be best friends 
cause I can't help but thinking we could just get along you see 
and we don't even need to be best friends Oh, I could be mistaken, but you and I've got a thing 
Oh energetic, dynamic, extravagant, hot connection 
See you won't ever meet somebody better baby 
At least nobody better who will matter baby I don't mean to be too straightforward, but I can't help myself 
It's you I wanna be with from now on 
And no one can believe what's going on, yeah 
I can't help but thinking we could just get along you see 
And we don't even need to be best friends 
cause I can't help but thinking we could just get along you see 
and we don't even need to be best friends I can't help but thinking we could just get along you see 
And we don't even need to be best friends 
cause I can't help but thinking we could just get along you see 
and we don't even need to be best friends Let's go, let's go girl, let's go, let's go girl (Repeat) 
I can't help but thinking we could just get along you see 
and we don't even have to talk or nothing 
I can't help but thinking we could just get along you see 
and we don't even need to be best friends I can't help but thinking we could just get along you see 
and we don't even need to be best friends
