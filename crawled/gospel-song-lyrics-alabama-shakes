Joe, What am I to do? 
I've been all 'round this world 
Lookin' for something like you Oh...oh... 
I always roam, but 
I still ain't got what I want Here,...i'm here and i'm there 
Ive been around, Joe, but I ain't going nowhere Oh...Joe 
Don't leave me on my own 
Cause I still ain't got what I want No, I still ain't got what I want 
No I still ain't got what I want 
No I still ain't got what I want 
If I ain't got you... Now...they put me on a plane 
And im flying out somewhere that I ain't never been 
Oh...Lord...why you keep me so long? 
And I still ain't got what I want Now Joe, Lord gave me a lot of things 
I've fulfilled a lot of wishes. 
And I've seen my dream 
But OH...Joe...Don't you leave me on my own, 
Cause I still ain't got what I want No I still ain't got what I want 
No I still ain't got what I want
