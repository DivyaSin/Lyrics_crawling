Here I am without a place to start 
Lost inside the desert of my heart 
All of my mistakes are adding up 
Take them all away, I've had enough Heal my jaded soul 
And I'm gonna feel the weight letting go Be alive in me 
I know I'm Yours forever 
Be alive in me 
I know I'm Yours So take me and shake me 
I know I'm needing You to 
Be alive in me I need You here so we can talk it out 
I'm giving You the things that pull me down 
Jesus, can You teach me how to stand? 
And if I fall I want to fall into Your hands So heal my jaded soul 
'Cause I wanna feel the weight letting go Be alive in me 
I know I'm Yours forever 
Be alive in me 
I know I'm Yours So take me and shake me 
I know I'm needing You to 
Be alive in me, I'm Yours 
I'm Yours Excite me, ignite me 
Relight this fire 
Excite me, ignite me 
Relight this fire Be alive in me 
I know I'm Yours forever 
Be alive in me 
'Cause I know I'm Yours So take me and shake me 
I know I'm needing You to 
Be alive in me, I'm Yours 
Be alive in me, I'm Yours 
Be alive in me
