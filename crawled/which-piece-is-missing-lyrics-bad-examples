I don't know much about the things that make you who you are 
A couple of dozen stories, some snapshots from your childhood 
But here in the dark it's clear that we both have our share of scars 
Some only scratch the surface, some have sculpted who we are 
(chorus) 
I don't know which piece is missing from your heart 
I don't know which piece is missing Running around in circles...running into each other 
I didn't mean to let you come too close for comfort Chorus Now that the shouting's over, try to accept each other 
Faults you'll forgive a friend for are hard to take in your lover 
And now that I sung about you and all your insecurities 
You can take this song and sing it right back at me
