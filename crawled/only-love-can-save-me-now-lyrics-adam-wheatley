I have followed my heart to a barren land 
Made my bed of rocks and sand 
I have loosed my grip that once held Your hand I have begged again for a second chance 
Then turned away without a glance 
And even I've grown tired of this song and dance 
Hallelujah Only love can save me now 
Free me of my fear and doubt 
I need You from the inside out 
Only love can save me now I have made a fool's request 
Took my inheritance and left 
But You were closer then than my next breath 
Hallelujah Only love can save me now 
Lay to waste my fear and doubt 
I need You from the inside out 
Only love can save me now You have long looked past my shame 
Noticed me and called my name 
You sought me out and staked Your claim 
Hallelujah Only love has saved me now 
Turned my fear to holy ground 
I was lost but now am found 
Only love has saved me now Only love, only love 
Only love can save me now
