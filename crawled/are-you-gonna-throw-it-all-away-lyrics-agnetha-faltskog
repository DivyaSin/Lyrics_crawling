You've been lookin' for a reason 
You've been trying to find a way 
To find an easy way of leavin' 
'Cause you can't find a way to stay 
If it's not workin' 
Why can't we work it out? 
Baby, it's just so wrong 
To be walkin' out 
Don't walk out Are you gonna throw it all away forever? 
Aren't you gonna give us one more try together? 
Are you gonna take the love we made 
And throw it all away? We've got somethin' good between us 
Something we might never find again 
Before you go searchin' for another love 
Look at what you got right in your hand 
Wish I could make you see 
What you'd leave behind 
Wish I could change your heart 
So you'd change your mind 
Change your mind Are you gonna throw it all away forever? 
Don't you think you're gonna find a love that's better 
Are you gonna take the love we made 
And throw it all away? 
Throwing it all away
