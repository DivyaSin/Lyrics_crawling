If you're gonna break another heart, then break it 
Come on and break it 
If you're gonna take that kind of chance, then take it 
Go on and take it Anything I say or do will make no difference 
In the end you'll go ahead 
And do what you really wanna do If you're gonna break another heart, then break it 
If you're gonna take that kind of chance then take it 
You are free to take it 
But don't come runnin' back to me If you're gonna make another change, then make it 
Go on and make it 
If you're gonna do it, do it now, don't leave it 
'Cause I can't take it Everybody knows that you were born a drifter 
You were born a drifter, baby 
You'll never, never settle down If you're gonna break another heart, then break it 
If you're gonna take that kind of chance, then take it 
You are free to take it 
But don't come runnin' back to me If you're gonna play another tune, then play it 
If you're gonna say what's on your mind, then say it 
Go ahead and say it 
But don't come runnin' back to me
