You knew you were right-until I proved you wrong 
You knew you were on track-till I showed you that you were lost 
You knew that things were going good-till I showed you what life's really like 
You're not everything you thought you were *chorus* 
It's not too late, not yet at least 
You can always change for the better 
I'm not saying it's easy, but neither is life 
You've noticed your mistakes, it's time to make a change You knew you weren't right - when I showed you how bad you were 
You knew you were lost - but I told you how to get back on track 
You knew things weren't good - when I showed you your life 
Do you notice the mistakes you've made
