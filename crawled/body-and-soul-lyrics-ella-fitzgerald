My heart is sad and lonely 
For you I pine, for you dear only 
Why haven`t you seen it? 
I`m all for you, body and soul I spend my days in longing 
And wondering why it`s me you`re wronging 
I tell you I mean it 
I`m all for you, body and soul I can`t believe it, it`s hard to conceive it 
That you`d turn away romance. 
Are you pretending? It looks like the ending 
Unless I can have 
Just one more chance, dear My life a wreck you`re making 
My heart is yours for just the taking 
I`ll gladly surrender 
Myself to you, body and soul
