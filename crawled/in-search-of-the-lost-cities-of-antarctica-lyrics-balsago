[The Explorer:] 
Beneath the ice, the endless ice of Pangaea's now axial 
eternally frozen frontier, entombed for countless millions of years... the 
lost cities of Antarctica! Secrets locked within the ice, the endless ice of Antarctica, 
'Neath the peak of Erebus the First Ones sleep, Lords of Pangaea, 
Cities lost within the night, the frozen night of Antarctica, 
Pre-Cambrian, the Voyagers, beyond the stars, Lords of Pangaea. [The Testament of the Winds:] 
Once, the coruscating spires of man here offered their splendour to the 
heavens. Now, those spires gleam no more, save in dreams of verdant plains, 
save in dreams of time-lost citadels. 
Legacy of a utopia lost, forever enshrined 'neath the ice... [Echoes of the First Ones:] 
Sail across Panthalassa to Gondwanaland, 
Three moons to guide us on this voyage across the sea, 
Sail across Panthalassa to Gondwanaland, 
New lands to conquer and claim for our progeny. [The Testament of the Winds:] 
Before the Third Moon fell from orbit, before the 
Nine Continents were formed from Pangaea's shattered surface... 
Hewn from the Pre-Cambrian rock, behold this primordial metropolis! 
And the First Ones shall awaken on that day, when man will return to the stars! [Echoes of the First Ones:] 
We, who were before Man, are destined to be the 
architects of his future! [The Explorer:] 
And humanity shall one day rediscover the secrets long-frozen 
within the lost cities of Antarctica! 
There will come a day when the ingenuity of man shall pierce that impenetrable 
shield of ice which keeps Antarctica's wonders from our inquisitive gaze, and 
I truly believe that day shall herald a glorious new era of enlightenment for 
us all.
