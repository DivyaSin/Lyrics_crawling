One lifting sigh leaves me light, leaves me light. 
In the darkness of midnight I am blinded, I am blind It's this crooked and old blue house 
It's the bend of the willows bough 
Bowing to the ground And I could hear it breathing 
Creeping from the darkness in my room 
It's sneaking up on me 
Drifting in my ears like a slow tune 
My imagination, oh 
It can be a dangerous refuge 
There's no way to escape it 
This fear is always stalking after you 
There's nowhere to run Fleet of my time but my arms open, arms are wide 
Peek in my mind just to find a mess of a life It's the spin of the ceiling tiles 
It's this rusted and concrete mind 
That's bending the bind And I could hear it breathing 
Creeping from the darkness in my room 
It's sneaking up on me 
Drifting in my ears like a slow tune 
My imagination, oh 
It can be a dangerous refuge 
There's no way to escape it 
This fear is always stalking after you 
There's nowhere to run And I could hear it breathing 
Creeping from the darkness in my room 
It's sneaking up on me 
Drifting in my ears like a slow tune 
My imagination, oh 
It can be a dangerous refuge 
There's no way to escape it 
This fear is always stalking after you 
There's nowhere to run 
Nowhere to run 
Run, run, run.
