Everybody's talking nobody says a thing 
Everybody's talking nobody's listening 
Brimstone hell and fire chase the lamb away 
You can't see the heavens 
For the Light of Day I find it oh so hard to believe 
I find it oh so hard to be free 
I find it oh so hard to be me 
All for the light of day 
Dark minds, dark times, dark age You angels shine your halos 
You preachers grip your books 
Mount your golden soapboxes 
To get a better look 
But you don't let your high horse 
Carry you so far away 
You can't see the heavens for the light of Day Hypocrites and homeless 
Murderers and thieves 
Nobody gets to heaven but you and your flock of sheep 
Guess it's a private party for your preacher and you ma 
Where you sit around the snakepit 
And pass judgment on us all
