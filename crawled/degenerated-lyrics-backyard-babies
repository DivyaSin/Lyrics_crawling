Who's the man? Who's your God? 
Who's the creep that you've been dreaming of? 
Are you degenerated? So my emotions betrayed me and left me behind 
I couldn't be bothered and you couldn't fuck with my mind 
And now I just see no other way out 
Let's erase and rewind Who's the man? Who's your God? 
Who's the creep that you've been dreaming of? 
Are you degenerated? Who's the ace? Who's the star? 
Who's the pig with that fat cigar? 
Wooh, degenerated Meet your maker, not a giver, I'm a taker 
And I leave you bleeding to die 
Sooner or later I'll sleep with the enemy 
So high Who's the man? Who's your God? 
Who's the creep that you've been dreaming of? 
Are you degenerated? Who's the ace? Who's the star? 
Who's the pig with that fat cigar? 
Wooh, degenerated You wanted to be in my nightmare, wake up and be blind 
Bite the bullet, never saw that you were coming so fast 
I'm a dangerous kind Who's the man? Who's your God? 
Who's the creep that you've been dreaming of? 
Are you degenerated? Who's the ace? Who's the star? 
Who's the pig with that fat cigar? 
Wooh, degenerated 
Degenerated Who's the man? Who's your God? 
Who's the creep that you've been dreaming of? 
Wooh, degenerated? Who's the ace? Who's the star? 
Who's the pig with that fat cigar? 
Wooh, degenerated Who's the man? Who's your God? 
Who's the creep that you've been dreaming of? 
Wooh, degenerated? Who's the ace? Who's the star? 
Who's the pig with that fat cigar? 
Are you degenerated?
