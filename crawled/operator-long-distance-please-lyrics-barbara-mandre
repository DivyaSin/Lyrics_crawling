(Kye Fleming - Dennis W. Morgan) I woke up alone the bed was so cold 
I learned a lot in just one night 
I don't like T.V., I don't like to read 
And I don't like this single life 
I don't even mind if he says I told you so 
I gave it one night that's long enough to know Chorus 
Operator, Long distance please 
Could you ring this number for me 
I've been callin' all afternoon, 
There's something wrong 
I can't get through 
Operator, long distance please, 
I can't wait for him to call me 
I only need a second or two, 
That's all it takes to say I love you I called yellow cab to see where they had taken him last night 
I called the airlines, they checked his flight 
He was on the 8.09 
I called the hotel where he stays when he goes to L.A. 
They said he checked in late last night, Room 245 Chorus I've got to keep dialin' tryin' can't you see 
If I can just reach him, he'll come back to me
