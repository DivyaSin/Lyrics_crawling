Virgin Mary was laden with child 
The prophecy had been foretold 
The One who had come to save our lives 
Was born in the manger so low 
And as sure as the stars are in the sky 
Valleys low and mountains high 
The newborn King was born 
In Bethlehem tonight Silent night, holy night 
Bethlehem tonight 
Silent night, holy night Three kings brought gifts from far away 
A boy came to play upon his drum 
Skeptics saw truth and had nothing to say 
The wonderful Savior had come 
And as sure as the stars are in the sky 
Valleys low and mountains high 
The newborn King was born 
In Bethlehem tonight Silent night, holy night 
Bethlehem tonight 
Silent night, holy night Behold our Redeemer from sin 
There was no room in the inn 
But still He left His throne on high 
Shed His blood 
To saved our lives, our lives 
In Bethlehem tonight Silent night, holy night 
Silent night, holy night
