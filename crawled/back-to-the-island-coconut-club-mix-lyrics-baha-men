Wake up early one mornin 
kiss my mama good-bye 
Going back to the island

I sure hope that she's still able 
Sow the seed around 5 o'clock 
I'll stand at her bow and see the dark 
Out in the field from dawn till dusk 
Swimming in the blue hole is a must 
That island where i was born 
First thing I'll do is grow some corn (Chorus) I've been Cooking outside in the island pot 
So young when I learn I haven't forgotten 
how to catch them dark crabbas dey walkin 
Old folks smokin pipes and talkin 
Saturday night we gonna dance and sway 
Shake my belly and do the Gongay 
People don't you understand
