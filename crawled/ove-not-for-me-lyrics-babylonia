The sailor fighting the ocean 
Love, it's not worth anything 
The sinner chasing devotion 
Love, it's not worth anything Love seeks and finds me 
Just to hit and paralyze me 
It overwhelms me 
As heavenly as could be 
The most intriguing fatal lie 
The sweetest of deceits in disguise Tame me, use me, please me, tease me, 
break me, hate me and pierce me to the bone 
Tame me, use me, please me, tease me, 
break me, hate me and rip away my soul 
'cos I live in love, I live to love, I live for love 
Tame me, use me, please me, tease me, 
break me, hate me as far as I can see 
Love, not for me With all those hidden subtle tricks 
Love, it's not worth anything 
Puzzling paradoxes 
Love, it's not worth anything Love calls my name 
And I'm rushing once again 
It crucifies me 
It tempts and mesmerizes me 
The most deceptive and sweet trap 
A journey that we live without a map Hunger for a yearning 
I feed my soul burning 
And I give in 
Yes, I give in
