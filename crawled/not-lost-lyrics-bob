[Chorus - B.o.B] 
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost 
They gave me nothing but doubt 
First they waited, than they hated, than counted me out 
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck 
They say I lost my way 
But first I showed them, than I sold them right in front of they face [Verse 1 - B.o.B] 
Well, this is the world that we live in 
One minute you the hero, the next you the villain 
We got up in this game just to try to make a living 
We hit you with the truth while you watching television 
But still, these are the cards that we dealt 
They kicked you on the ground when you most need help 
Until you dried up and they sit you on the shelf 
And then you start to cry because you all by yourself 
So just know if you want to wear the belt 
The only way to excel is the soul that you sell 
So I could care less about the clothes on myself 
I'm trying to drive straight on a road made of nails 
Yeah, I got to pay the toll if I fail 
Or else it'll be another story to tell 
I'm getting to the door I can tell 
I'm just waiting on the day till the glory prevails [Chorus] [Verse 2 - T.I.] 
All I know is keep going, shit don't stop 
Until the hustle double up to put the click on top 
Used to want to have the bricks on lock 
Till we went to prison saw we couldn't pick them locks 
Easy decision, now a nigga think I lost my touch 
Listen if I ain't the realest ever done it I ain't off by much 
So please don't wake me up if I'm dreaming 
In the fast lane speeding no safety belt 
And it's a marathon pace yourself 
In this race for wealth, talking shit just a waste of breath 
Chasing me like chasing your tail, you'll never catch it 
Respect is something you never get if you never had it 
I'm looking back and laughing this life of mine 
Brought me all the way here form a life of crime 
Just a constant reminder that the end all be all 
Is the one who knows all sees all 
Because [Chorus] [Verse 3 - B.o.B] 
Yeah, well these are my predictions 
I'll be on the Top 40 with a big hit 
Travelling the world trying not to get sick 
And I'ma get more friends on my friends list 
And then after that, I'll be famous 
And everyone I know will tell me that I'm changing 
And then my cell phone will never stop ringing 
And I'll be all over magazine pages 
Yeah, and they'll play my songs till they boring 
And if I ever do stop touring 
They treat me like a foreigner 
Don't believe me ask Lauren [Chorus]
