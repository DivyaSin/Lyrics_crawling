Another lonely night 
Surrounded by breathing 
I called him dynamite (liar) 
Shot and sleeping, he believes me You boys are all talk 
Sexually nowhere 
Alone, in the dark 
Nice try, but the spark isn't there These men are a virus 
They come, and go 
Take their fill and sneak away 
I'm a needle in a negligee 
Come to me, lover When I hit the streets 
The mongrels are seething 
Tourists love the city at night 
Me, I see demons breeding 
"Hey pop, over here 
I've got something for you" 
(Poor slob, smelling of beer 
Nice suit, for an old buffoon) I don't need this shrink to fit life 
I need somebody to help me 
Can anyone set me free? 
Come to me, lover Another lonely life 
Surrounded by choices 
Choices made outside of light 
Controlled by hidden voices 
Sometimes we're all talk 
Spiritually nowhere 
In our hearts, the key to new life 
Sometimes, afraid to show it Lives so tragic; they come and go 
Crossing our paths every day 
So easy to turn them away 
Yet we are called as lovers
