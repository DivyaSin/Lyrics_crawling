You took to the light 
And they call you a fool 
You think "It's alright" 
It's all part of the rules 
But don't look away 
Till you've seen the light 
Or they'll get to you 
Well if you want to stay 
Then do what you gotta do [Chorus] 
See the light and you will find the answer 
Morning, night anytime 
See the light and you will find the answer 
Morning, night anytime If you see the light 
You want to give up 
Cause they're getting to you 
They say live it up 
And stop being a fool [Chorus] If you see the light [Chorus] If you see the light 
And you do it right 
And shake things up 
And just get it right 
Don't be a fool 
Play it cool 
Just get it right 
Look to the light 
Yeah!
