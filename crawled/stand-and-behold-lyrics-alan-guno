Stand and Behold the Name of the Lord 
The power of our Call 
Stand and Behold - Hes made us His own 
His Mercy comes to all 
From the dark night, His Loves Light 
Is ours to be claimed 
Call on the power of His Name 
His Name We still remember the chains of our past 
Silenced by slaverys fear 
Out of the darkness, rejoicing at last 
Our voices rise out of our tears Calling His name, desert sands shout for rain Stand and Behold the Name of the Lord 
The power of our Call 
Stand and Behold - Hes made us His own 
His Mercy comes to all 
From the dark night, His Loves Light 
Is ours to be claimed 
Call on the power of His Name 
His Name Long well remember the stillness of days 
The cries of His passion so new 
Run from the tomb that now breathes with our praise 
And rings with the hymns of His Truth Strength now is found - with our faith we call out Stand and Behold the Name of the Lord 
The power of our Call 
Stand and Behold - Hes made us His own 
His Mercy comes to all 
From the dark night, His Loves Light

To Him our hearts belong 
And were now sure that His Word

Leading us into His light
