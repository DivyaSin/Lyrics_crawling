(Seventeen) 
Mama drama's got to go, dad 
(Seventeen) 
Nothing's gonna bring her back (Seventeen) 
Experiment with something living 
(Seventeen) 
And I'm sweeter than sixteen Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Seventeen) 
I've always longed for true affection 
(Seventeen) 
But you compare me to a corpse (Seventeen) 
Stay with the dead, I'm joining the living 
(Seventeen) 
'Cause I'm freer than sixteen Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey Something's changing, I can feel it 
I'm seventeen now 
Why can't you see it? Seventeen and you can't stop me 
Seventeen and you won't boss me 
You cannot control me, father 
Daddy's girl's a fucking monster
