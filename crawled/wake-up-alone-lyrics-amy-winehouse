It's okay in the day 
I'm staying busy 
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he 
Got so sick of crying 
So just lately 
When I catch myself, I do a one-eighty 
I stay up, clean the house 
At least I'm not drinking 
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking 
That silent sense of content 
That everyone gets 
Just disappears 'soon as the sun sets He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts 
He floats me with dread 
Soaked in soul 
He swims in my eyes by the bed 
Pour myself over him 
Moon spilling in 
And I wake up alone If I was my heart 
I'd rather be restless 
The second I stop, the sleep catches up 
And I'm breathless 
'Cause this ache in my chest 
As my day is done now 
The dark covers me, and I cannot run now 
My blood running cold 
I stand before him (before him, I) 
It's all I can do to assure him (assure him) 
When he comes to me 
I drip for him tonight 
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts 
He floats me with dread 
Soaked in soul 
He swims in my eyes by the bed 
Pour myself over him 
Moon spilling in 
And I wake up alone 
And I wake up alone 
And I wake up alone 
And I wake up alone
