There's a late night diner on the south side of town 
That pretty girls on Friday should never hang around 
But the lady two seats over is sitting there crying all alone 
If she's here at this hour it must be hell on her at home I'm not trying to know your business 
I'm not trying to change your life 
It costs a lot to love somebody 
And I know because I had to pay the price I finished up my coffee and put my dollar down to leave 
If I was a few years younger, she'd be coming home with me 
But that'd be the bad decision that I made one too many times 
You know we might be forgiven; I'm just not good company tonight I'm not trying to know your business 
I'm not trying to change your life 
It costs a lot to love somebody 
And I know because I had to pay the price 
It costs a lot to love somebody 
And I know because I had to pay the price
