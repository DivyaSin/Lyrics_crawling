Don't' look so sad 
I know it's over 
But life goes on 
And this world 
Keeps on turning 
Yeah 
Let's just be glad 
We have this time 
To spend together oh 
There is no need 
To watch the bridges 
That we're burning hey oh Lay your head on my pillow sweet babe 
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine hey 
Hear the whisper of the raindrops 
Roll softly 
Against my window hey hey oh late at night 
Make believe you love me one more time hey 
For the good times hey 
For the good times I'll get along 
I'm sure you'll find another but baby please remember 
I'll be here, I'm gon stay right here 
And you should ever find that you need me yeah 
Don't say a word 
About tomorrow 
Ah forever and ever and ever and ever 
They'll be times 
Enough for severance when you leave hey hey hey 
For the good times 
For the good times Lay your head 
On my pillow 
Oh this is one time girl 
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine 
Hear the whisper 
Of the raindrops 
Rolling softly against my window 
Oh you gotta do is 
Oh you gotta do is make believe you love me one more time 
For the good times 
For the good times
