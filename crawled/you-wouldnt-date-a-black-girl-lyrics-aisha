Intro chorus: You're famous now 
You've made it 
You know the game 
And you've played it 
But black people helped bring you into this world 
So why don't I ever see you with a black girl 
(A pause in the record so you can hear a pin drop) 
No I don't hate you 
And no I don't want to date you 
But it seems to me 
And many in this world 
That you just wouldn't date a black girl Verse 1: Let alone marry one 
Carry one to the alter 
But in your own private world 
You're the rock of Gibraltar 
But that rock is crumbling fast 
Denying your past 
Now I agree that love knows no color 
And that we should all love each other 
And you say that's true 
But you're never with anyone that looks like you Repeat (intro) chorus Verse 2: I don't have a color preference 
Color is not my point of reference 
But it is for you 
And you know it too 
If the one you love is black 
And you are white 
Do what's right 
And marry them for life 
It takes character to 
See it through 
The incentive to love you 
For who you are 
Not because you're a star Rap: No, I'm not hating 
And this song isn't about interracial dating 
First of all let me clear the air 
If it weren't for interracial relationships I wouldn't be here 
My grandparents weren't the same color 
But with them they really loved each other 
As with all the interracial relationships of my family and friends 
Love is always the message they send 
And that's real 
But with you that's not the deal 
This song is about famous black men like you 
And all the discriminatory things you do 
Once you become known 
You feel you've outgrown 
Your own race 
And are too much for this place 
I'd date a person regardless of their color 
But you date a person because of their color 
One after another 
They're never black 
So please tell me why is that 
I mean, not even a token Negro 
And what about me 
I'm as cute as can be 
Are you trying to tell me you don't like me 
(I'm not vain, really) 
It's because I'm black 
And ironically you're black too 
But somehow that just doesn't matter to you 
And that's sad 
Do you really think being black is that bad 
You distance yourself from the black community 
Under the guise of racial unity 
You say you love everyone 
But you don't 
You don't love your own race 
Or yourself 
You actually think you're something else 
Hey, you know what they say 
Walks like a duck... Chorus: Black people helped bring you into this world 
So why don't I ever see you with a black girl 
(Now for a pause in the record so you can hear a pin drop) 
No I don't hate you 
And no I don't want to date you 
But it seems to me 
And many in this world 
That you just wouldn't date a black girl 
Black girl
