Wrists are severed 
The deepest cuts are traced in red 
So beautiful 
The separation of her flesh from the razor 
Feeling a pain she's never known 
Like broken glass 
Draining the blood that's running cold She tasted eternity 
It's kiss like a last goodbye 
As she's taken herself from me 
Forever abandoned Eyes held open, the bitter taste of blood and sweat 
The emptiness 
The suffocates a final breath, endless silence 
That dulls the pain beneath her skin 
Her vacant eyes watching the blood that's running thin She tasted eternity 
Its kiss like a last goodbye 
She's taken herself from me 
FOREVER ABANDONED!
