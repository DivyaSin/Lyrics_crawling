I be missin' you, missin' you, missin' you 
I be missin' you, missin' you, missin' you 
I be missin' you, missin' you, missin' you Thinking back on yesterday, 
All the things I could've said, but didn't say to you 
Should've begged you to stay, 
Heard you moved on... Heard you've been doing okay 
Been thinking 'bout you all the time 
Do you ever reminisce? Do I be crossing your mind? 
All the tears and wasted time 
Nothing's been the same since you went away Girl, I know that I... 
Used to be your man, 
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand 
I let you slip away, just like grains of sand When I'm lying in my bed at night 
Wish I was holding you, wish I was touching you 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
Wish I was kissing you instead of just missing you Girl I keep holding on, Girl I keep holding on 
Girl I keep holding on, Girl I keep holding on 
Girl I keep holding on, Girl I keep holding on Wish I could turn back the hands of time 
Inside me there's so many questions why 
I'm still wanting to live a lie 
But in my heart I know it's just too late 
It's just like standing out in the pouring rain 
I refuse to believe that I'll never see you again 
All that's going on inside my brain 
That I can't seem to get it straight Girl, I know that I... 
Used to be your man, 
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand 
I let you slip away, just like grains of sand When I'm lying in my bed at night 
Wish I was holding you, wish I was touching you 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
Wish I was kissing you instead of just missing you Girl I keep holding on, Girl I keep holding on 
Girl I keep holding on, Girl I keep holding on 
Girl I keep holding on, Girl I keep holding on And if I ever hurt you, I didn't mean to treat you bad 
I think about the goods times that we had 
And there's no way we can be done Girl, I know that I... 
Used to be your man, 
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand 
I let you slip away, just like grains of sand When I'm lying in my bed at night 
Wish I was holding you, wish I was touching you 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
Wish I was kissing you instead of just missing you Girl I keep holding on, Girl I keep holding on 
Girl I keep holding on, Girl I keep holding on 
Girl I keep holding on, Girl I keep holding on
