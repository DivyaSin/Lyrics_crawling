Lola When you look at me that way 
Makes me wanna walk away from you, from you, from you, 
I see an evil in your eye 
When your tears were running dry Who knew, who knew, who knew, 
Tastes so guilty on your tongue 
you cant hide from what you've done Coz you friends, don't pretend, don't pretend 
Don't you tell me how he got his way 
I've got nothing more to say Again, again, again Now I'm singing Lola, Lola, Lola 
Lola, lola, Lola 
Stay another day See people told me it was true 
I just couldn't defend you No more, no more, no more 
No you won't be laughing in my face 
My medicine you will taste Not yours, not yours, not yours 
Feel so guilty on your own 
Tryna blame me with that tone to your Friends don't pretend, don't pretend 
You can see me tryna shout it out 
All you do is pull that frown Again, again, not again Still i'm singing Lola, Lola, Lola 
Lola, lola, Lola 
Stay another day There's a hole 
In the place, where you stay 
Said it all, but I know 
There's a way Be my girl 
Be my girl But now I'm singing Lola, Lola, Lola 
Lola, lola, Lola 
Stay another day 
Won't you stay another day Be my girl!
