All un-tucked from a late night binge 
Look, the ass is drunk again! 
I say, So fucking what 
I'd knock that smile off your old mans face 
If it didn't mean losing all grace in your eyes 
I didn't mean to barge right in 
But I just had to see you again And it was 
Perfect timing 
Giving up on me 
Cause you were sick of fighting 
What could and shouldn't be 
And baby I don't mind 
If it takes all night 
Cause it's just perfect timing 
For us to get it right Let your friends talk shit about me 
They'll take shit and we'll just be happy 
Let's get on my motor bike 
Baby let's just run all night 
L.A. or Miami you choose 
Yes, I know it's dangerous 
And that's just the kind of love you need And it's just 
Perfect timing 
For you to break your plans 
And it's just perfect timing 
To say that I'm your man 
Cause baby I don't mind 
Putting up a fight 
Cause it's just perfect timing 
For us to get it right
