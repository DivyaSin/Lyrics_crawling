Situated in the present alive in the 
Moment of now separated from 
Attachment 
- gone but not forgotten what is meant 
To be inevitably will be, destiny a force 
Rather than an outcome of events 
My point of change is on the horizon, 
What brought it together now took it 
Away 
Chapters open, chapters close, 
Opportunities rise and fall like an 
Everlasting circle 
My memory still plays the events 
Affection is a state of mind. 
My mind is altered. 
Emptiness is eventually filled, 
The universe unfolds 
- things shall be as they are. 
Although I often deviate I always return 
To me. 
Many paths are marked for us
