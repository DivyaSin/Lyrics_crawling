[Verse 1: Ab-Soul] 
My only fear is fear itself 
I ain't afraid to die, more afraid of myself 
Niggas looking at me like I don't hear myself 
Like I don't know pain, I been here myself 
This life will drive you crazy 
Only if you let it 
I'm just an American expressing, give me some credit 
Won't be surprised if before I rise, I'm beheaded 
These are the days of our lives 
Nightmares of a thief coming, taking my life 
I go to sleep thinking I may never wake up 
In this reality, at least I keep my bed made up 
I just wish they all could see what I can see 
If we could stop it with the violence and apply a lil' logic I believe 
We could strive to be a promising civilization 
We may die individually, but as a nation 
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga 
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga 
It's not time, until it's our time [Hook] 
Don't be so afraid to die 
Until it's our time 
Don't be so afraid to die 
It's our time, til it's our time 
Cause we'll never die [Verse 2: Ab Soul] 
All I see is confusion and chaos 
Blatant disorder, authorities picking on the minorities 
Unfortunately, the land of the free has little to offer me 
And got me often thinking about offing me 
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself 
Is life worth living, should I blast myself 
I'm tired of being broke and even worse 
The upper class acts like they don't want me on this Earth 
This life will drive you crazy 
Only if you allow it 
That's only if you a coward and you're sure to get devoured 
To no avail, tuck your tail, and all you do is give them power 
Who's gonna take a stand, who's gonna be a man 
Who do you work for, please help me understand 
You could be the victor in a situation 
We may die individually, but as a nation 
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga 
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga 
It's our time, until it's our time [Hook] [Verse 3: Punch] 
Pardon my immortality 
I'm Martin Luther shooting back on the balcony 
Escaping the Lorraine until they call in the cavalry 
Alpha 184, oh Lord, nobody blast for me 
If it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther 
Nigga show me to the slaughter 
I gladly sacrifice what is percieved 
Sow my seed, so my seed can live its dreams 
My spittin' image, see my stitching in his genes 
According to my likeness, his breath of life is priceless 
My enlightenment's the ancient Chaldeans 
Penetratin' America's culture, to its very being 
It's not political though, it's more critical 
Spiritual warfare, you can murder me in the physical 
But I advise y'all to keep me alive 
In the event of my demise, I'll be bigger than life 
Beautiful death, nigga [Bridge: Ab-Soul] 
Tragedy after tragedy, I know it's sad to see 
America killing her babies like Casey Anthony 
We try, we try to cope and hold on to our sanity 
Popping ecstasy will surely shorten life expectancy 
We travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace 
We promised pie in the sky, I'm dyin' to get a piece 
Put down your piece, I'm wish you all a beautiful death 
Peace
