No sign of life 
Pulsing through these aging veins 
"I bet it's your age", that's easier for you to say 
Forcing answers into questions 
And worrying that you might stop breathing On and on we sift through alphabets of life 
That never get us anywhere, anyway 
I'd like you to feel we have the best intentions 
I want you to know that I know it's not easy 
I want you to know that I know it's not easy 
Easy, easy Then there's a peak you reach 
Out to somebody that's never even there 
Somebody that you may hope that they might care 
For nearby health, or distant welfare 
I'm pleased to hear that you're warm, 'cause I'm freezing 
Yeah, I'm freezing 
Co-old I don't want to be alone, is that out of the question 
I'd like to have you home, is that too obvious 
Quit being pushed around, stand on my feet 
And kick all these losers out of my street I've been losing confidence in the heat 
Just when I'm feeling the strength, I get weak 
I've been losing confidence in the heat 
Just when I'm feeling the strength, I get weak Duba-da-duba-da-do

Out to somebody, a peak you reach
