Silvery moon do a dance for me 
Could you make me feel like this was meant to be 
Could you make me feel at home wherever I stand 
Cause once you crossed over there's no turning back All this river shivers in the cold tonight 
and I stand almost frozen under the neon light 
take my hand walk me down by the riverside 
cause once you crossed over there's no turning back Without a trace, without a sign 
Without a name, without even a dime 
Would I believe it to be true for I must follow through, 
Even if it means that I believe in you All this deja vu makes me feel all right 
like I'm right on schedule 
even though sometimes I get tied 
but i wont be afraid when i see the morning light 
cause once u crossed over there's no turning back
