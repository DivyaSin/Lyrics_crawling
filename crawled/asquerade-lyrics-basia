I've got a friend who had a schoolboy dream 
He wanted every luxury that money could bring 
He fancied himself as a King of the castle 
Impressing all the ladies with the size of his car 
But none of them would have it 
They left the morning after 
As a giver of love he was a walking disaster Who will ever know of this charade 
Unless you tell us who you really are 
How far will you go 
Down a road that's paved with gold but takes away your soul Come to masquerade 
Keep your heart out of sight 
You can be a winner 
A master of disguise Then one night he met a beautiful girl 
She was a viable concern, he couldn't help thinking 
But he ran out of small talk and started to panic 
The comedy was turning into something tragic 
Never mix business with pleasure 
You can play them independently but never together Who will ever know of this charade 
Unless you tell us who you really are 
How far will you go 
Down a road that's paved with gold but takes away your soul Come to masquerade 
Keep your heart out of sight 
You can be a winner 
A master of disguise
