Hush little baby, don't say a word 
Mama's gonna buy you a mockin' bird 
And if that mockin' bird won't sing 
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring 
And if that diamond ring is brass 
Mama's gonna buy you a lookin' glass 
And if that lookin' glass gets broke 
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat 
And if that billy goat won't pull 
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull 
And if that cart and bull turn over 
MAma's gonna buy you a dog named Rover 
And if that dog named Rover won't bark 
MAma's gonna buy you a horse and cart 
And if that horse and cart fall down 
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town Sleep child, and when you do 
Dream a dream to drift you through the night 
that lingers through the day Tonight, 
if dreams are few 
I'll sing this lullaby for you 
Sleep child, for dreams always come true Lullaby and goodnight, may sleep softly surround you 
While your dreams fill your eyes with a melody of love 
May the moonlight embrace you 
The starlight caress you 
May the sunlight still sing you this lullaby of love
