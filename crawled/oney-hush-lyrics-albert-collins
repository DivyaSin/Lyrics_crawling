Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much 
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much 
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us You start talkin' in the morning, you're talkin' all day long 
I'm tryin' to figure out what I did wrong 
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much 
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us I stay out all day long, you know I hate to come home 
Everything I do, seems to be wrong 
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much 
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't rest in peace 
I'll be better off, you know, walkin' the streets 
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much 
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us
