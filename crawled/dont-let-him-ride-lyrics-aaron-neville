Don't let the devil ride 
Oh, don't you let the devil ride 
If you let the devil ride, he will wanna drive 
Don't let him ride Don't you let him flag you down, oh 
Oh, don't you let him flag you down 
If he flags you down, he'll turn your soul around 
Don't let him ride Don't you let him be your boss 
Oh, don't you let him be your boss 
If you let him be your boss, your soul will be lost 
Don't let him ride Don't let him drive your car 
Oh, don't you let him drive your car 
If you let him drive your car, he'll surely go too far 
Don't let him drive Don't you let him call your name 
Oh, don't you let him call your name 
If you let him call your name, you'll get there just the same 
Don't let him ride Don't let the devil ride 
(Don't let the devil ride) 
Don't you let the devil ride 
(Don't let the devil ride) Don't you let the devil ride 
(Don't let the devil ride) 
Don't you let the devil ride 
(Don't let the devil ride) Don't you let the devil ride 
(Don't let the devil ride) 
Don't you let the devil ride 
(Don't let the devil ride)
