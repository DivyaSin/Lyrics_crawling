You got your big idea 
I got my big idea 
And anyone who wanna stay can stay 
If they can find a reason Your line around the corner 
My line is turning over 
And I don't need to see the light of day 
To feel it on my shoulder All of my ins are on the outside 
And I want you all to notice 
'Cause I have no will to hide With only dark around me 
So cold I couldn't ever 
Manage to see the curtains draw their weight 
Around me like a sweater And hold all my memories of shelter 
Beside me like a furnace 
Either way I choose to turn And leave me out so long, I doubt I'm ever gonna be 
So picked apart and practiced at the art of never changing 
And it's all so much, the weight, the words, to resonate 
I finally have, I finally have, alright already 
So much for the rest And hold all my memories of shelter 
Beside me like a furnace 
Either way I choose to turn And leave me out so long, I doubt I'm ever gonna be 
So picked apart and practiced at the art of never changing 
And it's all so much, the weight, the words, to resonate 
I finally have, I finally have, alright already 
So much for (so much for) the rest
