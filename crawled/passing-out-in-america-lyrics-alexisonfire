No, I won't go, I want to stay here with you... Now, say what you need, don't hesitate make that call. 
If you need help, scream "HEY YOU", quietly one more time "hey you". Dreams they don't help, but they do stop the hurt for now. 
I guess we will have to figure this one out... Now, say what you need, don't hesitate make that call. 
If you need help, scream "HEY YOU", quietly one more time "hey you". It's the passing of America [x26] 
(trust your heart, your heart) [x4] I wanted to cry [x5]
