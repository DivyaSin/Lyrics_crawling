Hey Do What You Want 
But Don't Do It Around Me 
Idleness and dissipation breed apathy 
I sit on my ass all god damned day 
oh misanthropic anthropoid with nothing 
to say what you must , do all you can , 
break all the fucking rules , and go to hell with 
Superman and die like a champion ya hee! 
Hey I don't know if the billions will survive 
but i'll believe in god when 1 and 1 are 5 
my moniken is man and i'm rotten to the core, 
i'll tear down the building just to pass through the door 
so do what you must, do all you can , 
break all the fucking rules , and go to hell with 
Superman and die like a champion ya hee!
