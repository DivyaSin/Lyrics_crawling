I'll charge the mound to the top of the hill.I'll make you proud with my very first kill.Something about the ride and the thrill,you don't know now but soon you will.My father said to me,I'll help you lead this killing spree.Together you'll learn to be a man;I'll try to help you where i can.This is the end of you;I couldn't stop if i wanted to.Call me the patient one.We march together the fight has begun.Our words are weapons we wound with our tongues.We got no limitations,fight for months.This is the end of you;I couldn't stop if I wanted to.Bring me...the head of.Bring me the head of self-righteous ignorance.Bleed slowly cut deeper these people aren't your friends.Bring me the head of those who get in your way.On honor I promise this shit will stop today.My father said to me,I'll help you lead this killing spree.Together you'll learn to be a man.I'll try to help you where I can.And when the day is done I'll tell you go reload your gun.Tomorrow we hunt again,Go to some place we've never been.I'll charge the mound to the top of the hill.I'll make you proud with my very first kill.Something about the ride and the thrill,you don't know now but but you soon will.Call me the patient one.We march together the fight has begun.Our words are weapons we wound with our tongues.We've got no limitations I'll fight for months.
