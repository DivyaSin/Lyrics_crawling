Epicurean theme to a never-ending sequence 
Burns me out, dries me up 
Up and out and through 
My plans disappoint, drain my cup 
Blind man sat in his room and he cried 
"Tomorrow promised me triviality" 
Bite the bait, swallow the hook 
Hooked in routine instead of living 
Wonder what's become of me What's become of me? 
What's become of me anyway? I've been uncaring, unconcerned 
Except at what comes dangerously close to 
Overturning my house of cards 
Falls fast and furious 
Scattering shapes of well-worn self-conceit 
Blind man shook his fist and he cried 
"Surely those were my rights" 
As if it were as bad as that 
To be condemned to doing as thou wilt 
Wilt and fade away 
The kernel must first 
So here I wait for You I wait for you 
I wait for you all the while
