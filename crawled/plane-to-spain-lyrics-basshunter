I'm falling down, I'm turned around 
I'm falling down, I'm turned around I'm falling down, I'm turned around 
No matter what I do I hit the ground 
I don't want to do this anymore 
But everyone is coming back for more With my love, they want to play 
I could stop them but I look away 
What have I done? I should have known 
If I hide something I'll be alone But now I know how to be strong 
I have to find a place where I belong 
And take a plane, maybe to Spain 
I will never be betrayed again I'm falling down, I'm turned around 
But everyone is coming back for more With my love, they want to play 
I could stop them but I look away 
What have I done? I should have known 
If I hide something I'll be alone But now I know how to be strong 
I have to find a place where I belong 
And take a plane, maybe to Spain 
I will never be betrayed again I'm falling down, I'm turned around 
But everyone is coming back for more
