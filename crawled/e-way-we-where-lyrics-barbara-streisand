Mem'ries light the corners of my mind. 
Misty water color mem'ries of the way we were. 
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind. 
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were. Can it be that it was all so simple then, 
Or has time rewritten ev'ry line? 
If we had the chance to do it all again, 
tell me, Would we? Could we? Mem'ries may be beautiful, and yet,What's too painful to remember 
We simply choose to forget. So it's the laughter we will remember, 
When ever we remember the way we were, 
The way we were.
