He fights hard, will he reach his aim 
He'll survive for his friends 
He is like a crying wolf tonight 
He's the winner in the end 
He is proud and he'll take his chance 
He is fighting for his last friends 
But his freedom 
Oh, it's not for free 
But he feels, he will 
Survive He is free, free like the wind 
He is free and he will win 
Cause he's fighting 
For the honor 
To be free 
He is free, free like the wind 
He is free and he will win 
Cause his heart is brave 
He's fighting for his life, oh no He had it all 
What they took away 
Sometimes proud and sometimes sad 
But he's fighting for a better life 
What you give is what you get 
He can make it 
If he really tries 
Take the chains, throw them away 
He has the power and he don't 
Give up 
Feeling stronger every day He free, free like the wind 
He is free and he will win 
Cause he's fighting for the honor 
To be free 
He is free, free like the wind 
He is free and he will win 
Cause his heart is brave 
He is fighting for his life, for his life
