Take me on, don't leave me blue 
Nobody knows me better than you 
Stay with me, you can help me through 
Nobody loves me better than you I know crying is useless 
But I don't, I don't want it to end this way 
'Cause I love you, I want you, I need you 
Don't ever walk away Share my life, like you used to do 
Nobody loves me better than you I know crying is useless 
But I don't, I don't want it to end this way 
'Cause I love you, I want you, I need you 
Don't ever walk away, don't ever walk away
