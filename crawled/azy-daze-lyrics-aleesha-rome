Beneath suburban skies of blue 
There is a nightmare coming true 
He's leaving home 
Cause his daddy takes to drinking 
And likes to beat him black and blue At 13 he knows how to score 
And he don't feel much any more 
As he lies on the floor 
Of his mothers arms he's dreaming 
His memories are just a blur Hazy daze, Living like there's no tomorrow 
Hazy daze, A perfect world no hurt no sorrow 
Hazy daze, A shadow always walks behind you 
Hazy daze, For you and I and the world we're living in Beneath the cold grey city skies 
He's standing 16 stories high 
With the wind in his hair 
He's falling to his freedom 
Into an angels arms this time Hazy daze, Living like there's no tomorrow 
Hazy daze, A perfect world no hurt no sorrow 
Hazy daze, A shadow always walks behind you 
Hazy daze, For you and I and the world we're living in Sure as the sun will shine 
These days are yours and mine 
And we own these hazy 
days Beneath the cold suburban skies 
He's standing 16 stories high
