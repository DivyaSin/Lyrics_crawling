From the depths of depression subsiding below 
To the center of your pain as all hatred grows 
You swear to avenge 
Destroy self control 
Ideas self destruct 
Your warmth turns cold 
Revenge so sweet 
Kill this beast 
I lost respect for your beliefs 
Your soltion is no solution 
I am this beast 
You say you're blind 
You see 
You can't believe reality 
Corrupt regenerate disease 
Lost in ignorance 
Their pain is seen 
Revenge they'll pay 
You're as guilty as they.
