I'll hire Dalton, Jack of Spies 
To uncover all the lies, all the lies You think you're all alone 
But you're next to the Jack of Spies 
The Feds can't close in on him 
He's so deeply in disguise He'll pitsol whip you in the face 
And turn you in for the prize 
Invest it all in the Dow Jones 
You know his stock's on the rise Who you call when you're in trouble? 
Better be the Jack of Spies 
Dalton gets there on the double 
Rides a bike for the exercise 
He'll discover all the secret files 
Disappear without a trace 
Though you might pass him in a crowd 
You won't recognize his face 
You won't recognize his face
