Basement Jaxx 
Scars Coming, coming, coming 
Coming, coming, coming, coming Coming loose at the seams 
Blind spots, voices 
Controls gone, I'm like a balloon 
Cut it out, emotion Distance, it grows now 
You don't reach for me 
All I got, all I got is my scars Save me, give me wings to fly 
Make me your reason to fight 
Say my name across your heart 
Remember me into the night Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss me then I'll wake up Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss 
Fairy tales make up Headlights like demons 
Peering in my hollow core 
Grunge heads, they're strangling 
On splinters and dry skin Streetlights, they see me 
The whole world will reach for me 
All I got, all I got is my scars Save me, give me wings to fly 
Make me your reason to fight 
Say my name across your heart 
Remember me into the night Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss me then I'll wake up Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss 
Fairy tales make up I'll kiss you then you'll wake up 
Don't want to meet your maker 
And you don't believe in fairy tales 
Well, today I'm gonna make ya 'Cause I've come here to save ya 
Finna none of that miss, I'ma take ya 
I can rap, I can rhyme like karma 
Be your knight in shining armor Oh no, I ain't got no Porsche 
Just give me a shield and a sword and a horse 
And I'll come ridin', ridin', ridin' 
Give me a little mmm, mmm on the back I'mma tell a lie and get you on back 
I'mma tell a lie and get you on back 
It's gone right from fiction to fact 
I'm gonna take you out this world Coming, coming, coming 
Coming, coming, coming Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss me then I'll wake up 
Kiss me then I'll wake up Kiss me, then I'll wake up 
Kiss me, then I'll wake up 
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss 
Fairy tales make up Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me 
Kiss me, kiss me 
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss 
Fairy tales make up
