I feel something runnin' through my veins 
And it feels like I'm goin' quite insane 
And I can't find the cure anymore 'Cause she wouldn't love me 
Too young and I was too drunk 
And I always been talkin' talkin' 
Praying like a dog in the rain 
Like a dog in the rain She said, you wanna ride with me 
With a Jack in my hand, baby 
I'm gonna sit outside your door 
And try to understand 'Cause you got a strange kind of attitude 
Don't you see that I miss you too 
What the hell am I gonna do with a girl like you 
With a girl like you What can I do 
When I saw you walkin' with another man 
All I can walk with now is my bottle, hand in hand And don't try to tell me 
Stories that I've already been told 
Doin' alright, baby 
Just a drunk like me on my own 
On my own She said, you wanna ride with me 
With a Jack in my hand, maybe 
I'm gonna sit outside your door 
And try to understand 'Cause you got a strange kind of attitude 
Don't you see that I miss you too 
What the hell am I gonna do with a girl like you 
With a girl like you I was out walkin' one lonely night 
And the rain was pouring down her cheeks 
She said to me, honey, love is like a smoke 
And it always disappears Don't try to run 
And don't try to cry 
And don't try to throw my bottle away 
'Cause I don't know how to love someone 
But I think I can find my way She said, you wanna ride with me 
With a Jack in my hand, maybe 
I'm gonna sit outside your door 
And try to understand 'Cause you got a strange kind of attitude 
Don't you see that I miss you too 
What the hell am I gonna do with a girl like you 'Cause you got a strange kind of attitude 
Don't you see that I miss you too 
What the hell am I gonna do with a girl like you 
With a bitch like you 
With a girl like you 
Baby, I can find my way
