If god had long hair, and a gottie, 
And if his eyes were pretty glazed, 
And he looked spaced out would you buy hhis story, 
Would yo believe he had an eye infection? [Chorus] 
And yeah, yeah, god looks baked 
And yeah, yeah, god smells good 
And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
What is god smoked ?, 
Hit the bong like some of us, 
Drove a tydie microbus,and listens to rolling stones, If god a place in the beging and did he grow any seeds , 
Or did he put them there for adam and eve, 
So theyed be hungry for the apple that the snake was offerin [Chorus]
