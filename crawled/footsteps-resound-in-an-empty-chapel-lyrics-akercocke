Hear me, the Antichrist is coming 
He who opened his mouth in blasphemy 
Against God and His Tabernacle 
And those that dwell in the Heavens He denies the Father and the Son 
He refutes that Jesus is the Christ And it was given unto him 
To make war with the saints 
And to overcome them all, power was given over 
All kindreds and tongues and nations I am an idea, I exist 
Live and breathe, I am real Call it a moment of inspiration 
That allowed my existence 
I am a raw and terrible God 
I am Antichrist Sticky white bile 
Smeared and splattered 
Around gray lipped mouths 
Heavy death that rapidly decays The rich and the poor The rich and the poor 
We are all the same in death 
The unmistakable fragrance 
Of rigid decomposition exacts no distinction
