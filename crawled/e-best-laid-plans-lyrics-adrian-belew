What happened to the sweet love you and me had 
Where did all of that stuff start to go so bad 
What happened to the sweet love you and me had 
Where did all of that stuff start to go so bad 
Out of control 
Walking on the edge of my soul 
Bad, out of control 
The best laid plans never get laid 
The best laid plans 
Never get laid
