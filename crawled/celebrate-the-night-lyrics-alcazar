We are the ones 
We put a spell on you 
Your life will go on and on 
From dusk till dawn 
Celebrate the night You've been looking for attraction 
We go deeper than that 
Couldn't get no satisfaction 
Gonna show where it's at Felt us move in the corner of your eyes 
Saw us dance irresistible disguise 
Come on groove in the heat of the night 
Welcome in 'Cause we are the ones 
We put a spell on you 
Your life will go on and on 
From dusk till dawn 
Celebrate the night Living our lives in sin 
Kissing your velvet skin 
Stay with us forever more 
But not before 
We celebrate the night You've been looking for a sunrise 
I go deeper than that 
So quit pretending that you're cold as ice 
I know you better than that Felt you move in the corner of my eye 
Saw you dance irresistible disguise 
I wanna groove in the heat of the night 
So count me in 'Cause we are the ones 
We put a spell on you 
Your life will go on and on 
From dusk till dawn 
Celebrate the night Living our lives in sin 
Kissing your velvet skin 
Stay with us forever more 
But not before 
We celebrate the night Let's celebrate the night 
Let's celebrate the night 
Let's celebrate the night 
Let's celebrate the night Let's celebrate the night 
Let's celebrate the night 
Let's celebrate the night 
Let's celebrate the night 'Cause we are the ones 
We put a spell on you 
Your life will go on and on 
From dusk till dawn 
Celebrate the night Living our lives in sin 
Kissing your velvet skin 
Stay with us forever more 
But not before 
We celebrate the night We are the ones
