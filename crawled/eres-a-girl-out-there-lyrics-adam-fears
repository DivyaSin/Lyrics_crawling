I don't know how many times I've heard it 
You can't find it there's no such thing as perfect But there's a girl out there 
Used to sit on my tailgate 
Talk about her hometown 
She'd take me there someday 
There's a girl out there 
She danced in her bare feet 
Sang along with the radio 
Even though she was off key 
If you ever meet her you'll know you've seen her I swear 
There's a girl out there She gives the sun a pretty good run for it's beauty 
Don't know where she is but the thought of her kiss still moves me, yeah There's a girl out there 
Used to sit on my tailgate 
Talk about her hometown 
She'd take me there someday 
There's a girl out there 
She danced in her bare feet 
Sang along with the radio 
Even though she was off key 
If you ever meet her you'll know you've seen her I swear 
There's a girl out there There's a girl out there 
Used to sit on my tailgate 
Talk about her hometown 
She'd take me there someday 
There's a girl out there 
She danced in her bare feet 
Sang along with the radio 
Even though she was off key 
If you ever meet her you'll know you've seen her I swear 
There's a girl out, there's a girl out there 
There's a girl out there I don't know how many times I've heard it 
You can't find it there's no such thing as perfect 
But there's a girl out there
