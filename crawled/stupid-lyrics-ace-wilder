One last drink before we go 
We head into the night 
Raise our glass and toast the world 
Hear this one last time 
Say a prayer for any man who's willing to go down 
Tell the ones who need to know 
We're taking it back this town! Dumb and drunk and high 
It's the best night of our lives 
And tomorrow we'll ask why 
But tonight we're making history 
History Stupid boys and stupid girls 
We're stupid just because 
We're free to be what we wanna be 
And smart we never was 
Let's get stupid! 
Stupid is as stupid does 
We're stupid just because 
We're free to be what we wanna be 
And smart we never was 
Let's get stupid! 
Let's get stupid stupid stupid stupid! No regrets, don't hesitate, that's another day 
Worry about other shots that you didn't make 
Let the ones who got away stay left behind 
Fireworks light up the sky, yup that's our sign Dumb and drunk and high 
It's the best night of our lives 
And tomorrow we'll ask why 
But tonight we're making history 
History (x2) 
Stupid boys and stupid girls 
We're stupid just because 
We're free to be what we wanna be 
And smart we never was 
Let's get stupid! 
Stupid is as stupid does 
We're stupid just because 
We're free to be what we wanna be 
And smart we never was 
Let's get stupid! 
Let's get stupid stupid stupid stupid!
