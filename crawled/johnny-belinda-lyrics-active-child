I came home 
In the morning 
Just a little bit ago You lie asleep 
In our bed 
All twisted in your clothes And the rain came down 
On our rooftop 
In a rhythm like this Let the hair stand up 
On my shoulders 
When you open your mouth You say aaoohh 
Say aaoohh So I wrote you a letter 
Wedged into my forearm 
With the pen that you gave me 'Cause if there's one thing that I mustn't face 
This is permanent 
This is permanent Wish that I was strong enough 
Wish that I could give it all 
Wish that I could change enough 
To be yours Wish that I could give it all 
Wish that I was strong enough 
Wish that I could change enough 
To be yours Wish that I was strong enough 
Wish that I could give it all 
Wish that I could change enough 
To be yours Wish that I could give it all 
Wish that I could change enough 
Wish that I was strong enough 
To be yours
