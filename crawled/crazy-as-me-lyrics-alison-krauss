I'm used to being alone. 
Except for six month flings with diamond rings and phone bills that outweigh the phone... 
This is the life that I choose. 
I got no complaints if he is; 
if he ain't, I guess he'll send me a rose. Just don't ask me for the truth if you choose to lie honey. 
And don't try to open my door with your skeleton key. 
Some folks seem to think I only got one problem. 
I can't find nobody as crazy as me. I still love what I know. 
I love to ride alone and sing a song and listen to the radio. 
You can ride alone and if you change your mind, well, that's just fine, but there is somethin' that you got to know: Just don't ask me for the for the truth if you choose to lie honey.
