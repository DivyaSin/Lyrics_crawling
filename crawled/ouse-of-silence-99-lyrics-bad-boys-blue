In the house of silence In my dreams I met a girl 
Somewhere down the river 
She took me to an ancient house She looked young but also wise 
Something made me shiver 
She was both dead and alive 
And I could see the ravens fly In the house of silence far from here 
Distant voices coming out of the air 
The house of silence sends out tears 
Shadows dancing for a hundred years and they cry You can't rescue me from silence 
From the cage of time 
You can't rescue me from violence 
And give me back the peace of mind I saw her sleep but couldn't hear 
What the girl was saying 
And sadness filled the misty night And then I tried to hold her back 
While she was slowly fading 
Bittersweet was her smile 
And I could see the ravens fly In the house of silence far from here 
Distant voices coming out of the air 
The house of silence sends out tears 
Shadows dancing for a hundred years and they cry You can't rescue me from silence 
From the cage of time 
You can't rescue me from violence 
And give me back the peace of mind 
(Give me back) [Incomprehensible] 
[Incomprehensible] In the house of silence far from here 
Distant voices coming out of the air 
The house of silence send out tears 
Shadows dancing for a hundred years and they cry 
In the house of silence, in the house of silence
