A call for penance 
Cracks in the hands of a stranger 
Rescue me to come back 
A call for deliverance 
Ghosts in the air that we breath 
Watching our every last word Whisper 
Whisper So what should I do 
About a boy 
Who won't listen Erase 
Erase us 
Erase this world A call for penance 
Crack in the hands of a stranger 
Are calling me home 
Sheer disobediance 
Simply a lack of love 
I'm warming up 
To come home 
To come home So what should I do 
About a boy 
Who won't listen So anxious to find 
Any other way 
But won't listen, no Erase 
Erase us 
Erase this world Erase 
Erase us 
Erase this world
