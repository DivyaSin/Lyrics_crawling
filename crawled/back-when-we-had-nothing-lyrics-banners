Flags upon the floor 
And on this cold war 
Battle torn 
Soldiers fold 
Lay down your arms 
Losing all control 
And down this rabbit hole 
Lost souls letting go 
But I won't Down these halls 
These holy walls 
Echoes of light 
Lost in time 
Do you hear me call? Back when we had nothing 
We never stopped running 
Back when we had nothing 
We had everything 
I feel my blood rushing 
Burning like a glory blaze 
Back when we had nothing 
We had everything Eyes against the walls 
Won't surrender 
Bullets fly 
Blinding skies 
If we die tonight 
When it all goes up in flames 
We'll fly this hurricane 
We'll wash away like tidal waves 
As it fades Down these halls 
These holy walls 
Echoes of light 
Lost in time 
Do you hear me call? Back when we had nothing 
We never stopped running 
Back when we had nothing 
We had everything 
I feel my blood rushing 
Burning like a glory blaze 
Back when we had nothing 
We had everything We had everything 
Back when we had nothing 
We had everything Back when we had nothing 
We never stopped running 
Back when we had nothing 
We had everything
