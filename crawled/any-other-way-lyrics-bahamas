I love you baby and I want to know 
If the little baby that's inside of you grows 
Months will pass by and when you start to show 
That's when I'll be jumping for joy 
Oh that's when I'll be jumping for joy I'm so happy that you're ming all mine 
I'll get your loving in the evening time 
I know you think it's trouble 
And I hate to burst your bubble now I love you baby and I've just gotta say 
If the little baby that's inside of you stays 
Years will pass by and when we're both old and gray 
That's when I'll be jumping for joy 
Oh that's when I'll be jumping for joy 
Oh that's when I'll be jumping 
Fist in the air pumping for joy 
I wouldn't have it any other way
