it can't be right to say good-bye in a boring way 
and as your tears run down i knew i couldn't walk away 
the look in her eyes and the way she she smile yeah 
and now i'm walking all alone on this blvd 
and now i wonder how you feel and where you are 
ten minutes is a life time 
and i just i just want to know why you were the one 
but you said good-bye 
you were my everything my life 
you changed your mind 
and now i'm walking alone 
oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh 
oh oh oh oh and now i'm sitting here in heart break avenue 
and now i see her walking the coner with someone new 
the look in her eyes and the way she she smiles yeah 
and then you said to me that i was the only guy (only guy) it was me you you and me you and i 
ten minutes is a life time 
and i just i just want to know why you were the one
