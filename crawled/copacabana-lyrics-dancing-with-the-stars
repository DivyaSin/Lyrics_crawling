Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair 
And a dress cut 
Just cut down to there She would merengue 
And do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar Across the crowded floor 
They worked from eight 'til four 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? At the Copa, Copacabana 
The hottest spot, north of Havana 
At the Copa, Copacabana 
Music and passion were always the fashion at the Copa 
They fell in love, love
