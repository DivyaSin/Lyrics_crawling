A real playa like Pinky, when Im in the game, I TD 
And Im all about my dollars, dollars, dollars, thats 3D 
I wake up with a bad bitch by my side

Looking at the city that raised me

And go get everything they never gave me Like every day that I wake, I say grace for my cake 
Ima do dessert first, I dont even gotta wait 
Yea, when I hit the mall, I hit that bitch in the face 
God be so good to me, I just gotta stop and pray 
By the way, my jewelry appraised, its a couple K 
On the lake, Im out of the state, at my hideaway 
Like Bruce Wayne, Im saving the day, and Im getting bank

I woke up, my dough up, I got out, I go nuts 
I show out, I blow up, I ball out, I po up 
Ok its Early Mac off in this ho, tailor-made designer coat 
Watch me take it to the bank and deposit a pot of gold
