White bird in a black cloud 
You flept, eyes rolled back 
Medicine gave you a heart attack 
Big flight for a small ride 
First flight into white light 
Pull the trigger love at first flight 
Big plan for a big man 
Tough change for a tough guy 
Teaching out the corner of your eye 
White bird in a black cloud 
Rain comin' down, thinking hey 
maybe we should turn this boat around 
Heaven - maybe freedom 
What''s the word? Right, I forgot 
Quiet is the closest thing we got
