Liar, liar! 
Why on earth won't tell the truth? 
Liar, liar! 
Can't nobody see the lie of you? Follow you to dust 
Leaving footprints on the clouds as we're walking home 
Iron hearts all turn to rust 
By tears and the days on a diamond street Is this apocalypse? 
Chasing shadows, living dreams that don't exist 
Anymore... 
We need to find a way... Well, we are who we are, and we're all going under 
When the past with the last and will last until under Liar, liar! 
Why on earth won't tell the truth? 
Liar, liar! 
Can't nobody see the lie of you? Wall closing in your head 
Counting heartbeats 'til the feeling's good and gone 
On a dark path there to watch 
A sad greed pouring rain over everything You'll think it's apocalypse 
With the whispers of the sand and the sun eclipsed 
Forever more 
We need to find a way... Well, we are who we are, and we're all going under 
When the past with the last and will last until under Liar, liar! 
Why on earth won't tell the truth? 
Liar, liar! 
Can't nobody see the lie of you? They keep talking but I can't hear them, no 
I just sit there and watch them come and go 
There might be something underneath it all 
But at least I'll find, we'll all find out in the end 
But at least I'll find, we'll all find out in the end
