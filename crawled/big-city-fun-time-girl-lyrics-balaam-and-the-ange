Can't work can't sleep 
Can't stop I'm so weak 
Oh can't you see just what you done to me 
Long hair sweet lips 
Worn jeans on soft hips 
Just can't resist the magic in your kiss 
I couldn't die without you 
My big city fun time girl 
Hot white street light 
Red dress skin tight 
For another face or just another place 
Nigh club low life 
I see through your disguise 
In your eyes I see a thousand lies 
Can't work can't sleep 
Can't think I can't eat 
I couldn't die without you 
My big city fun time girl
