That's the holiday 
That's the hanukkah robot funk 
(Ba-rum-pa-pum-pum uh.) 
Right about now 
Gonna drop some hanukkah science 
Yeah, hmm, uh--this is it I press a button make the gentleman cry 
I rock a beat to make the hamburger fry 
I funk this joint and check out holiday gear 
The system booming strictly pioneer 
Under the rear 
Bringing a tear 
I turn it out in a holiday mode 
Safe like a seatbelt in a volvo 
Keeping it real like a spray-snow tree 
We'll shut it down harmoniously 
Rockin' softly 
808 Beats I get this shit lit like a menorah 
Funk so illegal I think I might need a lawyer 
Not a firestarter but my beats get hotter 
Even amount like an allowance 
Footwear riot new balance 
Hanukkah pimp on a check 
Like a micro rock gettin' in a sweat 
Neal's mackin' track 
Ejaculatin' on buffet tables and record labels 
Willin' and able 
Bring my funk in place of each beat 
Lifestyles of the slick and sleazy 
Spin around and around like a dreidel 
Kind of science that puts you back in the cradle 
Shit, sometimes this track's so poignant 
Somebody please pass me some kind of ointment 
Put these rhymes together like a thief 
Clear up your nose like a eucalyptus leaf 
Dropping science, you don't even know what hits you 
Next thing you know you're 13 and get a bar mitzvah I get down, I get down, I get down all the way 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah ooohhhhhh 
I get down, I get down, I get down all the way, etc 
Hanukkah pimp
