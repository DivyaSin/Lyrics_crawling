There's a roar 
From a thousand CCs 
And to Johnny 
The message is clean 
The words of the song are 
- Tonight you are free 
And the music's strong 
And sweet Marie 
Waits with her dreams 
And her clouded eyes 
And her rouge-laden cheeks 
She yearns for the warmth 
Of her Johnny's machine 
Holding on tight 
Into the night 
In Stockholm 
In a Stockholm serenade 
In Stockholm 
In a Stockholm serenade 
She's dressed to kill 
In her black leather jeans 
And her lilac shades 
She's a big city queen 
Who will play her part 
With a shrug and a smile 
And a craving heart 
And they ride 
On their serpentine flight 
Over tire marked roads 
Under shattered street lights 
Until far way 
The city looks 
Like a fiery jewel 
Ablaze in the night 
In Stockholm 
In a Stockholm serenade 
In Stockholm 
In a Stockholm serenade 
It's an eternity 
From dusk to dawn 
Before Johnny 
Is back on his job 
With his welding torch 
And Marie's gentle touch 
Still alive on his arm 
For the night it is long 
In Stockholm 
In a Stockholm serenade 
In Stockholm 
In a Stockholm serenade 
[In the original Swedish lyrics, Johnny is a computer operator and Marie (who 
is called Cathrine) listens to synth pop. The rest of the lyrics are more or 
less the same.]
