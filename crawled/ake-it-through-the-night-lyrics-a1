She's all alone 
Making her way to a cold, empty home 
Nobody waiting and no one to hold 
She's holding her own He wakes up late 
Stares at the mirror to find his own face 
Picks out the pieces he hides from within 
He doesn't fit in, do you? I've made up my mind, everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind, everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night Opens her eyes, looks around her 
There's faith in disguise 
There's no more secrets to shadow with lies 
She swallows her pride Somebody care 
Hard to be seen when there's nobody there 
It's getting closer, no need to pretend 
Just let it in and believe I've made up my mind, everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind, everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
Yeah, yeah, whoa, oh, oh Things ain't getting any better 
She still feels the same 
She's hiding from her bitter days 
A chance to take the pain away 
Finding answers out there in the air Whoa, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah 
Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah I've made up my mind, everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night Maybe today or maybe tomorrow 
Guess the hands of fate been making you wait too long, yeah 
I know the way to forget all your sorrow 
Just be the first in line to admit that you were wrong sometime, yeah I've made up my mind, everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night, yeah 
I've made up my mind, everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night Gonna make it through the night now, baby 
We're gonna make it through the night now, baby 
We're gonna make it through the night now, baby 
Yeah, yeah, come on, everybody now 
We're gonna make it through the night
