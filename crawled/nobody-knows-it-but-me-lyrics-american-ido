Yeah, wish I told her how I feel 
Maybe she'd be here right now 
But instead I pretend that I'm glad you went away 
These four walls close in more everyday 
And I'm dying inside, and nobody knows it but me Like a clown I put on a show 
The pain is real even if nobody knows 
Now I'm cryin' inside and nobody knows it but me Why didn't I say the things I needed to say? 
How could I let my angel get away? 
Now my world is just tumblin' down 
I can see it so clearly but you're nowhere around The nights are lonely, the days are so sad 
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had 
And I'm missin' you, and nobody knows it but me I carry a smile when I'm broken in two 
Now I'm nobody without someone like you 
I'm tremblin' inside, and nobody knows it but me I lie awake, it's a quarter past three 
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me 
Yeah, my heart is callin' you and nobody knows it but me How blue can I get, you could ask my heart 
But like a jigsaw puzzle its been torn all apart 
A million words couldn't say just how I feel 
A million years from now you know I'll be lovin' you still The nights are lonely, the days are so sad 
(Nights are lonely, oh, so sad) 
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had 
And I'm missin' you, and nobody knows it but me Tomorrow morning, I'll hit the dusty road 
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go 
I'm gonna unload my heart and hope you come back to me (Said, when the nights are lonely) 
The nights are lonely 
(Since you've been gone away) 
The days are so sad 
(And I've been missing you, baby) And I just keep thinkin' about 
The love that we had 
(I always thought you'd be right by my side) 
And I'm missin' you 
(Yeah) 
And nobody knows it but me 
(Nobody knows it, no, nobody but me) The nights are lonely, the days are so sad 
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had 
And I'm missin' you, and nobody knows it but me
