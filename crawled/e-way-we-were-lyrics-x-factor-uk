Memories 
Like the corners of my mind 
Misty watercolor memories 
Of the way we were Scattered pictures 
Of the smiles we left behind 
Smiles we gave to one another 
For the way we were Can it be that it was all so simple then? 
Or has time rewritten every line? 
If we had the chance to do it all again 
Tell me, would we, could we? Memories 
May be beautiful and yet 
What's too painful to remember 
We simply choose to forget
