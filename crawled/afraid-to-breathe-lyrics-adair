phone calls from another place, 
these days they rarely come. 
calls that I can't answer. 
does it burn as bad for you 
as it does for me? 
I'm afraid to breathe. so wait another year. 
I thought you'd come tomorrow. 
so wait another year, 
who knows just what we'll find. 
if you came back tomorrow we would never be the same. I'd stumble for the words to say, 
if we were face to face. 
and minutes feel like years. 
so it's been a million years or so 
since you went away. 
since you left me here. so wait another year. 
I thought you'd come tomorrow. 
so wait another year, 
who knows just what we'll find. 
if you came back tomorrow we would never be the same. every song. 
every word. 
every picture. 
every song. 
every word. 
all for you. so wait another year, 
who knows just what we'll find. 
if you came back tomorrow we would never be the same. so wait another year, 
who knows until we try. 
if you came back tomorrow we would never be the same. so wait another year, 
you're still my everything. 
if you came back tomorrow we would never be the same.
