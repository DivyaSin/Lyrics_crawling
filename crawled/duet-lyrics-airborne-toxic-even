I've been away for far too long 
I've had my mind wrapped around this one song 
I heard last week on the radio while 
Driving near that place we used to go 
Where the track homes all look the same 
With the roofs and the tiles and the similar frames 
All these streets are so wide and these cars are so lame 
And on every block I heard the whisper of your name 
I spent so many evenings in my head 
I'd lie alone on an unmade bed 
Counting the minutes like numbered clocks 
Should I call, should I write, should I read, should I stop? 
I'm a child, I'm a ghost, I'm a slur, I'm a boast 
I'm a prince, I'm a king, I'm a ryhme, I'm a ring 
I'm unable to sleep, I'm unable to sing 
I'm a desperate and lonely, frightened, unholy thing 
And you'd say la la la I'm so glad I'm over you 
As you reach for your drink and you tell me you like my shoes 
And I smile like a wretch, there's not much else I can do 
I say I know what you mean, yeah it's weird for me too 
Besides what would I sing about if I had you? 
Kinda sounds like la la la... 
La la la... 
I think maybe it was Radiohead 
That had this weird little beat and a keyboard instead 
guitar playing chords, I remember how bored 
You would get with those bands 
You always said they play the same three chords 
And you'd dance around in your t-shirt and sing 
Don't you love Modest Mouse and adore Promise Ring? 
Don't you wish that you could just avoid everything? 
Join a band, go on tour, and think of me when you sing? 
And I'd think la la la yeah that sounds okay to me 
And you'd fall on the bed and I'd fall down to my knees 
And I'd smile like my life depended on it 
That's so weird I was mostly right about that 
Always eager to love and eager to leave 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la... 
And I'd think la la la all these songs are so untrue 
As I stare at this face I love you 
And we don't belong and it sounds so wrong 
And you're beautiful with that gray scarf on 
I think yeah okay but maybe it's just the song 
And I miss you but it might just be the song
