I don't expect the guarantee 
From you, but maybe somehow 
I thought your love was specially 
Made for me, now I know Dust in the sands, you've been sending 
So what is the game you're pretending? 
Who's that man by your side 
The man by your side Who's that man by your side 
The man by your side 
Cause if when we - all or nothing 
Cause if when we - you and me Who's that man by your side 
The man by your side 
The lesson you have given me 
I got it that is for sure You better stop messing around 
I'll walk right out through the door Dust in the sands, you've been sending 
So what is the game you're pretending? 
Who's that man by your side 
The man by your side Who's that man by your side 
The man by your side 
Cause if when we - all or nothing 
Cause if when we - you and me 
Who's that man by your side 
The man by your side Dust in the sands, you've been sending 
So what is the game you're pretending? 
Who's that man by your side

The man by your side Cause if when we - all or nothing 
Cause if when we - you and me
