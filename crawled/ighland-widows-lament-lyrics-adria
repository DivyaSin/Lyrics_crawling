Oh I am come to the low country 
Ochon ochon ochrie 
Without a penny in my purse 
To buy a meal to me 
It wasna sae in the hieland hills 
Ochon ochon ochrie 
Nae woman in the country wide 
Sae happy was as me 
For then I had a score of kye 
Ochon ochon ochrie 
Feeding on yon hill sae high 
And giving milk tae me 
And then I had three score of yowes 
Ochon ochon ochrie 
Skipping on yon grassy knowles 
And casting woo' tae me 
I was the happiest of all the clan 
Sair, sair may I repine 
For Donald was the brawest man 
And Donald he was mine 
Til Charlie Stewart cam' at last 
For to set us free 
My Donald's arm was wanted then 
For Scotland and for me 
Their waefu' fate what need I tell 
Right to the wrang did yield 
My Donald and his country fell 
Upon Culloden field 
Ochon Oh Donald Oh 
Ochon ochon ochrie 
Nae woman in the world sae wide 
Sae wretched now as me.
