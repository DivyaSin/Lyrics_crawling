All these radio towers, the clouds, the sky. 
I watched them fall through the back of my mind 
ten thousand miles away from home. And the DJ shakes me in my seat 
"I'm sorry we haven't slept in weeks 
just to wake and dream", "I bet. 
I could use a little laugh." And I finish my songs, and the DJ screams 
and I stare at the ground, and I tune my strings. 
I got three days to the show. 
I got nowhere else to go. And the battles that I wage, so goddamn polite. 
I was thinking of jumping from my room last night. 
I got one more year to live. 
I got nothing else to give.
