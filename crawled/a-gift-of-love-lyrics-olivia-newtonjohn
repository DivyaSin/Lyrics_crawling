Here in this silent night 
Now all the world alI is right 
As if we've suddenly been given 
A gift of love a gift of love 
Warm as the fire glows 
Soft as the fallen snow 
A precious miracle we live in 
This wonder of 
A gift of love 
Night falls at this coldest time of the year 
Love calls and its summer in here 
Here where I love you so 
Now as our blessings grow 
We share the greatest gift we'll ever know 
A gift of love A gift of love
