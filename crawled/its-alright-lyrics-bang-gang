I said something wrong 
I just can't hide it 
It runs out 
And I can't fight it 
It's alright I meant nothing bad 
I'm just excited 
Please don?t cry 
I try to fight it 
It's alright And I was 
In your arms 
And you were in my arms 
And I was 
In your arms 
And you were in my arms 
It's alright 
It's alright I meant nothing bad 
I'm just excited 
Please don't cry 
I try to fight it 
It's alright And I was 
In your arms 
And you were in my arms 
And I was 
In your arms 
And you were in my arms 
It's alright 
It's alright And I was 
In your arms 
And you were in my arms 
And I was 
In your arms 
And you were in my arms And you might like what I say 
And you might get what you hate 
And it's okay to be right here by you 
It's alright...
