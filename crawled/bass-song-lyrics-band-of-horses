Well I got to tell you things 
The day I was born 
And every ounce chowed off was before 
Your son came to kill me there 
No peace inside, he's playing 
He's slowly stealing all of my dreams away Ain't it wonderful 
Wonderful to watch Loneliness is grilled with meet 
Illness I imbibed 
With shaking hands, watchful eyes Ain't they wonderful 
Ain't they wonderful to watch Carolina, home 
Savanna, home 
They need to know 
Where'd you go They lean on, they lean on 
They lean on, they lean on 
Everything that I care for 
Is so wonderful Legs wrapped around me there 
Fuckin' through the storm 
The truth be known, never saw before 
She sat so weepy there 
So listen now, I've learned 
Some bridges better not burn We'll leave in disaster now They lean on, they lean on 
They lean on, they lean on 
Everything I'm reaching for 
Is so wonderful
