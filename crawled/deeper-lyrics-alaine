(feelin', ooh) I can't imagine, living, without you (without you, oooh), 
My world would just stop, spinning, without you (ooh without you), 
Floating on a cloud each time you say my name, 
I wanna scream out loud you're driving me insane (driving me crazy baby), Each time you call I wanna fall, 
Deeper and deeper and deeper, 
Each time we kiss I'm feeling it, 
Deeper and deeper and deeper 
When you love me like you do baby, I wanna give my all to you, 
Take full control, please baby go, 
Deeper and deeper and deeper You say you would do, anything, for me (for me), 
You knew how I kept my everything, for you (for you), 
I promise I'll make sure to keep you satisfied, 
Just trust me baby hold me tight, enjoy the ride (i'm gonna drive you crazy) Each time you call I wanna fall, 
Deeper and deeper and deeper, 
Each time we kiss I'm feeling it, 
Deeper and deeper and deeper 
When you love me like you do baby, I wanna give my all to you, 
Take full control, please baby go,

Deeper and deeper and deeper 
When you love me like you do baby, I wanna give my all to you,
