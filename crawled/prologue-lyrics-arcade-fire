Tucked in the woods 
Near North Chicago 
Early November 
Commences our saga 
Two loved in silence 
For fear of corruption 
Then fate chimed in 
With an evil grin and a mighty interruption She awoke in a panic 
The TV in static 
She heard a voice 
In the attic Crouched behind her door 
With a Swiss Army knife 
She cried in silence 
Fearing for her life Protecting herself 
She stabbed the intruder 
The lights turned on 
Her knife impaled her suitor She'd committed a murder 
While he laid there bleeding 
She stared, clearly scared 
Checked her boyfriend's heart for beating It's not right 
The lights get dim 
And all she thinks of is him She cried through the morning 
As she read the paper 
Her father told police 
The boy broke in to rape her She ran to the bathroom 
Enraged and pissed 
Grabbed a razor 
And tic-tac-toed her wrist She'd committed a murder 
And while she laid there bleeding 
She stared, clearly scared 
Checked her final pulse for beating It's not right 
The lights get dim 
And all she thinks of is him
