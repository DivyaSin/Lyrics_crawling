When the summer day is over 
It's busy cares have flown 
I will sit beneath the starlight 
With a weary heart alone Then it rises like a vision 
Sparkling bright it shines for me 
My own dear Ellan Vannin 
With it's green hills by the sea Let me hear the ocean murmur 
Let me watch your stormy sky 
Then above the emerald waters 
Sings the seagull as she flies Then it rises like a vision 
Sparkling bright it shines for me 
My own dear Ellan Vannin 
With it's green hills by the sea
