I don't know what's playing 
Deep in my emotions 
I live so close to the river 
My dreams sing in slow motion I wait by the waterfront 
That's where I'll be holding 
These goddamn feelings I'm feeling 
I shall be folding I step on slippery sidewalks 
I'm slowly moving along 
Through somber paths in the alley 
My weakness gets strong
