Starlight and wonder 
The universe seen through your eyes 
The moon is a glorious halo 
Hanging high over your head every night 
Spinning and spinning 
A flick of the wrist and a smile 
And in the morning so early 
Deep conversations are spoken 
In tongues by sunlight Tonight, you can dream you're a star 
You can walk on the clouds 
And float to the ground 
And I'm with you We stare out the window 
And look to the sky every night 
The stars are the beacons of heaven 
And maybe one day you'll go up for a ride 
Oh, you are the sunshine 
You are the face that I dream of 
You are your mother's religion 
Down on her knees as she 
Kisses your heartache away Tonight, you can dream you're a star 
You can walk on the clouds 
And float to the ground 
And I'm with you 
Tonight, you can get very far 
The calm and the storm 
Are forever yours 
And I'm with you I've thrown coins in the fountain 
I've been to the mountain 
I've lived through the violence 
I've seen what man can do to man 
I can't promise you peace 
I can't promise you money 
But I promise to make you the best man I can 
Hold on to something 
Cause your life's about to begin Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Ooh, ooh 
Aah, hey, aah, ooh, oh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Whoa-hoah, oh 
Oh-oh, oh, oh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, aah Tonight, you can dream you're a star 
You can walk on the clouds 
And float to the ground 
And I'm with you Tonight, you can dream you're a star 
You can walk on the clouds 
And float to the ground 
And I'm with you
