I could stay awake just to hear you breathing 
Watch you smile while you're sleeping, while you're far away and dreaming 
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender 
I could stay lost in this moment forever 
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep 
'Cause I miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do 
I still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing Lying close to you feeling your heart beating 
And I wondering what you're dreaming, wondering if it's me you're seeing 
And then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together 
I just want to stay with you in this moment forever and forever, forever I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep 
'Cause I miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do 
I still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing I don't want to miss one smile, I don't want to miss one kiss 
I just want to be with you right here with you just like this 
I just want to hold you close and feel your heart so close to mine 
And just stay here in this moment for all of the rest of time I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep 
'Cause I miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do 
I still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing
