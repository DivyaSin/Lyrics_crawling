Aesop Rock (Aesop Rock)... (x16) Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice 
The factor which then amalgamates debates with straight-jackets and ROBES 
Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globe 
Xenophobe, loathe to modify the fly, feel this... I carve a notch in my wall for every stall 
every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall 
Drunky peasants, honor the shifty megatron presence 
Slug a bolt once ceremonies of merit turn blood sport (Uh) 
Fought in hella high seas, I freeze your mega dumb company 
Pumpin' out wise beads like, fly sneak-attacks on dry leaves DUNCE 
Crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin' 
Bad seeds blossom the wookie walk, hawkin' 
Let a sucker drift, I lift up every stone prone to find 
the point at which repellent signals ultimately bind 
When a pack of style mimics see my brans target the cluster 
I advance clutchin' the mic like bully to knuckle duster 
Innocent, your riddles yield a little plastic blend 
Fuck a badge, light a bonfire, dance a jig around a pig 
Figurin' yeah, I'll land a plan on bleached fame trackers 
using only the finest im post-modern terrain mappers 
Once my brethren disperse ... 
My God, you think the heaven's touched the earth then 
Thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse 
But I don't confide wine and water chose me 
Bored, lasso down Polaris, let the glow amuse me OK I lay me down to sleep, creepin' a slumber under red skies 
Heads splittin', straight sippin' a drip of dead vibes 
It's red tides from here, stop and smell analog hell 
Clenchin' a stench of burnin' logics and a child with yearning 
optics... Now someone's approached the ropes, shaking like snow-globes 
Others sought safety in numbers, other's flows got towed under (yeah) 
Still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee 
But there will never be another starvin' marvel like me 
See, there's a time when... rhymin'... 
Pain combined can't even manage to tell what the swell is, like 
Picture your imagery embellished with the hellish aspects of the swans 
for lone facets 
Soul crafted fat cats, burrowin', left perrenial tenants discouraged in 
Discussin' my foresees and flourishing, Uh! 
Searching, perching, poetic lead poison 
Poised, imploised to leak a little bit of boisture on your pride 
I'm a, animated style machine in 
a veening faulty production fueled by nicotine suction 
From tux in my carnivore to vipers in my garden 
You flash identify by the genus, species and class 
Start to chuckle 
Buckle the architecture until it fell through 
Kill the survivors then raise the dead for shock value 
By the time the pending settlements fully negotiated (yeah I'll...) 
I'll have put a sonic youth to get myself situated It's like sadly, my style spooks juveniles like Boo Radley 
Radically weak assume the Colonel Kurt's in our platoon soon enough 
That's one bluff call, toughens the searcher 
Stuttering, emerging, gutter urchin, bursting I live for the moment of truth when Big Willy rapper 
acknowledges failure and states "Goddamn my shit is trash" 
"It's time to let go", the tin man bangin' upon his chest to hear the echo 
Heartless kid, hollow compartments 
See we the people of the united, starving artistic 
Militia keep movin' in order to form a more perfect union 
I'm cluing into the poison panoramics brewed in panic situations 
It fucks a little with my brittle gift 
I tell myself "Stay" (Stay)... up high 
make a mockery of Sun and moon and star til they hand over the sky 
My de luxe is, fluxes, pivots to where the crux is 
Invade the town while village elders holler "Who the fuck's this?" 
See hipper cats, aggravated trudge through the muds 
Quickin' ones, plots thicken like, coagulated blood 
Rugged serpentines climb, pebble to rock 
Let your pretty pink cloud nine expectations please you not 
I'm, Ae-fuckin'-sop Rock, mic bizarro 
Proper application of the soul by my standard 
Candid once position from which instigations spawn 
And man, I plan to die with a mic in my hand, it's like... Abandon all hope yo, abandon all hope, it's like 
Abandon all hope yo, abandon all hope...
