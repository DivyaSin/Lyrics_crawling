A repentant nobel man 
He vowed to overthrow the land 
Horrified by the treatment of the peasants by his fathers hand 
He had a vision destruction his creative urge 
He lit a fire and it still burns 
Mikhail wanted nothing more than liberty 
He denounced the church the state and monarchy 
He called for an armed revolution 
To overthrow their governmental institution 
In a world with a dominant minority 
Capitalizing off the poor 
The immense majority 
Consumed with hatred for authority 
Enemy of the state, protector of humanity 
Eight years of his life were taken from him 
Six of those were spent in a dungeon 
But he escaped and circled the globe 
Once again sticking his neck on the gallows 
To oppose the force of tyranny 
That keep us locked our classes 
Rise up and kick their collective asses 
Whatever the form of government may be 
A class restricted society 
Will be the end result 
No revelation without revolt
