See you coming my way, and I don't know what to do with myself. 
I feel my heart is beating faster, as you make your way closer. (Pre-Chorus) 
No, no it don't feel like butterflies, it feels small like fireflies 
Cuz whenever I look at you, I heat up and my heart just melts aside. Nooooo x2 (Chorus) 
I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta keep my cool now, 
oh x9 
oo oo oo oooo, I'm trying to keep my cool now now now. Trying to make it look like don't care, that you were standing over there(over there) 
I'm laughing with my friends, and I'm showing up again like it's nothing. (Pre-Chorus) 
(Chorus) You know that I want your love, vicious mouth can't get enough, and sure in time I'll let you know, but till then imma take it slow. Till then imma take it slow. x2 (Chorus)
