Oooh oooh ooohhh ooohhh 
Oooh oooh ooohhh ooohhh Every time you try to pick up just the pieces, 
Feelin' bad for yourself. Watchin' all the foreign cars for fags and breezes 
From a window instead 
From a window instead Find it hard to see the good or face the music 
Looking backwards again 
Oversentimental staring half-way horizontal 
Well I think you're a new man 
Well I think you're a new man So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat Morning calls its early birds, my babes and beagle, Still resting their heads They're waking up to noisy doors or stomping feet, 
Of a restless old man 
Of a restless old man So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said Oooh oooh ooohhh ooohhh 
Oooh oooh ooohhh 
Oooh oooh ooohhh ooohhh 
Oooh oooh ooohhh So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat what you said 
So I repeat
