Everybody 
Whoa-oh-oh 
Everybody 
Whoa-oh-oh Everybody get up and dance now 
Everybody show me how you smile 
Everybody stand up and sing now 
Take my hand; I'll make it worth your while 
Everyone will be alright 
Let's make this summer outta sight! 
Life is great in my backyard 
Let's crank up the volume on this guitar This is a song for your eye drums 
This is the anthem for having fun 
Now that you're here and you're in the mood 
Let's go party, cowabunga dude! I wanna get kicked out of school 
I wanna go to a place where the big kids rule 
I want to enjoy life and just have fun 
I don't wanna worry about anyone 
I wanna be a big rock star 
I wanna make me famous with this guitar 
I wanna go see everywhere 
Don't want to sit around and just be a square This is a song for your eye drums 
This is the anthem for having fun 
Now that you're here and you're in the mood 
Let's rock out and order pizza, dude! This is a song for your eye drums 
This is the anthem for having fun 
Now that you're here and you're in the mood 
LET'S TURN IT UP AND WRECK STUFF, DUDES 
This is a song for your eye drums 
This is the anthem for having fun 
Now that you're here and you're in the mood 
Let us all go stare at boobs
