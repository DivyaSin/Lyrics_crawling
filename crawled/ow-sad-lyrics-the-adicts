A boy loved a girl but the girl said no 
She ran away with a handsome gigolo 
He loved her but they were through 
So he fed himself to the lions at the zoo Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh how sad 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, how sad Romeo and Juliet,a weirdo couple that I met 
They had a little drink with a strange effect
