I call you on the phone 
I sit here all alone 
And try to find the words 
That I can't say In less than thirty days 
We'll both be going our separate ways 
Now there's nothing left 
That we can fall back on I know that I'm much too selfish 
I can't, I can't help this Nobody knows what I've done 
(I've done wrong) 
What doesn't kill us makes us 
(Makes us strong) And there's a place that I know 
(I may know) 
What doesn't kill us makes us 
(Makes us strong) There's nothing left for me 
But paybacks, death and destiny 
Where did I go wrong, I don't know I gotta leave and take what's mine 
Wasted youth and wasted time 
I call these words into my stains so it will show I know that I'm much too selfish 
I can't, I can't help this Nobody knows what I've done 
(I've done wrong) 
What doesn't kill us makes us 
(Makes us strong) And there's a place that I know 
(I may know) 
What doesn't kill us makes us 
(Makes us strong) So give back everything you took from me 
Don't believe in me, you don't care about me 
I've learned my lesson and it's set me free 
Don't believe in me, you don't care about me 
(No) Nobody knows what I've done 
(I've done wrong) 
What doesn't kill us makes us 
(Makes us strong) And there's a place that I know 
(I may know) 
What doesn't kill us makes us 
(Makes us strong) Makes us 
Makes us 
Makes us 
Makes us
