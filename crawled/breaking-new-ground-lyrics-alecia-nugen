Well, you told me when we met 
Your love would last forevermore 
And it took me by surprise 
When you up and walked out the door Been suffering through this dry spell 
With no relief in sight 
Well, you're sowing oats with another girl 
And raising cane all night The only way I'll make it through this drought 
Is by breaking new ground Yeah, the only thing you left 
When you left me was no choice 
Gonna plant my love in another field 
With no rocks beneath the soil It's high time I was leaving this old town 
Start breaking new ground Well, I'm finding out that I can live without you on my side 
The grass is getting greener slowly as the days go by 
Somewhere I'll find someone to help me tear down these old walls 
Fill my life on a solid love, I'll rise above it all I won't let your memory get me down 
I'm breaking new ground Yeah, the only thing you left 
When you left me was no choice 
Gonna plant my love in another field 
With no rocks beneath the soil The only way a new life can be found 
Is by breaking new ground Yeah, the only thing you left 
When you left me was no choice 
Gonna plant my love in another field 
With no rocks beneath the soil And it's high time luck was a-leaving this old town 
And start breaking new ground
