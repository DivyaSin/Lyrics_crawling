She moved into my old apartment 
That's how we got this whole thing started 
She called and said that I had mail 
Waiting there for me I told her that I'd come and get it 
How could I know in just a minute 
That I'd be standing face to face 
With my own destiny Ohh, and we sat there talkin' 
Just like we were old friends 
And ohh, then I asked her 
"Can I see you again?" She said, "Yes" and I said, "Wow" 
And she said "When?" and I said, "How about right now?" 
Love can't wait, then I asked if she believed in fate 
And she said "Yes" The days flew by just like a fast train 
And nothing else has been on my brain 
Except the thought of how she makes me 
The man I wanna be And she's the one I want for a million reasons 
Loving her it's just like breathing 
It's easy and it obvious 
She was made for me Ohh, then it happened one night 
Looking in her eyes 
Ohh, and I popped the question 
Much to my surprise She said, "Yes" and I said, "Wow" 
And she said "When?" and I said, "How about right now?" 
Love can't wait, then I asked if she believed in fate 
And she said "Yes" So we called the preacher 
Family, and friends 
And nothing's been the same 
Since She said, "Yes" and I said, "Wow" 
And she said "When?" and I said, "How about right now?" 
Love can't wait, then I asked if she believed in fate 
And she said "Yes", she said "Yes"
