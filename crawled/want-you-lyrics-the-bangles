(V. Peterson) 
I want you I don't want to sleep, go on and speak 
Wearing out the carpet with my feet And I want you 
I want you You don't know how bad you've got me hooked 
I hate myself 'cause you don't like my looks I want you 
I want you 
Oh ah, oh ah 
I want you Everything's still playing in my head 
I'm twisting and I'm crying in my bed I want you 
Yeah, I want you It's not fair 
I should be there too 
With you Here I am still trying to erase 
Everything, your voice, your smile, your face I want you 
Yeah, I want you 
Oh ah, oh ah 
I want you 'Cause I want you 
Yeah, I want you
