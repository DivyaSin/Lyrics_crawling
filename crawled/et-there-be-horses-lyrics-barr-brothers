Mary, 
You would not be the woman that you are 
If someone could mend your troubled heart 
That would be easier 
but that would be wrong 
Water, 
Sometimes I think my cup might overfill 
As if God and the Devil had struck a deal 
Sayin you can have this one 
after Im done 
Oh, let me hear music 
Like you hear music 
Like you were just born 
Oh, let there be horses 
Let there be danger 
Let there be one song 
A song for the little man 
A song for his wife and his two charmed childrens children and his noble life 
People, 
Want love but have little for themselves 
They pray for a stranger to lift their veil 
That would be everyone 
That would be us 
Children, 
That would never keep us from itself 
Well dance through a window 
We reap and yell 
But you are a daughter 
You are a son 
Oh, let me have patience 
Like you have patience 
Like you were old 
Oh, let there be horses 
There will be danger 
Let there be one song 
A song for the little man 
A song for his wife and his two charmed childrens children and his noble life
