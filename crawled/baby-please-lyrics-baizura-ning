[hook] 
Baby please... now give in to me, won't you 
Baby please can't I say that you're mine now? 
Make a stand to the master plan cause darlin 
I'll never ever leave you, can't you see how much I care? 
[verse] 
I wait all night for you, I fall asleep by the phone 
And just to hear your voice, when can I be with you alone 
Cause nothing seems to matter when I am close to you 
I look into your eyes see my future shining through 
I want to make you smile, I hold you all night 
And do sweet things for you, no one can love you oh so right 
Nothing seems to matter, my heart belongs to you 
Eternally I love you, promise I'll be true to you 
[repeat hook x 1] 
[verse] 
The search is over now, just let our hearts beat as one 
Please baby dance with me, the sentiments won't come undone 
You know there isn't nothing that I won't do for you 
I'd climb the highest mountain, fly you to the moon 
Now give me just one chance, a lifetime full of romance 
That's how we'll live life through, so overjoyed you know the truth 
The love that I will give you is unconditional 
Now realize your feelings, let them come undone 
[repeat chorus x 1] 
[hook 2] 
Baby please... hear me, can't you see, won't you 
Baby please... let me love you forever 
Never leave, need you close to me, because darling 
A sweeter love than this, no one else could but compare 
[rap x 8 bars] 
[repeat chorus 1 & 2 till fade]
