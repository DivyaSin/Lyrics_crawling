When I saw you first time 
I left everything behind 
And when I see your smile 
I start to think about you 
My heart start racing 
And my brain stops working 
Everything will be not fine 
The reason is just you 
Hit come on one more time 
Hit me with your sparkling eyes 
I feel my heart is beating 
And my body start shivering 
Everything is not alright 
I just want you to be mine 
Nothing will stop me now 
Because I am in love with you I'm afraid to fall 
More in love, More in love 
One day I'll get lost 
In the dark, In the dark 
I'm afraid to fall 
More in love, More in love 
One day I'll get lost 
In the dark, In the dark I'm trying to find a way 
To say that I'm crazy on you 
OH OH I'm in love with you 
I'll express what I feel 
But I don't have the time 
OH OH I'm in love with you I always think of you 
I wish my dream become true 
I can not take out of my mind 
Because I am obsessed with you 
You're the cure to my pain 
When you look at me 
I'll be insane 
When you go away 
I'll get sad 
Because I'm in love with you 
Everything in you 
Is driving me insane 
And I am saying I'll get over 
But I can't get through 
Because of you I'm trying 
To save myself from 
The hole I'm inside 
In the dark I'm in love with you I'm afraid to fall 
More in love, More in love 
One day I'll get lost 
In the dark, In the dark 
I'm afraid to fall 
More in love, More in love 
One day I'll get lost 
In the dark, In the dark I'm trying to find a way 
To say that I'm crazy on you 
OH OH I'm in love with you 
I'll express what I feel 
But I don't have the time 
OH OH I'm in love with you I'm afraid to fall 
More in love, More in love 
One day I'll get lost 
In the dark, In the dark 
I'm afraid to fall 
More in love, More in love 
One day I'll get lost 
In the dark, In the dark 
Oh I'm afraid to fall 
More in love, More in love 
One day I'll get lost 
In the dark, In the dark 
I'm afraid to fall 
More in love, More in love 
One day I'll get lost 
In the DARK! I'm trying to find a way 
To say that I'm crazy on you 
OH OH I'm in love with you 
I'll express what I feel 
But I don't have the time 
OH OH I'm in love with you 
I'm trying to find a way 
To say that I'm crazy on you 
OH OH I'm in love with you 
I'll express what I feel 
But I don't have the time 
OH OH I'm in love with you
