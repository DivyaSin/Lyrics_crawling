Not to think about love 
But to see the way you play it 
I have taken a vow 
Now I want to hear you say it 
Are you troubled at all 
If I make no hesitation 
When you ask me not to think about love? 
I don't think about love 
When I see you kiss another 
It won't matter at all 
No I won't hold to its power 
I have given it up 
And I've seen the final hour 
When I tell you I don't think about love 
I don't think about it 
And I won't sing about it now 
I promise not to think about love 
I don't think about love 
I don't need the incantation 
I have given it up 
Oh, I had my reservations 
Were your friends there at all? 
Did they offer consolation 
When I promised not to think about love? 
I don't think about it 
And I won't sing about it now 
I promise not to think about love 
Promise not to think about love 
Promise not to think about love 
Promise not to think about love
