Cold as the sun on a winter's morning 
Your resolve still lies shivering 
A heap of ill sighted plans 
So you think, so it shall be Dwelling on all that's happened now yeah 
Since that day you were lucid 
And saw things all too clear 
It was easy, now it's grown dark Even though the wood surrounds you 
It doesn't mean your heart should fail you now 
When the end is just within your reach Pushing you up against the wall 
You feel there's no one to cushion you from the fall 
You stumble, spending all your strength in vain 
Holding onto the cherished notion, things were different back then 
You lapse into the old you with all you see before your eyes Even though the wood surrounds you 
It doesn't mean your heart should fail you now 
When the end is just within your reach Take it easy, chill, chill, chill 
You've got a penchant for pulling through these things 
It's alright, it's okay Take it easy, chill, chill, chill 
You've got a penchant for pulling through these things 
It's alright, it's okay, it's okay, it's alright Even though the wood surrounds you 
It doesn't mean your heart should fail you now 
When the end is just within your reach Even though the wood surrounds you 
It doesn't mean your heart should fail you now 
When the end is just within your reach It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
It's alright, it's alright
