Stab wounds will take their toll, murderer with her smile 
And as an after thought, she kept the heart he gave her 
Beauty can be so cruel, she once swore him forever 
To make good on her word, ensured he'd never leave her She lies and whispers loving words 
He lay bleeding on this floor 
A sigh, a kiss will end his pain 
And she drives the blade deeper still 
Come closer, come closer, come closer to me Crimson streaks the pale skin of her face 
From the spray of blood from his throat 
His eyes ever questioning why 
She swore never to leave him She lies and whispers loving words 
He lay bleeding on this floor 
A sigh, a kiss will end his pain 
And she drives the blade deeper still
