its just a question of time before i forget 
who you are and what it was to me 
i cant pretend 
to understand a thing 
what if it all comes back? 
its not what was expected but 
theres no reason to keep holding on 
i feel contempt 
i feel regret 
and now i see that nothings changed i'm breaking down 
and its because of you 
i question why i made this sacrifice 
everything i do is not enough for you 
i wonder 
why do i feel this way? fighting against air 
fighting against time 
i dont know where im headed anymore 
my blind progression leaves no impression 
of the life i used to know 
everything that was familiar is 
now reduced to a pile of dust 
memories have aged 
many lives have changed 
so now its time for me to do the same
