Rotting, the dead are rising 
The living hiding, and running for their lives 
Decaying, corpses amassing 
Building there army, hellbent on feeding 
Slaughter cities like cattle 
For each new fallen, the scourge grows one larger 
Infecting, blood flows like water, green horde??? 
For human flesh they march onward 
Now 
And look at you now 
You've never looked so good before 
Before tonight - thank God that I've brought you back 
Those light green eyes, those pale white thighs, black blood bleeds down your fingers 
While thousands die, the dead alive, cut their way through the cities 
Flowers for the girl, sweet little girl, from her grave to her cold hands 
He's doomed the world, the whole damn world, so he might bring her heart back NO ESCAPING 
Love undying 
NO ESCAPING 
Love undying 
No escaping
