Go, I may be ten years old but I still know what's up 
I wear my cramp shirt almost every single day 
I wanna sag my pants, I wanna pogo dance 
But mom won't let me so I might just run away I, I wanna ride my skate, I wanna stay out late 
I wanna a Mohawk but mom won't let me get one 
I, I wanna go to shows, I wanna pierce my nose 
I wanna Mohawk but mom won't let me get one I may be in fourth grade but I know what's going on 
I listen to The Misfits every single day 
Don't wanna take a nap, I wanna TV tat 
But mom won't let me so I might just disobey I, I wanna ride my skate, I wanna stay out late 
I wanna a Mohawk but mom won't let me get one 
I, I wanna go to shows, I wanna pierce my nose 
I wanna Mohawk but mom won't let me get one
