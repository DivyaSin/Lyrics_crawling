Abusive 
No more 
No more He says he loves you 
But the make-up will not cover up the bruises 
He left on you 
I've tried to stop the cycle for you, 
This relationship is whack 
You bastard, don't touch her anymore Stand up, stand up 
He's a drunk and abusive 
Stand up, stand up 
He thinks that you'll never leave him 
Stand up, stand up 
I won't let him get near you 
Stand up, stand up 
Next time's your fault when he hurts you I think that you should have the chance 
To enjoy the friends you have 
He wants to erase them 
I know that you were trying hard 
Not to show up but the coward is an asshole 
He's shameless! Stand up, stand up 
He's a drunk and abusive 
Stand up, stand up 
He thinks that you'll never leave him 
Stand up, stand up 
I won't let him get near you 
Stand up, stand up 
Next time's your fault when he hurts you Abusive

Abusive 
No more 
No more Stand up, stand up 
It's not your fault when he hits you
