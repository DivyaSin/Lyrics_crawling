Brother, brother 
Sister, sister It's the loneliness that's the killer So you want 
To be free 
To live your life, 
The way you want to be 
Will you give, 
If we cry? 
Will we live, 
Or will we, die? 
Oh Jaded hearts heal with time 
Shoot that love (oh whoa whoa whoa)

Stop the bleeding, oh Solitary brother (brother)
