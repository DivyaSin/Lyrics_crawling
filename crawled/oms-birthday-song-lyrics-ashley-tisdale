Mom it's your birthday 
Thanks for all the care and love you give 
not to mention the meals, 
and times I get kinda' nervous 
and forget to tell you how I feel 
(shooby doo, shooby doo) I'm a little high strung 
just because I'm young 
Mom I adore ya 
and I'll do anything for yaaaa 
Although my brothers make me frantic, 
With every single crazy antic 
and when I'm bouncing off the walls, 
your the one who stays calm Because you love me for who I am 
I'll always love you mom...... THE END
