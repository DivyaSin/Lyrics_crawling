All my lights are out 
This is not my kind of bliss 
My painted lips are numb 
In this stranger's empty kiss I saw shadows at your feet 
My empty shoes have left me here 
I knew then that the rain would come 
When we watched the rainbow disappear I'm not missing you 
I'm not staring into space 
I'm not blue, I'm not blue I'm not holding on 
Even to the lack of you 
I'm not running movies in my head 
I'm not searching for your feet in bed 
I'm not sleeping in your t-shirt 
Baby I'm not making tea for two I'm not missing you 
I'm not staring into space 
I'm not blue, I'm not blue And dreams will fly 
Just one more night 
And I'll let you go 
Just like a kite 
I won't turn around 
I'll wake up singing again For the first time and forever 
I say a million times goodnight 
It seems easier to love everybody 
Than to love just one man right I'm not missing you 
I'm not staring into space 
I'm not blue, I'm not blue 
I'm not missing you 
I'm not staring into space 
I'm not blue, I'm not blue 
Oh 
Oh 
Oh 
Oh, oh
