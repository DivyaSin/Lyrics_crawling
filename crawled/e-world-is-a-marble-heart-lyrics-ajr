The world is a marble heart 
Too fragile, too broken 
Left without nothing but our bags to hold on to 
Yeah out in the daylight 
And out of the jungle 
We could have been, we should have been 
What your heart couldn't handle Feel like I need, to forget you 
Run away girl, 'cause I let you 
Now you found some other man, you see 
I'm better off without you, 'cause the man ain't me! (My oh my) I'm going back now 
(Right all right) To the beginning 
(Why oh why) What you denied from the start 
(My oh my) And now you can't go breaking my heart, yeah 
(Right all right) Woah 
(Why oh why) And now you can't go breaking my heart. The world is a marble heart 
It's bullshit and we know it 
Like a flower sheltered in stone 
With no chance of regrowing 
Like push comes to shove 
Like I'm out on your doorstep 
We could have been, we should have been 
With only my soul left. Feel like I need, to forget you 
Run away girl, 'cause I let you 
Now you found some other man, you see 
I'm better off without you, 'cause the man ain't me! (My oh my) I'm going back now 
(Right all right) To the beginning 
(Why oh why) What you denied from the start 
(My oh my) And now you can't go breaking my heart, yeah 
(Right all right) Woah 
(Why oh why) And now you can't go breaking my heart. 
Now you can't go breaking my heart. 
Now you can't go breaking my heart, ooh 
Breaking my heart 
And now you can't go breaking my heart. Feel like I need, to forget you 
Run away girl, 'cause I let you 
Now you found some other man, you see 
Now you found some other man, you see 
I'm better off without you, 'cause the man ain't Now you can't go breaking my heart. 
(My oh my) I'm going back now 
(Right all right) To the beginning 
(Why oh why) What you denied from the start 
(My oh my) And now you can't go breaking my heart, yeah 
(Right all right) Woah 
(Why oh why) And now you can't go breaking my heart.
