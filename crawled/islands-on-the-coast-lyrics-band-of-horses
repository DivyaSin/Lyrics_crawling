Here's a copy 
The rest that you know 
And put the kind words to bed For man don't say why 
Or even know how 
It's only awful as 
The hell that you know When islands want to coast 
Islands want to coast 
They'll know how 
Yeah, they'll know how And only hours before 
The house had burned down 
He shut the other door But if I don't see now 
Or even know why 
It's only awful 
As the hell that you know When islands want to coast 
Islands want to coast 
They'll know how 
Yeah, they'll know how Home 
Home 
Home 
Home He was riding in 
The next thing you know 
Let's take the other door Now if I don't think right 
Or even know how 
It's only awful 
As the hell that you know When islands want to coast 
Islands want to coast 
They'll know how 
Yeah, they'll know how Home
