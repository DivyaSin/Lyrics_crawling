I thought release the endless pain 
I think it'll never be the same 
But I didn't cause the summer rain 
I don't wanna see you here again 
Again, again, never again, never again I made a move, I thought was right 
I had a chance to stop the fight 
But I looked away and to the side 
I never thought I'd say it'll be alright 
Again, again, never again, never again 'Cause I'm far away from everything we knew 
But all I see reminds me so 'bout you 
Face to face, I'm a hopeless case 
We go on and I pretend 'cause I'm far away I don't wanna live to reverse my life 
I had it coming 'cause of my lies 
I'm not about being number one 
But I'm so afraid that I'm right and you're wrong 'Cause I'm far away from everything we knew 
But all I see reminds me so 'bout you 
Face to face, I'm a hopeless case 
We go on and I pretend 'cause I'm far away Again, again, never again, never again 
Again, again, never again, never again 'Cause I'm far away from everything we knew 
But all I see reminds me so 'bout you 
Face to face, I'm a hopeless case 
We go on and I pretend 'Cause I'm far away from everything we knew 
But all I see reminds me about you 
Face to face, I'm a hopeless case 
We go on and I pretend, I'm far away Again, again, never again, never again
