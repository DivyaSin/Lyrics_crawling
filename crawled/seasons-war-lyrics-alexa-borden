I predicted this 
do you know me at all? 
It's ended just like 
you said it would end 
with the cold Season's change 
can war harder than me 
because they belong 
I put up a good fight 
but I'm not that strong I felt you shifting 
I felt you gone 
Lost you to autumn Step on twig 
after freezing twig 
in the last summer squall 
and I bet you're just fine 
oh what am I? 
I'm just bones and body I felt you shifting 
I felt you gone 
Lost you to autumn What I'd give to turn it off 
why am I somebody else? 
What I'd give to make it stop 
Let it torture someone else 
Love itself I felt you shifting 
I felt you gone 
Lost you to autumn 
Lost you 
oh, oh
