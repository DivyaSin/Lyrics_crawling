A wire in my mind has finally snapped 
No longer am I held to binding rules 
Driven insane by the actions of animal man 
Too much becomes nothing for me to see 
Please remove the bugs crawling on my body 
Tell the voices to stop screaming in my ear 
At night I run through the park naked 
Because the moon likes fucking my bod 
I make mud pies with my own shit 
And then throw them at politicians passing by 
Carry me away to the cheers from all around 
Electric shock for the brain of mr. clown 
Lock me up because I'm ill 
Keep me that way cause it pays the bills 
A burden to all I live in shame 
Left to rot by the very same game 
I tell my eyes the walls aren't really bleeding 
Pleasuring myself in a rubber room 
Talk to the aliens hovering near the ceiling 
Cry to sleep 'cause I know the worlds' gonna end 
Bruce Lee lives in the la brea tar pits 
Just ask the taylor all about the dragon 
I see shrimp around but there's no plates 
Fly away some day but feathers never seem to grow 
I eat black gum from the window cill 
In the mash potatoes they hide the pill 
I see the eels swimming in the air 
Analyze the white walls with a blank stare 
Force feed myself my bedsore scabs 
Jesus crawls on the floor just like the crabs 
Finally freed myself, vision starts to blur 
They're to busy laughing to find the cure
