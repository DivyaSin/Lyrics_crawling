won't permit you to get me down 
because I'm on my stride 
and I'll keep my pride 
no time for you to analyze 
don't try to read my mind 
you'll never get it right 
prejudice makes us less 
and I 
I will not be defined 
I will not justify 
feelin' blessed and serene you see 
cuz I believe in me 
just wait and see 
it's showtime 
turn it on gonna see me shine 
i won't stop 
i'm the one starring in my life 
it's go time 
starting right now 
watch me take a bow 
it's so hot 
livin' large standing in the light 
i won't drop 
gonna get to the finish line 
it's showtime 
starting right now 
watch me take a bow 
people freak when they think you're weak 
because you change your mind 
just take another try 
my decisions are mine all mine 
since when is that a crime? 
I'm gonna be just fine 
win or lose it's for me to choose 
I feel like breakin' rules 
I won't be no one's fool 
right or wrong, bring it on 
cuz I 
i've only got one life 
just one life 
(refrain) 
can you listen to this 
without your prejudice 
gotta follow your heart 
or you'll keep us apart 
won't you open your mind
