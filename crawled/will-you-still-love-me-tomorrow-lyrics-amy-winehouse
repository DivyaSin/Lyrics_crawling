Tonight you're mine, completely 
You give your soul so sweetly 
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes 
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure 
Or just a moment's pleasure 
Can I believe the magic of your sighs 
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken 
You said that I'm the only one, the only one 
But will my heart be broken 
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love 
Is a love I can be sure of 
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again 
Will you still love me tomorrow 
Will you still love me tomorrow 
Will you still love me tomorrow
