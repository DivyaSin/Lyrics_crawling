Lost an innocence 
Take this fragile heart 
We know where we've been 
All these miles together Fall into my skin 
Crash into these arms 
We know where this ends 
Fade into forever The road is wild, we're holding on for life 
Like a child who's not afraid to cry 
We were escaping to a place we'll never know 
Just you and me, love 
We are almost home Lost inside your eyes 
Those brilliant, dazzled stars 
Show me every side 
The good, the bad, the better The road is wild, we're holding on for life 
Like a child who's not afraid to cry 
We were escaping to a place we'll never know 
Just you and me, love 
We are almost home Promise you, I'll be 
The promise you can't keep 
'Til the end of time 
And on the other side The road is wild, we're holding on for life 
Like a child who's not afraid to cry 
We were escaping to a place we'll never know 
Just you and me, love 
Just you and me, love 
Just you and me, love 
We are almost home
