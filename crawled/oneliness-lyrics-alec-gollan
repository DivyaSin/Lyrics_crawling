i found myself lost in questions 
that i ask to myself 
outside the sky is falling 
confusion in my head 
someone is calling me 
but i let the telephone rings 
theres no one at home now 
its very hard to believe that i miss you now 
i always play too much 
now im gonne 
and thinks she haves no chance now shes waiting forever 
and will never be same
