Bobby's going out tonight 
Looking for trouble 
Everybody likes to fight sometimes 
Heading south on 41 
Straight for the action 
Meeting the boys at the county line He kicks it into overdrive 
Really puts that pedal down 
Feels so good to be alive 
He's had enough of being pushed around Bobby and the boys walk in 
The heads start turning 
They don't like no strangers in this place, no no 
Everybody's acting tough 
Words get spoken 
And someone pulls a knife in Bobby's face, no! He turns away but it's too late 
He's gotta face them on his own 
Left him there to meet his fate 
Bobby's never going home Boys cry tough 
Boys fight dirty 
Life gets rough 
When you're living on a fine line Mary's waiting home tonight 
She's dreaming of church bells 
Bobby says the day is getting near 
Mary hears the doorbell ring 
The blue lights are flashing 
At 2 A.M. her dreams all disappear Mary's world is turning upside down 
She's been left here on her own 
Her world is spinning 'round and 'round 
Bobby's never coming home Boys cry tough 
Boys fight dirty 
Life gets rough 
Yeah, when you're living on a fine line He said that soon their lives would be as one 
Looks like you're gonna be the lonely one 
Yeah, yeah, yeah Maybe in a year or two 
She'll find someone of her own 
Mary don't you wait around 
Bobby's never coming home Boys cry tough 
Boys fight dirty 
Life gets rough 
When you're living on a fine line Boys cry tough 
Boys fight dirty 
Life gets rough 
When you're living on a fine line
