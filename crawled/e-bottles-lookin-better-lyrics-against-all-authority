Goin Down with the rest of the rats on this stinkin ship 
Gonna drown in this dirty sea that smells like shit 
Another night coated with blood, sweat and spit 
Wake up again with a face full of floor 
in another town that I`ve left before 
at another time with all the memories that I could hoard 
You can try to hold us down but we won't submit 
A mouthful of slogans might as well be shit 
It all tastes the same to a bunch of hypocrites 
We roam the land, livin' in a van 
hosing down wherever we can 
and I trace it all back to six days in Amsterdam 
I`m tired but I`m persistant I took the path that was most resistant 
I've covered so much distance, I never asked for any assistance 
Rock bottom ain't that bad, the bottle's lookin' better every night 
to this lad, I can't measure my wealth by the things I have 
but I`ll sleep tight tonight 
Sweatin' blood to make it work 
I woke up alone again in a park somewhere in Koln 
I can still taste the blood I've left on every microphone 
from Cutler Ridge to the Berlin Wall 
throwin' up blood and alcohol 
Lost an engine but I found myself in a whack shack in Arkansas 
The suits came knockin', said they represent 
some fat cat asshole seeking settlement 
for defacing an american dream his -AAA-dvertisment 
Another time, murder on my mind 
a cold shiver runs down my spine 
I can trace it all back to these feelings I confine
