Jericho walls fastened up tight, 
promised our Yahweh surely would be a terrible fight. 
Marching around, day after day, 
faithfully waiting, giving a shout with trumpets to play. 
At the echoes of that sound, 
they could see the walls come down. And the walls came down. 
The walls came down. 
It was not the way they would have landed, 
but the walls came down. Came down... Seeking the Lord, worshipping Him, 
making a journey all the long way to Jerusalem. 
Phillip revealed the wonderful Word. 
Needing atonement, a beautiful Lamb and merciful Lord. 
On that old deserted road, 
he was spared his heavy load. And the walls came down. 
The walls came down. 
It was not the way that he expected 
but the walls came down. They came down... 
Falling, falling, the walls came down. 
And the walls were falling down... 
The walls came down... Hearing the words, "The cancer has spread," 
dealing with treatments, suffering pain with worse times ahead. 
Praying for a "yes" answer with strife, 
freedom was prayed for, freedom received but not in this life. 
A reprieve was not to be, 
though he truly was set free. When the walls came down, 
the walls came down. 
It was not at all as we intended, 
but the walls came down. Let the walls come down, 
the walls come down. 
If we trust in God, we'll find His blessing 
as the walls come down. May the walls come down, 
the walls come down. 
He is still the Lord, he'll never leave us. 
Let the walls come down.
