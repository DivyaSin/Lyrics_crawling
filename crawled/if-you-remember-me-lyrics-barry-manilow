[Chorus] 
When you remember me 
If you remember me 
I hope you see it's not the way 
I want it to be 
Oh I'd be with you now 
But wherever you go 
My love goes with you Keep on smiling, keep on shining 
Even though you know you want to cry 
I tried to love you 
Looking in my eyes 
You saw promises and lies 
Too many times [Chorus] I'll be with you, keep believing 
Some things even time can't come between 
And if you blame me, try and realize 
There are promises and lies too many times
