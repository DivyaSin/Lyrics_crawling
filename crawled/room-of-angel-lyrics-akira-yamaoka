You lie, silent there before me. 
Your tears, they mean nothing to me, 
The wind howling at the window, 
The love you never gave, 
I give to you, 
Really don't deserve it, 
But now, there's nothing you can do. 
So sleep, in your only memory 
Of me, my dearest mother... Here's a lullaby to close your eyes. 
[Goodbye] 
It was always you that I despised. 
I don't feel enough for you to cry, [oh well] 
Here's a lullaby to close your eyes, 
[Goodbye], 
[Goodbye], 
[Goodbye], 
[Goodbye]. So insignificant, sleeping dormant deep inside of me, 
Are you hiding away, lost, under the sewers, 
Maybe flying high, in the clouds? 
Perhaps you're happy without me... 
So many seeds have been sown in the field, 
And who could sprout up so blessedly, 
If I had died I would have never felt sad at all, 
You will not hear me say 'I'm sorry' 
Where is the light, wonder if it's weeping somewhere? Here's a lullaby to close your eyes. 
[Goodbye] 
It was always you that I despised. 
I don't feel enough for you to cry, [oh well] 
Here's a lullaby to close your eyes, 
[Goodbye], Here's a lullaby to close your eyes. 
[Goodbye] 
It was always you that I despised. 
I don't feel enough for you to cry, [oh well] 
Here's a lullaby to close your eyes, 
[Goodbye], 
[Goodbye], 
[Goodbye], 
[Goodbye]. Here's a lullaby to close your eyes. 
[Goodbye] 
It was always you that I despised. 
I don't feel enough for you to cry, [oh well] 
Here's a lullaby to close your eyes, 
[Goodbye], Here's a lullaby to close your eyes. 
[Goodbye] 
It was always you that I despised. 
I don't feel enough for you to cry, [oh well] 
Here's a lullaby to close your eyes, 
[Goodbye], 
[Goodbye], 
[Goodbye], 
[Goodbye].
