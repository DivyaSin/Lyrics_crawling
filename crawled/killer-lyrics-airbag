Killer Here I am 
A self-made predatory man 
If you see me coming your way 
You better run 
I'll make you see, I'll tell you no lie 
And give it to you straight 
Pull on this trigger 
And get your blood on my hands Chorus 
This is who I am, this is what I've become 
A disease that spreads to everything and everyone 
But I'm only here for the ride 
I'm here for the fun and I'll kill if I must 
If that's what it takes to stay on top So here I am 
And I'm no ordinary man 
Cause I'm never slowing down 
I'll take what's mine 
I need it all and leave you for dead 
Hunt down the next prey 
And start all over again
