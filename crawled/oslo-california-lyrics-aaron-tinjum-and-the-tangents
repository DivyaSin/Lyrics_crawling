[First Verse] You made the trip and I tripped the trap 
From Oslo to California and back 
Was I just supposed to become a ghost? 
Like the fog that lines your coasts 
I'll just linger on 
Then leave [Chorus] Lately I've been clipping all your wings from you 
And lately when I sing I rarely think of you 
Except for right now [Second Verse] We always seemed to fall behind 
At the wrong place in a different time 
And through and through I became more useless 
But more used to you 
Ain't it funny how that goes? [Chorus] Well, lately I've been clipping all your wings from you 
And lately when I sing I rarely think of you 
Except for right now [Outro] Now you're nowhere to be found 
You don't hang around 
You don't hear a sound 
When they ask you 
Don't you love your home?
