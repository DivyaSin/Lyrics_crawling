Well I wake up in the morning each and every day 
And I sit down at the table and I hear my daddy say 
Life is nothing 
It's a nothing 
Life is nothing but a slap in the face 
Life is nothing 
It's a nothing 
Life is nothing but a fat rat race 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah 
Every night I have a dream that you're taking off your dress 
The only thing you're wearing is a button on your chest 
And the button, it says nothing, 
Life is nothing but a slap in the face 
Life is nothing 
It's a nothing 
Life is nothing but a fat rat race 
What is life? 
What is life? 
A rat race 
A rat race 
What is life? 
What is life? 
A rat race 
A rat race 
A rat race 
A rat rat race 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah 
It's a jungle out there and I know I don't belong 
So all night long I just sing my stupid song 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah 
Life is nothing 
It's a nothing 
Life is nothing but a slap in the face 
Life is nothing 
It's a nothing 
Life is nothing but a fat rat race 
What is life? 
A rat race 
What is life? 
A rat race 
A rat, a rat race 
A rat race 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah 
Ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah
