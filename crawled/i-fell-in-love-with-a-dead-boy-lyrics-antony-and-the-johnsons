I find you 
With red tears in your eyes 
I ask you what is your name? 
You offer no reply 
Should I call a doctor? 
For I fear you might be dead 
But I just lay down beside you 
And held your head I fell in love with you 
Now you're my one and only 
All my life I've been so blue 
But in that moment you fulfilled me 
Now I tell all my friends 
I fell in love with a dead boy 
I tell my family 
I wish you could have met him 
I write letters to Australia 
I throw a bottle out to sea 
I whisper the secret in the ground 
No one's gonna take you away from me! 
I fell in love with a dead boy 
Oh such a beautiful boy 
I asked him are you a boy or a girl?
