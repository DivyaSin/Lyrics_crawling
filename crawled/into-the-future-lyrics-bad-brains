Crazy, your main team, 
Only be thankful, only be thankful. 
I caught you with heart in mind and deep within 
Locked your heart in mine with the wicked reacted. Into, into, into the future, 
Into, into, into the future. The cradences of your edible locked it 
I took your heart in mine, intergalactic. 
We prayed to cease out of your intergalactic. 
I locked your heart in mine, intergalactic. Into, into, into the future, 
Into, into, into the future. Might have crushed again, 
With that crash at dawn. The cradences of your edible locked it 
I took your heart in mine, intergalactic. 
The cradences, the cradences. Into, into, into the future 
Into, into, into the future.
