Loving you so, 
I was too blind to see you letting me go 
But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle 
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle 
To make me love someone new 
'Cause I'm crazy for you Didn't you know 
It wouldn't be so easy letting me go 
You can be sure that now It's gonna take a miracle 
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle 
To make me love someone new 
'Cause I'm crazy for you Tho' I know I can't forget about you 
I'm gonna try to show you how much you're turning me around 
Destroying me 
I'll never be the same anymore 
You must realize you took your love and left me 
Quite by surprise 
You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle 
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle 
To make me love someone new 
'Cause I'm crazy for you It's gonna take a miracle 
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle 
To make me love someone new 
'Cause I'm crazy for you Oh, it's gonna take a miracle
