I was walkin down the Highway 
My thumb out in the air 
I'd argued with my father 
And thought he didn't care 
It was cold and I was angry 
As I cursed his name that day 
When a car pulled up beside me 
And I heard my father say Come on home, Come on home 
I can't bear the thought of you 
Out here all alone 
It doesn't really matter 
Who was right or who was wrong 
Tears in his eyes he said please son 
Come on home She heard me say it's over 
I can't do this anymore 
Then I packed up my suitcase 
And walked on out the door 
A few days later from a phone booth 
I called and thru my pain 
Said I know I don't deserve it 
But will you take me back again Come on home, Come on home 
I can't bare the thought of you 
Out there all alone 
It doesn't really matter 
Who was right or who was wrong 
Don't say a word hang up the phone 
Come on home My Pop's been gone a while now 
And my Nan she's grown old 
And I was with her when she spoke her final words 
She firmly held my hand 
Then she gently let it go 
As she left to be with Grandpa 
I swore I thought I heard Come on home 
Come on home 
Can't bear the thought of you 
Out there on your own 
I've been waiting for you 
And your time had finally come 
Now you'll never have to be alone 
Come on home
