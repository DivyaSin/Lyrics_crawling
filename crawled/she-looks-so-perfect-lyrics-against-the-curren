Simmer down, simmer down 
They say we're too young now to amount to anything else 
But look around 
We work too damn hard for this just to give it up now 
If you don't swim, you'll drown 
But don't move, honey 
She looks so perfect standing there 
in my American Apparel underwear 
and I know now, that I'm so down 
Your lipstick stain is a work of art 
I got your name tattooed in an arrowed heart 
and I know now, that I'm so down 
Hey, hey! 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Let's get out, let's get out 
Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down 
While I was out, I found myself alone just thinking 
If I showed up with a plane ticket 
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it 
Would you wanna run away too? 
Cause all I really want is you 
She looks so perfect standing there 
in my American Apparel underwear 
and I know now, that I'm so down 
I made a mixtape straight out of '94 
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor 
and I know now, that I'm so down 
Hey, hey! 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
She looks so perfect standing there 
in my American Apparel underwear 
and I know now, that I'm so down 
Your lipstick stain is a work of art 
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart 
and I know now, that I'm so down 
Hey, Hey! 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
She looks so perfect standing there 
in my American Apparel underwear 
and I know now, that I'm so down 
Your lipstick stain is a work of art 
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart 
and I know now, that I'm so down
