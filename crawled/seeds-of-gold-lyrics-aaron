When you have lost the power 
That used to lift your feet 
And all you have is anger 
For all the things you've seen Believe we grow in numbers 
The seed will give a tree 
Life has a road for difference 
Close your eyes and you'll see 
Gold in your pain Something's coming up 
Something's coming up 
My friend, 
It's all around 
Something's coming up 
The wind is full of hands to help The only way to live in 
A world that doesn't care 
Of how you could breathe in 
A non-dreaming air 
Is to believe in the next day 
Seek beauty everywhere 
The wind will lift my fears 
The shadows of the day 
Hope is in my veins 
Something's coming up 
Something's coming up 
My friend 
I know by now 
Something's coming up 
The wind is full of hands to help When the weight is so strong 
And I can feel my eyes 
Burning all day long 
From the fire of my cries 
I remember the tree 
That came out of the pain 
I remember how beauty 
Sometimes comes out of the rain 
Time is my strength Something's coming up 
Something's coming up 
My friend, 
Its all around 
I know that now 
Something's coming up 
The wind is full of hands to help Seeds of gold 
Seeds of gold 
Seeds of gold Something's coming up 
Something's coming up 
My friend, I know by now 
Something's coming up 
The wind is full of hands to help Seeds of gold 
Seeds of gold
