Cultic regimes, 
Money to scheme, 
False religions, beware 
Caught in the grip 
Caught in the spit 
It's all going to burn, it's a snare Worship the god of your choice 
Is he asleep where is his voice 
My god raised up from the dead, is yours in bed? [Chorus] 
No more 
No more 
No more 
No more Power to take 
Power to steal 
Your mind is what they want 
Don't let them suck you into their muck, they'll 
Hound you and pound you all Worship the god of your choice 
Is he asleep where is his voice 
My god raised up from the dead - is yours in bed? [Chorus] Listen to me 
The bible it says 
One god is the maker of all 
If you don't believe that Jesus is God, 
Then my god made yours, that's all Brainwash the goose, 
Brainwash the gander, 
Brainwash what moves and gives 
But if I could brainwash the cults with the truth, 
Millions of lives would live Cultic regimes 
Cultic regimes 
Cultic regimes, no more
