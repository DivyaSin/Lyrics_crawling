Wish on a star 
Watch it die 
Trapped beneath the timeless sky 
Every day the sun will rise I watch it fall and wonder why it died 
Goodbye 
I looked inside 
I tried to change But it won't work 
It's not the same 
I looked inside 
I made the change But it won't work 
You're not the same 
Why do we always play these games? 
Subject ourselve to so much pain There's always somewhere else to place the blame 
It wasn't worth it in the end 
I tried to forget what every promise meant 
An empty statement bent Forever comes to an end.
