It was a bright and beautiful morning in spring 
I just went out in the forest to collect some wood for the fire 
when I stumbled upon this strangely formed root... Behind the things they sleep 
but waiting beyond your god 
Just to hear them breath 
records, the end 
to lose it all at once 
the words 
the sounds 
the love 
the ground 
they sleep, they sleep, they sleep, they sleep
