[Chorus x2: Z-Ro] 
All you hoes still get no love 
All you can get is a "fuck you" 
Get mad if you want to 
Kiss my black ass [Verse 1: Z-Ro] 
Playa 
I understand why you hate me 
Cause I'm on the radio and on the T.V. 
And your baby mama won't stop callin' my phone 
(Stop callin' my phone) A couple of grillin' bids in my past 
Cause I got caught up in the game 
Now it's 750, 000 dollars later 
And 18 grand everytime I pick up my telephone [Verse 2: Trae] 
Bitch 
I'm doing my thang 
Focusing on getting my change 
And you ain't getting nothing 
I'm cool so please stay out of my face 
For worries stay up under my waist 
N then I get to dumping on you bitch [Chorus x2: Z-Ro] 
All you hoes still get no love 
All you can get is a "fuck you" 
Get mad if you want to 
Kiss my black ass [Verse 3: Z-Ro] 
Too many years I'd done payed the price 
I ain't got no time for no more drama in my life 
Day after day I'm still grindin' hoes 
If I ain't grindin' for nobody else, 
I'm grindin' for Ro Dats why there's diamonds on my hand 
And swangers on the caravan 
I'm a Asshole By Nature 
Yes I am (ha) I thought I told ya'll deep down south 
We don't play 
Don't get too close 
Cause nigga I'm goin' spray everyone of ya'll 
Piss me off and I'm a murder everyone of ya'll I'm gon let the top down 
With my favorite screw tape bangin' 
Betta roll cruise control as the cigarello blows 
Cell phone ringing, traffic light changin' [Chorus x2: Z-Ro] 
All you hoes still get no love 
All you can get is a "fuck you" 
Get mad if you want to 
Kiss my black ass [Verse 4: Trae] 
You must be crazy 
I still don't luv you roach ass hoes 
Don't excuse my gangsta 
Fuck you n everybody, I'm a Asshole Go head, catch a attitude 
I'm a do me, whether you like it or not 
But one thing you gon have to do 
Is kick rocks 
When you get the fuck up out of my drop Ain't no need to callin' my phone 
You can keep on roachin' on your own 
Thinking I'm a chill but baby you're wrong 
Cause I don't luv no bitch These swaggers made out 22 inches of chrome 
I got a reputation with money too long 
Dispespect me, you'll get more then a song 
So please stay the fuck off my dick [Chorus x2: Z-Ro] 
All you hoes still get no love 
All you can get is a "fuck you" 
Get mad if you want to 
Kiss my black ass
