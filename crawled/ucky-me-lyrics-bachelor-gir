I've got an ex-boyfriend who calls me up to blame me for his life, 
I get bunches of roses from another guy and hate mail from his wife, 
I date a stupid jerk who forgets my name likes to make love while watching TV, 
And some guy calls me in the middle of the night just so I can hear him breathe Lucky Me, 
Lucky, Lucky Me 
I have everything in the whole wide world a girl could ever need, 
Lucky Me (lucky, lucky, little old me) I've got a great car, it's a red convertible made by Mattel, 
Got a nice house in the suburbs, with 'hell's angels' as neighbors as well, 
I've got a scholarship for a hundred years of college and I want to study dentistry, 
But my folks just want me married, 
And popping out the grand kids, to keep them company Lucky Me, 
Lucky, Lucky Me 
I have everything in the whole wide world a girl could ever need, 
Lucky Me (lucky, lucky, little old me) Lucky Me, 
Lucky, Lucky Me 
I have everything in the whole wide world a girl could ever need, 
Lucky Me (lucky, lucky, little old me) I think I want to join the Hare Krishna, 
Give up all my worldly goods and cut off all my hair, 
There's nothing that I have right now that brings me any joy, 
When I'm shopping at the mall, can't find it anywhere Well I've got my Tamagotchi, 
And I've got my wristwatch wrong, 
I've got so many friends on the internet, I could never be alone, 
I've got just enough cash to pay a lot of tax, but not enough to quit my job, 
Got a fool's gold ring and credit card debt, psychiatrist for my dog Lucky Me, 
Lucky, Lucky Me 
I have everything in the whole wide world a girl could ever need, 
Lucky Me (lucky, lucky, little old me) Lucky Me, 
Lucky, Lucky Me 
I have everything in the whole wide world a girl could ever need,

I have everything in the whole wide world a girl could ever need,
