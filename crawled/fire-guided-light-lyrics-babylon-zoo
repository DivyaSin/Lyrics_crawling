There's something in the sky, 
I think you're going to die. 
We're sitting on the edge 
Of a coffee coloured crowd. 
Like strangers in the night 
Dance of fire guided light. 
And I think you're going to die. 
And I think we're going to die. Don't give me crap. 
We're gonna change, 
We're gonna change. 
Don't give me crap. 
We're gonna change, 
We're gonna change. 
There's something in the sky, 
I think you're going to die. 
We're sitting on the edge 
Of a coffee coloured crowd. Like strangers in the night. 
I believe you. 
Dance with fire guided light. 
I believe you. 
And I think we're going to die. 
I believe you. 
And I think you're going to die. 
I believe you. Don't give me crap. 
We're gonna change. 
We're gonna change. 
Don't give me crap. 
We're gonna change. 
We're gonna change. There's something in my eye, 
I think I am going to die. 
Like strangers in the night. 
I believe you. 
Dance with fire guided light. 
I believe you. 
And I think you're going to die. 
I believe you. 
And I think we're going to die. 
I believe you. Don't give me crap. 
We're gonna change 
We're gonna change 
Don't give me crap 
We're gonna change 
We're gonna change 
Don't give me crap 
We're gonna change 
We're gonna change 
Don't give me crap 
We're gonna change 
We're gonna change
