Picture you on a pedestal 
So avant-garde of mind 
Standing in the last ditch 
Where fallen heroes lie 
Stand to the left of centre 
Stand to the right sometimes 
All good politicians 
Speak in riddles and in rhymes 
I'm looking under tables 
I'm looking under chairs 
Been searching for an answer 
Been searching everywhere Yeah Day by day 
Hour by hour 
Who's gonna fly my flag 
In the corridors of power? Your image is of virtue 
Pure as driven snow 
Your picture hangs in galleries 
Your sin down in Soho 
One day you'll meet the keeper 
The keeper of your soul 
One day in the next world 
Your secrets will unfold 
I'm looking under tables 
I'm looking under chairs 
Been searching for an answer 
Been searching everywhere Day by day 
Hour by hour 
Who's gonna fly my flag 
In the corridors of power? Day by day 
Hour by hour 
Who's gonna fly my flag 
In the corridors of power? One day in the future 
Like Andy Warhol said 
"Everybody will be famous 
For fifteen minutes" then Day by day 
Hour by hour 
Who's gonna fly my flag 
In the corridors of power? 
Day by day 
Hour by hour 
Who's gonna fly my flag 
In the corridors of power? Power 
Corridors of power
