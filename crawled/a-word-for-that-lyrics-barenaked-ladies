There's a word for that 
But I don't seem to know it 
Sometimes I grow a mustache, 
Just so I don't have to show it The word for that 
It's somewhere, someone chose 
For that little dented skin 
Between my upper chin and nose [Chorus] 
There's a word for that 
What does it start with 
A word for that 
I'll sound so smart 
If i only knew 
A Word for that 
Perhaps you do "The word You're looking for is Philtrum" There's a word for that 
It may come to me soon 
It dangles down my mouth 
And often comes it cartoons The word for that 
It seems like such a drag 
To not know 
What to call that little fleshy punching bag [Chorus] "Do you mean euvlia" There's a word for that 
It''s on the tip of my tongue 
well actually underneath it 
and has been such I was young The word for that 
Although I won't quote 
It likely stops my tongue 
From disappearing down my throat [Chorus: x 2] "Are you nuts it's frenulum"
