One smile for love, one smile for hate 
And one for both in ecstasy 
One out of, one in our time One smile for pleasure, one for pain 
And one for both in Satori 
One above, one against the time Never on nobodys side Take two lines and make a cross 
A snare for light and time 
Crucified between two thieves 
Sun of the evening lands And hushed they spoke of a white horse 
Upon the horse a rider A Pale Horse against time A dance for creation, one for destruction 
And one for both in ecstasy 
One out of, one in our time One for remembrance, one for oblivion 
And one for both in Satori 
One above, one against the time Caught between the lines Out of love for the other world 
Iron and sadness our machines 
Built the Golden House 
For rabbits turtles to chase They say there is a white horse 
Upon the horse a rider 
With the rider a sword 
By the sword the judgement A Pale Horse against Time "Out of of the loss of memory 
The loss of understanding 
Out of the loss of understanding 
All evil" Kali Yuga
