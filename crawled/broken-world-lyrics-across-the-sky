Promises shattered 
Answers don't come 
Friends say goodbye 
Plans come undone 
Dreams get crushed 
Lies get told 
Words can turn cruel 
Hearts can grow cold [Chorus] 
In a broken world where we cry to feel 
Some hope that helps these hearts to heal 
You're my strength, You're my refuge 
In a broken world, Jesus I'm holding to You You make sense of the madness 
And You make darkness flee 
You bring such a calm 
To the chaos in me 
Show me life 
Tell me truth 
Day after day I keep running to You [Chorus]
