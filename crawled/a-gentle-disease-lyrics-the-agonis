The gift of poison 
I'm the right mistake 
Cruel words can heal me 
Touch - a gentle disease Where skies are green 
The grass burns red 
Terminal youth outlives me 
Sight - an abstract sense I'm the worst theory 
Your downfall, my majesty In this restless syndrome 
I'll drown the flavours 
Such an innocent crime 
Taste - my ascending demise
