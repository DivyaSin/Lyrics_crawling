Careful steps we take 
Don't want this bridge to break again. 
In this winters cold embrace the love we used to know Wherever you get, wherever you go I'll follow you 
With every new breath and every new test I'll be with you As the sharks start swimming circle at your feet again 
In this new beginning, we repeat mistakes again Wherever you get, wherever you go I'll follow you 
With every new breath,and every new test I'll be with you Wherever you get, wherever you go I'll follow you 
With every new breath,and every new test I'll be with you I follow, I follow, I be with you 
I follow, I follow, I be with you 
I follow, I follow, I be with you 
I follow, I follow, I be with you
