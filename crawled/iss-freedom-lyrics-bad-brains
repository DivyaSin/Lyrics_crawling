Check out the government inject 
The innocent with subliminal criminal vibes 
With the message attainable station to station 
Tellin' lies to a nation addressed by the President, yo You should all be aware that leader who fooled you 
And told you lies to get elected 
Rejected a civil rights bill with skill 
What is he saying? Subliminal vibes again You're known as Miss Freedom 
You're known as the land of opportunity 
Yeah, but what do they know? They know nothing 
Tell-lies-vision it's got a nation trapped 
Keepin' you flip back and forth and back A remote in your brain, you remain the same intellectual genocide 
It's suicide, because you play the game and turn it on 
So now you're caught like a base head visual fiending 
For the things you see on your television, subliminal vibes again Subliminal nation, governmental constitution 
Emancipated, Miss Freedom was their mendacious solution 
To keep us really where we are mentally 
Physically and foolishly abiding by the rules they set What do they know? They don't live like we do 
They'll never understand the middle or lower class 
So you better believe we go to over stand ourselves 
From the White House in D.C., they'll never see you and me Believe that brother, so whether you're white our whether you're black 
Take your brothers hand and sure enough understand 
That this world is in need of a new plan 
Stop suffering and bring love across the land, Miss Freedom
