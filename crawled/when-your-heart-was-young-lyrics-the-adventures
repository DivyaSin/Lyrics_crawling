Well here I stand 
With an open mind 
Still unafraid, of the cards that fate has dealt me 
One by one, we burn our books and run 
Some for home, while others take the world and shake it You can stay here forever, and never see the sun 
You don't realize the price you're paying 
It's just that I can remember 
When your heart was young 
Don't you understand the song I'm singing 
When your heart was, when your heart was young The winter chill 
That surrounds your life, 
When you grow old and tired and worn 
You keep saying that you'll be coming 
But still you cling, to your mother's charms 
Don't take your time again to think 
You'll be sorry you didn't listen, listen!
