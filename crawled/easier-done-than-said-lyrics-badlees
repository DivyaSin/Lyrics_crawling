Like a fire burning in the kitchen sink 
Like a choir that can't agree on what to sing 
Like a wild raging river that just can't find the will 
You change your mind a thousand times, deciding to stand still Better to live than to explain 
Better to write than to have read 
Better to cope than to complain 
Better in your hands that in your head 
Easier done that said Like a dying flower that just don't give a damn 
Like a higher power nobody cares to understand 
Like a horse on a merry-go-round spinnin' at a county fair 
Just running 'round in circles not gettin' anywhere Better to guide than criticize 
Better to lead than to be led 
Better to act than to analyze 
Better in your hands than in your head 
Easier done than said Like a tree that doesn't grow 'cause it's afraid of the sky 
Like a lamp that doesn't glow and doesn't wonder why 
Like a cigarette that's burnin' on the side of the road 
A little less concern and no telling where you go Better to live than to explain 
Better to write than to have read 
Better to cope than to complain 
Better in your hands than in your head 
Easier done than said
