So up rolls a riot van 
And sparks excitement in the boys 
But the policemen look annoyed 
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid Got chased last night 
From men with truncheons dressed in hats 
We didn't do that much wrong 
Still ran away though for the laugh 
Just for the laugh 
And please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do 
Oh those silly boys in blue 
Well they won't catch me and you Have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me 
I'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me And up rolls the riot van 
And these lads just wind the coppers up 
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks 
They get their address and their names took 
But they couldn't care less
