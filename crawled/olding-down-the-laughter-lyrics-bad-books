Styrofoam cup of mud in my good hand, 
Disembodied voice of God in the trash can 
Eyes in the ashes, feeling for the future 
Sleeping through the steak-out, researching the rumor My old motor and mattress of memories 
First you were embarrassed, but how could you not be 
Tangled in teenage mum at the movies 
Your voice ran out out of words 
It was awkward and homey Gospel in your belly, they aim a little lower 
Back into the bleachers, Spoke as it's owner 
Sindicate a sermon you sang from the raptors 
Anchors in you pockets, holding down the laughter Tearing up your mind, your lust and your ego 
Slingshot a martyr to speed your libido 
Perish grows to jelly, blissful and wasted 
Your fish knew I consult them pictures of you naked? You're complicating your worst mixed messes 
You built them burned to bridge 
And scattered all your crumbs at the cliff 
She wants me, she'll swim for it Brother, can you spare your arms or your arrows? 
Thunder clap's arising, I think that I should 
Go home To the days when, back barns, it melts me 
Nineteen-ninety-six and your waiting there to tell me 
I didn't die, you dreamt it, you dreamt it 
I'm as alive as your backward intentions 
Sorry that I tricked you, you had to focus 
Put yourself together, clear out, you got this But for all that effort 
The slow burned struggle 
I forgot where you live She swept away the clues from the cliff, your lost now 
She swept away the clues from the cliff, your lost now 
She swept away the clues from the cliff, your lost now 
She swept away the clues from the cliff, your lost now 
Remembering She swept away the clues from the cliff, your lost now 
She swept away the clues from the cliff, your lost now 
She swept away the clues from the cliff, your lost now 
She swept away the clues from the cliff, your lost now 
Remembering
