I wanna leave you but I just can't leave you 
I keep coming back for little more of your love 
I wanna go away but honey, I just can't stay 
I keep coming back for little more of your love And I can't understand when I try 
As hard as anyone can 
Each night I dream I wake up and scream 
Oh baby, that I love you woman I love you Oh baby, I realize I treat you wrong 
But I'm so sorry let me come back were I belong 
You see I'm your fool I lost my cool 
Oh baby, that I love you woman I love you and I wouldn't lie Oh, but I lay down and die 
Oh baby, that I love you woman 
Oh baby, that I love you woman 
That I love you woman I love you
