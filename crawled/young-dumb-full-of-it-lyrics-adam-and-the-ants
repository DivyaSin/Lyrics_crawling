Have a lucky charm and a usual crew 
And a wild guitar 'cos it's good for you 
Get a pair of legs about three feet long 
And a dangerous jane to lay kisses on But be young dumb and full of it 
Young dumb and full of it full of it Keep your friends real close 
And keep your enemies closer 
And be a real hoss carwright on the ponderosa 
Get a kingsize brain with the funk gone wrong 
And bite the hand that you feed upon But be young dumb and full of it 
Young dumb and full of it full of it Show the squares some class with some bravado 
And a whiff of the kicks that they'll never know 
Tell the party jerk if he shows again 
You're gonna work on his head with a six foot chain. But be young dumb and full of it 
Shake up new york shakedown gypsy The trouble with mary and the truth about frank 
They wanted the money but they wouldn't rob banks 
They wouldn't just get down yelling for the hell of it 
Should have been young dumb and full of it full of it
