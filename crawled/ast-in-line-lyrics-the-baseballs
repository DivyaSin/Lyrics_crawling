Hey, what am I gonna do 
Can't get this by with you 
You hide away from me And I understand 
A kiss will make you shy 
But please, don't say goodbye 
When I try to make you see: You're the last in line 
Anything but fine 
What a waste of time 
But still you're mine 
You're far from cool 
Nothing better than fool 
But I swear it's true 
I do love you, oh Oh yeah Hey, you leave your band in blues 
In someone else's shoes 
To me it's all okay And now you're born 
Under a lucky star 
And senses in your heart 
But hear when I will say: You're the last in line 
Anything but fine 
What a waste of time 
But still you're mine 
You're far from cool 
Nothing better than fool 
But I swear it's true 
I do love you Yeah 
Yeah You're the last in line (last in line) 
Anything but fine (yea yea yeaah) 
What a waste of time (waste of time) 
But still you're mine 
You're far from cool 
Nothing better than fool (yea yea yeah) 
But I swear it's true 
I do love you
