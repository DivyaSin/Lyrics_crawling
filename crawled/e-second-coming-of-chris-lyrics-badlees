He'll be coming up 287 
He'll be driving a rented car 
He'll be carrying a key to heaven 
And a box of Te-Amo cigars You'll see him at your reunion 
You'll see him at the orchid lounge 
He works in NYC, got a cool goatee 
Tell everyone he's back in town We were starting to get concerned 
We were wondering if he'd ever return 
So gather 'round children or you shall miss 
The second coming of Chris He's acting so bored with existence 
He's working for a music mag 
Wants to get into radio promo 
But that business can be such a drag We were starting to get concerned 
We were wondering if he'd ever return 
So gather 'round children or you shall miss 
It's the second coming of Chris He's nothing but a trust fund baby 
Swimming in the deep end of the old gene pool 
Probably end up working for his parents 
After he goes back to school We were starting to get concerned 
We were wondering if he'd ever return 
So gather 'round children or you shall miss 
the second coming of Chris So give his pinkie ring a kiss 
The second coming of Chris Please sir, won't you tell us 
Where the action is 
It's the second coming of Chris
