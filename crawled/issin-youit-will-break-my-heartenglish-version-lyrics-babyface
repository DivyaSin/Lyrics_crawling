Verse 1 
I will leave the light on for you 
With a plate of food 
And at the door step darlin' 
I left the keys for you 
And I'll hold my tongue if that is your request, yeah 
We'll just take our time and talk 
No arguments 
B-Section 
Though it just might seem 
Alittle farfetched 
That we could work things out, well 
I still believe that 
That we'll make amends, yeah 
There's one thing for certain 
We could use some happiness 
We've been through it enough, my friend 
Chorus 
It will break my heart 
To see you go 
I'd rather die than live alone 
I don't wanna go nowhere 
And meet somebody new 
I'd rather spend my time 
Just missin'you 
Verse 2 
First thing tomorrow morning 
I will make me a list, yeah 
Of all the good things about us 
So we don't forget 
If we'd only concentrate on 
Just the good, yeah 
I know we could make a go of it 
I know that we could
