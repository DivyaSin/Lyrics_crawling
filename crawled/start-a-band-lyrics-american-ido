I never was a straight-laced, straight-A student 
Teacher's pet or child prodigy 
I wasn't gonna get rich throwin' a football 
It'd take too long to get a law degree So I sat down with momma and daddy 
They tried to talk some sense into my thick head 
But the best advice that I ever got 
Was from my sister's rock star boyfriend Just get you a guitar an' learn how to play 
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name 
When you're living in a world that you don't understand 
Find a few good buddies, start a band 
Start a band! Start a band And all those girls that were too cool to talk to 
They'll be waiting in the line out back 
Might get your picture in the hometown paper 
Maybe buy your momma that Cadillac Just get you a guitar an' learn how to play 
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name 
When you're living in a world that you don't understand 
Find a few good buddies, start a band Start a band, scrape up some money 
Buy a van, learn "Free Bird" and "Ramblin' Man" 
Never buy another beer again! So get you a guitar an' learn how to play 
Grow out your hair, come up with a name 
With a little bit of luck you'll be packing the stands 
Find a few good buddies, start a band No need to study, start a band 
Call up some buddies, man, and start a band
