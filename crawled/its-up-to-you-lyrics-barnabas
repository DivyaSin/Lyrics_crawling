I saw heaven open, and behold! A white horse 
With a Rider Who is Faithful and True 
His eyes are flames of fire, and on His head are many crowns 
In righteousness He'll judge and make war Whose side are you gonna be on when Jesus returns? 
You better make your decision now that you've heard 
Its up to you His is the kingdom; His is the power 
And the glory forever, amen 
Praises to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit 
Blessed be the name of the Lord You know the time is coming; every day is closer 
To the day when Jesus Christ will return 
You know He'll keep His promise; He said He'd be coming 
And the time is running out for this world
