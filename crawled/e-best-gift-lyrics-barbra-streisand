The best gift 
That I ever got 
Didn't really weigh a lot 
It didn't have a ribbon 'round 
And it sometimes made the terrible sound 
The best of all it seems to me 
It wasn't neath the christmas tree 
And yet, I guess I'd have to say 
That it made all the other presents twice as gay 
The best gift that I've ever known 
I'd always wanted most to own 
Yet in my dreams of sugar and spice 
I never thought it could be so nice 
The best gift that I ever get 
Was sometimes dry and sometimes wet 
Was usually pink but oftentimes red 
As it lay so innocently in it's bed 
The best gift of the year to me 
The one I hold most dear to me 
A gift that simply drove me wild 
Was a tiny new born child...
