Don't bother cryin', don't bother callin' 
It's all over now, no use in stallin' 
The love I once felt I don't feel anymore for you 
This time I'll even open the door for you. You walked out when I was down 
Well, now I'm well off and look, look who's comin' round. Where were you when I needed ya 
Where were you when I wanted ya 
Where were you when I needed ya 
Where? You're looking good, it's hard to fight it 
There's no use explaining, I've already decided 
That living with you is worse than without ya 
I won't spend a lifetime worrying about ya. Aah things got rough and you disappeared 
Now I'm back on my feet and look...look who's standing there. Where were you when I needed ya 
Where were you when I wanted ya 
Where were you when I needed ya 
Where? You were so young and you were so wild 
I knew you were nobody's innocent child 
The first day I saw you, you really got to me 
I thought I could change you, what good did it do me. Aah things got rough and you couldn't wait 
Now you're trippin' back but babe...babe it's too late. Where were you when I needed ya 
Where were you when I wanted ya 
Where were you when I needed ya 
Where? Where were you when I needed ya 
Where were you when I wanted ya 
Where were you when I needed ya 
Where?
