I am the nail that you cant strike 
I am the spear that will run you through And when the shots were falling we were sound asleep 
And you filled your palms with dirty bombs 
Instead of hand-grenades I am teeth which cannot bite 
Ill tear your garden up by the roots And when the shots were falling we were sound asleep 
And you filled your palms with dirty bombs 
Instead of hand-grenades Hear the seven bell tolls 
Ringing loud for you 
Coroners and vultures 
Cry out, Gloria! All across the valley 
Onward towards the sun 
The two-bit prophet sways and 
Pulls a price from everyone Feel the heavy hoof-beats 
Pound across the land 
The sin of our forefathers 
Lies within our clutching hands Watch the planes pass over 
Hear its call-to-arms 
The golden drunk of morning 
Made me straight my bended knee
