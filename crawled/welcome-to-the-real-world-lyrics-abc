I was a rich man 
I was a thief 
I was a sailor, shipwrecked on a reef 
I was a coward 
I was afraid 
I was courageous 
Man, I was brave Until the oceans dry 
Until the day you die 
Until the stars fall out the sky Welcome to the real world, baby 
Welcome to the way things are 
Welcome to the real world, darling 
Step on for Shangri-la 
Welcome to the real world, baby 
Paradise guarantee 
Welcome to the real world 
Come and see what we've bequeathed I was an angel, idolised 
I was a devil in a disguise 
I was a stalion 
I was a mule 
I was misguided, but nobody's fool [Chorus] 
The day that I was born, daddy placed me on his knee 
Said: "Son, you've got to be a better man than me 
You're inheriting the world; make your mark on history 
Welcome to the real world; be what you've got to be." Welcome to the real world
