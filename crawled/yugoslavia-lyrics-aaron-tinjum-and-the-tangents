[First Verse] 
Once dismissed as dark and drab 
Light breaks in and reflects back 
The citadel rises now 
And makes you wonder, well 
Is anything impossible at all? [Chorus] 
It's coming full circle 
Well, I suppose 
The feeling comes until it goes 
And in the wake 
Of my failed and fractured state 
I lay these prayers upon this page [Second Verse] 
The fortress walls they are cracked 
And downed defenses welcome attack 
Temptation waits on my soul 
And I'll either hold or fold, but 
Oh, the poor penitence I pay 
With my wicked ways [Chorus] 
It's coming full circle 
Well, I suppose 
The feeling comes until it goes 
And in the wake 
Of my failed and fractured state 
I lay these prayers upon this page [Instrumental] [Chorus] 
It's coming full circle 
Well, I suppose 
The feeling comes until it goes 
And in the wake 
Of my failed and fractured state 
I lay these prayers upon this page [Ending] 
It's coming full circle 
Now I believe 
How unorthodox of me
