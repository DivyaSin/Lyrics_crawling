(Doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) 
(Doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) 
(Doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) 
(Doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) Well, not too long ago in 1944 
When every mother's son was goin' off to war 
They had to lift they spirits high (High) 
For Uncle Sam, motherhood and apple pie 
Instead of spendin' money that they didn't have 
In hot spots in the Bronx 
They went to hear the kind of jazz 
You hear in funky honky tonks [Chorus:] 
It made you want to 
Jump (Jump), shout (Shout), knock yourself out 
A boogie-woogie beat is what I'm talkin' about 
If you had the heebie-jeebies you could dance away 
To the boogie-woogie music the piano man was playin' 
You could jump (Jump), shout (Shout), knock yourself out 
A boogie-woogie beat is what I'm talkin' about 
You could pull a switcheroonie if you felt low down 
With the boogie-woogie beat of a piano man who's goin' to town (Doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) 
(Doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) It had the kind of rhythm that would fill the hall 
The plinkin' and the plunkin' drove 'em up the wall 
And they would dance and drink their gin (Yeah) 
And when the fuzz (Fuzz) buzzed (Buzzed), they'd join in 
So everybody partied 'till the cows came home 
'cause that's what boogie's for 
And every night that dump would jump (Jump, jump) 
And keep 'em comin' back for more [Chorus] (doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) 
(doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) It made you want to 
Jump (Jump), shout (Shout) 
(Foo der acka sacki) 
Want to jump (Jump), shout (Shout) 
(Slip the talcum to me Malcolm) 
You want to jump (Jump), shout (Shout) 
(Floy doy, floy doy) 
To the boogie-woogie music the piano man was playin' You could jump (Jump), shout (Shout), knock yourself out 
A boogie-woogie beat is what I'm talkin' about 
You could pull a switcheroonie if you felt low down 
To the boogie-woogie beat of a piano, ha ha ha ha ha, ha (Doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) 
(Doot, doot, doot doo, yeah) 
(Shake it, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
(Shake it, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
(Shake it, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
(Shake it, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
(Shake it, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
(Shake it, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
(Shake it, yeah, yeah, yeah)
