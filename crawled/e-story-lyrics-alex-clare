? Wide just to fall 
You turned your back when I was lying on the floor 
Maybe that's a sacrifice called forth 
Let it give a better than I ever worked for (? dizzy, ? dizzy) But the story isn't over 
No, I only just begun 
You know sometimes it's hard to understand the road we're on 
The road we're on yeah Wear my fingers down to the phone 
Gave you everything, my mind, my heart, my soul 
If you'd seen the heartache in my eyes 
You know that I can never compromise (? dizzy, ? dizzy) But the story isn't over 
No, I only just begun 
You know sometimes it's hard to understand the road we're on 
The road we're on yeah The story's just beginning 
I can feel the rising sun 
You know sometimes it's hard to comprehend the road we're on 
The road we're on, yeah When you're at your end 
And the road's still on 
You know a broken bone 
Grows back twice as strong, yeah 
Grows back twice as strong, yeah You know sometimes it's hard to understand 
The road we're on, the road we're on 
The story's just beginning 
I can feel the rising sun 
You know sometimes it's hard to understand the road we're on 
The road we're on, the road we're on
