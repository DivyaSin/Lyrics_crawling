You are nothing but a false prophet 
A sworn enemy from the day we met 
Head held up higher than your eyes could see 
Your source of greed lacks divinity For all that is and whatever will be 
May you all die in your animosity Doesnt matter what is written 
Life will pass you by 
Cause a book full of stories 
Means nothing when you die To believe is naive 
His words may deceive 
To believe is naive 
Fuck you i geeve Take a chance 
Dont look back 
Take a chance 
Dont look back Take a chance 
Dont look back 
Cause time is running out 
Im in a trance 
With things i lack 
But dont have any doubt Take a chance 
Dont look back 
Cause time is running out 
Im in a trance 
With things i lack 
But dont have any doubt Take a chance I am your god 
not your friend 
He is fraud 
Embrace the end 
Embrace the end 
Embrace the end You are nothing (you are nothing) 
but a false prophet
