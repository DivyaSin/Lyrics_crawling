[Hook] 
It don't matter what yo skin tone 
White, yella, red, brown 
She a queen in the sheets 
And she finna get a crown 
Wit my name on it 
That pussy look good wit my name on it 
Wit my name on it 
That pussy look good wit my name on it [Verse 1] 
She just want my last name 
Now I just blow them candles out 
They leave that wax stain 
I put that D on it like she just got that bad grade 
Then let go, follow it I bet like I got bad aim (?!) 
Cashe, back lace, fat cake, latte, 50 shades of ball 
This 50 days of run, she luvin' on the crew 
I think she finna date the squad 
I put it on the box like posters 
She turn around, I poke it 
I write my name in cursive dent 
Sign it with emojis 
That's that smiley face, saddy face 
From that egg plant, egg plant 
Make that kiddy kad water sign 
And a has stand, has stand 
Body shots, can't stands 
I'm faded, whoop, up, whoop 
This is not a test, but she take it 
That pussy look amazing! (Oh my God) 
Wit my name on it, got Louie 
He was doin' it when he made on it 
Gotta wrap it up, like the rain comin' 
And I ain't got em lyin', but em J's comin' [Hook] 
No matter what yo skin tone 
White, yella, red, brown 
She a queen in the sheets 
And she finna get a crown 
Wit my name on it 
That pussy look good wit my name on it 
Wit my name on it 
That pussy look good wit my name on it [Verse 2] 
Pussy look good wit my name on it 
Perfect picture, make a nigga put a frame on it 
Yup, treat it like a base drum, I'mma bang on it 
Neva liked playn, I like mary jane all in 
Gimme gong 'efo I hit, call it head start 
She say that I drive her crazy, where my damn car? 
I ain't even drive, I ain't even tryin' 
She wet like the ocean, I go scuba diving 
She a cool girl, oh yeah, her man a looser 
We not makin' no music, I make a hit to halo 
She 'ok, baby, you flex, got all that junk in yo trunk' 
Now lemme get behind that trunk so you can come back it up
