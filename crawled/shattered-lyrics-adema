Do you wake up and wonder where you're really going 
Reach the age in your life, you wanted to achieve you goals 
No 
Confusion, it lingers, making me feel sick to my stomach 
Because who knows what will happen next I've shattered into pieces in this world 
I've shattered into pieces in this world 
(This world, your world, my world) Confusion, it lingers, a fear of loathing that I regret 
Because who knows what will happen next I've shattered into pieces in this world 
(This world, your world, my world) 
I've shattered into pieces in this world 
(This world, your world, my world) What do you want in life 
Do you have plans for the future 
I wonder, does anything matter 
It's not all the same old fate and it's all wrong 
Hold onto your goals or you'll have nothing (You have) 
Nothing 
(You have) 
Nothing 
(You have) 
Nothing Why 
Have I shattered into pieces in this world I've shattered into pieces in this world 
(this world, your world, my world) 
I've shattered into pieces in this world 
(this world, your world, my world) 
I've shattered into pieces in this world 
(this world, your world...) 
My world
