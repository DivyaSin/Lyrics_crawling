Its kinda like murder 
It's kinda like a murder 
Only how much does it hurt 
I don't understand this pain 
Something's wrong but I cannot ? 
I don't wanna deal with this 
Every days a waste 
It seems like such a pretty face 
I can't keep the image in 
You can't control what you cannot admit 
Depression is all in vein 
The pressure is building in my head 
There's no way to bleed myself of this 
She drives the vampire blade through my heart 
Leave it up to fate and try to kill off thoughts of hate 
The voices are creeping in 
If I don't then my minds ? 
I'm loading the gun again 
The pressure is building in my head 
There's no way to bleed myself of this 
She drives the vampire blade through my heart 
Its kinda like murder 
Through my heart 
Its kinda like murder 
Through my heart
