After you go 
I can catch upon my reading 
After you go 
I'll have a lot more time for sleeping 
And when you're gone 
It looks like things are going to be a lot easier 
Life will be a breeze you know I really should be glad 
But I'm bluer than blue 
Sadder than sad 
You're the only life this empty room has ever had 
Life without is going to be 
Bluer than blue After you go 
I'll have a lot more room in my closet 
After you go 
I'll stay out all night if I feel like it 
And when you're gone 
I could run through the house screaming 
And no one will ever hear me I really should be glad 
But I'm bluer than blue 
Sadder than sad 
You're the only life this empty room has ever had 
Life without is going to be 
Bluer than blue
