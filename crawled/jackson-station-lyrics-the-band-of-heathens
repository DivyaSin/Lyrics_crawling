Mama got a voice like sugar so sweet and fine 
Sister singing Amazing Grace, right in time 
They're laying poor papa low, in the ground that he worked and sowed 
They waitin' at the Jackson Station for the train to roll She been up all night, she got crows walking round her eyes 
She can still raise a cup in a toast to a well run dry 
He left her on a Tuesday still, Gin, Whiskey and a bottle of pills 
Now she's waitin' at the Jackson Station looking over the hill Take me away, hear that whistle play a sad, sad song 
Lay me down, where the river runs wide and strong 
Sometimes she rides a ticket home 
Other times she'll leave you all alone 
Just waitin' at the Jackson Station for the train to go The 4:19 rolls on the Red Ball Line 
The backwater shacks been waking to the 419 
She got the smoke coming out of the stack, dead running on a 10-mile track 
Waitin' at the Jackson Station never coming back
