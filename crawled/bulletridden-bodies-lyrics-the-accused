In 1989 in New York city alone 
140 youths under the age of 18 
Were gunned down 
Gunned down 
Bullet ridden bodies 
The streets are the new battle fields 
Someone's gonna die, the blood never stops flowing 
The streets are the new battle fields 
Littered with bullet ridden bodies 
And families mourning their dead. 14 years ol selling five dollar rocks of crack cocaine 
You ripped off the wrong people 
Now you've got the sights of the 9mm 
Aimed at the back, back of your head. The first shot fired pierces his skull 
As eight more shots are pumped into his body 
As he crumples into the new fallen snow. 14 years ol selling five dollar rocks of crack cocaine 
You crossed the wrong people 
Now you've got the sights of the 9mm 
Aimed at the back, back of your head. The blood, his blood, drips from the snow 
Into the slush-filled streets. 
A crowd starts to gather 
A young girl begins to scream BOGOTA, COLUMBIA 
50 bodies float down a raging river 
Hands cut off at the wrist 
Headless and bloated from weeks 
In the tropical water. The streets are the new battle fields 
Someone's gonna die, the blood never stops flowing 
The streets are the new battle fields 
An families mourning their dead.
