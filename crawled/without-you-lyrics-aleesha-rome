You were the one who made me laugh 
I guess we were moving way to fast 
Someone should have told you 
Love was just a curse 
And when it comes to jealousy 
You know you were the worst 
Now all I have to live for 
An echo in the hall 
A broken heart, a memory - and your picture on the wall Without you, the one I would cry for 
Without you, the one I would die for 
Without you I know I was wrong to stay so late 
But you made me mad I made you wait 
I was only flirting - I didn't want to start a fight 
And how was I to know that someone had a knife 
I only saw a flash - and then I saw you fall 
Then someone started screaming - and you were on the floor Without you, the one I would cry for 
Without you, the one I would die for 
Without you, the one I would lie for 
Without you
