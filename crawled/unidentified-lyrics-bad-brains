No, I can't take it no more. Living a fantasy with my face laying flat on the floor, how many days till the eagle flies, another one goes, another one gets by. It's time to get high, high up above you search for our crop and sudenly you drop. Drop. You, you walk right through my door unidentified, now it's time to lesson the score. played by the rules of fools, now they've gone and convinced you of much more. Now its time to fly, Your unidentified. There's no way to avoid the blood you say, is it the taste you desire, do you know the right form the wrong, the right from the wrong, no I ca't take it no more... and suddenly you drop.
