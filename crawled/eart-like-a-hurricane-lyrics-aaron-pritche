Shes not easy to get close to 
When youre on the outside looking in 
Just when you think youve got her figured out 
Shell turn and run away again Shes got a heart like a hurricane 
Causing everyone around her pain 
But in the eye of the storm 
Theres a place thats safe and warm 
In her heart like a hurricane If you think you cant stand the weather 
Afraid of running through the rain 
Deep inside her soul 
Theres a place where she can hold you 
Close to her and never let you go Chorus Solo Chorus In her heart like a hurricane 
In her heart like a hurricane
