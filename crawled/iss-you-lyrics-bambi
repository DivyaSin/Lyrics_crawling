Never thought it would come 2 be 
That id be this lonely 
Remember the times we had 
But its over 
Cant close my eyes no more 
Without seein u walk out that door 
Wish i could take it back 
Y didnt stop u 
And show u how i cared 
Then i wouldnt be dazin 
W/ that long lost satre I'm hopin 
I'm wishin 
I'm dremin 
That boi ur hearin me now 
'cause theres shit i gotta tell u 
And i'm tryin to figure out how 
So let me get it out 
And i hope u'll hear it soon 
'cause baby the truth is 
I will always miss u
