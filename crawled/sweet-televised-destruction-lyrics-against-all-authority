Sit back and watch the world crumble. 
Humanity has stumbled. 
No commercial interruptions. 
Sweet televised destruction. Wave your flag and chant the slogans. 
Watch digitized explosions. 
No Commercial interruptions. 
Sweet Televised destruction. It's gonna swallow you and me this time. 
We've gone too far the world is in decline. 
One nation one people. 
No borders no evil. 
Burn the shrines that we've designed. 
Stand as one. 
Unified. Controlling all our lives. 
Our backs are full of knives. 
State sponsored genocide. 
So sweet and televised
