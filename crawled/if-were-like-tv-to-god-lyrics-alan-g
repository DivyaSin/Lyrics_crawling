I think that God's sittin' 
On a big cloud in Heaven 
Wondrin' what's happ'ning below 
So He plugs in a big screen 
That's just like a TV 
And clicks on His heavenly remote He sees all the people 
In crystal-clear detail 
All of them crazy or odd 
Do you think He would laugh 
Would He cry or get mad 
If we were like TV to God What if we all are 
Just like big TV stars 
On a fancy reality show 
Would God have the stomach 
To look and not get sick 
Oh the scandals He'd know For some He would gotta 
Shield His eyes to watch 'em 
And some He could not watch at all 
And He'd Tivo some guys 
To fast-forward their lives 
When the dull boring parts would come on How would you act if someone were watching? 
Would you be bad more than not 
Would you live the same 
Be all shameless or lame 
If we were like TV to God? Some people are sitcoms 
That He likes to turn on 
When He is in need of a smile 
And some people's mommas 
Are just like the dramas 
Emotions all crazy and wild And some are like cop shows 
All action and gusto 
Others are news shows - so grim 
And some are like reruns 
In a rut since they were young 
If we were like TV to Him How would you act if someone were watching? 
If everyone knew what you got 
Would you still be bad 
Do the things that you had 
If we were like TV to God Sometimes I believe 
I have grown up to be 
The kind of show God finds too weird 
Does He understand 
I just like to be bad 
My picture ain't always too clear And I don't have those special effects 
Or big guest stars 
My ratings aren't all number one 
But it's early, you know 
Still can make a good show 
Soon as the commercials are done How would I act if someone were watching? 
Would I still be crazy a lot 
But I hope I could handle 
If He changed the channel 
If I were like TV to God So live like you dare 
Someone's watchin' upstairs 
We are like TV to God
