All I want is your love 
Your love is all I need 
All I want is your love 
Your love means everything 
All I want is the happiness and joy you bring 
All I want is gone so now will life go on for me I've got the will, I just need the way 
Maybe I can make it through this hurt another day 
Since you left me, baby since you're gone 
I find it harder and harder everyday to hang on And the rain came down, and down it came 
Down so hard, I can't stand the pain 
I just can't stand the rain anymore 
And once I do finally break away 
See me comin' don't ya' get in my way 
I wish upon my lucky star that day will come Can't find my 4 leaf clover 
Nowhere near over you 
Look for it over and over 
Nowhere near over soon 
Can't find my 4 leaf clover 
Heartache is overdue 
It's over, it's over, it's over 
All I want is your love 
Your love is all I need 
All I want is your love 
Your love means everything I wanna die, but then, I wanna live 
So many times it takes much more than I can give 
Don't ya' need me, don't ya' feel it's wrong 
Sometimes I just can't find the strength to carry on And the rain came down, and down it came 
Down so hard I can't stand the pain 
I just can't stand the rain anymore 
And once I do finally break away 
See me comin' don't ya' get in my way 
I wish upon my lucky star that day will come Can't find my 4 leaf clover 
Nowhere near over you 
Look for it over and over 
Nowhere near over soon 
Can't find my 4 leaf clover 
Heartache is overdue 
It's over, it's over, it's over Can't find my 4 leaf clover 
Nowhere near over you 
Look for it over and over 
Nowhere near over soon 
Can't find my 4 leaf clover 
Heartache is overdue 
It's over, it's over, it's over All I want is, all I need is, all your love 
All I want is your love 
Your love is all I need 
All I want is your love 
Your love means everything 
All I want is your love 
All I need is all your love 
All I want, all I need, is all your love
