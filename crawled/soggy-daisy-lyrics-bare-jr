I had a nurse at home called the Soggy Daisy 
Seven lonely people all died in one day 
Seven people put away and forgotten 
Seven people with a lifetime of wisdom for their offering Here are some people who had loved and lived 
May had done things that they wished they never did 
Sometimes in life got bored and sad 
May have been gay and dressed up like a bride A great seducer, a horrible singer, an unknown psycho-killer 
A devout Christian on a mission that he or she lost faith in 
A hopeless romantic, a survivor of the Titanic 
A small person who wished they were gigantic A loud person who thought too much of them self 
Sharp person who never knew they're better than everyone else 
Great artist who knew they were sham 
A lawyer always found a new way to scam [Incomprehensible] never made one mistake 
A macho man who's hard, never felt enough to break 
A mother who loved too much, a brother who teases as much 
A sister who spied and cried too much A dancer who survived cancer only to die 
Chicken with some manila figurative 
Sneaking as to get a Libra 
A Sagittarius, a person who could care less A hair blade you or braid you 
A kindergarten teacher's story 
A loner, a passionate murderer, a butcher, a baker 
A constant masturbator who asked me never read A terrible reminder of the worth treasures 
Inside the shoes our elders 
Have been sentenced to die alone 
And before you turn away from this page Remember we'll all be there someday 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Load of hay, happy headily, lee 
Pickle pink, murder way Didley, aunt May, May 
Jim and Joe, Ricky Roe, Didley Doe with me alone
