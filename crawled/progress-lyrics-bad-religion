And progress is not intelligently planned 
It's the facade of our heritage 
The odor of our land 
They speak of progress 
In red, white and blue 
It's the structure of the future 
As demise comes seething through 
It's progress 'til there's nothing left to gain 
As the dearth of new ideas 
Makes us wallow in our shame 
So before you go to contribute more 
To the destruction of this world you adore 
Remember life on earth is but a flash of dawn 
And we're all part of it as the day rolls on And progress is a message that we send 
One step closer to the future 
One inch closer to the end 
I say progress is a synonym of time 
We are all aware of it but it's nothing we refine 
And progress is a debt we all must pay 
It's convenience we all cherish 
It's pollution we disdain 
And the cutting edge is dulling 
Too many folks to plow through 
Just keep your fuckin' distance 
And it can't include you!
