You don't like my hair 
The clothes that I wear 
You've got a problem with my attitude 
You don't like my music 
You say it's abusive 
It's got no class and it's downright lewd 
I've got nothing, I've got nothing, I've got nothing, I've nothing to prove 
I've got nothing, I've got nothing, I've got nothing, I've nothing to prove 
I don't think I'm going crazy 
I might be slightly radged 
But what you see, is what you get 
And I'm not all that bad 
'cause I've got nothing to prove 
I do what I want 
I say what I feel 
I tell you it straight and I keep it real 
If you've got a problem 
Then you've got to solve them 
Get out of my face 'cause I'm the real deal 
I've got nothing, I've got nothing, I've got nothing, I've nothing to prove 
I've got nothing, I've got nothing, I've got nothing, I've nothing to prove 
I don't think I'm going crazy 
I might be slightly radged 
But what you see, is what you get 
And I'm not all that bad 
'cause I've got nothing to prove 
I've got nothing to prove 
You got nothing to prove 
We've got nothing to prove 
Have you got something to prove
