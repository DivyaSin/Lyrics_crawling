I could sing the blues any way I choose, if I wanted 
I could turn you around, I could bring you down, if I wanted But it's not my constitution, it's not my way of life 
You know, I'm just a lover for my wife I could join a race, I could paint my face, if I wanted 
I could be a queen, but it's not my scene 'cause I've tried it And it's not my constitution, it's not my way of life 
You know, I'm just a lover for my wife

I could bring you down, I could turn you around, if I wanted But it's not my constitution, it's not my way of life 
You know, I'm just a lover for my wife 
Hey, yea
