Listen to a lonely sound 
See the gray and sadness all around 
See the people go their way 
Care not of me and love I've lost today Maybe tomorrow, I will love again 
I'll never know until I looked into her eyes 
Maybe tomorrow, I will love again 
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice And so I'm living for a dream 
Each lonely day spent looking for the sunshine 
I make believe that I don't care 
I tell my friends I love my life I'm happy Maybe tomorrow, I will love again 
I'll never know until I looked into her eyes 
Maybe tomorrow, I will love again 
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice Wherever, whoever you may be 
Let the light of your love Shine through the window of my heart 
Then when you've colored all thoughts bright 
Don't let me ever, ever thing of night, no-oo yeah Maybe tomorrow, you will love again 
I'll never know until I look into her eyes 
Maybe, tomorrow, you will love again 
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice Maybe tomorrow, you will love again 
Maybe tomorrow, I will love!
