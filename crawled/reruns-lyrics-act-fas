Sometimes i 
Feel my life 
Has stopped before 
It has begun 
Nothing's changed 
It's all the same 
My life is just reruns *chorus* 
Sitting alone 
In my room 
Another wasted night 
Another episode 
Constantly repeated 
Forever is my life 
So I conclude that 
Reality bites (look mom, I'm on tv!) 
Don't know if I can cope 
If everyone knows 
When I am down 
When I am low 
Was it all a lie 
My whole damn life 
Was everything wrong 
Was nothing right
