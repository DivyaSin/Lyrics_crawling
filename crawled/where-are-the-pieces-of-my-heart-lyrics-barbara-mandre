WHERE ARE THE PIECES OF MY HEART (Hugh Prestwood) You took your suitcase and your toothbrush 
And walked out in your walking shoes 
You left behind this little letter breaking me the news 
But now some things of mine are missing 
Some things that I could dearly use 
And since the evidence points to you 
I must accuse I don't mean to be unfriendly 
All I want is to be fair 
I'll be more than glad to share 
But you gotta tell me where 
Are the pieces of my heart It was bad enough to break it 
After all that we've been through 
But then to go on and take it 
Was unkind of you 
Every night I feel so empty 
This pain is more than I can bear 
Even if you do not care 
You just gotta tell me where 
Are the pieces of my heart It's not the first time it's been broken 
It's been dropped a time or two 
I got to piece it together 
And then get over you 
Where even if you do not care 
You just gotta tell me where 
Are the pieces of my heart Where even if you do not care 
You just gotta tell me where 
Are the pieces of my heart
