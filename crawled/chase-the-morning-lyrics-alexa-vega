Shilo, is your name Shilo? 
Can I talk to you? 
Can you come down please 
So we can speak? I saw you at the show 
I thought I'd seen a ghost 
Your resemblance is striking 
You have your mother's eyes Her hair, I was told you died with her 
All these years have come and gone 
How do I put this? I'm your God mom State your business 
Business? 
What do you want? I want, I want to finally meet you 
Something real to cling to 
Leave you with the hope that 
You will go do all you're meant to 
All I've failed to In you is a world of promise 
We have both been kept in bondage 
But you can learn from all my failures I'm not supposed to talk to strangers 
Or let them through the gate? 
That either, a big risk, a big fence 
A mistake, a new friend Chase the morning 
Yield for nothing 
Chase the morning 
Yield for nothing How'd you do that? Do what? 
Do that, that, that eye thing 
These eyes can do more than see 
I know I mean, I've seen you sing 
Where? From my window 
I can see the world from there 
Name the stars and constellations 
Count the cars and watch the seasons I wish we could've watched together 
I can't have guests 
Never? Ever if dad found out 
That I'd been let out or you'd been let in 
I should go then, before I do promise me you won't 
It's better that you Don't forget me 
'Best if I resume my life inside my bedroom 
Don't forget that a sheltered rose needs a little 
Room to bloom outside her bedroom Chase the morning 
Yield for nothing 
Chase the morning 
Yield for nothing Let your life be your dream 
Integrity, honesty 
It's too late for me 
Don't look back 'til you're free to Chase the morning 
Yield for nothing 
Chase the morning 
Yield for nothing 
Yield for nothing
