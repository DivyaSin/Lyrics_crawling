[Verse 1] I saw you at Sagrada Familia 
Something in your swagger was so similar 
To a girl I used to know 
To a love I used to hold [Chorus] I still remember those nights 
Inside your Gaudi room 
With your tambourine on the wall 
And Spanish Rice you said 
Was not actually from Spain 
What a gringo thing for me to say [Verse 2] I saw you at Casa Mila 
Something in your fragrance felt familiar 
But you did not know me at all 
No, you did not know me at all [Chorus] But I still remember those nights 
Inside your Gaudi room 
With your Joan Miro on the wall 
And Spanish Rice you said 
Was not actually from Spain 
What a gringo thing for me to claim [Verse 3] I fell on down in Valencia 
In a fiery fiesta so peculiar 
They torched effigies of your face 
My burning desire displaced [Chorus] But I still remember those nights 
Inside your Gaudi room 
With Las Fallas flames fanning through 
And Spanish Rice you said 
Was not actually from Spain 
What a gringo thing for me to sing
