Tell me your destination 
Could need some inspiration 
Don't make too much of it 
Now let's not analyze This is a game with no rules 
I won't comit to I do 
All I can say for sure is 
What will be will be In days of joy and lack of sorrow (lack of sorrow) 
I live my life the way I planned I am not a sinner nor a saint 
Not that I would loose my head and faint 
Every time we touch, no 
Am I forgiven 
Living and loving my way I am not a sinner nor a saint 
You never gonna break my heart, I ain't 
Gonna let it happen, no 
Am I forgiven 
Confessions I make in the name of myself Am I a badboy, maybe 
Am I a sadboy, let's see 
I can't remember crying 
Since I was a child Don't need no babysitter 
No I am not that bitter 
I get my satisfaction 
Every now and then In days of joy and lack of sorrow (lack of sorrow) 
I live my life the way I planned I am not a sinner nor a saint 
Not that I would loose my head and faint 
Every time we touch, no 
Am I forgiven 
Living and loving my way I am not a sinner nor a saint 
You never gonna break my heart, I ain't 
Gonna let it happen, noo 
Am I forgiven 
Confessions I make in the name of myself Ah 
Not that I would loose my head and faint 
Every time we touch, noo 
Am I forgiven 
Living and loving my way I am not a sinner nor a saint 
You never gonna break my heart, I ain't 
Gonna let it happen, noo 
Am I forgiven 
Confessions I make in the name of myself
