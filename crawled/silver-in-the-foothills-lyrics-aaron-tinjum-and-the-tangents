[Verse 1] 
Looking out across a valley 
The windswept vista of my dreams 
And at the edge of this reality 
Nothing's ever as it seems [Chorus] 
There's silver in the foothills 
But that's so far away from here 
How can I change my mind or direction? 
When my compass points the same 
When my values haven't changed [Verse 2] 
There's nothing I can do to change that 
Nowhere I can turn or run 
These city lights they never soothed me 
Amid the sirens and neon [Chorus] 
There's silver in the foothills 
But that's so far away from here 
How can I change my mind or direction? 
When my compass points the same 
When my values haven't changed
