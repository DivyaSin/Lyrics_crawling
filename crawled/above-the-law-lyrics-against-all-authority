Couldn't get in the show We had nowhere to go Hangin' out in the street We were just out havin' fun In the Miami heat We were just kickin' the shit Four punks in a park We didn't bother no one You had to prove your a man A big stick in your hand It was late it was dark You're just a pig motherfucker You wear your badge with pride A gun close by your side Just a pig Above the law You motherfucker You think you're big You're fuckin' nothing but a pig You like to push us around That's how you have your fun You're the law in this town You answer to no one But who protects us from you From me you'll get no respect You swore to serve and protect It's time to pay your dues Out in the cold dark street I should have put up a fight I think back to that night But my revenge will be sweet You pushed too far this time And I've committed no crime You're gonna die You're gonna die pig In the shadows I hide A blade close by my side I keep myself out of sight Under a blanket of night Now on your own blood you'll choke Your wound pours out in a flood Feel my blade at your throat I slip and slide on your blood Your body drops with a thud I push your face in the mud
