Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you 
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new 
Flashback, warm nights, almost left behind 
Suitcase of memories time after Sometimes you picture me I'm walking too far ahead 
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you said 
And then you say go slow, I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds If you're lost you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting 
Time after time If you're lost you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting 
Time after time After my pictures fade and darkness has turned to gray 
Watching through windows you're wondering if I'm okay 
Secrets stolen from deep inside, the drum beat's out of time If you're lost you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting 
Time after time You say go slow, I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds If you're lost you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting 
Time after time If you're lost you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting 
Time after time If you're lost you can look and you'll 
Really, really, really, really find me time after time 
Whoa, if you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting 
Time after time Say, if you're lost you can look and you 
Really, really, really, really, really, really, find me 
Hey, if you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting 
Time after time Say, time after time, how long, how long 
Time after time, how long will I love? 
Time after time, how long, how long? 
Time after time, how long, how long? Time after time, I'll be loving you always 
I'll be loving you always, I'll be loving you always 
I'll be loving you always, I'll be loving you always
