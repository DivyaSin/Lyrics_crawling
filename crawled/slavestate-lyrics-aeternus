I have decreased your freedom 
Abhorrence and decay spat forth by me 
I will make your living hell in this realm of torment 
Slave state 
I will nourish you on undying pain 
Teach you ways you've never seen 
Walk the path of my misanthropy 
Each step a greater pain 
I am the air you breathe 
I decide your state of consciousness 
I am the world you see 
I decide which ground to walk on 
How does it feel to be a part of my one man slave state 
To be my only victim 
From this day on and forever
