I can still see the reasons that I opened my eyes to this scene in the first place 
I can still feel my beliefs growing stronger everyday 
I can still count the ways 
But for you it's all over the meaning is gone and you're moving on 
And tearing us down with you 
You've shed your past, grown up fast 
Demanding that we all mature at your pace, but here I remain refusing to change Remembering when we were the same 
I support your decision, I believe in change and you find 
Just what it is that you are looking for? 
But when you sit around and talk shit about everything that you once based your whole life on 
That is where you can count me out 
Because I will be here tomorrow and I will be here next year 
Just like this X on the back of my hand, I'm not going nowhere
