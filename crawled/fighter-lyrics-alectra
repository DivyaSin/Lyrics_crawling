Put your dukes up 
Loving me's like a battle scene 
From the start you fought the war for me 
Now it's my turn babe We found love 
We fought hate 
We looked fear in its face 
Now I'll walk through the fire For you I am a fighter, fighter, fighter 
Your love it takes me higher, higher, higher 
I've been down but now 
I'm swinging back, I'm swinging back 
For you I am a fighter, fighter, fighter 
And I'm never tapping out I will keep on soldiering 
I won't let you fall 
Oh, together as a team 
We're unstoppable We found love 
We fought hate 
We looked fear in its face 
Now I'll walk through the fire For you I am a fighter, fighter, fighter 
Your love it takes me higher, higher, higher 
I've been down but now 
I'm swinging back, I'm swinging back 
For you I am a fighter, fighter, fighter 
And I'm never tapping out I'll try to pull the punches till the time is right, I know 
To see the light, I'll sacrifice 
Battling I can see we're gonna win this war For you I am a fighter, fighter, fighter 
Your love it takes me higher, higher, higher 
I've been down but now 
I'm swinging back, I'm swinging back 
For you I am a fighter, fighter, fighter 
And I'm never tapping out For you I am a fighter, fighter, fighter 
Your love it takes me higher, higher, higher 
I've been down but now 
I'm swinging back, I'm swinging back 
For you I am a fighter, fighter, fighter 
And I'm never tapping out
