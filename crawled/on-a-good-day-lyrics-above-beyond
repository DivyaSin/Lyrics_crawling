Little bit lost and 
A little bit lonely 
Little bit cold here 
A little bit feared But I hold on 
And I 
Feel strong 
And I 
Know that I can Getting used to it 
Lit the fuse to it 
Like to know who I am Been talking to myself forever, yeah 
And how I wish I knew me better, yeah 
Still sitting on a shelf and never 
Never seen the sun shine brighter 
And it feels like me 
On a good day And it feels like me 
On a good day Been talking to myself forever, yeah 
And how I wish I knew me better, yeah 
Still sitting on a shelf and never 
Never seen the sun shine brighter 
And it feels like me 
On a good day On a good day 
On a good day 
And it feels like me 
On a good day
