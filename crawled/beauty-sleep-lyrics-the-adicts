There you go weeping like a willow 
Lay your head down on my pillow 
Come on stop your poses 
Come on it's a bed of roses 
We can dream all night together 
Or my nightmare could last forever 
So sad the way you cry 
You've made your bed 
Now you've got to lie in it 
Beauty sleep, beauty get your beauty sleep 
Beauty sleep, beauty get your beauty sleep 
Beauty sleep, beauty get your beauty sleep 
Beauty sleep with me 
It's not so late around midnight 
Blow out the candlelight 
Let it take you 
Close your eyes 
Let it make heave a sigh 
Come on 
Let's go to the land of darkness 
Feel the sandman's 
soft and sweet caress 
When we wake 
and raise our sleepy heads 
Will we remember 
the dreamy things we said 
Beauty sleep, beauty get your beauty sleep 
Beauty sleep, beauty get your beauty sleep 
Beauty sleep, beauty get your beauty sleep 
Beauty sleep with me 
Woah I won't let you go oh no 
There you go weeping like a willow 
Lay your head down by my side 
Come on come on baby 
Come on girl you drive me crazy 
Beauty sleep, beauty get your beauty sleep 
Beauty sleep, beauty get your beauty sleep 
Beauty sleep, beauty get your beauty sleep 
Beauty sleep with me (x2) 
Woah I won't let you go no no 
Woah
