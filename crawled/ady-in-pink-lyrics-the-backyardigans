Who is the girl who's got bad on her mind 
Who thinks evil thought with a smile and a wink 
Who's the girl with a plan to mess up mankind 
Me, I'm the lady in pink Lady in pink, lady in pink 
She's bad, she's evil 
And I'm worse than you think 
Me, I'm the lady in pink Who is the girl who never plays nice 
And wishes that all rubber duckies would sink 
Who interrupts people and never thinks twice 
Me, I'm the lady in pink Lady in pink, lady in pink 
She does terrible things 
Even worse than you think 
I'm the lady in pink She's selfish and cruel and I totally rule 
She stops at nothing to win 
She cheats and she lies, I don't even like pie 
When there's bad to be done come to me Those containers, you better forget it 
They'll be mine before you can blink 
Wherever they are you can bet who'll get them 
Me, I'm the lady in pink Lady in pink, lady in pink 
Ain't she totally evil? Now what do you think? 
Lady in pink, lady in pink 
Me, me, me, me, me, I'm the lady in pink
