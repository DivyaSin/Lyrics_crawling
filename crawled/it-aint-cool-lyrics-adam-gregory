I used to wander why the songs on the radio 
Always seem to be about love 
If you look ever book, every TV show 
Is just full of that stuff They write about it, talk about it 
Inside and out 
They even cry about it 
For crying out loud 
Ah, but now that I've got it 
I get it now It ain't cool to sing love songs 
But I'm singing one to you 
It ain't cool to sing love songs 
But I'm giving one to you 
And if you laugh at me 
That's how it's going to be 
'Cause I'm doing it 
Yes it's true 
Ah, 'cause now that I've got it 
I get it now The way folks go on and on about it 
They're gonna wear the word out 
And every time you see a poor fool fall in it 
That's all he talks about 
I enver understood why the subject of love 
Was the biggest thing around 
Ah, but now that I've got it 
I get it now
