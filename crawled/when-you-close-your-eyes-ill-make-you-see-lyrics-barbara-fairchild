If I could just get you to love me one more time 
For just a moment have you here with me 
With your sweet lips next to mine you lose all track of time 
Cause when you close your eyes that's when I'll make you see 
It's been a while since you have been here in my arms 
Oh how they ache to hold you tenderly 
I've got so much love to give if you'll take it we'll both live 
And when you close your eyes that's when I'll make you see I'll make you see the sky is just a little bit bluer 
I'll make you see my love is just a little bit truer 
And I hope your heart and mind make you want me all the time 
And when you close your eyes I'll make you see 
I'll make you see the birds will sing a little bit sweeter 
I'll make you see that I love you a little completer 
If you'll take me in your arms let me keep you nice and warm 
And then just close your eyes I'll make you see 
Then you love me
