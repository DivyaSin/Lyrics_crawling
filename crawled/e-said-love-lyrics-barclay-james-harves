There once was a man 
Who was born to be king 
He changed all our lives 
And he made my heart sing He turned water into wine 
And called his fishermen 
He cured the sick, the lame could walk 
The blind could see again He told us of the shepherds 
And the flowers in the field 
The story of the farmer's seed 
And the harvest it would yield He told us of two houses 
And the man who lost his son 
Of two men in the temple 
And the Good Samaritan Love, only love's gonna take you higher 
(Love) 
Love, only love's gonna carry you home 
(Love) He healed the soldier's servant 
He calmed the raging sea 
He shared five loaves and two small fish 
And five thousand he did feed He told the rich men share your wealth 
He cured the ten sick men 
He raised a friend called Lazarus 
And made him whole again He said, "Love, only love's gonna take you higher" 
(Love) 
Love, only love's gonna carry you home 
(Love) He taught the people how to pray 
The children he did bless 
And Mary came with perfume 
Before his feet she wept He gave us bread, His body 
He gave us wine, His blood 
He asked us all to live in peace 
And nothing do but good Now one friend did betray him 
Another did deny 
With arms outstretched he died 
So all of mankind could survive There once was a man 
Who was born to be king 
He'll change all your lives 
If you'll just let him in He said, "Love, only love's gonna take you higher" 
(Love) 
He said, "Love, only love's gonna carry you home" 
(Love) Love and understanding carries you home 
Love, only love's gonna take you higher 
(Love, higher and higher) 
He said, "Love, only love's gonna carry you home" 
(Love, only love's gonna carry you home) Love, only love's gonna take you higher 
(Love, higher and higher) 
He said, "Love, only love's gonna carry you home" 
(Love, only love's gonna carry you home)
