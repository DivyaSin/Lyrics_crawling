I recall as a boy we would hop the freights 
Wasn't nothin' but a kick back then 
There was no better thrill for my anxious heart 
Than a long flatcar Headin' out of the yard 
And I knew even then she was in my blood 
Like the time when I first hired on 
And the fireman laughed at my bony nose But he tossed me a cap 
Said GM&O 
And I was a man... I gave her my best years 
Well, what can you do but laugh 
I don't expect she'll ever be coming back When we climbed up the great Appalachians 
Her engines would be raging like hell 
Then we'd come back down to the rising towns 
Where the cattle stare In the frozen air 
For me there nothing more sacred 
Than the beautiful sound she'd make 
Her long blue signal blowin' deep in the night, It would get to me there, 
It would get to me there 
Now I'm afraid... Afraid of these silent hours 
Awake underneath my old cap 
I don't expect she'll ever be coming back Well, I watched the beginning of the end for her 
When I saw my first jet airplane 
Flying high overhead like a bird of prey 
While the mighty fell In the land of the brave 
Now I'm alone.
