Rescue me when I get too deep, 
Talk to me there's nothing to tell, 
Everyone, is a hypocrite, 
Look to me, 
I'll save your soul 
Now somebody out there must be 
Reading my mail 
'cause' everybody knows 
I'm a man with a mission, 
Coming to your town today, 
I can damn you to fiery perdition, 
'cause' I'm a man with a mission 
Follow me, when you give up, 
Work for me, it'll serve you well 
Everyone is a hypocrite, come to me, 
I'll save your soul 
Now somebody out there must be 
Tapping my phone, 
'cause everybody knows 
I'm a man with a mission, 
I'm gonna fly you away, 
High above the noise and competition, 
Yeah I'm a man with a mission, 
Passing through your town today 
I condemn you 
To fiery perdition, 
Yeah I'm a man with a mission
