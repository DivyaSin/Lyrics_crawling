I am often trying on the inside 
and you are sometimes waiting for the plan 
but don't wait cause I don't mind 
if you won't understand I am trying hard to change the subject 
Its subject to change anyway 
God this is fun to play 
Said the things you'ld never say 
I know that you're not right 
There's little chance that you'll be wrong tonight Sick jokes, quick pokes help to keep this all together 
So late, long skate I guess could do a few things better 
Let's go 
I'll try and show you things that I don't know You are trying hard to weigh the issues 
But I don't see an issue with the weight 
You used to be right on time 
Its the second time your late I am often sitting on my laurels 
while you are busy making stands 
none of this was planned 
I could lend you a hand 
Don't know it feels so right 
I think that I can finally sleep tonight sick jokes, quick pokes help to keep this all together 
So late, long skate I guess could do a few things better 
Lets go 
I'll try and show you things that I don't know Waste not want not some things you got by always being you 
Come in begin I can't find sin reacting like we do 
Everyone knows this is true I am often trying on the inside 
and you are sometimes waiting for the plan 
but don't wait cause I don't mind 
if you won't understand I am trying hard to change the subject 
Its subject to change anyway 
God this is fun to play 
Said the things you'ld never say 
I know that you're not right 
There's little chance that you'll be wrong tonight 
You know that you're not right
