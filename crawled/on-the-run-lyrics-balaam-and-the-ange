If you don't like the things you see 
Baby that's tough 
There's a part inside of me 
That's had enough 
If you think the way I'm looking 
Is really strange 
Then you ought to realise 
It's time you changed 
Sooner or later 
I'm on the run 
I put school behind me 
Those things are done 
I got something special 
I'm having fun 
The way things are looking 
I can't go wrong 
Everybody laughing at you 
But it won't be long 
Sooner or later 
I'm on the run
