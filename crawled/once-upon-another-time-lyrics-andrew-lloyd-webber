Once upon another time 
Our story had only begun 
You chose to turn the page 
And I made choices too Once upon that other time 
We did what we thought must be done 
And now we have no choice 
We do what we must do We love, we live 
We give what we can give 
And take what little we deserve Once upon another time 
I knew how our story would end 
And maybe I was wrong 
But now the moment's gone Were it still that other time 
I'd make time itself somehow bend 
But now I'm not that strong 
And time keeps moving on We love, we live 
We give what we can give 
And take what little we deserve We love, we live 
We give what we can give 
And take what little we deserve Once upon another time
