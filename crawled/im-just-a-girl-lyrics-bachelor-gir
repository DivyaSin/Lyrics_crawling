I might be a little concerned with my hair 
I might need comfort, more than my share 
I might seem to follow fashion but claim that I don't care 
My heart is your best friend when it rules my head I might want to talk a lot, don't ask me why 
And I'll get impatient if you don't reply 
I might always search for something wrong, I want you to deny 
And if you love me just stay close and hold me when I cry Don't try to understand me 
I'm just a girl 
One of the greatest mysteries 
You'll find in this world 
I'm not hard to handle 
I'm just a girl I don't seek money but I want your time 
'Coz I'd give my life for you when you are mine 
And it hurts me more than I can say when you pull away 
But if you love me, you should tell me everyday Don't try to understand me 
I'm just a girl 
One of the greatest mysteries 
You'll find in this world 
I'm not hard to handle 
I'm just a girl You might think I'm too demanding 
But you're just not understanding I might like to take advice but go my own way 
It's when I hurt the most, I swear I'm okay 
And it's always when you least expect, I say, I wanna stay 
Might take just a single kiss to steal my heart away Don't try to understand me 
I'm just a girl 
One of the greatest mysteries 
You'll find in this world 
You think I'm an X file 
I'm just a girl
