Gotta have a reason - to stay alive 
Everytime i watch TV - I could die 
So much violence - and so much hate 
Seems that terrors taken over 
And its bound to escalate Gimme that reason - to get by 
Do you have an answer to my question why? 
What is the purpose? Where is the sense? 
It must lead to one conclusion - hear me now! Think about love - when the hate is stron 
Its time to have faith - And keep movin' on 
Think about hope - Its the only way 
Think about love - its all I have to say God is the reason- for mankind 
If we think we'll do without him - we'll go blind 
God is the reason - and love's the way 
If we'd only learn to listen - so hear him now
