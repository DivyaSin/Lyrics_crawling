To the left. To the right. 
We think we're okay. 
We walk we talk. 
Forget where we're going. 
We lose our way. We love we laugh. 
We act like we're happy, 
if just for a day. Now times have changed 
so don't be fooled. 
You got to remember you gotta be cool. There's too many voices you can't control. 
You better think twice before you're too old. It's a great life if you don't weaken. 
I paid a high price for all I've done wrong. 
It's a great life if you don't weaken. 
My daddy told me so I wrote this song. We feel, we touch. 
We see other people 
We put on a smile. 
We come we go with so much frustration. 
Accepting denial. The time has come. 
You must stand tall. 
You just arrived. 
Can't conquer it all. The sun has set. 
The tide's begun. 
Your ship has sailed. 
What have you become? It's a great life if you don't weaken. 
I paid a high price for all I've done wrong. 
It's a great life if you don't weaken. 
My daddy told me so I wrote this song. 
My daddy told me so I wrote this song. INSTRUMENTAL BREAK Now times have changed 
so don't be fooled. 
You got to remember, you got to be cool. It's a great life if you don't weaken. 
I paid a high price for all I've done wrong. 
It's a great life if you don't weaken. 
My daddy told me so I wrote this song. It's a great life if you don't weaken. 
I paid a high price for all I've done wrong. 
It's a great life if you don't weaken. 
My daddy told me so I wrote this song.
