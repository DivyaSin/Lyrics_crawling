We've got one chance to break out 
And we need it now 
Cause I'm sick and tired of waiting 
Sick of this fucking apartment Love me or leave me or rip me apart 
This is the voice that I was given and 
If you don't like it take a long walk 
Off of the shortest pier you can find And I'll be singing it out I'll be singing 
Oh, Mr. Magazine I never wrote one single thing for you 
Or your so-called music scene 
You don't mean a thing to me Pick it up, pick it up, and won't you want it 
Pick it up, pick it up, and you need it to 
Pick it up, pick it up, and won't you want it 
Pick it up, pick it up When they review the debut 
What if the critics hate you 
Don't worry cause they 
Might just catch somebody off their feet 
Well they can love it or leave it or rip it apart 
We're living while we're singing 
So I guess that's a step in the right direction 
Glare of composition in the honesty, honesty Oh, Mr. Magazine 
I never wrote one single thing for you 
Or your so-called music scene 
You both mean shit to me Pick it up, pick it up, and won't you want it 
Pick it up, pick it up, and you need it to 
Pick it up, pick it up, and won't you want it 
Pick it up, pick it up So save your breath and the money you spent 
Go work in retail and spare the suspense 
Just don't take chances on anything at all 
Anything at all So afraid of anything that may not come that easy 
Too afraid of anything that you may not have seen before 
So afraid of anything that may not come that easy 
Too afraid of anything that may not Pick it up, pick it up, and won't you want it 
Pick it up, pick it up, and you need it to 
Pick it up, pick it up, and won't you want it 
Pick it up, pick it up So save your breath and the money you spent 
Go work in retail and spare the suspense 
Just don't take chances on anything at all 
Anything at all
