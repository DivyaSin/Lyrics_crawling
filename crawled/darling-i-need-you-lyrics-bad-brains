Darling, darling, I love you 
Darling, darling, I need you 
Darling, darling, I love you 
And you've got feelings too You must be evolved within peace 
No one pushing in the ground 
Yes, God chose a part 
And whether it's sunshine or rain 
Come on my children, live in harmony Darling, darling, I love you 
And darling, darling, I need you 
Darling, darling, I love you 
And you've got feelings too No more worry, it's not so tough 
Be strong and free 
And in time you'll see
