Hello? 
Is my daughter there? 
She's 15 years old 
Blue eyes, blonde hair 
She's been away from home 'bout two or three day 
To locate Rikk Agnew in California Write a letter to me on a random chance of receiving some reply 
You get one, suddenly it's and insta-romance, but you're a stranger in my eyes 
Pull your rotting roots and proceed to bail on a journey guaranteed 
Did ya' ever stop to think I could go to jail for your adolescent need? [Chorus:] 
Runaway, why don't you stay 
Back where you belong 
Feel ya' gotta run, feel ya' gotta play 
But you're really much too young 
I understand your impulsiveness 
I've been there once before 
But you're so blind to the fucking mess 
That your loved one's can't ignore Calls from worried mom, detectives, and your aunt 
I don't really have the time 
An innocent exchange of petty postal lust 
Could turn into a nasty crime 
So pull a U-Y, Louie, don't come my way 
There's no place like home 
No need to run, no reason to fly 
But you still have to go, you still have to roam [Chorus] [Chorus] I don't know your reasons 
I don't know your rhymes 
I don't have the patience 
And I don't have the time 
You make me see red 
You make me feel black 
Don't ever get near me 
Don't ever come back 
I know what you're doing 
It's somewhere I've been 
I've seen it all happen 
Again & again 
I'm gonna say it once 
And I'll make it clear 
Go home! Do ya' hear me? 
Get the hell out of here! Runaway, runaway, runaway...
