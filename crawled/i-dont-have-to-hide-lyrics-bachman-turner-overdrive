Black witches sing their verses 
Of charms, hexes and curses 
They tried to take out my eyes 
But I don't have to hide I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide from you 
I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide from you Black sunset's on it's way down 
I've got to go out on the town 
I'm not afraid of the night 
But I don't have to hide I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide from you 
I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide from you Black moon-dogs chasing at me 
Way down to the sea 
They want to steal my life 
But I don't have to hide I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide from you 
I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide 
I don't have to hide from you
