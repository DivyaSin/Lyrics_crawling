Good girl gonna fucking bad 
I thought she fuck me good she askin' where the party at? 
She beautiful so she get away with it 
And all of this in hopes of her making it [Chorus] 
Beautiful girl 
No matter who you are 
Whether a superstar whether you regular 
You know I love you girl 
This one's for you girl 
This one's for you girl 
This one's for you girl 
This one's for you girl I think I met her bout' a year ago 
College girl she was a Florida State Seminole 
Had a job at the mall workin' ten to fo' 
Hella fine I ain't lyin' y'all don't hear me though 
So I'm walkin' right up to her, hey my name Ace 
She replied with a smile and said her name's Shea 
Very conservative, i luv that 
Fitted jeans, rockin' J's and a snap-back 
Yeah but I can see that she would kill a girl 
See you hidin' that physique, you better get it girl 
And you the shit but she don't' know yet 
Turnin' red got her blushin' where your mama at 
Cause all I wanna do is thank her 
I'm using beautiful and gorgeous in the same verse 
I swear I'm trippin you just got me open 
And hope we can get acquainted what I'm highly hopin' [Chorus] And I just hope this got you motivated 
That's cause your body got me cultivated 
Seeing your fine ass alone I just can't tolerate it 
And all your friends say I'm a dog every conversation 
Mad cause you smiling more on a daily basis 
Tell me why they hating everything's accommodated 
I'm just searching for your love but I'll be very patient 
True story had a thing before we started dating 
Say she never heard beautiful so many times 
Silly guys approaching with all wrong lines 
That's a reason for being a single a long time 
And all the roses I sent you pleasure was all mine 
Yeah women are beautiful in many ways 
Confidence a stain never let it wipe away 
What's a man without a woman I'm just here to say 
Yeah I'm just here to say [Chorus]
