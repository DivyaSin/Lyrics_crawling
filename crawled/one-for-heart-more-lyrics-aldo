Oh-no, I can't take one more step towards you 
'Cause all that's waiting is regret 
And don't you know, I'm not your ghost anymore 
You lost the love, I loved the most If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll 
Be the one to let you know Every day, knowing I'm gonna see your face 
And that's enough for me 
I want keep in your heart and more every day Wo-ah I will stay with you tonight 
Maybe alone 
More, more.... One heart, one love 
I'm giving my all for you, sweet baby.... 
One heart, one love 
I promise that I'll be true Wo-ah I will stay with you tonight 
Maybe alone 
More, more.... Two heart, one love beating together 
I am yours, you are mine 
Two heart, one love always forever 
Standing the test of time I'll never saw you, I meaning your pict 
Don't see me, one for heart more And I will wait for you tonight 
You're here forever and you're by my side 
I've been waiting all my life 
To feel your heart as it's keeping time Oh.... oh.... oh.... 
(Uuu...) Uuu.... I'm in love with you 
I don't wanna dance you 
This may be I get jealous 
That I makes a wonder Don't see me, one for heart more 
Don't see me, one for heart more 
Oh, one for heart more 
Oh, one for heart more
