[Part 1: Beat the Case] [Verse 1: Ab-Soul] 
Doeburger! 
Head swingin' like Rambo, he be spittin' like he pullin' triggers 
Make a enemigo an example 
(And I bet I beat the case) 
Lot of guys with the gavels, look em' right up in they face 
While a nigga under oath, plead the fifth, then ask if I can smoke 
Burnin' dirty money but I keep a little something for the clean escape 
And the rainy day after 
Don't forget a nigga live where the heat wave at ya 
And ya safe ain't safe 
And heat don't wave back but life is cold that way 
Ay man [Hook: Ab-Soul] 
All I do is beat the case 
All I do is beat the case 
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it 
Like a runaway slave 
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away 
The doctors say what an odd autopsy 
All I do is beat the case 
All I do is beat the case 
All I do is beat the case 
All I do is beat the case 
All I do is beat the case 
All I do is beat the case 
I ain't never go to jail 
I ain't never gon' tell 
All I do is beat the case [Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]

Let me set the record straight 
You got 10 commandments, 33 amendments over 20,000 laws 
Raise your hand if you think you'll beat the case 
Motherfuck a Bill of Rights 
I need a bill of Miller's ? 
Phenergan up in my sprite 
I ain't sippin' Miller Lite 
I like to say my lighter white 
Lit the spliff and went to space 
Then I'm playin' with the white 
What an interracial day 
I made her write a different light 
Got gerped up by the jakes 
Had the work tucked, guns in the truck 
Licenses suspended, but remember-- [Hook: Ab-Soul](x2) 
All I do is beat the case 
All I do is beat the case 
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it

I ain't never gon' tell 
All I do is beat the case [Part 2: Straight Crooked] [Verse 1: Ab-Soul] 
Ruffled up a couple feathers when I called Barack a puppet show 
Now that Trump is POTUS I know this election is just another Muppet Show 
That ain't even none of my business though 
Whatever's your cup of tea 
Even lil' Niemah voted for Hillary 
I'm a entity, never mind my identity 
My king Slim hit me with a quote that sticked with me 
A criminal's best asset is his liability 
(That was crazy, lie-ability) 
Do What Thou Wilt nigga (Soul!) 
Cause these niggas a have you swim across a ocean just to drown you in a lake 
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight 
Word, word yea 
Make sure I was straight 
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight 
Don't (?) 
The righteous will remain righteous and the filthy will remain filthy 
In a sense, we all guilty
