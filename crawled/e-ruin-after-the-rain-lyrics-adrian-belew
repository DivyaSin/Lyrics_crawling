When it first began 
In the light of sacred things 
And you felt oblivious to any sort of pain 
When it first began to rain 
Then there came the steady flow 
Slowly like a flood 
Sweeping over everything and turning into mud 
Why? Is there nothing sacred left, nothing to hold on to? 
Is there no way to make it up, nothing that you can do? 
You believe what you want to believe Not so long ago 
It was as perfect as the snow 
You can never know what things 
May come to spoil your dreams 
And to hurt you as they have 
Do you hear the rain 
So insistent on the windowpane? 
A reminder of a night when everything was changed 
Why? Is there nothing sacred left, nothing to hold on to? 
Is there no way to make it up, nothing that you can do? 
You believe what you want to believe When the light of morning comes 
You see the damage done 
And you know how many things 
May never be the same 
There you will remain 
In the ruin after the rain "the ruin after the rain"
