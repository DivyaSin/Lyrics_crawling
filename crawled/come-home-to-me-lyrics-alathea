Rise and fall, like the tide 
My hand goes with your chest 
Steady now, moon will pull 
A slow and even breath Outa the blue, the storm rolls in 
I see it in your eyes 
Thunder strikes, but I will be 
A place for you to hide Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves 
The highest point is just before it breaks 
I will light a candle for you welcoming 
Baby, come home to me Night moves in 
And you can't see, a star up in the sky 
Let my voice anchor you 
I promise the sun will rise Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves 
The highest point is just before it breaks 
I will light a candle for you welcoming 
Baby, come home to me I am standing, on the shore 
I am holding a light 
I am standing, on the shore 
I am holding a light 
I am standing, on the shore 
I am holding a light 
I am standing, on the shore 
I am holding You're heart rises and it falls 
Just before it breaks 
I will light a candle Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves 
The highest point is just before it breaks 
I will light a candle for you welcoming 
Baby, come home to me Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves 
The highest point is just before it breaks 
I will light a candle for you welcoming 
Baby, come home to me Baby, come home to me 
Baby, come home to me
