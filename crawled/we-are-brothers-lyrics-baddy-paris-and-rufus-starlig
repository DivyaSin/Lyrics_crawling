He is your brother. 
And just because he's older, 
He will always try to bust you 
No matter what you do, you must obey him. 
He is your brother. 
And just because he's younger, 
You will learn to tell your fist's no 
When he beats you on Nintendo, 
Do not hit him. Ahhhhhhhhhhh 
Don't leave us! 
You are our Jesus! 
But you look like mother! 
Don't want to lose you, 
To another! 
Ahhhhhhhhhhh 
Don't leave us! 
You are our Jesus! 
She may be your lover, 
But do not forget, 
You are our brother! You were a loser. 
Your haircut was a mullet. 
You could not play the bazoone*, 
You had the dark blue bedroom, 
What were you thinking? 
You also had a mullet. 
I was always the cool one. 
I was the budding rockstar, 
I'm also mad at the guitar. 
But what for me now? Ahhhhhhhhhhhh 
Don't leave us! 
You are our Jesus! 
But you look like mother! 
Don't want to lose you, 
To another! 
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh 
Don't leave us! 
You are our Jesus! 
She may be your lover, 
But do not forget, 
You are our brother! You were working as a salesman. 
In the homeware design store. 
You only worked like, 
You life was made of habitat. 
You were lonely. 
Oooooohhhhhhhhh. 
That was when you met her, 
Though you would never tell us. 
But then we finally guessed it. 
Out came your dirty secret. 
You loved your boss. 
Oohhhhhh.

Just like how far you've come nooooww.

Now you're old and saggy, fat like daddy.

But now to me it's quite weird, 
Because you have her and a beard, 
Like like our daddy. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!
