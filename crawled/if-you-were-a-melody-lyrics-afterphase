If you were a melody, if you were a song. 
With the feelings inside of me, the beat would be strong. 
The music would come alive, and make me feel warm. 
The passion is so intense, but yet I feel calm. You make me feel alive, you light the fire inside, burning inside me. 
You boost my energy, you give me what I need, and I feel free. If you were a melody, what would it be? 
Something that's sexy, something cheeky! 
It would light up the morning sky, it would light up me. 
It would have an intensity, which takes over me. You make me feel alive, you light the fire inside, burning inside me. 
You boost my energy, you give me what I need, and I feel free. If you were a melody, could I sing your song? 
Would it come to me easily? Or would it take long? 
I want to embrace it, let it take control. 
Feeding my passion, feeding my soul. You make me feel alive, you light the fire inside, burning inside me. 
You boost my energy, you give me what I need, and I feel free. 
And I feel free. 
And I feel free.
