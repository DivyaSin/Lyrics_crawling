this will die out. 
Narrative: Fear. a fever is dancing in stride with our metronome memory 
hipocracy here. painting a portrait that's dripping with crass composition 
fumbled trust, the father is dead. cathedrals are burning 
lies fuel fires, fear burns red, now i'm cold. ***going inside of our heads. 
when we whisper: danger, danger, pull the lever. turn the page and i burn better in the morning. 
Heartlessness. Narratives. Christ, where'd you go? 
Impassioned. Abandoned. Why, you were wrong. 
this will die out. 
Narrative fear. a fever is dancing in stride. Metronome memory. 
hipocracy here. it's painting a portrait that's screaming "the silence of dying." 
fumbled trust, the father is dead. cathedrals are burning. 
lies fuel fires. fear burns red and i'm cold. ***going inside of our heads. 
when we whisper: danger, danger, pull the lever and i burn better in the morning. 
Heartlessness. Narratives. Christ, where'd you go? 
Impassioned. Abandoned. Why, you were wrong. 
*long random talking* 
Heartlessness. Narratives. Christ, where'd you go? 
Impassioned. Abandoned. Why, you were wrong. 
we've forgotten how to read. we've forgotten how to believe. 
the text has gone dark. the author receeds.
