I remember the long warm December we shared. 
I can still taste the air. 
You were open and I was hoping you cared, 
Hoping that you would be there for me. 
That's the way it was meant to be, 
But I guess your heart was free; 
Free to take the best part of me, 
And leave a hole where my heart should be; 
Where it used to be. 
Days are lonely, and nights are only a veil, 
And the air is so stale. 
I'm still open but I guess you were hoping we'd fail, 
So you could sail away from me, 
And return to your open sea; 
Where I guess you need to be, 
Where you can wander endlessly. 
Still you know that your heart was free, 
And you took the best part of me, 
And left a hole where my heart should be; 
Where you know it should be. 
You're for me. 
I'd have sworn it was destiny, 
But I know you were always free; 
Free to be the best part of me. 
I'd have loved you endlessly, 
With my heart and soul eternally. 
A love the way love should be, ain't that the way a love should be? 
You are free; 
Free to give back the heart of me, 
And replace all this misery. 
Since you took the best part of me, 
And left a hole where my heart should be; 
Where my heart should be.
