You got this habit you just can't shake 
There's not much more your body can take 
So you jab that needle in your vein 
Another load of dirt for your brain 
Scars and scars up and down your arms 
Your body covered in a sheet of sweat 
You made the choice 
To drag out your life 
In a dull drugged oblivion 
Eyes wide open lips blue with death 
Your lifeless body slumped over in a chair 
No show at your funeral 
No flowers on your grave 
Dropping like flies
