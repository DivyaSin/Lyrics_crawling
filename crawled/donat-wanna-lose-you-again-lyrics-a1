I can feel that the wheel is in motion 
And there's life in this old timer yet 
Looking back there's a new reflection 
Now I know what you give is what you get In the end it's all or nothing 
And i feel I'm ready now 
So I'll try to be the answer 
Coz I don't wanna lose you again Now i bet that your ears are burning 
With 3 words on the tip of my tongue 
I just hope that your heart is open 
So that I can undo what i've done In the end it's all or nothing 
And I feeel I'm ready now 
So I'll try to be the answer 
Coz I don't wanna lose you again
