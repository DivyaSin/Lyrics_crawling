Long ago in a dusty village 
Full of hunger, pain and strife 
A man came forth with a vision of truth 
And the way to a better life 
He was convinced he had the answer 
And he compelled people to follow along 
But the hunger never vanished 
And the man was banished And the village dried up and died 
At a time when wise men peered 
Through glass tubes toward the sky 
The heavens changed in predictable ways 
And one man was able to find That he had thought he found the answer 
And he was quick to write his revelation 
But as they were scrutinized In his colleagues eyes 
He soon became a mockery 
Don't tell me the answer 
I've got ideas too 
But if you've got enough naivete 
And you've got conviction 
Then the answer is perfect for you
