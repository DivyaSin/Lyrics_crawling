Girl, you can have it all, go ahead and have a ball 
If you want, you can take them both, baby In the year 2000, I see thousands 
Of pretty young women I find arousin' 
Grocery store shopping, magazine browsin' 
Many different ways they keep their hair styles And full of boredom, I walk toward 'em 
Get 'em close to me, 'cause I'm supposed to be 
Be male aggressor, female impresser 
Say the right things, possibly undress her But that's the post game, this is still the pre game 
Silly woman she game, baby, what's your name? 
Even though I'm a freak, I play it off like a college geek 
Crack a smile and politely speak With intellect to the woman I select 
Hoping that she won't detect 
My egotistical, chauvinistical lust I thrust 
'Til I scream like Mystical The wrong message I hope I'm not sending 
Laughing and pretending my dick's not extending 
Can't be overzealous, she might discover 
She's walkin' away, blew my cover She won't let me fuck 
(You know I love you) 
I really need to bust a nut 
(Please don't change the subject) She won't let me fuck 
(We coulda fucked all night long) 
I really need to bust a nut 
(But, but, but, but your telephone number is wrong) She won't let me fuck 
(Girl, you got a lot to give) 
I really need to bust a nut 
(You dress, you dress, so provocative) She won't let me fuck 
(I can see your lingerie, from real far away) 
I really need to bust a nut 
(Bitch, you must think I'm gay, yeah) Oh, don't make me beg, baby, let me rub your leg 
Don't make me cry, look into my eye 
Girl, you so damn pretty, stop actin' so
