I found an artist beneath my skin 
He buried himself deep within me 
And he's playing a tune with a soft melody 
He's playing a tune so soft I found an artist beneath me skin 
He writhes to the rhythm that plays within me 
And he bangs on my heart like it's a loud tympani 
He bangs on my heart real loud 
And I like the way he sings like each song 
Is the last he'll ever sing to the world 
So he best deliver 
And he's walking around with a soul on fire 
He's walking bearing his soul Sometimes I wish he's just leave 
Just leave 
And give me a moment to breathe
