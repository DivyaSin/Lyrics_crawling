In a way, the sun has shone on me 
Makes it easy, to make it hard 
Take an inch, take a yard 
Take it all 
I don't need it, at all Any day, the sun could shine on you 
Makes it silly, to make it bad 
Take it good, take it glad 
Take it all Don't you know there's a stronger thing 
Keeping us together? 
Don't you know there's a song to sing 
Sing on, let the feeling take you high Don't you know there's a stronger thing 
Keeping us together? 
Don't you know there's a song to sing 
Sing on, let the feeling take you high
