abby 6, she's the beast 
from the East, 
good grief, it's a three piece 
sit back relax 
people don't dance, 
step to the side 
I've got a super, simple groove 
make ya feel alive 
I've got one reason 
two reasons why 
my boogady Bam, Bam 
don't lie 
I want it, I need it, 
sit back and relax 
and watch the big man move 
tick tick boom 
there goes the room, 
my egos to those that 
don't assume that I've got 
A problem: many, many of 
them who can't dance to 
the mega boogie groove? 
I want it, I need it, 
sit back and relax 
and watch the big man move 
Chorus 
mega Boogie, Mega Boogie...etc 
touch one of your people 
I am one of your people 
Chorus 
mega aha 
she won't bore ya 
mega Boogie
