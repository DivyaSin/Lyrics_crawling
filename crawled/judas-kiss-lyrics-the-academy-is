take, take these words in 
take them like you did the foreign excitement 
you bleed, lust, choke, so was it worth it 
did you get what you wanted, the silent type 
did you even come close, did they let you taste it 
i can see how the rush, and the heat, and the touch 
of a stranger gets you going 
you're feeling selfish, you've got the urge 
don't bother keeping your heavy breathing down 
for the one who can't hear you scream 
never pass off your guilt lines 
just wear them like a noose on your neck 
i'll help you keep it tied tight 
when you feel you're close to coming 
just think about that perfect subtle demon 
that you've been dreaming into the light, keep it tied tight 
unlike the way you've become "city feature" 
you'd love to let them rip you apart 
rinse and repeat, until you feel clean 
but when it's over he won't take back what is left 
i can see how the speed, and the sting, and the wings 
on the plane home make you nervous 
oh, mr. shoddy content swept all your dignity under the covers 
she'll be lying, keeping secrets, keeping quiet 
now you understand what it's like to dive 
take it back, taken back, she forgets you 
now she pleads "forgive me again, it's the last time i will" 
never pass off your guilt lines 
just wear them like a noose on your neck 
i'll help you keep it tied tight 
you're the worst actor that i've ever seen, 
but if this script called for liars, you'd play the lead 
"when you've changed, i'll change" 
what it's like again. what you don't see 
while you sleep, three year deceiver, you're not fooling 
never pass off your guilt lines 
just wear them like a noose on your neck 
i'll help you keep it tied tight
