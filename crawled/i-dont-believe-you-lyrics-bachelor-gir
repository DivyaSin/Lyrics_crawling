I, I don't believe you 
Something about you just don't add up 
I, I don't believe you 
And I just can't see you staying true to me I don't mean to say that you've been lying 
But don't you think it's just a matter of time 
You want me to be your only one 
No but I, I don't believe you Watcha gonna do to win me over? 
Watcha gonna do to prove me wrong? 
How can I deny all the talk about you? 
When I hear the things you do... Listen to me I'm saying 
I, I don't believe you 
Something about you just don't add up 
No I, I don't believe you And I just can't see you staying true to me 
No cause I, I don't believe you 
Don't believe you, I don't believe you 
All I need to see is your devotion And all I need to feel is your emotion 
But how can I trust all your promises to me 
When you ain't the man you seem to be... 
Listen to me I'm saying I, I don't believe you 
Something about you just don't add up 
No I, I don't believe you 
And I just can't see you staying true to me No cause I, I don't believe you 
Don't believe you 
Something about you just don't add up 
No I, I don't believe you And I just can't see you staying true to me 
Hey! I don't believe you 
Nothing about you I can't give up 
No no no I, I don't believe you And I just won't see you if you lie to me 
'Cause I don't believe you 
I've heard about you and I've had enough 
I, I don't believe you And I just won't see you if you lie to me
