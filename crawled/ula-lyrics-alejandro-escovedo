The first thing I wrote, 
A man eating a grizzly bear 
The first thing I wrote, 
I fought fires for seven years 
It's the god honest truth 
It's the god honest truth 
It's the god honest truth 
It's a terrible thing There's more to this love 
This big bad love 
There's more to this love 
Than the color red Tula, Tula 
Tula, Tula There's more to this life 
This wild and crazy life 
There's more to this life 
Than a random kiss There's more to this story 
There's more to this story 
There's more to this story 
Than a beginning or end Tula, Tula 
Tula, Tula
