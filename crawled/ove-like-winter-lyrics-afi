Calm down. Come down 
Cold resides with me 
I flee to decemberunderground 
As you exhale 
I breathe in the waterunderground 
and I'll grow pale 
without you Warn your warmth to turn away 
Here it's December every day 
Press your lips to the sculptures and surely you'll stay 
Love like winter 
For of sugar and ice I am made, I am made It's in the blood, it's in the blood 
I met my love before I was born 
He wanted love, I taste of blood 
He bit my lip and drank my warmth from years before 
From years before She exhales vanilla lace 
I barely dreamt her, yesterday, yesterday 
Read the lines of the mirror through the lipstick trace 
"Por siempre" 
She said, "It seems you're somewhere far away" to his face It's in the blood, it's in the blood 
I met my love before I was born 
She wanted love, I taste of blood 
She bit my lip and drank my warmth from years before 
From years before Love like winter, oh oh, oh oh 
Love like winter, winter, three four It's in the blood, it's in the blood 
I met my love before I was born 
He wanted love, I taste of blood 
He bit my lip and drank my warmth from years before 
From years before
