You 
Your life's an endless mission 
Blind to the consequences 
While earthly poisons 
Drain the lifeblood out of you You're living like a candle 
And if it burns too quickly 
You really need to find 
A way to slow it down Slowdown 
You've got to live for something 
Slowdown 
Before it gets away 
Slowdown 
You've got to set aside 
Some time to get it right You 
You never think about it 
But life is like a window 
And if it's left open or shut 
It's up to you 
You need to share with someone 
And if it don't come easy 
You're gonna have to find 
A way to slow it down Slowdown 
You've got to live for something 
Slowdown 
Before it gets away 
Slowdown 
You've got to set aside 
Some time to get it right Sometimes you'll find 
That even fools can offer wisdom 
In their views of the world 
And it's gold You 
Your life is in the fastlane 
You need to take it easy 
You really need to find 
A way to slow it down Slowdown 
You've got to live for something 
Slowdown 
Before it gets away 
Slowdown 
You've got to set aside 
Some time to get it right Sometimes you'll find 
That even fools can offer 
Wisdom in their views 
Of the world... Slowdown 
You've got to live for something 
Slowdown 
Before it gets away 
Slowdown 
Before it gets away 
Slowdown
