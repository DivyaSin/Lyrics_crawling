People, people who need people 
Aare the luckiest people in the world. 
We're children, needing other childrenAnd yet letting our grown-up pride hide all the need inside, 
Acting more like children than children.Lovers are very special people, 
They're the luckiest people in the world. 
With one person, one very special person, 
A feeling deep in your soulSays you were half, now you're whole.No more hunger and thirst,But first, be a person who needs people. 
People who need people are the luckiest people in the world.
