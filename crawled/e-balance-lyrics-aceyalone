Intro: 
Mr. Mix Mr. DJ play that beat. 
Won't you play if for me. In the mix mister hop 
forward hop back. Hop, hop hop. Verse 1: 
The second somebody dies somebody else is born 
People are celebrating while other people mourn 
Home may be home to you but to me it's foreign 
Even the matador don't pull the bull by the horns 
One man's enemy is another man's friend 
One man's poisons is another man's medicine 
So let us stand, let us sit and let us view 
The changing of the guard oh it's so hard to keep it true 
It's the balance of the scales it can't be challenged or expelled 
Soon as somebody lost somebody else prevails 
Some someone is quiet at the same time someone yells 
Half full or half empty water in the well 
It's the Half and Half Hypothesis the 50/50 theory 
Eerie as it may seem check your balance beam 
It's the Half and Half Hypothesis the 50/50 theory 
Eerie as it may seem check your balance beam 
Now check your Balance Beamer with a feather and a rock 
Wheath or not you find the answer is really not the plot 
See it's like Love and Hate (love...and hate) 
The same emotion different weight 
People Love to Hate so I know you know just how this all relates 
It's the posa and the nega tive 
Mini and mega live 
Arm a leg a leg an arm headed by a nigga 
Like big and small 
Short and tall 
Night and day and so on 
Some people are bashfull 
Some people just love to get their flow on (they flow on) 
So here goes one to grow on 
I'm a go on and on and on till the principles are laid out 
The scales of justice weighed out 
Till your memory starts to fade out and your game of life is played out 
Got to balance out the power don't we? 
Balance your emotions 
Push and pull positions like the moon pulls on the ocean 
Balance on one foot that's equilibrium 
Opposites attract and retract that's a fact 
I'm a Libra y'all! 
180 degrees but not that hot 
So whether or not you find the answer is really not the plot (really not the 
plot) 
Because giving is receiving (and) and seeing is believing (and) 
And the solar system rotes so harmonious and even 
It's perfectly balanced Verse 2: 
Some people say life is about taking chances choices and decisions 
Voices and opinions, politics and religion 
Clues the past and cash and keys to the future 
It's a possibility and probability on who's gonna execute yo ass 
Some slow and analytical 
Some quick fast on the dash 
Like heads or tails but the head usually leads the tail 
So I tell my tales from the head 
Cause they're embedded inside my cells 
Real quick let me tell you about a fact I know things will even out 
You can disbelieve or doubt or even shout or leave it in your mouth 
Cause how you gone reason wit grand Mother Nature 
Running mother Earth controlled by Father Time who's the chaser 
It's living and dying homey 
Laughing and crying dude 
Trying or lying my brother 
Walking or flying fool 
Now half of you are gone find the time to shine 
The other half gone find crime, money weed wine 
Till it's to late in a disillusion state of mind 
I just found my peace of mind 
Now they want a piece of mine 
To late in a disillusion of mind 
The orthodox is the unorthodox they just got you on the names 
The insane and the sane are the same 
It's a damn shame so many people's aim is so lame 
And their gain is so minimal 
Caught up in the subliminal 
It's pleasure and pain, water for the flames, the wild and the tame 
The style still remains if you use the right side of your brain 
Instead of going against the grain 
You can penetrate the vein to the point where what remains is a stain 
Of this universal thang 
That we call Balance balance..
