You can illustrate your life in romance. 
I can show you something so much more than words in my hands. 
It's not your best intention now to burn your friends. 
This is your last night, 
This is your last chance in my hands. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We fall asleep. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We die complete. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
Tonight's the night and its all we need now, 
To die romantic. 
I sat and watched your heartbeat fade with every breath, 
Is this happening? 
I've fucking had it, 
God save me please 'cause I don't think she'll make it through the night. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We fall asleep. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We die complete. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
Tonight's the night and its all we need now, 
To die romantic. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We fall asleep. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We die complete. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
Tonight's the night and its all we need now, 
To die romantic. 
Your last words to me, "Tonight's the night," 
Meant redemption was only found in books. 
Your last words to me, "Tonight's the night" 
Meant redemption was harder than it looks. 
So take care of what you love and all this stuff are remnants of a life in shattered glass. 
It's all I have to ask. 
I miss you. 
You can illustrate your death in romance, 
I can show you something so much more than words in my hands. 
I felt the dead-end price you paid for every day. 
This is your last night, 
Suicide kept tight, 
You're gone tonight. Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We fall asleep. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We die complete. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
Tonight's the night and its all we need now, 
To die romantic. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We fall asleep. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
This is the nightmare, 
We die complete. 
Die romantic, romantic, 
Tonight's the night and its all we need now, 
To die romantic.
