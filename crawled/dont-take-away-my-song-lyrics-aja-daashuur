Take my breath away 
Take my thoughts away 
Take my love way 
But dont- Take my patience 
Take my peace 
Take my conscience 
But dont take away my- 
Dont take away my- (Chorus) 
Dont take my song 
My hands of my speech 
Dont take away my song 
Till therere no notes to play or teach Take my home away 
Take my land away 
Take my heart away 
But dont- 
Take my brother 
Take my father 
Take my friend away 
But dont take away my- 
Dont take away my- (Chorus) 
Dont take my song 
My hands of my speech 
Dont take away my song 
Till therere no notes to play or teach Give me an oak box and some strings 
Give me an upright and a bench 
Place me on a corner and let me be 
Im happy, Im happy What is my voice without a melody 
A tangled web of interchangeable complexities 
What are these gifts without my hands 
Grains of wood & sand, grains of wood & sand (Chorus) 
Dont take my song 
My hands of my speech 
Dont take away my song 
Till therere no notes to play or teach
