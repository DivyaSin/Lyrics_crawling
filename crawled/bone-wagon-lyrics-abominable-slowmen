Tilt your head back but don't swallow 
We're sinking fast above the mast because this leaky ship is past its prime 
Here we go on the Bone Wagon 
Ossified but not quite dried, our leather faces weather places 
My avian bones are weak they're hollow 
The milk I drank was just a prank from blank faces that I have not yet thanked Hey there Mr. Driver, where are you carting us to? 
Lugging all our dusty bones across the English countryside 
Hey there Mr. Driver, what is our destination? 
Do you follow constellations or do you know this route by heart? 
Hey there Mr. Driver, I'm helpless on your wagon 
Keep me from the vultures for just one more day Anything that you wanted to say, anything that you wanted to talk about 
I hope you said it cuz your jaw don't work anymore 
Anything that you wanted to hear, anything that you wanted to listen to 
I hope you heard it cuz your ears don't work anymore 
Anything that you wanted see, anything that you wanted to look upon 
I hope you saw it cuz your eyes don't work anymore 
Any place that you wanted to go, any place that you wanted to travel to 
I hope you went cuz the Bone Wagon takes you home now We've got our place in time and space unto the charnel house we be delivered 
'Til then we can dance, we could dance, we should dance, leave it all on the floor 
We can dance, we could dance, we should dance, leave it all on the floor Resting never until forever, pay the price to board the Bone Wagon 
'Til then we can dance, we could dance, we should dance, leave it all on the floor 
We can dance, we could dance, we should dance, leave it all on the floor A price was paid for this one way stay: 
A silver tongue and a life worth living 
The countdown comes with funeral drums 
You get the thumbs up to leave this planet 
Carefully steered to the atmosphere 
This bag of bones tears through the heavens 
The Bone Rocket creaks as it lurches for the peaks 
As the darkness nears Charon whispers softly, And all he said was, "Take your seat so we can complete what you can't repeat" 
And all he said was, "Buckle up, we're blasting off and this could get rough" 
And all he said was, "Take this time to reflect on your crimes and the worms that you burned" The stars all stream like laser beams 
Dearly departed from the land of the living 
With vapor trails of memories 
All shimmering in the wake of history 
The timelessness is meaningless 
As we surpass the rings of Saturn 
As Pluto nears the light of years 
Hides behind your mind, then Charon whispers softly, And all he said was "Watch your step: you can't compete with two left feet 
You're on your own with sticks and stones cuz what you cast will come back home 
Keep what you reap but the Reaper knows what you sowed when you sold your soul down a black hole Bones collide as the Wagon rides 
As Charon guides, our approach vector's solid 
Our journey ends as we descend 
Delivered to the hall of Hades 
Where souls are rent from marrow spent 
Time to retire these bones so weary 
The Bone Wagon returns again 
To the land of men, no rest for Charon And here we goes, the end of the road...the road the name of which nobody knows 
Out past the point of no return you'll meet the fate that you have earned 
You can't outrun the Bone Wagon. In the hot, hot sun my bones rattle on the Bone Wagon!
