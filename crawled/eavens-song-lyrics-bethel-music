We have come, as one heart 
As one voice, to join Heaven's 
Endless song on the earth 
Lifting up our adoration 
Towards Your throne, praises rise 
Songs of love are now ascending 
For the King, for the Lamb 
Who gave His life to save us Holy, Holy, Holy 
All of Heaven cries 
Worthy, Worthy, Worthy 
For You were crucified 
[the] living creatures call out 
[and] all the elders fall down A sacrifice of living praise 
We bring our all for You have beckoned 
Us into a holy place 
A holy love, Your very presence 
[and] now we stand [in] wondrous awe 
A glory cry we raise to Heaven 
With holy hands and lifted hearts 
[our] eyes upon our Savior Holy, Holy, Holy 
All of Heaven cries 
Worthy, Worthy, Worthy 
For You were crucified 
[the] living creatures call out 
[and] all the elders fall down [they] fall down and worship 
[they] worship, we worship 
[we worship, we called in worship] 
[we call to worship] [we sing out] Holy, Holy, God most Holy 
Worthy to receive all glory 
Heaven's shouting as we glorify 
[repeat]
