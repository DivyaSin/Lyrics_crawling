Cold as ice 
You hypnotise 
A helpless dancer 
To their song 
I'm glad I found out 
About the way you'd 
Done things wrong 
But I know 
Another stranger's 
Gonna sleep with you tonight 
If it was left to me 
You'd spread your wings and fly 
If it was left to me now 
There'd be more to life 
Baby can't you see 
I've been praying 
For so very long 
I just don't know 
Where you've gone wrong 
She really gets to me 
Down on the street 
Where they all meet 
A private dancer 
For a fee 
I ain't complaining 
About the way you'd 
Done things wrong 
But I know 
I'm never gonna 
Be alone with you tonight 
Painted eyes 
Can never hide 
The fire that burns 
Within your soul 
If it was left to me 
You'd spread your wings and fly 
She really gets to me 
She really makes me high
