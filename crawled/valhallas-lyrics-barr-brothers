Bow and arrow, no wind 
High up in the dawn light 
Where everything begins 
No direction, but a steady drum 
Over the treetops, put my knuckle 
On the sun 
Oh Mama, I cannot say 
That I'm not affected 
By your orange blossom ways 
Took aim, spoke low 
Backed up to the West 
And let that little arrow go 
Valhallas want to name you 
Old relations in the valley 
Want to claim you 
There's no pill that can satisfy 
Your need to work and my need 
Not to deny I can moan like a dog 
And kick like a mule 
Say I've been sleeping well 
That wouldn't be true 
And I'm hooked like a fish 
On a telephone line 
Rounders and powders 
And fine Spanish wine Oh Darling, I'm still awake 
There are shadows on the wall 
Where the dawn wants to break 
This old mattress where we used to lie 
Heaven knows it's empty 
And I'm still on my side 
Oh Mama, I cannot say 
I am not affected by those 
Old fashioned ways 
There's some blood, some bone 
Something so sweet about 
The air back home 
Some name it, some blame it 
Some would rather see it go 
While others want to claim it 
Every jewel that you find 
Every glass you drain 
And every watch you wind I can moan like a dog 
And kick like a mule 
Say I've been sleeping well 
That wouldn't be true 
And I'm hooked like a fish 
On a telephone line 
Rounders and powders 
And fine Spanish wine
