I see people 
All kind of people 
I see 'em everyday 
Wealthy people 
Downtrodden people 
People still fighting their way Some take a shower 
Some take a bath 
Some don't ever come clean 
Some live like a criminal 
Some live like boy scouts 
Most of us live in between [Chorus: ] 
We're only gonna live so long (so long) 
We're only gonna live so long (so long) 
We're only gonna live... 
Still got time 
But never quite as much as we think (need) Working people 
Retired people 
People with too much on their plate 
Scary people 
Harmless people 
People with no where to live Some love the Bible 
Some love the Dharma 
Some feel the power of both 
(?) 
I ain't got nothing but love [Chorus: ] Some people happy 
Some people crying 
Some people feel everything 
They say we're equal 
We're not all equal 
I find that hard to believe I try love you 
I try to love them 
I try to love me too 
Some are easy 
Some take work 
People you know that we do [Chorus: ] I love people 
I love people....
