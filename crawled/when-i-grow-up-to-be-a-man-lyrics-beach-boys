When I grow up to be a man 
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid? 
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did? 
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds 
(Will I still joke around and still dig those sounds?) 
When I grow up to be a man? Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl? 
(Fourteen, fifteen) 
Will I settle down fast or will I first wanna travel the world? 
(Sixteen, seventeen) 
Now I'm young and free but how will it be 
(I'm young and free, how will it be?) 
When I grow up to be a man? Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Will my kids be proud or think their old man is really a square? 
(Eighteen, nineteen) 
When they're out having fun yeah, will I still wanna have my share? 
(Twenty, twenty-one) 
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life 
(Will I love my wife rest of my life) 
When I grow up to be a man? What will I be when I grow up to be a man? 
(Twenty-two, twenty-three) 
Won't last forever 
(Twenty-four, twenty-five) 
It's kind of sad 
(Twenty-six, twenty-seven) 
Won't last forever 
(Twenty-eight, twenty-nine) 
It's kind of sad 
(Thirty, thirty-one) 
Won't last forever 
(Thirty-two)
