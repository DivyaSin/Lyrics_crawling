My Uncle Pete was a trucker 
Riding that Nullarbor Plain 
Ten split gears and an overdrive 
Chrome stacks shooting out flames 
He'd throw me up into the cab 
My little hands would grip the wheel 
I would dream about the day 
I could drive that rig for real 
Rolling, rolling, rolling around the world 
Ten years old and ten feet tall, waving goodbye to 
The girl next door 
Rolling, rolling, today I'm the king of my street, 
I got my sleeves rolled up and my arm hanging out 
As I drive off with Uncle Pete 
As I drive off with Uncle Pete 
Heading west on highway one 
My eyes are glued to the road 
The two-way always in my hand 
"Little Buddy" that's my code 
We pull into Micks for a pie and chips 
Not a brussel sprout in sight 
Some yarns to spin as we listen to 
Slim Then we drive into the night 
If I had one wish I'd want to be, 
If I had one wish I'd want to be, 
If I had one wish I'd want to be like my Uncle Pete
