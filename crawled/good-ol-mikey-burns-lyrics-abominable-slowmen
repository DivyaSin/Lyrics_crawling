The green grass grows where the red rocks rise 
And the mountain goats stick to the mountain sides 
But the van broke down with a crick-crack sound 
So we sat on the side of the road in Montana A dirty old marmot hid beneath a tree 
While the Kraken was unleashed to keep us company 
Then the tow truck arrived and the journey revived 
As we sped down the road for Cut Bank, Montana We rolled into a town with streets full of bears 
And arrangements were made for vehicular repairs 
Then heard the good word as we were referred 
To the only rental shop in Cut Bank, Montana We waddled on over to a Loony Tune motel 
With mercs at the door to deter the clientele 
But we were ushered in by the mob's kingpin 
Who was good ol' Mikey Burns, Prince Thief of Montana Mikey Burns has got a Chevrolet Venture 
Mikey Burns has got your ticket for adventure 
He said when you're a-pressed with a policeman's concerns 
Just tell 'em you borrowed it from good ol' Mikey Burns We were led into his kitchen slash living room 
Enshrouded by an aura of taxidermic doom 
And where Mikey ate his meals he also did his business deals 
Right there in his home in Cut Bank, Montana We tried to haggle down but we were fools 
This was Mikey Burns' town with Mikey Burns' rules 
So we heeded his advice and paid the list price 
And our minivan snarled west on 2 in Montana It soon became clear that we had sold our souls 
To the only man eligible in all the polls 
The king of the town, the cock of the walk 
Ol' Mikey Burns in Cut Bank, Montana The sun comes up and the moon goes down 
And the casino bars open all around the town 
And Mikey Burns laughs all the way to the bank 
Cuz you can't prank a crank up in Cut Bank, Montana
