Welcome to another world 
Look at the water, look at whatever 
We broke the last one apart 
And put it back together, it didn't matter 
It's a little biblical 
A little bit tragic, it may be fantastic 
Every once in a while 
Every little thing, Every little thing But I'm old enough to know I'm holding on 
For something 
I'm old enough to see I'm not the only one When you get back to town 
Back from the islands, back to where I live 
Well, we need to have a word 
A topic to touch on, the topic is touchy 
Yeah this is pitiful 
The lack of reception, you never listen 
I don't need another round 
Nothing is perfect but this isn't worth it And I'm old enough to know that I'm holding on 
For something 
I'm old enough to see I'm not the only one Yeah I smashed it apart and the rains wouldn't stop 
'Til everybody was gone, moving on to the next one I'm old enough to know, I'm holding on 
For something 
I'm old enough to see I'm not the only one
