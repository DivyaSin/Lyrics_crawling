Nobody left unbroken 
Nobody left unscared 
Nobody here is talking 
That's just the way things are You had to go, without me 
You wandered off alone 
And all the neon reflects 
Off the sidewalk 
Home reminds me 
You're not coming home [Chorus] 
Sister, lost soul 
Brother, lost soul 
I need you 
Sister, lost soul 
Brother, lost soul 
I need you Every last heart is pardoned 
And every last tear's been cried 
Out on the street the water's frozen 
And I feel like the only one alive [Chorus] I long to lay down beside you 
Feel your breath in my ear 
You're not the first or last 
I've lied to 
I'm lying to myself right now 
You're still here [Chorus: x2]
