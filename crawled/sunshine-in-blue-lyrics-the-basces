And though we're running away 
Every day I see the Blue Sunshine 
Where the dreams are all made of gleams 
The same we treasured long, long ago. The world is somewhere out there 
And we're here in our Blue Sunshine 
Every time that I look at you 
Emotions come to sing songs in Blue I'm still running away with you 
When everything is growing like a wall 
You know I'll be there with you 
When everything is falling 
When everything is growing like a wall Time is always with us 
On our side in the Blue Sunshine 
Every time that I look at you 
I know my heart belongs next to yours We never thought it could be so real 
When we see the sunshine 
All the rain seems to fade away 
To let the blue take the place of the grey I'm still running away with you 
When everything is growing like a wall 
You know I'll be there with you 
When everything is falling 
When everything is growing like a wall I'm still running away with you 
When everything is growing like a wall 
You know I'll be there with you 
When everything is falling 
When everything is growing like a wall
