I always fantasize 
Every time the night strikes eleven 
Oh to feel the rhythm sway 
To dance the night away would be heaven Never never never had the chance boy 
Never ever ever got to love 
Tonight I'm free to explore your body 
Never never never had the chance boy 
Never ever ever got to love 
Tonight I'm free to explore your body Oh what a night, boy 
Just keep the music pumping 
All through the night, boy 
You'll be my distant lover 
I'm not here to fall in love 
Tonight should be enough for us 
Just move your body closer Oh give it all to me 
No boundaries, we are free 
For the first time 
Hold your body close to me 
I'll be a memory by the sunrise Never never never had the chance boy 
Never ever ever got to love 
Tonight I'm free to explore your body 
Never never never had the chance boy 
Never ever ever got to love 
Tonight I'm free to explore your body Oh what a night, boy 
Just keep the music pumping 
All through the night, boy 
You'll be my distant lover 
I'm not here to fall in love 
Tonight should be enough for us 
Just move your body closer I know you want to see the light 
And spend our days as one 
Don't want forever, just want whatever 
Until the rise of the sun Oh what a night, boy 
Just keep the music pumping 
All through the night, boy 
You'll be my distant lover 
I'm not here to fall in love 
Tonight should be enough for us 
Just move your body closer Oh what a night, boy 
Just keep the music pumping 
All through the night, boy 
You'll be my distant lover 
I'm not here to fall in love 
Tonight should be enough for us 
Just move your body closer
