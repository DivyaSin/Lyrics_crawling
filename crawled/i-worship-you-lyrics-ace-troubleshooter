How do I begin to speak of Your glory? 
How do I begin to speak of Your love? 
How do I begin to speak of Your goodness? 
How do I begin to praise my Father above? I think of all the things You've given 
And the price for me You chose to pay 
Your thoughts of me are always sunshine 
Through my clouded mind I see the Son drive the rain away I worship You Oh Lord Your love brings sunshine to my days 
Oh Lord Your love brings a smile to my face 
Oh Lord Your love brings hot sauce to my taco 
Oh Lord You love brings warmth to my heart Oh Lord how I long to be in Your presence 
With a longing heart I sit at Your feet 
Oh Papa God I throw my arms 'round You 
With a humble heart I lift my hands and fall on my knees I worship You
