I walked 47 miles of barbed wire, 
Used a cobra snake for a neck tie. 
Got a brand new house on the roadside, 
Made out of rattlesnake hide. 
I got a brand new chimney made on top, 
Made out of human skulls. 
Now come on darling let's take a little walk, tell me, 
Who do you love, 
Who do you love, Who do you love, Who do you love. Arlene took me by the hand, 
And said oooh eeeh daddy I understand. 
Who do you love, 
Who do you love, Who do you love, Who do you love. 
The night was black and the night was blue, 
And around the corner an ice wagon flew. 
A bump was a hittin' lord and somebody screemed, 
You should have heard just what I seen. 
Who do you love, Who do you love, Who do you love, Who do you love. Arleen took me by my hand, she said Ooo-ee Bo you know I understand 
I got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind, 
I lived long enough and I ain't scared of dying. Who do you love (4x's)
