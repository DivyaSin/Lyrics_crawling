There are pictures on my TV screen 
Stories told of make believe 
Seems there's always something new I could waste my time 
With characters that hypnotize 
I hope to see them soon But they're not real 
They can't feel 
They don't steal my heart like you do The ghosts of all my yesterdays 
Are calling me to slip away 
Back to where they all began I enjoy their company 
But they don't have the fix for me 
I'd rather hold your hand 'Cause they're not real 
They can't feel 
They don't steal my heart like you do I can see you when I close my eyes 
But memories don't satisfy 
I'm better with you by my side I could search the whole world through 
And still not find another you 
But I'm not looking for a change I don't even know the score 
But you're all I want and a little more 
And I need you every day 'Cause our love is real 
I like the way it feels 
No one steals my heart like you do
