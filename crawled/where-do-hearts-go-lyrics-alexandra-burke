You gave my wings to fly way up high 
Oh you showed me the love could bring anything 
Yeah you lifted my soul inside to clear those skies 
Oh you listened to me to see all I can be, yeah 
Gotta let you know 
I don't know what your love means, 
Are you near or far? 
And I need to know! 
Don't wanna waste one more hour, 
Wondering where you are 
And where do hearts go 
When love, love goes?! 
I see the light, 
My wings were fly 
I know my heart will breathe again 
FOR YOU! 
One day, our love will spread again! I said you put joy in amazing things, made everything 
Yeah you know what I felt inside 
I could never hide from 
Brought out the best in me for all to see 
Yeah you, made me believe in me 
You set ME FREE 
Gotta let you know 
I don't know what your love means, 
Are you near or far? 
And I need to know! 
Don't wanna waste one more hour, 
Wondering where you are 
And where do hearts go 
When love, love goes?! 
I see the light, 
My wings were fly 
I know my heart will breathe again 
FOR YOU! 
One day, my love will shine again! 
Will shine again, oooh

When love, love goes?!
