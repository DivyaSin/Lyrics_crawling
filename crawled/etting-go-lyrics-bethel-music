You've brought me to the end of myself 
And this has been the longest road 
Just when my hallelujah was tired 
You gave me a new song I'm letting go, I'm letting go 
I'm letting go, and falling into You I confess I still get scared sometimes 
But perfect love comes rushing in 
And all the lies that screamed inside 
Go silent 
The moment You begin You remind me of things forgotten 
You unwind me until I'm totally undone 
And with Your arms around me 
Fear was no match for Your love 
Now You've won me
