I can't believe that I'm here in this place again 
How did I manage to mess up one more time? 
This pattern seems to be the story of my life 
Should have learned this lesson by the thousandth time. 'Cause I promised myself I wouldn't fall 
But here I've fallen 
I guess I'm not as strong as I thought 
All I can do is cry to you. [Chorus] 
Oh God you have to save me 
You're my last and only hope 
All my right answers fail me 
I can't seem to make it on my own. Always thought that I would be strong enough 
What made all of them fall couldn't take me down 
Yeah, did I think that I was above it all? 
I have learned that pride comes before the fall I can't promise myself that I won't fall 
'Cause here I've fallen 
I know I'm not as strong as I thought 
All I can do is cry to you. [Chorus: x2]
