The lips of the righteous teach many, 
But fools die for want of wisdom. 
The rich man wealth is in his city; 
Do you hear, do you hear, can you understa-and?! Destruction of the poor, is poverty; 
Destruction of the soul, is vanity. 
The righteous' wealth is in his Holy Pla-ace. 
Do you hear? Those who have eyes, to see will see! /break/ The rich man wealth is in his city; 
Do you hear, do you believe, do you understand?! Destruction of the poor is poverty. 
Destruction of the soul is vanity, 
Well hear me children! 
The righteous' wealth is in his Holy Pla-ace!
