When it gets me back again 
I'll be ready to begin 
Ready to stand up to it 
And it gets me back again On my word I could never see it coming 
'Cause I never could keep up on anyone 
You said you could but you wouldn't 
Tell me what to do and I never could see through you 
Even sometimes On better days you and I 
Will figure this out 
Push it down look behind When it gets me back again 
I'll be ready to begin 
Ready to stand up to it 
And it gets me back again On my word I could never see it coming 
'Cause I never could keep up on anyone 
You said you could but you wouldn't 
Tell me what to do and I never could see through you 
Even sometimes On my word I could never see it coming 
'Cause I never could keep up on anyone 
You said you could but you wouldn't 
Tell me what to do and I never could see through you 
Even sometimes On my word I could never see it coming 
'Cause I never could keep up on anyone 
You said you could but you wouldn't 
Tell me what to do and I never could see through you 
Even sometimes
