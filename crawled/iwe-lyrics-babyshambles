Am I the caller of your keep 
Am I the catcher of your fall 
Am I the staller of your gaze 
You leave me in a daze You take your jump I'll make my leap 
Feel freedom coming, we can have it all 
We are the ones to lead the way 
We'll leave them in a daze We'll leave them in a daze 
We'll leave them in a daze 
We'll leave them in a daze I Carried you down from the fortress 
I don't know when to draw the line 
That's not the way that you should do thee That's not the way that you should screw me Make the jump or I'll take my leave 
Just like icicles burning my eyes out 
We are the ones to seize the day 
I'll tell you that we'll leave them in a daze Who will lead the way 
Who will lead the way 
Tell me while you leave them in a daze 
Change your, change your ways 
Just before I slip away I said 
We'll leave them in a daze Iwe, iwe, iwe, iwe
