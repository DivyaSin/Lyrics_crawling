You stopped 
Dead in your tracks 
A ghost from the past 
Had come back to play 
To fuck up your day But 
you spot an exit 
A door standing red lit 
You leave it to chance 
But you're worried cuz you'd rather go up than down You never like to hear the sound 
She makes You'd rather go up than down But she's still gonna give and you're still gonna take it 
Yeah, you're still gonna take it now It'll all be better when the clock runs out 
(Say it til it's true) 
(Say it til it's true) 
But I don't want to feel what I felt when I fell back down 
(Nothin you could do) 
(Nothin you could do) I could smell the smoke 
But could not see the flames 
Never thought we'd choke 
But I had forgot your name 
In the dark 
All the wounds we had opened 
Seemed more like a reason to bury the pain 
The fork 
In the paths we had chosen 
Has made it too easy to open gate I know 
The deeper it goes 
The deeper it goes 
The more it unfolds 
I get further from ever getting far away The deeper it goes 
The deeper it goes 
The lies that were told 
I get lost in the storm of the hell I made
