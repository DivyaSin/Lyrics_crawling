Written by Kevin Bacon and Michael Bacon "A song about thanksgiving - not the holiday, just the act of giving thanks." KB Bobby's lyin' round like the wakin' dead 
He's got a big black cloud hangin' over his head 
I want to get him up, get him out the door 
I'd like to get him drunk, but he don't drink no more 
He says, "Oh, buddy, I really thought she was the one 
Tell me what happened, 'cause we were havin' so much fun." Some of us will live in love, and some will watch love die 
There but for the grace of you, go I 
Girl but for the grace of you, go I Teddy married Betty, when they were still in school 
And he never was her first choice, she never was his fool 
50 years together, that was somethin' less than bliss 
Rarely did they tell the truth and rarely did they kiss 
Pass the fish sticks, and tell me what you did today 
And the clock ticks, they're runnin' out of things to say I've seen ashes in the wind, and I've never seen him cry 
There but for the grace of you, go I 
Girl but for the grace of you, go I Off we go in a cloud of dust, let the chips fall where they must 
Girl you turned my life around, in the time it takes a heart to pound Some of us will live in love, and some will watch love die 
There but for the grace of you, go I 
Girl but for the grace of you, go I
