Tall and gorgeous 
Cold as the summer time 
I wish I had some news 
To leave you this Caroline Seen so many vultures 
Split so many pieces 
Down the line Kastro would not believe 
What comes from below 
Fight me gladly 
Leave before the battles grow So good night, crazies 
I leave them, feeling lazy 
But I'm the god tonight Golden fabric 
Torn from the devil girls hair 
Cheap medallions 
Gleam from the Vanity Fair Seen so many vultures 
Split so many creatures 
Down there
