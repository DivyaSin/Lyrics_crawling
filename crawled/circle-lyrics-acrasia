Lets start from here 
Mend your broken heart 
Lets start from here 
And feel the emptiness inside Figure out what it could be 
And how possibly it wont be Cruel intentions in my mind 
Show me how to act 
(you show me how to act) 
Cruel intentions I cant hide 
Show me how to love 
(you show me how to love) Looking for the one 
Has never been easy 
The mornings that are breezy 
Empty feelings in me How could it be 
And where will I be Cruel intentions in my mind 
Show me how to act 
(you show me how to act) 
Cruel intentions I cant hide 
Show me how to love 
(you show me how to love) Send me your thoughts 
I will lend my ears 
Open your eyes and see me 
Open your eyes and see me Ohhhhhhohhhhh.. Cruel intentions in my mind 
Show me how to act 
(you show me how to act) 
Cruel intentions I cant hide 
Show me how to love 
(you show me how to love)
