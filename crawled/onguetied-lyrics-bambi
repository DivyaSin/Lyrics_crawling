I came into the party 
And i say u there 
Ur baby blue eyes 
And ur spiked up hair 
I tried to ignore u 
We were a long time ago 
But no matter how i hide it 
Its gonna show 
I started to talk with my friends 
But than u came over 
With some new chick 
Wonder how u know her? 
I wanted to ask u 
I even tried 
But whenever i get around u 
I get so tonguetied We were supposed to be 
Together 
Forever 
Forever aint so long no more 
We were in love boy for the longest time 
SO why suddenly do i get 
So tonguetied Five months later 
Sittin at home 
Drinkin some pepsi 
All alone 
The telephone rings 
I say hello? 
It turned out to be u 
Who woulda known? 
It was so weird 
I didn't know why 
U gave me full closure 
And i started to cry We were supposed to be 
Together 
Forever 
Forever aint so long no more 
We were in love boy for the longest time 
SO why suddenly do i get 
So tonguetied
