Listen, 
All our friends are breaking up 
Cause they don't never talk things through 
All they ever do is making love 
Being without you just ain't cool 
You're my baby and I'm feeling you 
There's no place I'd rather be 
Than wrapped up in your arms tonight 
Just you and me [Chorus] 
Only you could love me the way you do 
Only you would put up with the things I do (yes you would, know you would) 
Making love to you changes my gray skies to blue (ah, ha, ha, ha) 
Only you can love me the way do (yes you do, I know you do, I know you want it, ooh) Girl I like it when you're in the mood 
So I play like I'm a drink and you're the food 
I turn the phone off so no one disturbs our groove (don't you dare disturb our groov-oo-oo-oove) 
Call in sick so we can spend the day 
If you don't mind I want the needle in the hay 
And if I get it lady I will stay around [Chorus] 
(Cause baby I love you) (Only you can love me the way you do) 
(Woo, sometimes I'm so out of control) 
Making love to you changes my gray skies to blue (ah, ha, ha, ha) 
Only you (you) could love me the way do (take it to the bridge now) Girl there will be no more lonely nights (girl there will be no more lonely nights) 
We'll make love instead of always fighting 
So (don't you dare disturb our groove) 
Girl you're the only, girl you're the only lips (the only lips I want to kiss) 
And I will grant your every wish tonight [Chorus] 
(Only you can love me, so girl won't you lay your body down) 
(I know you would, I know I could, I'll do your body right)
