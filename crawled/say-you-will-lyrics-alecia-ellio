It only takes two hours by plane 
If you drive you can make it in a day 
Just think baby if we met halfway They say the miles will tear us apart 
But they don't how wrong they are 
For us forever just isn't that far I will wait for you 
Through the lonely hours 
Where you are 
Won't change the way I feel 
Oh my heart with you 
You don't have to worry 
This emptiness is something 
Only you can fill 
I will wait for you 
Will you wait for me 
Say you will,say you will,say you will,say you will When you're scared and you think we could fall 
When it feels like we just might lose it all 
Listen to your heart baby before you build that wall I will wait for you 
Through the lonely hours 
Where you are 
Won't change the way I feel 
Oh my heart with you 
You don't have to worry 
This emptiness is something 
Only you can fill 
I will wait for you 
Will you wait for me 
Say you will,say you will,say you will,say you will When you've been missing me a little too long 
Baby be strong I will wait for you 
Through the lonely hours 
Where you are 
Won't change the way I feel 
Oh my heart with you 
You don't have to worry 
This emptiness is something 
Only you can fill 
I will wait for you 
Will you wait for me 
Say you will,say you will,say you will,say you will
