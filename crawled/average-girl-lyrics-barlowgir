So what I'm not your average girl 
I don't meet the standards of this world 
Chasing after boys is not my thing 
See I'm waiting for a wedding ring No more dating 
I'm just waiting 
Like sleeping beauty 
My prince will come for me 
No more dating 
I'm just waiting 
'Cause God is writing my love story Boys are bad; that's certainly not true 
'Cause God's preparing one for you 
If you get tired waiting till he comes 
God's arms are the perfect place to run No more dating 
I'm just waiting 
Like sleeping beauty 
My prince will come for me 
No more dating 
I'm just waiting 
'Cause God is writing my love story Sleep, that's the only thing for me 
'Cause when I sleep 
God's preparing one for me No more dating 
I'm just waiting 
Like sleeping beauty 
My prince will come for me 
No more dating 
I'm just waiting 
'Cause God is writing my love story
