Convert discretion in a hotel room 
Ain't it always the same 
Another gig now, got an achin' head 
And I'm back on display 
Ain't no thing though, all the fans agree, we killed it tonight 
Back at the hotel, watching CNN, still scared for my life 
So where is the party going on? 
It's no fair to make me stay alone 
Down in the lobby there's a couple left 
Have them buy me a round 
I'm your best friend I'm your superstar 
Yeah I'm down with the brown 
We in the bathroom let's be super cool 
You gotta a little bit left 
What a special thing, I'm your trophy boy 
Get the fuck out my face 
You will go home satisfied 
I'll be blacked out for the night 
In the morning I can't remember, I can't remember a thing 
I'm on the bus now 
They won't look at me, man it's always the same 
I'm a broken, why can't you see? 
Can't you give me your hand? 
No, I'm the bad guy, don't appreciate, can't you see who I am? 
I'm on my last leg, I can't see 
I wasn't trying to blow your fantasy 
Another chance now, I'm on the stage again 
But this time I don't fly 
You all just left me, just walked away. Alone up there to die. 
It was the next day got a couple calls making sure I'm alive 
Man you gotta end this, just walk away Your money or your life. 
So save your judgments for someone else 
And be grateful I saved me from myself 
Fuck you all I gotta reason to live 
And I never gonna die 
Fuck you all I gotta reason to live 
And I never gonna die 
Fuck you all I gotta reason to live 
And I never gonna die 
Fuck you all I gotta reason to live 
And I never gonna die
