Making my way downtown, walking fast 
Faces pass and I'm home-bound 
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way 
Making a way through the crowd And I need you 
And I miss you 
And now I wonder If I could fall into the sky 
Do you think time would pass me by? 
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I can just see you tonight It's always times like these when I think of you 
And I wonder if you think of me 
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong 
Living in your precious memory And I need you 
And I miss you 
And now I wonder If I could fall into the sky 
Do you think time would pass me by? 
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I can just see you tonight And I, I don't wanna let you know 
I, I drown in your memory 
I, I don't wanna let this go 
I, I don't Making my way downtown, walking fast 
Faces pass as I'm homebound 
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way 
Making a way through the crowd And I still need you 
And I still miss you 
And now I wonder If I could fall into the sky 
Do you think time would pass us by? 
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I can just see you Oh, if I could fall into the sky 
Do you think time would pass me by? 
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I can just see you 
If I can just hold you 
Tonight
