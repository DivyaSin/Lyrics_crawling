Find table spaces, say your social graces 
Bow your head, they're pious here 
But you and I, we're pioneers, we make our own rules 
Our own room, no bias here 
Let 'em sell what they are sellin', there are no buyers here 
So gather all the rebels now, we'll rebel-rouse and sing aloud 
We don't care what they say no way, no way 
And we will leave the empty chairs to those who say we can't sit there 
We're fine all by ourselves So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance 
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s 
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies 
We have no apologies for being Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us) 
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah) 
Find me where the wild things are I lose my balance on these eggshells 
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead 
Don't wanna hang around the in-crowd 
The cool kids aren't cool to me 
They're not cooler than we are So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance 
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s 
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies 
We have no apologies for being Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us) 
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah) We will carve our place into time and space 
We will find our way, or we'll make a way (say hey, hey, hey) 
Find you're great, don't you hide your face 
Let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance 
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s 
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies 
We have no apologies for being Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us) 
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah) 
Find me where the wild things are
