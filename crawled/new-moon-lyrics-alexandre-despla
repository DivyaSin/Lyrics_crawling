Strip this pain 
you left me with 
crave me still 
I'm screaming out your name 
Free me from 
this forsaken road 
erase my fears 
of living my life alone escape the rain, 
run to me, 
cradle me, 
yearn for me, 
can you hear my cries, 
escape the rain, 
how do I escape the rain keep me alive, 
revive my love, 
I need you, 
whisper my name. 
break down these walls, 
uncloud my day, 
help me breathe, 
don't give up on me now. escape the rain, 
run to me, 
cradle me, 
yearn for me, 
can you hear my cries, 
escape the rain, 
how do I escape the rain can you heal this wound 
from bleeding inside 
inside x 3 escape the rain, 
run to me, 
cradle me, 
yearn for me, 
can you hear my cries, 
escape the rain, 
how do I escape the rain
