When I wake they're always there 
Waiting just to freely please me 
While I wash they're occupied 
Cleaning things so sweetly neatly 
When I play they play with me 
Willing to do anything [Chorus] 
I live me dolls 
You must believe me 
It's plain to see, they really love me 
I love my dolls, 
They'll never leave me happily While I sleep they keep me warm 
Nestled right beside me, tightly 
As I eat they wait on me 
Making sure I'm satisfied [Chorus] When friends come over they're astonished by the sight 
So many dolls in just one place gives them a fright 
Don't understand what makes them so uncomfortable 
Around my dolls [Chorus]
