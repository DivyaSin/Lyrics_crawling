Wait, planet earthquake 
Planet heartbreak, give me this day 
Dates pass through a maze 
Are you okay? Are you awake? 
Pride, yours flies to high 
Yours is to great, yours is to die 
I, I'm taking no side 
I'm going under, for once alive 
Wait, falling airplanes Today, my worries fade away 
In suspended dream state 
Somehow I knew 
Erase, everything stops now And now I crash with them 
I am a bank deposit 
I'm held accomplice to man's will 
The faith transcending reason, 
The passenger descending 
And in an instant time stands still 
Fade, planet heartbreak 
Stop thinking
