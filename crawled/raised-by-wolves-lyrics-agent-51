This is a call to all of those that I've been missin' 
This is a call to all of those I used to know 
I get so jaded and my blood begins to thicken down so low 
Let it go And somewhere in the night I find a place and listen 
I've seen the faces fading as the years go by 
The search for answers still lives on but I can't grip them 
Still I try, I don't know why I know I've been right here before 
But I call on yesterday 
Ain't no clouds in the sky 
Still I can smell the rain I don't know why the darkness comes 
I don't know why it's in my blood 
You see dawn and I see dusk 
I was raised by wolves I don't know why the darkness comes 
I don't know why it's in my blood 
You see dawn and I see dusk 
I was raised by wolves And so the road is long and filled with many questions 
I look ahead with open arms to the unknown 
This is the time this is the place for us to listen 
Let them know, let them know I know I've been right here before 
But I call on yesterday 
Ain't no clouds in the sky 
Still I can smell the rain I don't know why the darkness comes 
I don't know why it's in my blood 
You see dawn and I see dusk 
I was raised by wolves I don't know why the darkness comes 
I don't know why it's in my blood 
You see dawn and I see dusk 
I was raised by wolves I know I've been right here before 
But I call on yesterday 
Ain't no clouds in the sky 
Still I can smell the rain I don't know why the darkness comes 
I don't know why it's in my blood 
You see dawn and I see dusk 
I was raised by wolves I don't know why the darkness comes 
I don't know why it's in my blood 
You see dawn and I see dusk 
I was raised by wolves I don't know why the darkness comes 
I don't know why it's in my blood 
You see dawn and I see dusk 
I was raised by wolves I don't know why the darkness comes 
I don't know why it's in my blood 
You see dawn and I see dusk 
I was raised by wolves
