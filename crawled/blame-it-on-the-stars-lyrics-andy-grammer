Sometimes you need a reason 
A little love you can't believe in 
A little hug, a little day dreaming 
Apparently there's some correlation 
Between hearts and outer space 
All I'm really trying to say is That I'm just a Sagittarius and we're kind of spontaneous 
So let's fly out to Vegas and find an Elvis to marry us Don't try to argue with the moon 
We can blame it on the stars 
Oh, come on let your heart just breathe 
Stars, oh, come one let your guard down 
And we can blame it on the stars We'd like to think that we're waiting 
On a previous reservation 
It's all written in the constellations 
Now I don't know, but neither do you 
Truth is, it's a good excuse 
For both our hearts to let loose And I know that you're a Cancer 
Which means you like holding hands 
So show me how to do this dance 
And spin me like a ceiling fan, oh Don't try to argue with the moon 
We can blame it on the stars 
Oh, come on let your heart just breathe 
Stars, oh come one let your guard down 
And we can blame it on the stars I read your horoscope 
And baby you should know 
Just what your future holds 
Let your hips move 
Let my fingers find you 
Wrap my arms around you, here we go Stars, oh, come on let your heart just breathe 
Stars, the stars, stars 
We can blame it on the stars 
Oh, come on let your heart just breathe 
Stars, oh, come one let your guard down 
And we can blame it on the stars We can blame it on the stars 
We can blame it on the stars
