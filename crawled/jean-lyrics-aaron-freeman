Jean, Jean, the roses are red 
And other leaves have come green 
And the clouds are so little 
You can touch them and some 
Come out to the metal Jean, jean, you're young and alive 
Come out of your half dream, dream 
And run if you will to the top of the hill 
Open your arms, buddy Jean To the shipping, the valley come home our way 
To the stars all around me 
And find me alone when the sun and singin' 
I still be waiting Jean, Jean, the roses are red 
And other leaves have gone green 
And the clouds are so little 
You can touch them in the sun 
Come into my arms, buddy Jean
