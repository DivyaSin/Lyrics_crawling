A long time ago in a land far away 
lived the pineapple princess, Tiki. 
She was sweet as a peach, in a pineapple way, 
but so sad that she hardly speaky. 
Still, if you listen well, 
you'll hear her secret wish. Sharpay: 
Aloha everybody, my name is Tiki! I long to free a truly remarkable fish

She dreams of a boy who is under a spell 
that has left him all wet and scaly. Sharpay:

just a girl with a ukulele. Come to me (Ryan: come to her)

kabuki thing. Sharpay & Ryan: 
The clouds turned grey, and the big sky cried, 
and the ocean had a fit. Sharpay:

Then the wind went whoosh, and the thunder 
cracked, and mighty Mount FuFu spit. Sharpay [spoken]:
