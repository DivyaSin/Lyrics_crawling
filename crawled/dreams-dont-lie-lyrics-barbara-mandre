(Gary Harrison - Kent Robbins - Gene Miller) I changed my number, I gave you back my picture 
I said you're someone I don't wanna see 
I told my friends at work it wasn't worth the hurt 
But it's a different story when I go to sleep Chorus 
Dreams don't lie - dreams don't lie 
I say I don't love you but the truth comes out at night 
Dreams don't lie Old friends call, they're careful not to talk about you 
I say it's alright, you never even cross my mind 
Then I hang up the phone, I say I like it here alone 
I can fool myself until I close my eyes Chorus I don't love you, I don't need you 
I don't want you in my life 
I cane make it sound convincing 
'Til I turn out the light
