Performed by after 7 I'll give you the sun 
The rain 
The moon 
The stars and the mountains 
I'll give you the world 
And all that you wish for 
And even more 
Girl I love you more than you could know 
And that's for sure 
I'd climb the highest hill 
Cross the widest sea 
Nothing could discourage me 
And I pray that you will be 
Always there for me 
Forever more Ready or not 
I'll give you everything 
And more 
All that I've got - it's yours 
I'll give you everything 
All that you're lookin' for I'll give you my heart 
My soul 
My time 
My love is a fountain 
I will be your earth 
And all that you need for 
And ever more 
'cause girl I love you more than words can show 
My love is pure 
I'll walk a thousand miles 
Sail a thousand seas 
Nothin' will discourage me 
And I pray that you will 
Always be there for me 
Forever more Hook Everything's not anything 
If you're not here to share my dream 
You don't know what it means to me 
If you'll accept my love 
I dedicate my love 
My soul 
My heart beats for you 
Girl I can't get enough 
So I'll wait for your love 
There's nothin' that I'd rather do Hook 3 times
