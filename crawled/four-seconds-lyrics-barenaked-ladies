Goes to show 
It's not what you know 
(But) who you know 
So's, you know 
I can go with the flow 
Build my note 
Then throw to snow 
Before the show 
Stay low 
Play it on a Dobro 
Oh, I tiptoe to and fro 
From Ontario 
My stereo's blue like the rodeo 
Growing like a freak show free throw 
It's just the intro 
Keep dropping like dominoes One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Now rewind 
What'd you have in mind? 
Could we unwind? 
I'm fine 
We can find a streamline 
Recombine, intertwine 
If I'm gonna headline 
Tryin' to be moving all the behinds 
Line to line 
Try to shine 
Redesigned, redefined 
Keeping up the spellbind 
Gotta make it worth the grind 
Just in time to have another close encounter of the third kind One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four I've been away for years and a day 
You'd be thinking I'd be lonely 
But I'm out here to stay 
Wouldn't have it any other way Oh flip, the light is turning orange 
Coat ripped when I caught it in the door hinge 
I slip when the lady in the four-inch 
Bought it in a store in Germany 
You wore it like a makeshift snowdrift 
Had to get a gift 
Saw the red shift rift 
Gretta got an eyelift 
Oh sure, that one's obscure 
Maybe piss-poor, but I had to take a little detour I've been away for years and a day 
You'd be thinking I'd be lonely 
But I'm out here to stay 
Wouldn't have it any other way One Mississippi 
Two Mississippi 
Three Mississippi 
Four
