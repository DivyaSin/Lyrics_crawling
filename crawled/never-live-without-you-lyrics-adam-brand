Well I've never loved another like I love you 
You taught this cheating heart to want to stay at home 
And now I know that I could never live without you 
If I ever thought I could I was wrong 
My heart was bleeding and my pride was all bruised 
I threw caution to the wind, I had nothing left to lose 
My days of running wild and no one to care for 
I've left them all way behind and now 
I'm knocking down your front door 
My friends keep telling me that it'll never last 
This crazy loving feeling, soon it's gonna pass 
But day by day it's getting stronger than before 
Everytime I kiss your lips I keep coming on back for so much more
