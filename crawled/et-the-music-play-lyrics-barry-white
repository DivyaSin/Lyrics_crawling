Hey, what's goin' on man, yeah

All night long, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, wee Let the music play on 
Just until I feel this misery is gone 
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on

I can't erase the things I feel

I've got to hide what's killin' me inside Let the music play 
I just want to dance the night away 
Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay 
All night long, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Let the music play on 
Just until I feel this misery is go
