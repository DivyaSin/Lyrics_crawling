When I was a baby my mum and my dad 
Said slow down son you're crawling too fast 
I had skinned up knees and bumps on my head 
Well I couldn't talk then but if I could I'd have said I was built for speed I was born to run 
I get chills when they fire off that starter's gun 
Keep your rocking chair and your tranquility 
I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed Well that car lot man said I've got a deal for you 
It's got air con, cushy seats and rides real smooth 
Well I told him I don't care if the saddle looks good 
'Cause it's all about them horses underneath the hood In a hundred years from now when my body gives out 
I won't have no nursemaid wheeling me around 
I'll take a chrome Harley motor and I'll bolt it to my chair 
And I'll lay a strip of rubber up those pearly white stairs
