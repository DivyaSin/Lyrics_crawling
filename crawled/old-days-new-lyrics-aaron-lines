It's Friday night, county road 
Seventeen, off we go 
It's summertime, not a care in the world 
Well I remember My two best friends and me 
Takin' a trip to feel the ocean breeze 
Nothing but dreams as far as we could see 
Oh I remember When fillin' that tank 
Would seem like such a big deal 
And how the wind in my hair 
With the sun coming up made me feel Oh well I ain't complaining 
(I ain't complaining) 
About the way things are 
(About the way things are) 
Not so long ago life was oh so easy now 
(Now when that innocence seems so far) 
When it seems so far 
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new Jenny Thompson, our first date 
I showed up early, she made me wait 
Clumsy conversation with her dad 
Well I remember That bright red dress, the perfect fit 
A romantic movie that I let her pick 
We were both in the dark dreaming of love 
Oh I remember How her head on my shoulder 
Seemed like such a big deal 
And how the touch of her hand and 
That very first kiss made me feel, yeah Well I ain't complaining 
(I ain't complaining) 
About the way things are 
(About the way things are) 
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now 
(Now when that innocence seems so far) 
When it seems so far 
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new Well I've got a thousand reasons 
To smile these days 
I've got a thousand great memories 
That I can't replace 
But when there's weight on my shoulders 
And tears on my face 
Even years from now I know I'll say I ain't complaining 
About the way things are 
Not too long ago 
Life was oh so easy now 
Now when that innocence seems so far 
When it seems so far 
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new I ain't complaining 
About the way things are 
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now 
Now when that innocence seems so far 
When it seems so far 
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new
