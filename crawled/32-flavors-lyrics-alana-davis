Squint your eyes and look closer 
I'm not between you and your ambition 
I am a poster girl with no poster, 
I am 32 flavors and then some And I'm beyond your peripheral vision 
so you might want to turn your head 
'Cause someday you're going to get hungry 
and eat all of the words that you just said I am what I am, 
I am 32 flavors and then some 
God help you if you are an ugly 
Course too pretty is also your doom 
'Cause everyone harbors a secret hatred 
for the prettiest girl in the room 
God help you if you are a phoenix 
and you dare to rise up from ash 
A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy 
while you are just flying past I am what I am, I am 32 flavors and then some 
I'm taking my chances as they come 
I am 32 flavors and then some, 
I'm nobody but I am someone, someone... I'd never try to give my life meaning by demeaning you 
And I would like to state for the record... 
I did everything that I could do I am beyond your peripheral vision 
so you might want to turn your head 
'Cause someday you're going to be starving 
and eating all the words that you just said 
That you said I am what I am, I am what I am 
I am 32 flavors and then some 
I'm taking my chances as they come 
I am 32 flavors and then some 
I'm looking for truth and there is none 
32 flavors and then some 
I'll never forget where I came from 
32 flavors and then some 
I'm nobody but I am someone 
32 flavors and then some 
I'm taking my chances as they come 
32 flavors and then some 
Looking for truth and there is none
