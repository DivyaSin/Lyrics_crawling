i don't wanna ask too much 
be too bold 
i dont wanna weigh you down 
with a heavy load 
ive heard you say that you can handle anything 
but what i really need to know is would you wait for me 
when i gotta leave 
could i ever be everything you need 
if i promise you my love 
could that promise be enough 
oh would you wait for me 
would you wait for me i dont need a magic night 
too make me feel 
like im living in a fairytale 
i know this love is real 
and hear me when i say 
that when ever im away 
my heart is with you 
all the same but would you wait for me 
when i gotta leave 
could i ever be everything you need 
and if i promise you my love 
could that promise be enough 
oh would you wait for me 
would you wait for me and looking back at where weve been 
me being scared to let you in 
to you becoming my best friend 
no matter where i travel to 
im coming right back home to you 
if you'll just wait for me would you wait for me 
when i gotta leave 
could i ever be everything you need 
if i promise you my love 
could that promise be enough 
would you wait for me yeah would you wait for me 
when i gotta leave 
could i ever be everything you need 
if i promise you my love 
could that promise be enough 
would you wait for me 
would you wait for me
