I thought it would rain forever 
Caught in the flood 
Reaching for some high ground 
Just before I went down It's hard for me to remember 
Just how I got through 
Now I'm lying on the cool sand 
Happy here where I am I look up 
The setting sun is bathing the world 
With a healing light 
Little darlin', it's gonna be 
A beautiful night The rolling of distant thunder 
Trouble ahead 
Now don't you be afraid now 
We'll get through it somehow Just look up 
The setting sun is bathing the world 
With a healing light 
Little darlin', it's gonna be 
A beautiful night Some like burning all night long 
Some like howling at the moon 
Some just like to sing along 
Cause we get lonely, 
Lonely, we get so lonely The stars in the sky above me 
Can make me forget 
Everything but you, babe, 
Everything but you I look up 
See your shining smile 
And I know it'll be all right 
Little darlin', it's gonna be 
A beautiful night Just look up, 
The setting sun is bathing the world 
With a healing light 
Little darlin', it's gonna be 
A beautiful night Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain let it rain It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be
