Great God of might, great God of wonders 
Giver of life, giver of grace 
Creator of everything before us 
You had me in mind before the stars were in place Your love surpasses all by far 
We're praising You for all You are The reason we're here and the reason we sing 
Is to thank You, oh God and give praise to the King 
We lift up our hands and we lift up our eyes and sing 
You are holy You are holy Father of love, Father of mercy 
What have I done that You would think about me? 
You've taken my shame, You've taken my sorrow 
Replaced them with life and life abundantly Your love surpasses all by far 
We're praising You for all You are The reason we're here and the reason we sing 
Is to thank You, oh God and give praise to the King 
We lift up our hands and we lift up our eyes and sing 
You are holy The reason we're here and the reason we sing 
Is to thank you, oh God and give praise to the King 
We lift up our hands and we lift up our minds 
And we pray that all we do would bring glory to You You can see inside my heart 
You can see inside my mind 
So strip away the things 
That leave me deaf and blind The reason we're here and the reason we sing 
Is to thank You, oh God and give praise to the King 
We lift up our hands and we lift up our eyes and sing 
You are holy The reason we're here and the reason we sing 
Is to thank you, oh God and give praise to the King 
We lift up our hands and we lift up our minds 
And we pray that all we do would bring glory to You Would bring glory to You 
You are holy
