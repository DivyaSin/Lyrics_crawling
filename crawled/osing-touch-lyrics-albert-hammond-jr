Use to run a mile but not gain an inch 
Making dreams real by killing some trees 
It's not goodbye, I'm just losing touch 
What you call wisdom, I call pain 
Stepped out of line 
I missed my train 
In time you'll say 
I'm just losing touch Happy here? The rest's a wreck 
Strangers come, the night begins 
Silence weighs a thousand tons 
Here youth describes 
You're lost in it Carved your confusion into my arm 
Left with a contusion and a bill for the scars 
It's not goodbye, I'm just losing touch 
You can't control the ocean 
You can't control the tide 
Maybe maybe maybe 
Put your ego aside 
It's like I said 
I'm just losing touch Happy here? The rest's a wreck 
Strangers come, the night begins 
Silence weighs a thousand tons 
Here youth describes 
You're lost in it
