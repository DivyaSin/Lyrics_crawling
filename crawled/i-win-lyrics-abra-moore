OK I win, you've finally lost me. 
Your letting me go, I'm walking away. 
No fight no fight still falling apart 
I can't get you out of my heart All right all right I lied about loving 
A man that I love, a love I won't have. 
It's true It's true I'm falling apart 
And I can't get you out of my heart. Kiss me under the table and we'll make believe in love 
And dream with me under the table 
It makes me feel it makes me feel alive. Something is filling my heart full of secrets 
Something is filling my heart full of lies. 
Something is taking my lover for granted 
Something is making me cry. Can't get you out of my heart 
OK I win you've finally lost me 
Your letting me go, I'm walking away 
It's true It's true I'm falling apart And I can't get you out of my heart 
Holding on to something so wrong.
