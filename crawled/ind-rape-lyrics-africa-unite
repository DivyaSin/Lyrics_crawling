Where brain wash ads form rules 
dissolvin' right into wrong 
if you unglaze your eyes and see 
though billions of dumb scenes screamin' out of your TV 
the idiot box show ain't reality Tricks and lies are coming 
they try to steal your youth 
you don't ever drop your guard 
stay alive 
wake and scream the truth 
don't let them rearrange your mind 
they're chainin' up your soul 
cause their control is outta control Rit : Keep on creatin' your now generation 
pushin' forward culture to be free 
rules of business never draw your dreams 
keep on checkin' know your enemy Marley singin' rebel music 
words keep on cracklin' 
critical mass under camera light 
fight n' die another way 
there are so many questions with no answer 
they got nothing to reveal 
the shadows of the power now are pushin' 
fast food light
