(akinyele) - hook You I'm from new york 
And connected with my down south niggas 
Here this year 
My nigga rap bone came to tear the club up 
Yo my nigga chock came to tear the club up 
My nigga joelle came to tear the club up 
And this shit here should get all the thugs up 
It's for (the money makers) 
What (the booty shakers) 
Yea (my real niggas) 
And fuck who (the playa haters) 
Yea (the move fakers) 
Ha (the immitaters) 
Yo this is for who (the money makers) 
Yea (the booty shakers) 
Ha (my real niggas) 
Yo and fuck who (the playa haters) 
Yea (the move fakers) 
And the motherfucking (immitaters) (rap bone) 
Now where I'm from these niggas dobn't pimp they pro 
Nautica shirts game hats 
And nice sweats 
And litle niggas got through the mall like packs of wild animals 
Anticipating the showdown 
In my town 
Pretty (? ) bitches get fucked 
Then they stock just drop 
They rpops go bankrupt 
So tell me who's pimping heartless 
From jacksonville to charlotte 
I got some (? ) goddesses 
On our twenty, many 
A late lonely night 
We coming back from some hype shit 
Like freaknik 
Possibly daytona 
Chilling with hook dogs 
Smelling the aroma 
Drinking wine, from 1989 
I'm blinding in the dinette set 
And let the sunlight shine 
Making vows to remain for ill and tight 
Throughout all space and time 
So from here to 19 ninety something 
My word is as money 
I hate to hear my real niggas hungry 
So I'm going to represent with my shit 
And hit the public 
All types of angles 
Strangling niggas 
With electric car wire 
And calling out the frauds like we fucking on fire Hook (chock) 
Now most chicks get they back blown 
When I let my act roll 
Conference on a track phone 
I chock and rap bone 
Joelle will pack chrome 
All through your back zone 
And I'm no thug 
But will still aim at your black dome 
And bust you 
In a honda or if I need to augusta 
You bet we going to get crunk 
We pressure in a trunk 
When I catch second hand from your dank whenyou flame your skunk 
Then take all your bank in the game we tunk 
I'm drunk, I guzzle vs, in a bubble gs 
All chrome double bs 
So on top look like a brother with ds 
Down syndrome 
But if you want to find me come around wisdom 
How do I say this calmly 
You a clown kid son 
And you need a check up so go get a papshmere 
And if stripped to my wear 
I'd have two gats bare 
Only a few cats clear 
On how I do that there (joelle) 
I wreck yous down like molecules 
When I play them fools 
I'm just that little nast nigga 
With the ladies sneaking on the jewels 
The voice is calm 
But my words are strong 
Like hurricanes 
I might spit 
A little cum shit 
But it won't stop me from doing my thang 
I maintain 
When I slangs 
>from my native land 
Upstate south cleve west anderson 
It's unexpected 
They expect it just the same 
Just get in line 
Like carolina's in the (? ? ) 
We can't be wrong 
Growing up down here 
You didn't worry about no ride or no high priced gear 
You got to boogy say boogy 
Rode in like a champ 
Wearing fake gold chain and no shirt is how we pimp 
On all sides 
The north south east and the west 
To niggas got keys got pain got fresh 
Fresh went to dope 
And dope went to fat 
Next thing you know the fools are busting all the gats 
Except the parts 
So you had to deal before dark 
Smoking weed in the club 
They don't dance they just just party 
Drinking cold malt liquor 
Country ass niggas 
Booty shaking 
Shake 
To make them asses move quicker 
I picture that 
We dirty like floor mats 
Ride in the sports coupes big jeeps fly Hook (akinyele) 
I go down south to bust a nut 
On a down south slut 
Look her in the face and tell her girl I want to fuuuuuck 
She be like shiiiiiit 
There ak-nel go with that new york diiiiiiick 
Here take a liiick 
I beginning grinning 
Cause I'm ready to hit it up 
(? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) 
Point to the light 
She be like 
I going to go flick it up 
I'm gorilla like king kong 
While you niggas is little monkeys like mighty joe young 
Out of town I know crackers with correct id 
In other words i95 is where you find me 
And buy guns from me 
In exchange for crack 
Road maps 
Got me transporting gats 
>from the north 
And the south tackle that 
Bringing it back 
To my new york money makers 
Who smoke a lot and get high like sky scrapers 
Down south I know girls who straight want to rape us 
My niggas rap bone and chock here to tape us 
My nigga joelle got some bitches flying in from jamaica 
I got some girls in la who play like the lakers 
Shiiiiiit 
Because hoes r us 
Everywhere we go mad love they show us 
Even girls who don't know us 
Want to suck our dicks for us Hook
