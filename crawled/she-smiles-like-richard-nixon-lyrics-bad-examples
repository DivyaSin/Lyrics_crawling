She smiles like richard nixon 
Walks like bridgette bardot 
And I love her, but I can't trust her 
Want her, can't let her know 
And she comes 
Dressed up in beat-up leather 
Like a soft edged vision in black 
And she runs up 
Throws her arms around me 
As if she knew I wanted her back 
And she says 
"how could you leave without me? " 
She forgets she left before I did 
Then she smiles like richard nixon
