I hear you through the wire 
The words all sound like noise 
What happened to the fire in your voice Don't try to hide the distance 
It's just too big to ignore 
We work it out like business 
It won't work anymore I remember eyes that shine 
As they looked so hard back into mine 
Now it's just a memory 
So I'll set you free I'll set you free 
Still sometimes late at night 
Moonlight comes into my window 
I make believe it's how it used to be We made it look so easy 
We never tried to resist 
Somehow you stopped believing 
Somehow we've come to this I remember eyes that shined 
As they looked so hard back into mine 
Now it's just a memory 
So I'll set you free 
I remember words that fell Like coins into a wishing well 
It was never meant to be 
So I'll set you free 
I'll set you free So now that I must go on 
What more can I do 
What good is being strong 
When all I ever really want is you
