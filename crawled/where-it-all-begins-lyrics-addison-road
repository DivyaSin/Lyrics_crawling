Twenty nine and I'm going back to the basics 
Finding love, making peace, having a little more patience 
I wanna love somebody more than myself 
'Cause it would do some good for my mental health 
To take a backseat, remember everything You taught me I need You to show me how to feel again 
I come to You with open hands 
Teach me to be real again 
Take me back to where it all begins Slowing down, tuning out all the noise just to hear Your voice 
Sounds simple enough, I know but it's a daily choice 
I wanna love when it's costly, be quick to forgive 
Run to the one who calls me to live Show me how to feel again 
I come to You with open hands 
Teach me to be real again 
Take me back to where it all begins To where it all begins 
To where it all begins 
To where it all begins 
To where it all begins Show me how to feel again 
I come to You with open hands 
Teach me to be real again 
Take me back to where it all begins Show me how to feel again 
Twenty nine and I'm going back to the basics 
Teach me to be real again 
Take me back to where it all begins To where it all begins 
To where it all begins 
To where it all begins
