There was a storm 
There was a storm of a thousand seas 
And I'll raise my glass before you notice me 
I'll raise my glass before you notice me 
But you're too far to save 
And drowned at sea And there was a storm 
There was a storm of a thousand clouds 
And the rain did fall 'till the house went down 
The rain did fall 'till the house went down 
And it merged the sea and the lands around And oh what a fight 
Oh what a fight of a thousand words 
And most of them made up to the lies that I heard 
Most of them made up to the lies that I heard 
So I left you there And there was a storm 
There was a storm, the skies aglow 
And I was by the sea with pockets of stone 
So I rushed back to town to let everyone know 
But it caught up with me and it swept me home And I saw my house 
I saw my house was broken and gone 
I saw this I knew that something was wrong 
So I pulled away roofing and timber and stone 
But I couldn't find you anywhere 
My hands were numb And oh, when you died 
Oh, when you died 
It was only my fault 
I wasn't there when the storm came 
Wasn't there to revolt 
To hold my head skywards and let the rain know 
If it's taking us then, then it's taking us both
