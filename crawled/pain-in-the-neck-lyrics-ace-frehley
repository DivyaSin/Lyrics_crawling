I think you're cute 
You're a pretty girl 
That's why we're living in sum. 
You always ask where I'm going 
Or find out where I've been 
I lost the fun, making love girl 
But now you're making me sad 
No conceasure any sympathy 
You make off for the past. You're a pain in the neck 
Pain in the neck! 
You're a pain in the neck! I'm sick and tired of all your questions 
Stop telling me lies 
You always go or ask the band 
Like a private eye 
Don't want your love, all your money 
But put the toys away 
Don't wanna hear, your complaining 
'Cause your leaving today. You're a pain in the neck 
Pain in the neck! 
You're a pain in the neck You gotta go, gotta go now 
But I must confess 
I'm gonna miss that good loving 
But you failed the test 
You better think about your future 
Take your reality check 
You can go, without screaming 
You just better accept. You're a pain in the neck 
Pain in the neck! 
You're a pain in the neck 
Pain in the neck! 
You're a pain in the neck 
Pain in the neck! 
"I'm a pain in the neck!"
