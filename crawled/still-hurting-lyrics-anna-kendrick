Jamie is over 
And Jamie is gone 
Jamie's decided it's time to move on 
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon 
And I'm still hurting Jamie arrived at the end of the line 
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine 
Jamie is probably feeling just fine 
And I'm still hurting What about lies, Jamie? 
What about things that you swore to be true? 
What about you, Jamie? 
What about you? Jamie is sure something wonderful died 
Jamie decides it's his right to decide 
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide 
And I'm still hurting Go and hide and run away 
Run away 
Run and find something better Go and ride the sun away 
Run away 
Like it's simple 
Like it's right Give me a day, Jamie 
Bring back the lies 
Hang them back on the wall 
Maybe I'd see 
How you could be 
So certain that we 
Had no chance at all Jamie is over 
And where can I turn 
Covered with scars 
I had nothing to earn 
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn 
But that would't change the fact 
That wouldn't speed the time 
Once the foundations cracked 
And I'm still hurting
