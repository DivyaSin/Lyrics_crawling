Held in a daze, the warmth I crave 
And youre still so far away 
Though for you I'll gladly wait, Ill gladly wait 
Straight through the grandest storms I've braved 
I am strong and if I make it 
Darling will you let me stay? Ill find a way to you 
In this fragile state youre all Im thinking of 
I know you want me too 
In this idle love Dark shades, a haze, you're brightening 
Tones of grey that cover me 
Now youre gone theyre all I see, theyre all I see 
Dull, restless time that fuels the fire 
Guns a-blazed, for you Ill fight 
Still Im frightened all the while Ill find a way to you 
In this fragile state youre all Im thinking of 
I know you want me too 
In this idle love 
Can you feel my desire? 
Burning for you now its all Im thinking of 
Are you growing tired of this idle love 
Of this idle love This plastic sky sometimes is nothing to what it was with you 
Im all yours alright, to hold me back is 
Something you could never do 
Never do Ill find a way to you 
In this fragile state youre all Im thinking of 
I know you want me too 
In this idle love 
Can you feel my desire? 
Burning for you now its all Im thinking of 
Are you growing tired of this idle love 
Can you feel my desire? 
Burning for you now its all Im thinking of 
Are you growing tired of this idle love 
Of this idle love 
In this idle love
