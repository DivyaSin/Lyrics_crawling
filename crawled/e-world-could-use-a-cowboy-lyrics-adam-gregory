There are fences the need to be mended 
There's a stray cut off from the heard 
That needs to be defended 
By a lonely campfire 
Underneath the stars 
He sings his sad songs 
And strums his guitar 
Tell you what the world could use 
Is a little John Wayne kind of attitude [Chorus] 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
Run those bad guys right outta town 
Round 'em up and hunt 'em down 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
The world could use a cowboy... There's a stallion that won't be broken 
All the town folk need to here 
A word of courage spoken 
From New York city to Atlanta G.A. 
From Edmonton to California 
I tell you what the world could use 
Is a Roy Rogers and a trigger too... [Chorus] 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
Run those bad guys right outa town 
A bronckin' buck, you can't keep down 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
The world could use a cowboy... Tell you what the world could use 
Is the cavalry riding to the rescue 
Yeah, I tell you what the world could use 
Is a little John Wayne kind of attitude The world could use a cowboy,the world could use a cowboy, yeah 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
Run those bad guys right outta town 
Put yours hands up, lay your weapons down 
The world could use a cowboys right about now 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
Rides off into the west when the sun goes down 
He tips his hat 
When the ladies come 'round 
The world could use a cowboy right about now 
The world could use a cowboy...
