Some folks say the times are hard 
I just say oh my lord 
Coffee's cold and I been sold 
For half a dollar bill Every seed that I do sow 
Harvest time nothin's grown 
Coffee's cold and I been sold 
For half a dollar bill Fore I have ten dollars saved 
I'll be resting in my grave 
Coffee's cold and I been sold 
For half a dollar bill I been broke a thousand times 
No one cares to spare a dime 
Coffee's cold and I been sold 
For half a dollar bill When I lay my burden down 
Peace nor comfort have I found 
Coffee's cold and I been sold 
For half a dollar bill Angels I am on my knees 
But you'll never sing for me 
Coffee's cold and I been sold 
For half a dollar bill Some folks say the times are hard 
I just say, oh my lord 
Coffee's cold and I been sold 
For half a dollar bill
