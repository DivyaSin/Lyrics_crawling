Tough Love Trying to move away, 
but I can't find a way 
To get away from you A thousand ways I tried, 
days and night I cried, 
couldn't believe it's true So I started on the road, 
the way for me to explode, 
try out all the crazy stuff Hurt my mind and heart, 
this is how every night would start, 
the road is still very rough Pre-chorus- No I...I can't go in like this 
All...all my thoughts I'm scared to unleash Chorus- Everything iv ever loved 
Seems to go away somehow 
But I'm never gonna stop believing in love I know it can be a hard way 
That's what I'm trying to say 
Being the same way is tough It's love and it's tough 
It's always gonna be that way There have been instances 
I woke up in new places 
But that dint help anything A bag of coke or hash 
Throw away all my cash 
None of that rang a bell Trying to erase memories 
Of last night's bad scenes 
To nobody I could tell Reach the point of realization 
Finally accept this separation 
Never wanted this to end
