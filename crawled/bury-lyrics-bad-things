I don't know what hit her, 
the cold and rain and tide, 
don't know what hit her. 
Cause I could come and save you, 
but I won't anymore, 
so let me be. I don't know what hit her, 
the cold and rain and tides, 
don't know what hit her. 
Cause I could come and save you, 
if you weren't so lazy. But I think you're crazy, 
all of the time. 
Maybe, just maybe, I'll make you mine, whoa. Tell me are you ready, to lose? 
This is to bury the truth, I'll fall down. Eyes fall through the window, 
the only time they cry, 
baby, I shiver. 
But I could come and save you, 
if you weren't so lazy. 
But I think you're crazy, all of the time. 
Maybe, just maybe, I'll make you mine, whoa. Tell me are you ready to lose? 
This is to bury the truth, I'll fall down. 
Tell me are you ready to lose? 
This is to bury the truth, and I'll fall down. Tell me are you ready to lose? 
This is to bury the truth, and I'll fall down. 
Tell me are you ready to lose? 
This is to bury the truth, and I'll fall down.
