Love has gone away 
heaving a sigh 
with no regrets 
for yesterday 
heaving a sigh 
love said goodbye Through with "sad and low," 
love walked away, 
a spirit child 
love had to go, 
love passed a place 
love went away Away from a place all frozen in pain 
with teardrops and heartaches all over again 
only a game of hatred and love 
all thrown in together, a kiss or a shove Reaching for my hand 
love walked away 
sighing to leave 
but ready to stand 
love walked away 
love walked away 
loved walked away, and I walked away with love.
