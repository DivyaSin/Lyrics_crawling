Ricky had a will 
Ricky had a way 
Ricky was a stubborn kid 
He showed it every day 
But he didn't yell 
And he didn't fight 
Instead of starting arguments 
Ricky would take flight 
Oh - He hasn't done is yet but he just might 
Hey - Ricky takes flight tonight 
Escape - Time to get away 
Take leave from his fears 
And now he's in the clear 
Bitten by the belt 
And lashed by the tongue 
But through all his problems 
He looks out for number one 
When he doesn't like 
Whatever's going on 
He knows that he can just walk off 
He'll calm down before too long
