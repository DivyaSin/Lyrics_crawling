Did You see that I was hurt? 
Did You know that You had left me crying there? 
Now I'm holding all Your words 
Close till You feel this pain too, yeah You live on so unaware 
While I thought somehow this hate would heal me 
But this hate is never ending and it's only killing me 
Oh, sweet revenge, you lied again I find I can't get free 
'Till I release this vengeance that I seek 
Forgive You, the only thing 
I wanna live, I'm ready to be free, to be free Maybe you've been wounded too 
Maybe all this is Your self protection 
And all the hurts You thought were hidden 
Are the ones now hurting me 
So, who will make this patter end? I find I can't get free 
Till I release this vengeance that I seek 
Forgive You, the only thing 
I wanna live, I'm ready to Break these chains 
Won't see this through 
'Cause setting You free 
Will mean my freedom too, freedom too, oh I find I can't get free 
Till I release this vengeance that I seek 
Forgive You, the only thing 
I wanna live, I'm ready to be free, to be free
