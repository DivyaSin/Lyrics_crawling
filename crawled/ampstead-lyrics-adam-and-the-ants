Oh well Hampstead is a place and not for revolution 
I was down the fetchin' knocking two bits of wood together 
I seen you pounce around see you looking in the mirror 
Your mummy drives a mini and I didn't have a telephone You're deprived of being deprived x3 If you talk you have to do 
And I changed the line for your Maxie 
I seen you pounce around see you looking in the mirror 
Your mummy drives a mini and I didn't have a telephone You're deprived of being deprived x9
