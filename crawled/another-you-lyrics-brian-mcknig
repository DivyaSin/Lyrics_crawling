If I traveled all around the world 
I know what I would find 
Someone half as smart 
Someone half as sweet Half as lovely and half as kind if I was the one 
A kingdom with a wholesome wife to choose 
It wouldn't even quite compare 
To what I've got right here with you 
So if I stumble just a bit trying to say what's on my mind? 
Please excuse me cause I never felt the way that I feel inside It's possible 
I may have finally have found my dream come true 
There can never be another you 
The stars are bright tonight 
They know you are mine ooh mine 
I knew that it would be alright when my other dreams fell through 
And for this very night I've waited all my life 
Standing straight and tall I give my all to you 
So please excuse me if I 
Stumbled just a bit 
Trying to say what's on my mind 
Please excuse me cause I never felt the way that I feel inside 
It's possible
