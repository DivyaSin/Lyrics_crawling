If you were gone the moon would lose it's brightness 
Without your smile the finch will sing no more 
And once in a while some waves would said with sadness 
Remember to lovers walking by the shore If you were gone the days would all be pointless 
And in the night I'll sing the song so blue 
A song about spring and every happy moment 
When I had all the time along with you [Chorus:] 
But you are here and nothing could be better 
So take my hand and stay with me to dark 
And will the wind is playing with your sweater 
I can't imagine life if you were gone... But you are here and nothing could be better 
So take my hand and stay with me to dark 
And will the wind is playing with your sweater 
I can't imagine life if you were gone... If you were gone the world would lose it's meaning 
Without your love how could I smile again 
And though the sun would always keep on shining 
I'd never shine without my dearest friend [Chorus:] 
But you are here and nothing could be better 
So take my hand and stay with me to dark 
And will the wind is playing with your sweater 
I can't imagine life if you were gone...
