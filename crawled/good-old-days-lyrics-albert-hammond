And all the sad young men parading through their lives 
The girls that they have loved have now become expensive wives. 
They think they know it all and in someways they do 
They're reaching out for better times if they only knew. These are the good old days this is the best time of my life. 
The best I've ever known and it won't ever be the same again. 
These are the good old days and when my clothes are out of style 
And life is slowing down I'll know what I have done. While all the sad young men go marching off to war 
The old men shake their heads and say we've seen it all before. 
But how are they to know the lesson takes so long 
And by the time you've found the answer life is almost gone. 
These are the good old days this is the best time of my life . . .
