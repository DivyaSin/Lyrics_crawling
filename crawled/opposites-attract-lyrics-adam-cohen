Everything I say and do and think 
You seem to disagree 
Admit it, babe 
Everything you needed to be happy 
Was a mystery 
I didn't get it babe 
They say that opposites attract 
I don't know about that I don't wanna be the one to tell you 
That you've lost your mind 
'Cause so have I 
You don't have to be the one 
To tell me that I'm outta line 
My perfect Valentine 
They say that opposites attract 
I'm not sure about that One more night of shouting 
One more broken glass 
If we could see ourselves 
Through someone else's eyes 
Even we would laugh Maybe there's a way we can accomplish 
The impossible 
You never know 
All that it would take is just 
An ordinary miracle 
Even though 
They say that sometimes you just snap 
And you can never get it back 
They say that opposites attract 
We'll have to see about that.
