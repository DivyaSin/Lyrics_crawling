Lady, where do you feel this life is taking you? 
Lady, what have your hopes and dreams transformed into? 
Lady, you came away from home to an unown world 
Don't look back, don't look down Lady, can you come against your destiny 
Lady, you're reasoning with things you cannot see 
Lady, you wanted to laugh at the days to come 
Don't look back, don't look down Who do you trust 
Who will you turn to 
Where will you go 
And how will you break through She's crying behind a veil of smiles 
She's wiping away the tears of strife 
She's running for her life 
No place to go Smooth was the sound of her voice 
Smooth was the touch of her hand 
Don't look back, don't look down Who do you trust 
Who will you turn to 
Where will you go 
And how will you break through Chorus
