Time and time again, 
I tell you there's no better love, than I give you, 
No matter where you go, or who you love, 
You'll never find a love like mine Lately I've been so, into you 
I can't begin to let you know 
Sweet heart, I want to show you that 
I can be more than you've ever had before Make you my everything, and you'll have one hell of a man 
I'll prove to you that I am down with you girl 
Put dimond rings on your hands 
Just let me know where we stand and 
I'll be there to care girl, I promise baby [Chorus:] 
There is just no better love 
You'll never find a love, who'll give you all the joy 
And all the things I do. 
There is just no better love, 
You can not get enough of my lovin 
Kissin and huggin Girl you know I cannot live without you for a day in my life 
No, I want you to be my wife 
Girl if we were ever apart I'd be a lonely man, 
With no one else to hold on It was deep in my heart 
To tell you the real if you would only feel what I'm feelin baby 
Just bear with me now, I'm here for your love and 
I'll be there to care girl, I promise baby [Chorus] There is no love no love baby, better than my lovin sugar 
Right on time when you need it 
Blow your mind little sweetie 
No love baby no love There is just no better love, 
You can not get enough of my lovin 
Kissin and huggin 
[Repeat x 2]
