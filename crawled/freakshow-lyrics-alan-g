FREAKSHOW Whatcha lookin at? 
It's unnatural, too sexual 
So you justify your fear 
We're disgraceful, distasteful 
But watch out - now we're here Come on inside this place 
Scandalous acts, disgrace 
Locked in these cages, Guess who? Come see the way we do it 
Can't turn away, I knew it 
Can you resist a look or two? You don't like who we are, how we live, what we do 
Cuz we're not like you Freakshow's come to town 
Turns your stomach upside down, we're 
Wild unbridled beasts 
Come onstage for the Freakshow Our crazy circus 
Just ignore the way you hurt us 
Judge our lives although 
We're all part of the Freakshow It's unnatural, too sexual 
So you justify your fear 
We're outrageous, contagious 
But watch out - now we're here Are you repulsed by us 
Unnatural, We're just 
Animals, slaves to our lust Don't like the way we love 
Condemn us with disgust 
Thank you, but we've had enough You hate 
Who we are, how we live, what we do 
We're just not like you Freakshow's come to town 
Turns your stomach upside down, we're 
Wild unbridled beasts 
Come onstage for the Freakshow Our crazy circus 
Just ignore the way you hurt us 
Judge our lives although 
We're all part of the Freakshow Can your fun house mirror hide your hatred for our truth 
Do you think it's possible the freak just might be you, you, you
