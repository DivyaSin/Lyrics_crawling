Hey, you got a face like a Labrador 
I don't mind, that's what I'm here for 
The angel Gabriel sent me 
To give you a little bit of sympathy I'm gonna take you down to Harley Street Such a shame you had that crash 
That will teach you to drive flash 
And a lorry hit you at full power 
Your blood gushing like a shower Plastic surgery, it's so plastic 
Plastic surgery, fantastic 
(And you better take me away) Well, you might have to sell your car 
And your parent's brand new house 
You lie awake and lose your sleep 
Baby, miracles do not come cheap Well, you can have a brand new nose 
Light blue eyes or even hazel 
A little ear will be much better 
When you are a real go getter Don't go sitting in the sun 
Your new face might start to run 
Just forget your makeup scheme 
Clean your face with Mr. Sheen
