You're not listening 
So why should I talk to you? 
Why should I understand? 
Why should I follow through? Out of luck, out of time 
Out of hopelessness 
And sleepless nights ahead Not asking for this strange situation 
Not asking for this trite vaccination 
Not asking for this genius complication 
Are you loving or leaving or lying 
Or dying away, oh no, oh no? You're not listening 
Oh, why should I talk to you? 
Why should I understand? 
Why should I follow through? Out of luck, out of time 
Out of hopelessness 
And sleepless nights ahead Not asking for this strange situation 
Not asking for this trite vaccination 
Not asking for this genius complication 
Are you loving or leaving or lying 
Or dying away, oh, oh, yeah, oh? You're not listening 
Oh, not listening 
You're not listening 
So why should I talk, no? Out of luck, out of time 
Out of hopelessness Not asking for this strange situation 
Not asking for this trite vaccination 
Not asking for this genius complication 
Are you loving or leaving or lying 
Or dying away, oh, oh, oh? Oh, I've got to get the hell out of here 
Get my shit off the ground, knock this place down 
So far, far away, I just bleed don't ask me to repeat So long 
So, so long 
Oh, so long, yeah 
Oh no, oh
