Love is quite a feeling 
Love is so appealing 
Come this Friday night 
Everything will be uptight 
I've got plans baby 
that's out of sight 
yeah 
Maybe we can slip away 
and take a lovers holiday 
try not to overstay but if we feel it's okay 
maybe we can slip away 
and we can love til the break of day 
I don't care what the people say 
we'll just go on our way 
Love is reassuring 
Love is long enduring 
This we can't deny 
We won't even try 
It's a rule baby for you and I 
Maybe we can slip away 
and take a lovers holiday 
try not to overstay but if do it's okay...Baby 
baby we can slip away 
take a lover lover's holiday 
but try not to overstay 
but if we do it's okay 
(baby) 
Take a lover's holiday 
(baby) Fade out
