Your voice that sounded soft and sweet 
Your manners knocked me off my feet 
Infatuation made me blind 
Today I know you are someone else 
Than the one I keep in my mind So now you think I'm yours 
And you don't have to try 
Seems nothing I do is right How dare you talk to me like that 
If you're not careful I'll get mad 
How dare you talk to me like that 
Let this be a warning You made me hope we'd live a dream 
But now you make me want to scream 
Poetic style turned into prose 
This gentleman that once I knew 
I wonder if it was really you 
'Cause now you think I'm yours 
And you don't have to try 
Seems nothing I do is right How dare you talk to me like that 
If you're not careful I'll get mad 
How dare you talk to me like that 
Let this be a warning Now you think I'm yours 
And you don't have to try 
Seems nothing you do is right How dare you talk to me like that 
If you're not careful I'll get mad 
How dare you talk to me like that 
Let this be a warning 
Let this be a warning 
Let this be a warning 
Let this be a warning 
Let this be a warning How dare you talk to me like that 
How dare you talk to me like that 
How dare you talk to me like that 
How dare you talk to me like that 
How dare you talk to me like that
