Swingline throughout the backyards of the midwest 
Lean back, baby, in your seat on the train 
Look through the window pane Look at that kid over there with no underwear 
And a silly dog who doesn't care 
His mother stretches to reach the clothes line 
While a mean neighbor leans on the population sign Non-stop through the backyards of the midwest 
Eavesdrop, baby, from your seat on the train 
Look through the window pane Some kinda buick left in a stream 
It used to be somebody's' dream 
A town stares at the summer heat waves 
Past a smooth afternoon, 
Ready to close for the day
