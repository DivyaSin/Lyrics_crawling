I'll tell you a story but you won't listen 
It's about a nightmare steeped in tradition 
It's the story of a coked-up pansy 
Who spends his nights in flights of fancy Met two fellas over Gin and mixers 
They talked for a while and soon got the picture 
One was a souped up Soho mincer 
And the other was a pikey with a knowledge for scripture Then the conversation turned evil 
(Evil) 
Talked, talked and talked about people 
Why did you do it to so many people? Stumble left out of the boozer 
[Unverified] 
Another life 
[Unverified] 
And looking alright 
[Unverified] That girl's out, way ahead of the game 
Way ahead of the game 
Way ahead of the game You've turned your back upon her 
One too many times 
Spent all her hard earned money 
Getting high she sang (Kate Moss) 
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful 
Is she more beautiful than me? 
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful 
Is she more beautiful than me? She's La Belle Et La Bete at the ball 
La Belle Et La Bete at the ball 
La Belle Et La Bete at the ball 
[Unverified] You've turned your back upon her 
One too many times 
Spent all her hard earned money 
Just getting high, she sang (Kate Moss) 
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful 
Is she more beautiful than me? 
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful 
Is she more beautiful than me? Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful 
Is she more beautiful than she? I'll tell you a story but you won't listen
