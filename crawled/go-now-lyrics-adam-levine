So here we are 
We've got another chance for life 
It's what you want 
I can see it in your eyes 
You see so clear 
It's coming into light 
Go on, be wrong 
'cause tomorrow you'll be right Don't sit around and talk it over 
You're running out of time 
Just face ahead 
No going back now (ohhhh) You're gone 
So far 
Now see you couldn't all the ties 
Your eyes, go on 
Keep running for your life 
Make up your mind 
No going back now 
See it all come falling down 
You try so hard to figure out 
Just what it's all about 
You'll find it on, and on, and on 
For what you know it's true 
And I say go on and on and on 
Do all what you can do We're never gonna go 
If we don't go now 
You're never gonna know 
If you don't find out 
You're never going back 
Never turning around 
You're never gonna go 
If you don't go now 
You're never gonna grow 
If you don't grow now 
You're never gonna know 
If you don't find out 
You're never going back 
Never turning around 
You're never gonna go 
If you don't go now (ohhhh) 
Yeah! 
Ooohhhh! 
Ohhh You're never gonna go 
If you don't go now 
You're never gonna know 
If you don't find out 
You're never turning back 
Never turning around 
You're never gonna go 
If you don't go now
