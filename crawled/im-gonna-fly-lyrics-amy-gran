All of my friends are happy to stay 
Here in this yard day after day 
But something inside me has called me away 
I don't understand but I know I can't stay I'm gonna fly, no one knows where 
But I'm gonna fly, I'm lighter than air 'Cause I have felt for the first time, I can be myself 
No more faces to hide behind 
Just a smile and a dream that's mine 
And even if I am the only one who wants to fly I'm gonna fly, no one knows where 
But I'm gonna fly, I soar through the air 'Cause all my life seems I've waited for the time to start 
Being the person inside of me unafraid of being me 
No more faces to hide behind 
Just a smile and a dream that's mine 
And even if I'm the only one who wants to fly If I had my life to live over again 
I'd run bare foot, relax a bit more 
And I'd talk to more children 
And I'd learn how they laugh 
And I'd teach them how I've learned to fly I'm gonna fly, no one knows where 
But I'm gonna fly, I'm lighter than air 
I'm gonna fly, no one knows where 
But I'm gonna fly, I soar through the air 'Cause all my life seems I've waited for the time to start 
Being this person inside of me unafraid of being me 
Even if I'm the only one who wants to fly I'm gonna fly
