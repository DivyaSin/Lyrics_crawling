I can't tie my laces 
I don't play the flute 
My car is an automatic 
I can't paint my nails 
I never applaud 
I'm not very good at Twister 
And when my laptop crashes 
I can't even press control-alt-delete 
Cos I've got one hand Hello can I speak to an emergency physician? 
I have here a patient in a terrible condition 
He's vomiting up blood and he'll soon need a mortician 
Haematemesis 
Bleurgh Look at your skin, look at its off-white hue, 
Look at your eyeballs too, 
They've gone all yellow 
You came to me, you thought you had the flu. 
I knew that wasn't true. 
You wouldn't be yellow 
We took some blood off you 
That's just a thing we do 
To folks who turn yellow 
You're yellow like the desert in damascus is 
You're yellow cos your liver has metastases 
Do you know you're really f**cked you know 
You're really f**ked you know I would jog and I'd start rowing, 
Every day you'd see me going to the park and to the gym 
I'd go drinking in the pub and every evening I'd go clubbing 
If I only had some limbs 
I would learn to play the trumpet 
Cos just sitting on my stump it tends to make my life quite grim 
I'm content but I'd be more so if I wasn't just a torso 
If I only had some limbs 
Oh I just sit and cry, a quadruple amputee 
I just hang around all day and watch TV 
But that's the life of quadrapleg-ics 
I'd play cards and I'd play scrabble, 
Not just spend my days imagining a life where I had shins 
Cos I've never had a date, hell I can't even masturbate 
Oh if I only had some limbs How can you just walk away from here? 
How rude can a doctor be? 
You're the orthopaedic registrar and we've been here since 3 
You're the only one that we've been waiting for 
So take a look at my nan 
I think she's got a broken hip 
We found her in the bathroom on the floor 
You know I think she must have slipped 
Take a look at my nan 
The casualty doctor stated 
One leg is shorter than the other 
And it's externally rotated 
Well take a look at my nan 
Don't you know how long we've waited? 
And if you can't fix her, then DNR 
And can we have her cremated? I'm pushing 83 and the trust are telling me to retire 
I never take a history or consent 
My post-op survival rate should be higher 
In fact it's only 6 per cent 
We work at Denmark Hill for the terminally ill patients 
But they're relatively well when they arrive 
Cos I invent my own operations 
And I'm the only one who leaves theatre alive 
We're consultants, we're consultants at King's 
We're consultants at King's Do you feel any better? 
Or do you feel the same? 
We've done your operation now 
And you've just yourself to blame 
Now you've got 1 lung, 1 eye, 
1 knee below your 1 thigh 
We've removed your left hand side 
And you're all right now I get in the way 
I don't know what to do or say 
But I go in night and day 
Vainly hoping someone will teach me 
They say not today 
Practice taking blood, okay 
Me on take (Me on take) 
Me on take (Me on take) 
Me on take 
Take me home
