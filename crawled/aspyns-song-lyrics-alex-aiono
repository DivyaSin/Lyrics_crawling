You are the light I'd like to wake up to 
There's not a sun that rises sweeter than you do 
The moment my eyes caught the sight of you 
I was surrounded by these feelings I never knew Never knew it'd be nights alone in my car 
Just me, you, the stars and moon 
Didn't think I would share so much of this heart but now it's been built for two No, I don't see myself with anyone else 
Nobody else, but you Uuuuh 
Ooooh 
Uuuuh 
Ooooh You are the light I'd like to wake up to 
There's not a sun that rises sweeter than you do 
The moment my eyes caught the sight of you 
I was surrounded by these feelings I never knew Never knew it'd be years to keep in the tears away from your soft green eyes 
Didn't think it'd be walks to sunset and talks of love 'cause it just felt right Now I don't see myself being anywhere else 
Then kneeling to you tonight Uuuuh 
Ooooh 
Uuuuh How long would it take 
How long would it take us 
To find eternity 
There's nothing I want more 
Than you eternally 
So how long would it take 
To make this heart complete You are the light I'd like to wake up to 
There's not a sun that rises sweeter than you do Every day since our eyes met 
I just couldn't wait 
Couldn't wait to spend forever here with you
