You came with smiles and gifts of sweet word 
You came with lies and tainted whispers 
My innocence you dragged across the floor 
Now you look at me as you would upon a whore (Chorus) 
I learned me lesson once, I dont have to learn twice 
You get stepped on once, its a cure for life 
You took my heart once, youll not take it again 
Im stronger now, was weaker then 
Im stronger now, was weaker then Your touch was soft but it burned my skin 
Your kiss was sweet, bitter from within 
Your grin was wide for it had to hide 
Your black and blue nature, which I despise (Chorus) 
I learned me lesson once, I dont have to learn twice 
You get stepped on once, its a cure for life 
You took my heart once, youll not take it again 
Im stronger now, was weaker then 
Im stronger now, was weaker then You taught me well the art of pain 
Dont shed your tears - I know your game 
What once you had now is lost 
You were free with your anger, now suffer the cost! You think Im bad, well thats okay 
You think youre good, but I refuse to play 
I dont move back, I press on though 
You can follow me home, but I wont follow you (Chorus) 
I learned me lesson once, I dont have to learn twice 
You get stepped on once, its a cure for life 
You took my heart once, youll not take it again 
Im stronger now, was weaker then 
Im stronger now, was weaker then
