Girl, sometimes it seems to me 
That I don't say the things I should, to you, I act like I'm no good 
You wait for me patiently 
This house is not a home without you, it takes two hearts to share Your eyes will always see through me, and bring me to my knees 
And I will always turn to you, you're everything I need And through the good and bad times, you have always been there 
We hold each other close, you tell me it's alright 
The nights we fight about it, never dream of giving up 
That's the price of love Look, sometimes it makes us cry 
Forgive me when I get it wrong, sometimes it's hard to be that strong 
And oh, I would do anything 
For you I'd turn the stars around, I'd find a way somehow This time, you see I built a bridge to you again 
Love shines, we'll sweep away the past 
We're more than lovers, more than friends And through the good and bad times, you have always been there 
We hold each other tight, you tell me it's alright 
The nights we fight about it, never think of giving up 
That's the price of love Your eyes will always see through me, and bring me to my knees 
And I will always turn to you, you're everything I need And through the good and bad times, you have always been there 
We hold each other close, you tell me it's alright 
And sometimes I can't give enough, that's the price of love That's the price of love, that's the price of love 
That's the price of love... Come on everybody 
Come on everybody One-two-one-two 
One-one-one-one-one 
One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock 
Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock 
Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock rock 
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight 
Put your glad rags on and join me hon 
We're gonna have some fun when the clock strikes one 
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight 
We're gonna rock rock rock until the broad daylight 
We're gonna rock gonna rock around the clock tonight Rock, rock, rock everybody 
Roll, roll, roll everybody

Rocking with the beat W-w-w-w-wake up, little Suzie, wake up 
Wake up, little Suzie, wake up 
We've both been sound asleep 
Wake up little Suzie and weep 
The movie's over it's four o'clock 
And we're in trouble deep 
Wake up little Suzie 
Wake up little Suzie 
We gotta go home You ain't nothing but a hound dog 
Crying all the time 
You ain't nothing but a hound dog 
Crying all the time 
Well you ain't never caught a rabbit 
And you ain't no friend of mine Shake-shake-shake-shake, rattle and roll 
I said shake, rattle and roll 
I said shake, rattle and roll 
I said shake, rattle and roll A-well-a bless my soul 
What's wrong with me? 
I'm itching like a man 
On a fuzzy tree 
My friends say I'm acting 
Wild as a bug 
I'm in love 
I'm all shook up The warden threw a party in the county jail 
The prison band was there and they began to wail 
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing 
You should have heard them knocked out jailbirds sing 
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock 
Everybody in the whole cell block was dancing to the Jail house Rock A-ah-ah-ah 
A-ah-ah-ah 
A-ah-ah-ah 
At the hop, hop, hop-hop-hop Love come quick 
Love come in a hurry 
There are thieves in the temple tonight They don't care where they kick 
Just as long as they hurt you 
There are thieves in the temple tonight Love if you're there come save me 
From all this cold despair 
I can hang when you're around 
But I'll surely die 
If you're not there Love come quick 
Love come in a hurry 
There are thieves in the temple tonight I feel like I'm looking for my soul (Soul) 
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold) 
There are thieves in the temple tonight Voices from the sky say rely on your best friend to pull you through 
But even if I wanted 2 I couldn't really truly 'cause my only friend is you Come on There are thieves in the temple tonight Kicking me in my heart, tearing me all apart 
(Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart) 
'Cause me and you could have been a work of art 
Thieves in the temple Baby don't you know I'm holding on 
The best that I can 
Love please help me be 
The better man Better than the thieves in the temple 
In the temple tonight Oh, thieves in the temple (Tonight) tonight 
Hurt me Love come quick 
Love come in a hurry 
There are thieves in the temple tonight Thieves in the temple you said you loved me! (Thieves in the temple) 
you said I was your friend! (Thieves in the temple) 
you were supposed to take care of me! (Love come quick) {Thieves in the 
Temple} 
you lie! Love come (Lie!) In a hurry (Lie!) Thieves in the temple tonight You got a smile so bright 
You know you could've been a candle. 
I'm holding you so tight 
You know you could've been a handle. 
The way you swept me off my feet 
You know you could've been a broom 
And baby you smell so sweet 
You know you could've been some perfume Well you could've been anything 
That you wanted to, I can tell 
The way you do the things you do, alright. 
The way you do the things you do. As pretty as you are 
You know you could've been a flower 
If good looks were minutes 
You know you could've been an our 
The way you stole my heart 
You know you could've been a crook 
And baby you're so smart 
You know you could've been a schoolbook Well you could've been anything 
That you wanted to, I can tell 
The way you do the things you do, alright. 
The way you do the things you do. You make my life so rich 
You know you could've been some money 
And baby you're so sweet 
You know you could've been some honey
