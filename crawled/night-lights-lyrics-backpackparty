Sleeping in cheap hotels 
Filled up with oyster shells 
We don't get overwhelmed 
The window panes make shelves Evening paints out the sky 
Guest list is satisfied 
Bright Crimson floating high from snaps electric eyes 
Streets are like coffee pots, they'll never stop us watch 
Hang gliding to the docks 
Red lights we never walk 
Get stung by jellyfish, an open ended ditch 
Of anything we'd miss the scale of the Brooklyn Bridge Night lights beach houses awkward decision 
That leave us on top of the moon 
August is endless and I am so friendless 
We'll leave and they won't have a clue 
Drive by sightings who think that they'll find us 
It's not hard to trust me alright 
August is endless and I am so friendless 
We're leaving the city tonight Sugar dissolves our well 
Feel like we've never felt 
Win contests never held 
We'll make ideas melt High tide is rolling in so we step back a bit 
Creatures become our friends they go of fear again 
Reasoning poltergeist aquamarine in white 
Guess we don't sleep at night lets change this tired life Echoes of solitude these walls are talking too 
Chasing the afternoon of sunset avenue Night lights beach houses awkward decision 
That leave us on top of the moon 
August is endless and I am so friendless 
We'll leave and they won't have a clue 
Drive by sightings you think that they'll find us 
It's not hard to trust me alright 
August is endless and I am so friendless 
We're leaving the city tonight Question the answers they don't matter 
Throw 'em all right out the door 
Switch direction for protection because we're not running anymore 
These changing autumn leaves are filling me with everything I need 
To open up will subtle circuitry and bring me to my knees We're searching alleyways to find out where the end is, at the start 
It's not a shallow place it's leading to the same one as my heart 
We'll take a trolley down and hopefully the coast is looking clear 
Cause if it's not we'll have to sit a bit and wait right here The sky is crashing down the ground is rising up and I am torn 
Between the canopies of falling trees and ozone but I swore 
If we're ever to imagine It would be a different scene 
Only if you can distinguish what I meant from what I mean Night lights beach houses awkward decision 
That leave us on top of the moon 
August is endless and I am so friendless 
We'll leave and they won't have a clue 
Drive by sightings you think that they'll find us 
It's not hard to trust me alright 
August is endless and I am so friendless 
We're leaving the city tonight
