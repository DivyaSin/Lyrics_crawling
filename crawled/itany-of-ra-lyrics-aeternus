I am one of you 
A vulture I have been 
The falcon is my face 
You'll see that I am more I am one of all 
All that we see as sacred 
They are all in me 
All of mans divinties Deceased I am from the mortal world 
Yet I resurrect in the depths below 
I am many 
My limbs are gods From horus of the neverworld 
To the weary of the heart 
The mistress of the western desert 
Nurtures me with the strength I need The gods have themselves 
Transformed into my body 
I am entirelya god 
No limb of mine is without god I enter as a god 
I exit as a god
