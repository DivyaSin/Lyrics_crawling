Somethin happens when you touch me 
I get open, and my legs starts quivering 
This sensation, emotions take control of me 
Its a temptation, i don't knows what's come over me Yeah baby, tonights the night 
Ima ride that thing like a motor bike 
Grab my waist and hold it tight, I'm not frontin 
You think i bought a box of Lifestyle for nothin 
Please i got blunts you supply the weed 
I'm the best so baby keep yo eyes on me 
Its about time i get mine nigga I'm ready 
And sex ain't the bomb if the girl is sweaty Listen ma, we been chillin out for a minute 
And right now I'm in the mood to straight hit it 
We know enough about each other, i been patient 
Look, but every nigga got his limits 
I'm tired of waitin, i feel like tonight is the night 
To get Bucky Ball naked and make love all night 
You ain't gotta worry bout me bustin in quick seconds 
I can handle mine plus I'm young and energetic, you ready [Chorus]

[Babs] Yeah daddy i know you want it 'cause its extra tight 
[Ness] Yeah mommy I'm gon make sure its extra right
