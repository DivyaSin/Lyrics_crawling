Settling along the scenery, beneath the steady fall 
The dusk accompannnies a loneliness, descending as snow 
Tears can drown the embers in this broken heart of mine 
Another portrait in my life watching the seasons passing by Crystallizing every breath I take, even the subtle sighs 
The wind carries a solemn melody through uncovered trees 
At the red brick station the trains can catch their breath 
And I've been patient, waiting for someone who won't come back to me Tonight the tears will go away, I'll find a way to play this Serenade 
How can I break this song away from my emotions 
The snow is falling down to kiss and help me reminisce and celebrate 
My tears are falling from the sky and turn to White Love chorous: 
By the time the bells are swinging in their rhythmic symphony 
Imagining a dreamy Winterland is where I will be 
Angels all around, floating slowly from the sky 
And bring a look of tenderness only the spring can show me how So I'll be holding on strong and keep from going on to Loneliness 
The glistening angels in the sky are waiting for me 
And I will wish upon a star and carry in my heart for Foreverness 
These tears eventually will frost and turn to White Love chrous: 
Tonight the tears will go away, I'll find a way to play this Serenade 
How can I break this song away from my emotions 
Give me one chance so I can shine and reminisce the time and celebrate 
My tears are falling from the sky and turn to White Love White Love 2x 
My Love I just want to hold you 
Cant't be without you 
I'm calling out your name 
In my heart
