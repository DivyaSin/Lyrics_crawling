My mama told me not to play the guitar 
Stuck in a bottle neck you won't get far 
Hanging around with your sleeping in friends 
Elegant women, here I go again 
My mama told me early to bed 
Early to rise is what she said 
My mama told me to play the six string 
My mama told me but here I go again 
My mama told me go to church when 
I'm able And never live a moment of sin 
My mama told me not to gamble at the table 
Daddy said I gotta win win win win 
My mama told me not to play the guitar 
See the world but you won't get far 
Hanging around with your pool hall friends 
Loose women aah here I go again
