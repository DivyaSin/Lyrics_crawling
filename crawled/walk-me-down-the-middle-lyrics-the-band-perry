I was meant to be by your side 
And I have waited here a long time 
For you to turn around and notice me 
But now you're here holdin' hands with me Walk me down the middle of the county fair 
Walk me down the middle like you don't care 
Walk me by the Ferris wheel and make sure that she sees 
Let the whole world know you belong to me I've heard about your bitter end 
'Bout how she stole your heart and put it back again 
Well I may not be the prettiest girl around 
But I sure am a sight for sore, sore eyes Walk me down the middle of main street 
Walk me down where the whole town will be 
I don't need no parade but make sure that she sees 
Let the whole world know you belong to me I'd walk through fire for you 
Walk through barbed wire for you 
I'd walk for miles, it's true 
Just to be with you If you'll walk me down the middle of my mama's church 
Walk me down that aisle in your finest shirt Let the whole world know 
You will walk me down the middle of the county fair 
Oh walk me down the middle like you don't care 
Walk me by the Ferris wheel and make sure they all see 
Let the whole world know you belong to me
