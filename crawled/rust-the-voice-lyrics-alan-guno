Many lives, many lives walk in fear of the night 
Many dreams, many dreams fallen far from the light 
But the truth wont hide for very long 
And your faith cant be denied 
And the Words of He who speaks wont be defied Trust the Voice you hear inside your heart 
Trust the Voice that leads you through lifes harder parts 
Be strong though you dont always want to 
Courage wont be far 
Trust the Voice that guides you through the dark, through the dark Many days, many days leave us lost and confused 
Many times, we cant see the path that is true 
But no sooner or no later 
Than the time thats truly right 
Will the wisdom of His Plan be brought to light Trust the Voice you hear inside your heart 
Trust the Voice that leads you through lifes harder parts 
Be strong though you dont know His answers 
Though the goals still far 
Trust the Voice that guides you through the dark, through the dark Can you stand with conviction in your soul? 
Will you speak with the words of Hope? Trust the Voice you hear inside your heart 
Trust the Voice that leads you through lifes harder parts 
Be strong though you dont always want to 
Courage wont be far 
Trust the Voice that guides you through the dark Trust the Voice you hear inside your heart 
Trust the Voice that leads you through lifes harder parts 
Be strong though you dont know His answers 
Though the goals still far 
Trust the Voice that guides you through the dark, through the dark Just trust the voice thats in your heart 
Just trust the voice
