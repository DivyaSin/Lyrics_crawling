Puppy prints in the white sand 
A hungry dog all alone 
Our little hero looks to the night sky 
Cuz hes needing a home Follows a star for a dream still unknown 
A family of his own Hes a beagle in Bethlehem 
And hes here to follow his star 
Doesnt even know how or when 
But he knows that it could be far 
Even when darker times have begun 
Destiny calls to the humblest one 
So little beagle in Bethlehem 
Dont give up, Your journey aint done Joseph works all day for his family 
Times in the city are tough 
And Mary sits with her only baby 
But maybe three aint enough One special night came a noise from outside 
Four paws appeared in the light Little Beagle in Bethlehem 
I dont know why youre at my door 
It seems that youre lost and homeless now 
But our familys simple and poor 
And though our home is small, that is true 
Maybe one more will help us get through 
Oh Little Beagle in Bethlehem 
Tell me what are we gonna do Just one night 
One night can comfort an orphan, a stray 
Just one light 
Can show a mother the way 
Home is love 
Miracles find a benevolent soul 
Just one pup 
Can make a family whole 
This blessed familys now whole Little Beagle in Bethlehem 
Im not sure what God means to do 
I dont even know why youre here 
But our familys waiting for you 
Youll be a gift to our baby son 
You will become His best friend, little one 
So Little Beagle in Bethlehem 
Come on in, your journey is done Hes a beagle in Bethlehem 
Hes a pup who followed his star 
Now hes here with his family 
And their love will never be far 
And on the nights when he feels alone 
Little Jesus holds on to the pup thats his own 
So little Beagle in Bethlehem 
Sleep in peace, youre finally home Little Beagle in Bethlehem 
Youre finally home
