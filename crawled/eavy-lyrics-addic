Rejoice for what is coming 
Smile for we are one 
You are part of my future 
And that's as bright as they come In your company I'm quickened 
I move inwards when we speak 
We're all heavy with instruction 
We're all fragile in defeat I know the measure of a good man 
You were the first to qualify 
All that's ever had potential 
To be beautiful you and I
