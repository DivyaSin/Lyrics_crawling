I've known mornings white as diamonds 
Silent from a night so cold 
Such a stillness, calm as the owl glides 
Our lives are buried in snow, oh, oh I was sifting through the piles 
In my hand a tangled thread 
Each patient tug upon the snarl 
Is a glimpse of what has been, oh, oh Burdened bands gain strong hands 
Gaping holes where diamonds should be 
Must have been the morning that stole them 
A glint of white in the pocket of winter, oh, oh And some hearts are ghosts settling down in dark waters 
Just as silt grows heavy and drowns with the stones 
Some hearts are ghosts settling down in dark waters 
Just as silt grows heavy and drowns with the stones, oh, oh
