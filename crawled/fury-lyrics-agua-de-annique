Darling hear me I'm in this state of mind 
Adore me till twelve, but there's something going on 
I feel like I'm changing, a new woman coming out Forget the old me 
I'm fury doubt a doubt Look at me, God is the only one who knows where I'd be 
if you weren't with me 
Stay with me, God is the only one who knows what I'd do 
if you hadn't set me free Darling tempt me, and see what happens next 
Let me surprise you, there is no second best 
I feel like I'm changing, a new woman coming out Forget the old me 
I'm fury doubt a doubt Look at me, God is the only one who knows where I'd be 
if you weren't with me 
Stay with me, God is the only one who knows what I'd do 
if you hadn't set me free Look at me, God is the only one who knows where I'd be 
if you weren't with me 
Stay with me, God is the only one who knows what I'd do 
if you hadn't set me free
