Oh, did I strike the chord of honesty in you? 
Did I strike it hard enough? 
A bout of lust between true love 
My heart it cries with every lie 
Did I strike the chord of honesty in you? In the vane of my submission 
I dreaded everything 
What lucky fate lies waiting 
For this troubadour of mercy, tell me Oh, did I strike the chord of honesty in you? 
Did I strike it hard enough? 
A bout of lust between true love 
My heart it cries with every lie 
Did I strike the chord of honesty in you? 
Did I, baby? Did Cupid pluck my strings with fingers? 
Strumming through my heart like thunder 
Maybe if you knew 
I bet you'd write this song for me Oh, would you strike it gently? 
Oh, would you strike it mighty? 
My heart it cries with every lie 
Did I strike the chord of honesty in you? 
Baby Oh, is this life or a test of endurance? 
I'm durable but am I able, am I wanting? 
Do I need to strike this chord in you? 
Do I need to see the truth? Oh, did I strike the chord of honesty in you? 
Did I strike it hard enough? 
A bout of lust between true love 
My heart it cries with every lie, oh Did I strike the chord of honesty in you? 
Did I strike it hard enough? 
A bout of lust between true love 
My heart it cries with every lie 
Did I strike the chord of honesty in you?
