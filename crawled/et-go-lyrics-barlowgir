Yeah I trust in you 
I remember times you lead me, 
This time it's bigger now, 
And I'm afraid you'll let me down. 
But how can I be certain? 
Will you prove yourself again 'Cause I'm about to let go and live what I believe 
I can't do a thing now, 
But trust that you'll catch me 
When I let go, when I let go What is this doubt in me 
Convincing me to fear the unknown, 
When all along you've shown, 
Your plans are better than my own, 
And I know I won't make it, 
if I do this all alone 'Cause I'm about to let go and live what I believe 
I can't do a thing now 
But trust that you'll catch me, 
When I let go, let go 
When I let go, let go 
When I let go, let go
