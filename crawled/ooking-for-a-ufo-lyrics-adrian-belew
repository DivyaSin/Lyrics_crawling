I'm looking through my telescope 
Looking for a ufo 
I'm looking through my telescope 
Searching for a ray of hope 
To come out of this dark night 
I hope they understand wrong from right 
And maybe they can show us 
How to clean up our mess I'm looking through my telescope 
Looking for a ufo 
I wonder what they see on earth 
Do they see the hate and hurt 
Or do they see the christmas lights and mirth 
And hear songs of peace on earth Somebody will have to fall out of the sky 
Somebody to show us how to survive 
Oh, wouldn't that be nice Somebody to guide us out of this dark night 
Somebody to show us how to take hate and hurt 
And turn it into peace on earth
