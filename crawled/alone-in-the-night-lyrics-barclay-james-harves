The cold in your eyes 
Like the misty breath of a whisper 
On an ice-cold morn The cold in your face 
Like a dagger drawn 
Like a flashing blade 
In a killer blow We were never lovers 
And silently I froze within the gaze 
From your eyes 
That summer night In the dark of the night 
All alone in the night 
In the dark of the night, calling 
All alone in the night for your love In the dark of the night, crying 
All alone in the night 
I need you to hold me Timeless arrows carved through 
Broken hearts of stone 
Shadows moving slowly across the ground A cold reminder of the way 
Things used to be 
Now I feel the shadows 
Moving over me I searched in vain for love 
When true love I had found 
Like a blind man I could never see Those timeless arrows pierce my soul 
Now you're gone 
Ageless shadows closing in 
Won't let me be, only you set me free The cold in your eyes 
Like the misty breath of a whisper 
On an ice-cold morn You told me it was over 
And silently I froze within the gaze 
From your eyes 
That summer night In the dark of the night, calling 
All alone in the night, for your love 
In the dark of the night, crying 
All alone in the night for your love In the dark of the night, calling 
All alone in the night, for your love 
In the dark of the night, crying 
All alone in the night, I need you to hold me In the dark of the night, calling 
All alone in the night, for your love 
In the dark of the night, crying 
All alone in the night for your love In the dark of the night, calling 
All alone in the night, for your love 
In the dark of the night, crying 
All alone in the night, I need you to hold me In the dark of the night, calling 
All alone in the night, for your love 
In the dark of the night, crying
