So come on down and let it out 
Walk me through the corridors of fear 
It's not a dream without a doubt 
You try so hard to shut the feelings out I lie awake and watch the stars 
A cry so far from where we are 
And in the haze of shattered light 
I break from the chains and drift into the night [Chorus] 
'Cause I can't understand what's going on 
I can't understand what's going on And now it seems so long ago 
We talked for hours and missed the last train home 
But are we weightless being blown 
Far from the heart and far from all we've known? [Chorus] You said our love transcends this life 
Now I know it's true 
I cut my hands and close my eyes 
So I can feel it too I can't understand what's going on 
I can't understand what's going on
