Yeah, I know he gettin' hotter I get him hot and bothered 
So hot he needin' water 
He wanna be my everything

It's gettin' hotter 
He wanna take it farther 
But if you a'int got that paper

Die tryin' like a martyr 
He playin' that story but romance 
But baby I'm the author 
You want me in 'yo world

Oh my word Like seeing you winy anxious 
He wanna take me places 
Walks in the park to the races 
The stars and outer spaces 
After me he takes 
He tying my shoelace 
I know he hates it when I tell him 
'Baby, must be patient!' He says it's evident 
That I'm heaven sent 
But it's irrelevant 
When he's spending that precedence 
I know that he wants me 
I know that he needs me 
But it's okay to be greedy 
As long as he can please me I think it's gettin' hotter
