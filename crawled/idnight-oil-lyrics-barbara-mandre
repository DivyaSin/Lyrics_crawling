That call was from the office and I guess I'll have to burn the midnight oil again 
And hon' you know how much the boss depends on me to lend a helping hand 
I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be 
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me The girls all got together and they called to see if I could have some fun tonight 
But you know me the only thing I do is go to work and watch TV 
And I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be 
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me And tonight I'll cheat again and tomorrow I'll be sorry 
And I'll feel kind of dirty cause I'll have the midnight oil all over me 
God knows his dream would shatter if he knew the devil had me and won't set me free 
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me 
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
