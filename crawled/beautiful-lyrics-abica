It began like any other day 
Same mundane, same headache on the road for a show to play 
Got to get up, gotta get going 
Cant's in the back, blaze up he starts flowing 
Kick it off with my kind like any other show 
Before I said my line I saw her in the front row 
She's dancing looking so fine how's this song go 
Tac's like I'm just like you and I'm like I don't know Pre-Hook 
Do your dance girl 
Just give me a chance girl 
Just show me what I can do 
Just let me come closer now cuz I think I want you 
Do your dance girl 
Just give me a chance girl 
Just show me what I can do 
Just let me come closer now cuz I think I love you Chorus 
You're beautiful 
So fucking beautiful 
And I can tell by the way you move 
I'd be a little more complete if I just had you 
You're beautiful 
So fucking beautiful 
And I can tell by the way you move 
I'd be a little more complete if I just had you Damn girl well I don't mean to stare 
But I can't even help it when you call me over there 
You wanna drink, yea, just tell me what you like 
Tell me what you think what you're doing tonight 
Cuz I, need you yea you know I need your body 
It can be our secret I won't tell anybody 
So you wanna leave do you wanna make a bet 
That this will be a night that you'll never forgot Do your dance girl 
Just give me a chance girl 
Just show me what I can do 
Just let me come closer now cuz I think I want you 
Do your dance girl 
Just give me a chance girl 
Just show me what I can do 
Just let me come closer now cuz I think I need you You're beautiful 
So fucking beautiful 
And I can tell by the way you move 
I'd be a little more complete if I just had you 
You're beautiful 
So fucking beautiful 
And I can tell by the way you move 
I'd be a little more complete if I just had you Uh-oh, yo, I went a little crazy 
Got her locked up in my basement, maybe 
I'm her only man and she's my pretty lady 
I know she loves me when she screams out, save me! 
Put that song on 
I make her dance 
She doesn't have a choice it's what I call romance 
I watch her go and I'm hypnotized 
And she looks so cute with tears in her eyes Do your dance girl 
Just give me a chance girl 
Just show me what I can do 
Just let me come closer now cuz I think I love you 
Do your dance girl 
Just give me a chance girl 
Just show me what I can do 
Just let me come closer now cuz I think I need you You're beautiful 
So fucking beautiful 
And I can tell by the way you move 
I'd be a little more complete if I just had you 
You're beautiful 
So fucking beautiful 
And I can tell by the way you move 
I'd be a little more complete if I just had you
