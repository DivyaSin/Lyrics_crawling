I've been thinking lots about my life and 
How quick I'd wash it down the drain 
The past tense, the future, nothing matters now 
I act on my own, and I'm to blame Living's a wicked dream when things turn out all wrong 
We're all so weak, no matter how strong, yeah I tried running away from me, convince me that I've grown 
But I can't change so unnaturally, demons, they follow me 
I quit running away from me, convinced that I had grown 
But found out all my reasons for insanity, all a part of me I don't like that you're calling me a liar 
I don't like that you found out I'm a snake 
Been sneaking around for far too long now 
I don't like how fast my intentions fade Karma has beat me down, the worst is yet to come 
Many mistakes, and still I'm so young, yeah I tried running away from me, convince me that I've grown 
But I can't change so unnaturally, demons, they follow me 
I quit running away from me, convinced that I had grown 
But found out all my reasons for insanity, all a part of me I can't count how many times awakened in fear 
Nightly, palms sweating 
Dreams of promises I've made to no one but myself 
I've been crushed daily 
Don't lend me your hand, I can't trust myself 
So how can you trust me? We've all made selfish, bad decisions 
We've all tried dishing out the blame 
Convinced ourselves of our own actions 
My problem is, I'll never change In doubt, some good comes out, I'll fold before it's time 
Can't promise you that it's my last time, yeah I tried running away from me, convince me that I've grown 
But I can't change so unnaturally, demons, they follow me 
I quit running away from me, convinced that I had grown 
But found out all my reasons for insanity, all a part of me Truth won't help you now, all the love's gone too far, oh, oh 
Truth won't help you now, all the love's gone too far, oh, oh I'm scarred, yeah,yeah 
Demons, they follow me, cause my insanity 
I'm scarred, yeah 
Demons, they follow me, cause my insanity I'm scarred, yeah,yeah 
Demons, they follow me, cause my insanity 
I'm scarred, yeah 
Demons, they follow me, cause my insanity Demons, they follow me, cause my insanity 
Demons, they follow me, cause my insanity
