fed up to a degree - one more than i thought i'd be 
can't swallow anymore, left alone with all my greed 
complexity shouldn't be any more hard than you and me 
silence followed all my dreams you don't care anymore 
you don't care anymore 
i saw your sad eyes say it as you walked out the door 
you don't care anymore 
you don't care anymore 
i heard your bad lies spreading, i don't want any more crept up on bended knee, scuffed up what i thought i'd need 
not so innocent, we all know what you mean 
honesty shouldn't be so far for you to see 
folly followed my scheme you don't care anymore 
you don't care anymore 
i saw your sad eyes say it as you walked out the door 
you don't care anymore 
you don't care anymore 
i heard your bad lies spreading, i don't want any more one time was fine, stop to rewind 
incredulous to enlist the sympathy of my friends 
to defend all your unkind thoughts 
voracious, flirtatious, empty box of a heart-felt tragedy 
enmity can't you see, for all the empty serenity that surrounded me 
one time it was fine, one time you were mine you don't care anymore 
you don't care anymore 
i saw your sad eyes say it as you walked out the door 
you don't care anymore 
you don't care anymore 
i heard your bad lies spreading, i don't want any more
