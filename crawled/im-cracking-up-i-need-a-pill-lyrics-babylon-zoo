I am cracking up I need a pill 
I am cracking up I need a pill 
I sometimes starve myself of sleep 
It's my paranoid mind 
Strange looking demons laugh at me 
All my traumas start to infiltrate my mind I find it very hard to breath 
In my hypochondriac world 
Always poke the fun out of me 
So confused with his sexuality We've got information 
Government sweat intrepidation 
Stigmatise us all 
Consealed information 
Police crimes on Blacks and Asians 
Babylon's alone I am cracking up I need a pill 
I am cracking up I need a pill The animals are fast asleep 
Always check. They can breath 
Strange looking people laugh at me 
All their traumas start to infiltrate my mind 
We've got information 
Government sweat intrepidation 
Stigmatise us all 
Concealed information 
Police crimes on Blacks and Asians 
Babylon's alone People want an easy life 
Poeple want, hmmmm 
People want, hmmmm, hmmm
