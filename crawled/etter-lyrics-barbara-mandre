Give me a ticket for an airplane cause I ain't got a time to take a fast train 
Lonely days are gone I'm a going home my baby just wrote me a letter 
I don't care how much money I got to spend cause I got to get back to my baby again 
Lonely days are gone I'm a going home my baby just wrote me a letter Well he wrote me a letter said he couldn't live without me no more 
Hey listen Mister can't you see I've got to get back to my baby once more 
Give me a ticket for an airplane... Well he wrote me a letter... 
My baby just wrote me a letter my baby just wrote me a letter
