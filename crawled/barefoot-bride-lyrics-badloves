Let your daddy dance 
See you daddy dance 
Well I'm so entranced 
By the barefoot bride 
As she gave her hand 
And loved like no other 
Under the cover 
Of a cloudless sky 
And to our love 
I offer up 
The pink champagne 
In plastic cups 
Stole a caravan 
A gypsy caravan 
Where a gypsy man 
Could take his barefoot bride 
She never loved a man 
Or trusted a lover 
Until she discovered 
True love was alright 
We've got no plans 
Of turning back now 
This bridal train's 
On a one-way track 
And my barefoot bride 
Lying silent by my side 
With her eyes like sunrise 
Dancing on the wildflowers 
She may not say that much 
But with the warmth of her velvet touch 
She teels me our love will grow 
And to our love 
I offer up 
The pink champagne 
In plastic cups 
And my barefoot bride 
Lying silent by my side 
With her eyes like sunrise 
Dancing on the wildflowers 
She may not say that much 
But with the warmth of her velvet touch 
She tells me our love 
Yeah, I know that our love will grow
