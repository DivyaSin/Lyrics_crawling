Tell me what to say to make it go away and I'll do that 
Tell me what to do to make it up to you and I'll do that too 
Time means so much if all I have is your sweet touch 
And so it goes, and so it goes, which way I've never ever known Do I hold you back in all the ways I lack what ya need, dear 
And headed toward the end 
You were looking for a friend and that ain't me, dear 
Time means so much if all I have is your sweet touch 
And so it goes 
And so it goes, which way I'll never never know
