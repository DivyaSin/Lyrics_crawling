I want to give a pure intentions 
Speak with words of grace and judge through eyes of mercy 
I long to choose with holy wisdom and walk down paths of peace 
Taking love to every soul in need I want to leave a legacy of a servant who believed 
That the world could still be changed by just one life 
And I want to leave a legacy that years from now they'll see 
That I lived only for the cause of Christ If I could clearly see tomorrow, a humble prayer would be 
That every heart would beat with true faith 
If I could somehow shape the future 
I would hope and pray I touched lives by the way I lived today I want to leave a legacy of a servant who believed 
That the world could still be changed by just one life 
I want to leave a legacy that years from now they'll see 
That I lived only for the cause of Christ Oh, to make a difference 
By living day to day 
As a reflection of God I want to leave a legacy of a servant who believed 
That the world could still be changed by just one life 
I want to leave a legacy that years from now they'll see 
That I lived only for the cause of Christ I want to leave a legacy of a servant who believed 
That the world could still be changed by just one life 
And I want to leave a legacy that years from now they'll see 
That I lived only for the cause of Christ
