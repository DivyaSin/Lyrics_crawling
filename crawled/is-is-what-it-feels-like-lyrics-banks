I hang on everything that you say 
You know I can see all the things that imply 
You secretly are in love 
And finally when I let myself fall hard for you, I 
see you trying to pretend, like I'm making it up 
This is what it feels like 
This is what it feels like Bring it down, bring it on 
Bring it now, bring it on 
This is what it feels like now 
It's getting old 
Bring it down, bring it on Remember the first love that we made 
You said that you couldn't sleep 'cause of me 
told me, I caught you off guard 
And then when you saw I felt the same, you pulled away 
Started acting like being with me was too hard 
This is what it feels like 
This is what it feels like 
This is what it feels like Bring it down, bring it on 
Bring it now, bring it on 
This is what it feels like now 
It's getting old 
Bring it down, bring it on Bring it down, bring it on 
Bring it now, bring it on 
This is what it feels like now 
It's getting old 
Bring it down, bring it on Bring it down, bring it on 
Bring it down, bring it on 
This is what it feels like now 
It's getting old 
Bring it down, bring it on
