Don't you get this reality 
You're losing what is right, what used to be 
Don't hide your curiosity, the thing's hard to find 
I know it's in you and me Our life is going on 
Like the river flows to the ocean 
We just keep moving on 
Like the wind blows, together, being as one You're reaching the destiny 
Now you can see the light, what's meant to be 
You're getting the eternity, beyond day and night 
You know it's just you and me Our love is growing strong 
Like the rain falls to the dry ground 
We must keep going on 
Like the rainbow, forever, being as one Whenever you just call my name 
No need to care, I will be there 
Anytime we can feel each other 
Yes, we are, not alone Our life is going on 
Like the river flows to the ocean 
We just keep moving on 
Like the wind blows, together Our love is growing strong 
Like the rain falls to the dry ground 
We must keep going on 
Like the rainbow, forever, being as one
