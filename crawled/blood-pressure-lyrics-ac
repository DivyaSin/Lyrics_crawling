You keep calling me on the phone 
Why can't you just leave me alone? 
I turn around and you're always there 
Can't get away. It's just not fair. When I'm with you I have an adverse reaction 
I gotta take some evasive action 
I can't seem to keep my mind on track 
You're gonna give me a, a heart attack Blood pressure 
Blood pressure 
It's too high to measure 
My blood pressure 
Yeah, yeah, yeah... I have to admit that I think you're pretty 
You got me spinning three hundred and sixty 
You make nervous. You make my heart race. 
And suddenly I'm a basket case You got me running and trying to hide 
But I keep finding myself right by your side 
You make my heart flutter with your little sigh 
With a kiss on the lips I think that I might die Blood pressure 
Blood pressure 
It's too high to measure 
My blood pressure 
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Blood pressure 
Blood pressure 
It's too high to measure 
My blood pressure 
Yeah, yeah, yeah... [solo] I think that I might die 
My blood pressure is too high (x4) Blood pressure 
Blood pressure 
It's too high to measure 
My blood pressure 
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Blood pressure 
Blood pressure 
It's too high to measure 
My blood pressure 
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Blood Pressure...
