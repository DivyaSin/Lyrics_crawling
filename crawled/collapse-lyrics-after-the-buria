collapse 
we fold in difficult fashion, pinions clipped and forgotten 
so we grow fray and suffer the cold 
like a shiver inside our own reason 
your feigned regard a frozen lake 
I'll leave you trapped, I hope your winter never ends replicated errors, we smash against these glaciers of mistakes 
replicated errors, and as summers melt we just 
find ourselves drowning in the flood we melt away at the summers heat, stuck between 
our own ideas in paralyzed nights we kick and turn in searing waves 
like hollow shells, dread echoes inside 
reverberate in infinity, reverberate in infinity replicated errors, we smash against these glaciers of mistakes 
replicated errors, and as summers melt we just find ourselves 
drowning in the flood
