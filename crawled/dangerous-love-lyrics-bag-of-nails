When I wake up in the mornin' 
you know I find my babe playin' with my gun 
she's so decided in the mornin' 
that she wants to blow up my (brain) mind 'Cause she's my dangerous love When the night falls I find my babe 
lyin' in my lovin' arms 
but I can't get no sleep 
'cause I don't know if she could do me no harm 'Cause she's my dangerous love That's why I decided the very next mornin' 
that I had to throw my gun away 
if I don't wanna loose my baby 
and live my life or find me dead instead 'Cause she's my dangerous love Now I got her walkin' 'round 
she doesn't know which other way to chose 
she's getting ready for the second round 
but she knows that she ain't got another chance to lose 'Cause she's my dangerous love
