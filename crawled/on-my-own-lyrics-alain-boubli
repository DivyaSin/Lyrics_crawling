EPONINE 
And now I'm all alone again, 
Nowhere to turn, no one to go to. 
Without a home, without a friend, 
Without a face to say hello to. 
And now the night is near, 
Now I can make believe he's here. Sometimes I walk alone at night 
When everybody else is sleeping. 
I think of him, and then I'm happy 
With the company I'm keeping. 
The city goes to bed, 
And I can live inside my head. On my own, 
Pretending he's beside me. 
All alone, 
I walk with him till morning. 
Without him, 
I feel his arms around me, 
And when I lose my way I close my eyes 
And he has found me. In the rain, 
The pavement shines like silver. 
All the lights 
Are misty in the river. 
In the darkness, 
The trees are full of starlight, 
And all I see is him and me for ever and forever. And I know 
It's only in my mind, 
That I'm talking to myself 
And not to him. 
And although I know that he is blind, 
Still I say, 
There's a way for us. I love him, 
But when the night is over, 
He is gone, 
The river's just a river. 
Without him, 
The world around me changes. 
The trees are bare and everywhere 
The streets are full of strangers. I love him, 
But every day I'm learning, 
All my life, 
I've only been pretending! 
Without me, 
His world will go on turning, 
A world that's full of happiness 
That I have never known! I love him... 
I love him... 
I love him... 
But only on my own...
