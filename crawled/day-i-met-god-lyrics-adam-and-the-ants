Day I met God 
I got so carried away 
Day I met God 
I got so carried away 
Not with the vision 
But the streaks in his hair 
Not with religion 
But the size of his knob The day I met God 
The day I met God 
It was pissing with rain 
And we went Day I met God 
I got so carried away 
Day I met God 
I got so carried away 
Not with the vision 
But the streaks in his hair 
Not with the vicars 
Or the nuns or the priests The day I met God 
The day I met the big boy 
It was pissing with rain 
And we went And the herald angels sang 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.... The day I met God 
The day I met God 
The day I met God 
The day I met the big boy, yeah 
It was pissing with rain 
And we went We were coming back in the van 
From milan 
And I saw god 
Right there
