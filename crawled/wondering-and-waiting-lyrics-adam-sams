On the sand, I arise 
Here I stand with the tides 
Will this shore be my fate? 
Is there more than this state? Will you come and rescue me? 
Will you even answer me? Hanging on by a thread 
Am I left here for dead? 
No I'm certain, out there 
Out beyond the breakers 
There's a land, green and fair 
And one day I will see her Will you come and rescue me? 
Will you even answer me? Calling on a world unseen 
Putting messages in bottles 
And trusting the sea Will you come and rescue me? 
Will you even answer me?
