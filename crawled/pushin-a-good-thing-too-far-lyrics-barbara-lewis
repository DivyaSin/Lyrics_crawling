From the beginnin', you've been winnin' 
I've been givin' in to you 
I'm at the point of no return, I'm burnin' 
But it's time you learned a thing or 2 
You're pushin' a good thing 
You're pushin' a good thing 
You're pushin' a good thing too far It's like a slap across my face 
Or cheek & every place disgracin' me 
Now everybody's talkin' 'bout it 
They say I should walk right out on you, they see 
You're pushin' a good thing 
You're pushin' a good thing 
You're pushin' a good thing too far (Low so feelin' you're mad, come on & kiss me) 
Better listen good to what I'm sayin' 
No more kissin' till you stop playin' games 
(Baby I love you) 
If you do, then don't you abuse me 
Or you will lose me, ah You're pushin' a good thing 
You're pushin' a good thing 
You're pushin' a good thing too far 
So keep on pushin', come on, come on come on 
Keep on pushin', oh I want you to keep pushin' 
Come on
