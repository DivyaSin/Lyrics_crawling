Let's count the times we remember one by one, one by one, 
each June, July and September one by one, one by one, 
some special day, some special time, 
some special spring on summer time 
one by one, one by one, counting one by one 
There was a time we walked together two by two, two by two 
in sunny days all together children two by two, two by two 
so far away, so long ago 
where did I fall in moments go one by one, one by one, 
counting one by one 
love comes and goes like the seasons four by four, four by four Just stayed a while, just like your smile 
and when I wake like the seasons one by one 
one by one counting one by one 
Let's count the time we remember one by one, one by one 
each June, July and September one by one, one by one 
some special day, some special time 
some special spring on summer time, 
one by one, one by one, counting one by one 
one by one, one by one, counting one by one 
one by one, one by one, counting one by one 
one by one, one by one, counting one by one
