Cause babe since you been gone 
I haven't had a home 
And I'm so alone 
And now I miss you so 
When the night comes down 
I got nowhere to go 
And now I'm miles away 
Pick up the telephone 
Can't think of things to say 
But please don't let me down 
This could be the last time 
Don't wanna live this way 
Don't wanna lose your love 
With nothin' else to say 
I been so lonely babe 
On your days are my days 
I don't wanna sleep alone 
Please don't leave me this way 
So get back on the phone 
Send me some poetry 
Doesn't matter if it rhymes 
Cause I'm out here singin' 
If you got the time 
Please don't say no to me 
Not when I'm on the line 
And all I feel I've passed 
No one gets close to me 
I feel that I won't last 
So please don't let me down 
No 
This could be the last time 
Don't wanna live this way 
Don't wanna lose your love 
Oh no 
Baby since you've been away 
I've lost your address 
And baby ooh I'm so alone 
I got myself into a mess 
And some nights 
When I'm lonely 
I read your mail 
And baby 
Oh my heart's broken 
And now it's gonna fail 
Yeah 
So babe come runnin' home 
Oh I want you back 
I feel so alone 
And I'll always be your friend 
Please don't let me down 
Don't let me down again 
I know you feel abused 
I took your love for granted 
Looks like I'm being used 
But please don't let me down 
No no no no 
Don't wanna live this way 
Don't wanna lose your love 
Don't wanna sleep alone 
Please don't leave me this way baby 
No no no no 
No no no no 
Baby please don't go
