And did those feet in ancient times 
Trod on America's pastures of green? 
And did that anthropocentric god 
Wane with their thoughts and beliefs all unseen? I don't think so, he's up there with the others laying low 
Vying with those, who you've traded your life to to bless your soul Have they told you how to think 
Cleansed your mind of sepsis and autonomy? 
Or have you escaped from scrutiny 
And regaled yourself with depravity? Now we all see, 'Religion is just synthetic frippery 
Unnecessary in our expanding global cultural efficiency'
