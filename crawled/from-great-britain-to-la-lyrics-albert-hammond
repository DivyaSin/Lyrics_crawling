Albert Hammond 
It Never Rains in Southern California 
From Great Britain To LA 
We came from Great Britain to L.A. 
Where the groups from England play 
Swing Auditorium, Hollywood Palladium, Civic Hall She said she had a house up in the hills 
Lived on orange juice and pills 
California, sweet California, bless you all! California tastes so good like coffee should 
I can't put it down, but that's not all 
If only they had soccer here, Watney's Beer 
And the BBC, and the Albert Hall I think, I might think of settling down 
In this easygoing town 
With a good woman, with a good woman just like you I just wanna lay my head beside you 
On the water bed, won't you lay me down 
Help me to forget about tomorrow 
And the early plane to another town I came from Great Britain to L.A. 
Must go back the other way 
California, so long, California, I'll be back! Yes, I'll be back!
