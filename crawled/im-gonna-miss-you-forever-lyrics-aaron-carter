Hey girl, I'm sad 
I heard that you were leavin' 
You can't go. 
You're my best friend 
I'm sure gonna miss you I always think about you 
All the time you're on my mind 
We play together you and I 
I can't believe that it's true 
Now I have to see you leave 
You're the only one for me My girlfriend, my best friend 
I don't want to see you go 
I just want to let you know 
That I have a crush on you 
I can wait no longer, girl 
To say what I feel I'm gonna miss you forever 
I'm gonna miss you, girl 
Gonna miss you, girl 
The first time that I saw you 
I knew it from the very start 
You had a place deep in my heart 
I can't believe that it's true 
Now it's time for you to leave 
And maybe I just can't believe I'm gonna miss you forever 
I'm gonna miss you, girl 
Gonna miss you, girl 
The first time that I saw you 
I knew it from the very start 
You had a place deep in my heart 
I can't believe that it's true 
Now it's time for you to leave 
And maybe I just can't believe You and me together 
Girl, I'll wait forever 
It's only a matter of time 
'Cause I never want to see you go 
I just want to let you know 
That I can't wait no longer, girl 
To say what I feel
