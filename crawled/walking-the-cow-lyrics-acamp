Try to remember 
But my feelings 
Can't know for sure 
Tryin' to reach out 
But it's gone Lucky stars 
In your eyes 
I'm walking the cow I really don't know 
How I came here 
I really don't know 
Why I'm staying here 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
I am walking (walking) 
The cow Try to point my finger 
But the wind 
Keeps blowing 
Me around in circles 
In circles Lucky stars 
In your eyes 
I'm walking the cow I really don't know 
What I have to fear 
I really don't know 
What I have to care for 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
I am walking 
The cow Lucky stars 
In your eyes
