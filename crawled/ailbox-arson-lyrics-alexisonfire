Your mail's not safe in this town 
Your mail's not safe in this town 
Your mail's not safe in this town 
Your mail's not safe in this town A cigarette burn on your face 
I pour the kerosene in your mouth 
I watch the ash fall down your throat 
I'll burn all your precious bills 
Watch the smoke fold for every crack 
Breathe in your secret lives 
All your bills pay your welfare checks 
But I don't think I can sleep alone 
With this last war always ending in ash Your mail's not safe in this town 
Your mail's not safe in this town 
Your mail's not safe in this town 
Well I'm taking this town back I watch the smoke start to rise 
One hundred homes one hundred fires 
Everything you own now burned away 
This town is no longer mine its fucked with me for the last time 
How I wish that I could see your face Withered sky is streaked with plumes 
Know that it's my signature upon this wretched fucking city 
Mailbox arson, my sweet revenge 
Mailbox arson, my sweet revenge Strike a match and burn away every tie that binds me to this place 
Strike a match and burn away every tie that binds me to this place 
I will strike a match and burn away every tie that binds me to this place 
Strike a match and burn away every tie that binds me to this place. When the smoke clears 
You can consider us anything Your mail's not safe in this town 
Your mail's not safe in this town 
Your mail's not safe in this town 
I'm taking this town back I watch the smoke start to rise 
One hundred homes one hundred fires 
Everything you own now burned away 
This town is no longer mine it's fucked with me for the last time 
How I wish that I could see your face
