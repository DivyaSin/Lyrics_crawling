I'm a wild spirit and I've always been this free 
Lovin' the skies that I'm under 
Born to the wind, Ive been flyin' thru the breeze 
Storms roll on filled with thunder Fighting ways are natural to me 
Friday nights you'll find me in 'Lees' 
Drinkin' brew and braggin' with ease 
Makin' time with ladies I see I'm a wild spirit, women set the spirit free 
Can't break the spell that I'm under 
Love to break a heart, I'm together, no not me 
End up holding my number A woman full of love is a tease 
Love to me is like a disease 
Take your lady, give her the squeeze 
If she cries, it's just that she's pleased, so pleased I'm a wild spirit, I take everything I see 
Livin' one day to another 
Winning is a thrill and I'm making sure it's me 
Thrivin' on the strain that I'm under Fighting ways are natural to me 
Friday nights you'll find me in 'Lees' 
Drinkin' brew, braggin' with ease 
Making time with ladies I see, you see
