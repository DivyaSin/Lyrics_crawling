Well, I was standing by my window 
On one cold and cloudy day 
When I saw that hearse come rolling 
For to carry my mother away Ohh, will the circle be unbroken 
By and by, Lord, by and by? 
There's a better home awaiting 
In the sky, Lord, in the sky Hey, undertaker 
Hey, undertaker, undertaker, please drive slow 
For that body you are haulin' 
Lord, I hate, I hate to see her go Ohh, will the circle be unbroken 
By and by, Lord, by and by? 
There's a better home awaiting 
In the sky, Lord, in the sky I went back home, my home was lonesome 
Missed my mother, she was gone 
All my brothers, sisters crying 
In our home so sad and alone Will the circle be unbroken 
By and by, Lord, by and by? 
There's a better home awaiting 
In the sky, Lord, in the sky Well, I followed close behind her 
Tried to hold up and be brave 
But I could not hide my sorrow 
When they laid her in the grave Ohh, will the circle be unbroken 
By and by, Lord, by and by? 
There's a better home awaiting 
In the sky, Lord, in the sky Ohh, will the circle be unbroken 
By and by, Lord, by and by? 
There's a better home awaiting 
In the sky, Lord, in the sky In the sky, Lord, in the sky
