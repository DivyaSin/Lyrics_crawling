What do I need to do, I really dont know 
Teach me, how to get to your heart 
This bright of smile 
I havent seen before, I guess Im nervous like this 
Oh just hold me now and kiss me now 
At this moment think of us only 
Ive only thought of you the entire day 
Did you know the way you give me laughter 
Is only by you? 
I only dream of you 
Because in this world I only see you 
Did you know the way you give me pain 
Is done solely by you? 
I need you so much 
What do I need to do, I really dont know 
Teach me, how to get to your heart 
This bright of smile 
I havent seen before, I guess Im nervous like this 
Oh just hold me now and kiss me now 
At this moment think of us only 
Ive only thought of you the entire day 
Did you know the way you give me laughter 
Is only by you? 
I only dream of you 
Because in this world I only see you 
Did you know the way you give me pain 
Is done solely by you? 
I need you so much 
In eager hopes of desire, Ive waited all this time just for you 
You were my dream of course 
From now on Ill become your entire dream come true 
Ive only thought of you the entire day 
Did you know the way you give me laughter 
Is only by you? 
I only dream of you 
What should I do, you already know
