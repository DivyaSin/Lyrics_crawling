You walked away from me and this child 
I dried her tears last night 
Gently I rocked her while I quietly cooed 
With a heart that won't stop loving you I've got a heart that won't stop loving you 
I'm feeling helpless, I do 
Why did you leave, I'm so confused 
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you Deep in the night our baby screamed 
She sought for mommy to come 
I told her I hoped that daddy will do 
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you I've got a heart that won't stop loving you 
I'm feeling helpless, I do 
Why did you leave, I'm so confused 
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you Now here you stand pleading with me 
You ask if I can forgive 
My mind is shouting not to try to 
But my heart won't stop loving you I've got a heart that won't stop loving you 
I'm feeling helpless, I do 
Why did you leave, I'm so confused 
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you What will it change if I take you back 
How can I know you'll try 
I can't let go of the good times we had 
Tell me, have your feelings died I've got a heart that won't stop loving you 
I'm feeling helpless, I do 
Why did you leave, I'm so confused 
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you Why did you leave, I'm so confused 
I got a heart that won't stop loving you
