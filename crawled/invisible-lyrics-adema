The game is too free fame 
The mental picture and let it be shown 
It looks a lot like this 
And I can't bear to look alone There's a little inside that we never really know 
Till the hole gets deeper and it starts to show 
There's a part of you that likes to feel it too 
Just like we always do I cry but I can't explain 
Why I never be the same 
I know I'm just another face in the crowd now 
Yeah, I'm invisible I stayed awake until the morning after 
I couldn't just tell you there was something wrong 
I fought the pain that soon became a disaster 
Don't walk away because they're playing our song No, don't go 
Like a child beneath an open door 
If you feel the same way too 
Then I got nothing left to lose I cry but I can't explain 
Why I never be the same 
I know I'm just another face in the crowd now 
Yeah, I'm invisible 
(We know) 
I've always been a zero If you could see me now 
If you could see me now 
If you could see me now I've tried but I can't explain 
Why I never be the same 
I know I'm just another face in the crowd now 
Yeah, I'm invisible I've tried but I can't explain 
Why I never be the same 
I know I'm just another face in the crowd now 
Yeah, I'm invisible
