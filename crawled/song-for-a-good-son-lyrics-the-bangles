A summer's day so long ago 
A thousand boats dancing on the bay 
I came to you inside a dream 
We both held hands and fell into the water You never claimed to know me well 
The dark-eyed son, the privileged man 
You fond me bitter, you thought me cold 
Well now I'm gonna make you understand My mother died, my father cried 
He left me lonely by the waterside 
Waterside so deep and wide 
If I follow, maybe I will find her Beyond the salt and spray 
The current carried her away 
Beyond the salt and spray 
The current carried her away I can't outrun my destiny 
Tell me who will sing a song for me 
Darkness darkness cover me 
By my own hands the way it has to be My mother died my father cried 
You will find me by the waterside 
Waterside so deep and wide 
If I follow, maybe I will find her 
If I follow, maybe I will find her
