If your trials end, are really getting you down 
We had a close call 
I didn't even see it, then another one 
I hardly believed it at all What the writers say, it means shit to me now 
Plants and animals, we're on a bender when it's eighty degrees 
The end of December was coming on, only for you and me 
When the showing up ends, going back to the south Where hungry necks that I know, and runnin' a blender in a lightning storm 
Disguised as a blessing I'm sure 
Knowing up here, there comes a fork in the road, 
Pants have gotta go, we're on an island on the fourth of July 
Looks like the tide is going home In time I'd find a little way to your heart 
Down to the general store for nothing specific 
Gonna wash my bones in the Atlantic shore 
Only for you and me
