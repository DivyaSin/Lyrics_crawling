my jaw hit the floor the day you walked in 
all eyes were pointed in your direction 
with nothing to lose I asked you to dance 
I didn't think that I'd stand a chance but Chorus: 
lucky for me you proved me wrong 
(proved me wrong) 
it was a roll of the dice 
it was a shot so long 
what started out as no hope in hell 
has turned out heavenly 
so lucky for me Just goes to show you can't judge a book by the cover 
if I had I'd still be searching for another 
I believed I was livin in a dream 
and at any moment someone would wake me up but, 
chorus 2x 
yeah 
lucky for me 5x
