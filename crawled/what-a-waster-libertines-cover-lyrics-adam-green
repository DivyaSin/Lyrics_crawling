What a waster, what a fucking waster 
You pissed it all up the wall 
And 'round the corner where they chased her 
There's tears falling out from everywhere The city's hard, the city's fair 
Get back inside, you've got nothing on 
And you mind your bleedin' 
Own you two bob cunt When she wakes up in the morning 
She writes down all her dreams 
Reads like the book of Revelations 
Or the Celestine prophecies Oh, I really wanna know 
Where does her money go 
Where does all the money go 
Straight, straight up her nose And I never even liked it any way 
I much preferred it the other way What a divvy, what a fucking div 
Talking like a moron, walking like a spiv 
I was laying in bed, paying my rent 
He was knocking on the door 
For something that he lent her brother Meanwhile from under the covers she says 
"Save me from tomorrow man 
Save me from tomorrow, oh, no 
Oh, no, not me" And I never even liked it anyway 
I much prefer it the other way 
I never liked it any way 
I much prefer it the other way What a waster, what a fucking waster 
You pissed it all up the wall 
And 'round the corner where they chased her 
There's tears coming out from everywhere The citys hard, the citys fair 
What a waster, what a fucking waster yeah
