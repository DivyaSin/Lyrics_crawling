Today a tribute to my sister 
And I don't want to make her feel 
Any worse than she must feel Today my arms reach for survivors 
A medal I had never won 
But it's never meant this much, it's obvious Bells ring, waking 
The thought of yesterday is beckoning 
Night lies to razz 
Life is a long breath 
Hey now I'll be on occasional vacation 
Pretending I never grew up 
And I've never given up on anyone Bells ring, waking 
Lure of sedation always beckoning 
Good morning night 
Mine is a lifetime Can't imagine life without those blue eyes 
But they will take those lights away 
When they see 'em in harms way 
This is the killer you are tempting 
The other sum of all we are 
Resent to live, resent to wait, resent to fight Bells ring, waking 
The sound of innocence is beckoning 
Night storms to lout 
This is a long life 
Hey now
