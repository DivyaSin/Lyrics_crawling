Shaking and mumbling, you calmly drop your weapon and take a look around 
The cracks beneath the floorboards revealed wandering eyes 
But you didn't care to check, you didn't care to check Why would I save you on the night the town was red? 
You were far too comfortable just leaving him for dead 
And I patiently waited to send you away for the debt you refused to pay You can't remember your motive but I know it well 
The spotlight finds you and the stories you tell 
Your formality made it too simple, you signed before you read 
And your suit never fooled me 'cause you watched him as he bled 
And I was there all along, I was there all along Why would I save you on the night the town was red? 
You were far too comfortable just leaving him for dead 
And I patiently waited to send you away for the debt you refused to pay Don't beg for forgiveness, 'cause your cries won't be heard 
You underestimated my forewarning word 
Your secrets' on the table as you hide underneath 
Oh you'll hide underneath Why would I save you on the night the town was red? 
You were far too comfortable just leaving him for dead 
Why would I save you on the night the town was red?
