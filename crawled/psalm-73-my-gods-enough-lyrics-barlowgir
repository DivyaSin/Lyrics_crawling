I've had enough of living life for only me 
And reaching for the things 
That keep destroying me 
So sick of envying the lives of so many I see 
Somehow believing that they have what I need [Chorus] 
My God's enough for me 
This world has nothing I need 
In this whole life I've seen 
My God's enough, enough for me I can't explain why I suffer though I live for You 
Those who deny You, they have it better than I do 
Cover my eyes now so that my heart can finally see 
That in the end only You mean everything [Chorus]
