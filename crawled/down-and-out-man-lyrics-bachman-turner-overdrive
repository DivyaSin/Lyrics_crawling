Had a widow down in Boston 
You know she really trusted me 
Then I ran away to Cleveland 
From a brand new bride-to-be Held a preacher's plate in Memphis 
On a dark cold Sunday night 
By Tuesday was in Alabam' 
Showing people how to do it right I'm a down and out man 
Guess you wonder why I am 
I'm a down and out man 
Guess you wonder why I am Tried to boogie in a honky-tonk 
But my old guitar was out of tune 
That's when they didn't like my music 
So they tried to throw me out the room I was living in a funky world 
They were living in three four time 
All my friends are into rock and roll 
Or they ain't no friends of mine I'm a down and out man 
Guess you wonder why I am 
I'm a down and out man 
Guess you wonder why I am (Down and out man) 
(Guess you wonder why I am) 
I'm a down and out man 
Guess you wonder why I am 
I'm a down and out man 
Guess you wonder why I am (Down and out man) 
(Guess you wonder why I am) 
I'm a down and out man 
Guess you wonder why I am 
I'm a down and out man 
Guess you wonder why I am
