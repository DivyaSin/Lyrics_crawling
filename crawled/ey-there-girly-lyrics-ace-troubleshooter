Hey there, hey there girly 
You're always on my mind 
And it's too bad we can't go out 
And do stuff all the time 
You gotta know that you are 
My one and only girl 
And together we will make 
The cutest couple in the world Now don't you have no doubts 
'cause you know we can work it out 
And you will always be my girl I fell in a pile of you 
And got love all over me 
And you know you'll always be my girl
