Cock a snoot, 
Loop the loop, 
Hock the hula-hoop, 
But now it yo-yo'd back again 
Shiver me timbers, 
Just jumped ship with a little faith 
We could win the championship 
Parachute substitute, problem is it's soooo cute 
Workless, cashless, hungry and in debt 
Outta house, outta home, outta pocket 
They persuade you, 
That they made you then betrayed you 
And they blame you with the power of persuasion 
The power of persuasion 
The power of persuasion 
The power of persuasion 
You bought the troll, 
You bought the gonk, 
You took it home, and put it on a pedestal 
We needed a saviour, 
But from its behavior 
Why did it have to be so extra-terrestrial? 
Tax deductible. Cash corruptible, 
Never the less another pool swinner 
Penniless dog tooth check, 
Cash and carry Find a girl, 
Settle down and marry 
They persuade you, 
That they made you 
The proclaim, 
And they'll maim you with the power of persuasion 
The power of persuasion 
The power of persuasion 
The power of persuasion 
I sold the Eskimo snow 
Build the skyline outta playdough 
Persuading you that monochrome is day glo 
With the power of persuasion
