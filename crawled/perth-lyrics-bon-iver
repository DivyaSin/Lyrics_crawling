I'm tearing up, across your face 
Move dust through the light 
To find your name 
It's something faint 
This is not a place 
Not yet awake, I'm raised to make Still alive who you, love 
Still alive who you, love 
Still alive who you, love In a matter of an month 
From forests for the soft 
Gotta know been lead aloft 
So I'm ridding all your stories 
What I know, what it is, is boring, wire it up! 
You're breaking your ground
