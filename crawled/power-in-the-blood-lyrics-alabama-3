No time for spindoctors medicine 
Cooked up by the government, selling me some cover-up 
Sponsored information, crack pipes in the shopping malls 
Nothing but another drug, a license they can buy and sell I don't mind dying 
I don't mind dying 
I don't mind dying 
When that call it comes, I will be ready for war No time for backhanded compliments 
From bourgeois apologists desperate for an incident 
Real-estate assassins, assessing my predicament 
My dollar bills dependant upon it being in their interest I don't mind dying 
I don't mind dying 
I don't mind dying 
When that call it comes, I will be ready for war CHORUS There is power in the blood, justice in the sword 
When that call it comes, I will be ready for war 
Power in the blood, justice in the sword 
When that call it comes, I will be ready I will raise mah sword up right 
To the bright and shining light, 
Stained crimson red with the blood of the unredeemed 
And as I cut them limb from limb, and I dash all their kith and kin, 
You know, their bodies I will bury in the deep 
Because there's power in the blood. 
There's power in the blood.
