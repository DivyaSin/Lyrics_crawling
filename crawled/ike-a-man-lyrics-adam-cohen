I don't wanna love you like a man 
By being above you like a man 
I don't wanna hurt you like a man 
But that's what I am... 
Don't wanna cheat and lie like a man 
Hold it all inside like a man 
Hide you behind a veil like a man 
But that's what I am... 
I don't wanna, I don't wanna be like them 
Those other men 
Whatever came before me, well that was then 
I'll be better than, those other men 
So I want you to cry like a woman 
Take me on a ride like a woman 
Use beauty as revenge like a woman does, with a man 
I don't wanna, I don't wanna be like them 
Those other men 
Whatever came before me, well that was then 
I'll be better than- 
I don't wanna, I don't wanna be like them 
Those other men 
I'll be better than- 
So don't become my beautiful friend 
The one I don't go home with 
When the night ends... 
I don't wanna, I don't wanna be like them 
Those other men 
Whoever came before me, well that was then 
I'll be better than- 
I don't wanna, I don't wanna be like them 
Those other men 
Whatever came before me, well that was then 
I'll be better than, those other men 
Those other men, those other men, those other men...
