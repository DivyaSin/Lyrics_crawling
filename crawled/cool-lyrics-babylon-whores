She`s kinda cool / Like Third Reich paraphenalia / I gave her bullets / And blades / I gave her whips and chains 
It's cool to sleep in a witch house / It's cool to close your eyes / If you want something to / Fuck up your mind 
Sometimes my head is liquid methedrine / Reality floating in / As I breathe 
She's kinda cool / Like Grimorium of Honorius / I gave her a hundred demon names / I gave her coffin nails 
It's cool to sleep in a witch house / It's cool to close your eyes / If you want something to / Fuck up your mind 
Sometimes my head is liquid methedrine / Reality floating in as I breathe / And She / She won't play by the rules / She's just playing it cool 
I know I'll remember / I'll remember if I can / A promise given in the / No man's land / Though sometimes the rain / Cools me down / Like I was crying for a lightning / Just dying for a lightning 
I guess I am so cool it hurts / I am a boy scout dressed in a skirt / I threw my coins in a wishing well / And you can all go fuck yourselves
