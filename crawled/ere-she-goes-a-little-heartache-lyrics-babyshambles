I do declare I was surprised to see you stay 
only to be betrayed by the one you gave all your love and trust to And tell me how could I let go 
Since I caught a glimpse of your immense soul 
You were dancing to northern soul 
Just one glance, and well you know... There she goes a little heartache 
There she goes a little pain 
Make no mistake, she sheds her skin like a snake 
On the dirty road to fame, dirty road to fame my lord now, 
Oh There she goes a little heartache 
There she goes a little pain 
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake 
You're going to walk the plank again, walk the plank again my lord now I was to implore that you forget all you saw 
When you came through my door and from your bag 
You pulled out more skag than I'd ever seen 
No! how could I let go? 
Since I caught a glimpse of your white plimsoles 
Twisting and turning to northern soul 
Just once glance, ah well you know, 
Everybody knows
