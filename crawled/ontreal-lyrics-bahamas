When we started out I had my doubts 
I let them in 
Now I can't begin 
When I apologize 
See it in your eyes 
You don't give a damn 
Honey please don't give up on your man Time has its ways of stealing days 
From me and you 
Now what can we do 
If every time I crawl 
Crawl to Montreal 
Don't seem like no plan 
Honey please don't give up on your man Of all the things we said 
Laying in our bed 
Which words will I hold true? 
If I could stay the course 
My voice hollered hoarse 
From screaming the sky is blue Now here we are again 
Both wishing now was then 
When I do all I can 
Honey please don't give up on your man
