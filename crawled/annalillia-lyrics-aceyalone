Yo, I met this queen 
Yo, I met this queen named Annalillia Annalillia, oh Annalillia

I bet you think Im silly, uh Annalillia Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
I bet you think Im silly, uh Annalillia Now I was in a bar when I met Annalillia 
Drunk and high drinkin shots of tequila 
Chasin it with genuine draft 
Tellin wack jokes as the bartender laughed I was about one drink away from my limit 
In came a black dress, with a black body in it 
She looked so timid it took me a minute 
To get her in focus he said, what will it be And just so she could notice ace I said 
Yo this ones on me and she stormed 
I dont even know who you are fool 
Keepin that barstool warm like norm Then it hit me, right there center in my heartbeat 
Shot down but I loved it 
I was talkin out the bottom of a shot glass anyways 
I says I insist that I pays By the ways 
What your mama name you what they call you 
Can I call you and soon claim you 
I was diggin a hole I knew Id fall through But I aimed to just understand her 
A woman that not many men knows 
She looked me in my windows and said Annalillia 
Annalillia? Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
I mean well really, uh Annalillia Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
You wanna smoke this Philly, uh Annalillia Now once I broke the ice on the lake the water felt cold 
But nevertheless it was water my conversation caught her 
Some daddys daughter and my mamas son 
Said, Im ace de uno and I do know how to have fun I comes from the hills, 1 in a mil 
2 out of 3 aint bad, 4 a 5 dollar bill 
And a half a dozen thrills just see how it feels 
7, 8, 9 now he pre-10s pretends hes real 
And she thought that was so funny And she put her drink away went to pay her money and squirted 
All because a brother just flirted and didnt know how to word it 
I blurted out the door but she never heard it 
Then Annalillia deserted Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
I bet you think Im silly, uh Annalillia Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia 
Annalillia, oh Annalillia

Hmm with her friend, yo havent we met before 
Of course we have we crossed paths at a local pub 
And I was like a lickle drunk on everything I love I didnt mean to run you off but I did

She said, first of all I got a boyfriend 
And a girlfriend and a couple of rug rats and a cat 
Splat Ooh, she threw me all out of my game 
She was open like a [unverified] 
So I asked myself the what and the why 
So I said self what are you doin Why are you canoing when you could have a motorboat instead 
Then I told her hold her head peace this aint what I wanted 
But right before I shook the spot I said let me tell you somethin
