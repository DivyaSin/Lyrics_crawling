WRITTEN BY KEVIN BACON Tequila smile and a mango kiss 
They've never seen rain quite like this 
Give the storm a name watch her blow 
She's outside with a sweet surprise 
You can't stop her when her waters rise 
Open up the door let her flow CHORUS 
Ten Years in Mexico 
Watch them come and I watch them go 
Where the time went I don't know 
Life and death joy and tears 
Ten Years In Mexico I still remember every step so well 
Through the graveyard to the cheap hotel 
Knowing any moment I might fall 
Still a notion in senora's eyes 
She sees the ocean and the dragon flies 
From the hacienda hear her call CHORUS I ain't learned much 
But I learned that love is all 
And I learned to count 
To ten en espal 
Last night I dreamed of ice and sleet 
I dreamed of sidewalks underneath my feet 
Woke to find my suitcase by the door 
I ask the mountains and the Cortez Sea 
How did she come to love a fool like me 
But I don't really need the answer any more CHORUS
