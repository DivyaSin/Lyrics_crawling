We used to throw thunderbolts 
They rained down on passing cars 
We played it to greet the stars 
To play it with any art You don't need those glasses but 
You just look so good in them 
We used to throw thunderbolts 
Good ideas even then They let you, let you ride 
They let you, let you ride We used to throw thunderbolts 
Twilight on the overpass 
We'll wrest them out gravity(?) 
Color fast and come with me And we had some directives 
We shown in that villain(?) light 
TV yellow and in love 
In whatever's shining down He let you, let you ride 
He let you, let you ride We used to ride thunderheads 
We rode them around the bend 
You don't need those glasses but 
You just look so good in them They let you, let you ride 
They let you, let you ride They let you, let you ride 
They let you, let you ride 
They let you, let you ride 
They let you, let you ride
