What's that song we use to sing? 
It's about anything, everything and anything 
What's that song we use to sing? 
You have always thinking of her 
You're in love and you don't know what to say 
But I saw her at the fair 
And she feels the same way 
She was married by the merry-go-round The merry-go-round 
The merry-go-round 
Merrily we go round It was the first one of the day 
It was the last one of the night 
Oh hold me tight, hold me tight, hold me tight now It was the first one of the day 
It was the last one of the night 
Oh hold me tight, hold me tight, hold me tight now There's a parade of girls outside 
That boy's so shy, why'd you punch out his lights? They said you were wrongened 
But I can see in your eyes 
How you are gentle and wise 
And you had the good stuff There's a parade of girls outside 
That boy's so shy, why'd you punch out his lights? What was that song you used to sing? 
What was that song we used to sing? 
What was that song you used to sing? 
What was that song we used to sing? 
Sing that song we used to sing What was that song you used to sing? 
It's about anything and everything 
Everything and anything 
The times of your life, the people that we meet It was the first one of the day 
It was the last one of the night 
It was the first one of the day 
It was the last one of the night 
Oh hold me tight, hold me tight, hold me tight now There's a parade of girls outside 
That boy's so shy, why'd you punch out his lights? You have always thinking of her 
You're in love and you don't know what to say 
But I saw her at the fair 
And she feels the same way 
She was married by the merry-go-round The merry-go-round 
The merry-go-round 
Merrily we go round
