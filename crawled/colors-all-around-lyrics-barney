Ho, ho, what a great day! 
Well, it is, the grass is green 
And the sky is so blue 
Yeah Oh, look at all those pretty flowers, wow 
There are so many colors 
You're right, Baby Bop 
There are lots and lots of colors, everywhere we look We like colors, we like them a lot 
We've got colors, colors, we've got 
Red, blue and yellow, purple, orange, green 
Black, white, brown, every color in between [Chorus] 
Colors all around, all around the world 
For every boy and girl Red makes me think of an apple or a cherry 
The sun, and it sets on the ripe strawberry 
Blue is the sky, blue is the sea 
Blue is the color of a blueberry [Chorus] Orange is a pumpkin, orange is a carrot 
Orange is an orange, we can share it 
And if you haven't seen what is purple and green 
Just take a look at Barney, see what I mean [Chorus] We like colors 
(We like colors) 
We like them a lot 
(We like them a lot) We've got colors 
(We've got colors) 
Colors, we've got 
(Colors, we've got) Red, blue and yellow 
(Red, blue and yellow) 
Purple, orange, green 
(Purple, orange, green) Black, white, brown 
(Black, white, brown) 
Every color in between 
(Every color in between) [Chorus: x2]
