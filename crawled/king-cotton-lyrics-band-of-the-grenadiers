KING COTTON Pick the cotton and pick the cotton and pick the cotton some more! Youre pickin cotton until you drop 
Youre never getting away 
Youd rather be in a coffee shop 
With fish and chips on your tray. Youre bendin down 
Your back is broke 
Your fingers ache and 
Your feet are smokin Your head is numb 
Your legs are gone 
And youve got nothing to say Youre pickin cotton the whole day through 
Until the evening is done 
Youll never get a vacation or a getaway for some fun You grind your knees into the dirt 
You rip your pants and you tear your shirt 
But you cant complain, your backs in pain 
And you get nothin for pay Cause that sonavabitch will never let you 
Take a break at all, 
Youll never get any food 
Or water, juice or alcohol So pick your cotton, boy. This rotten 
Day has just begun, and you will 
Not be done with pickin till its 
Later in the Fall Im tellin you what my life is like 
So listen up my friend 
My mother is holding up all right 
Although her back dont bend We pick all day, we pick all night 
And when the day is over we can 
Grab a little nap and then we do it all again. TRIO Youll never guess how much I really love this job, 
So, Im giving you fair warning 
I love the foreman who can make my mother sob 
While cotton pickin in the morning. You see that bastard with the whip? His name is Bob. 
Woke me up at five this morning, Youll never know how much Id love to stab that slob 
And spread his guts to rot til dawning DOGFIGHT Youve got to 
Bend down, open a boll 
Pick out the fluff, bag it! If your bags getting full 
Harder to pull, drag it! Fill the bag my friend 
Fill it once again 
Do it till your fingers bleed, boy! TRIO (REPRISE) Youll never know how much I love plantation life, 
Full of sweet perfume and romance; 
Youll never know how much Id like to use Bobs knife 
To separate him from his gonads.
