A nightmare, long ago now 
Forced me awake from the pain of my dreams 
A late-night look in my heart 
Unearthin' a lifetime of grief I yelled out "Why should I hide" 
And there in the storm of my lies, said a prayer 
Raced to the mirror to find 
An immature child feelin' scared Funny when you start to realize maybe you're not a boy anymore 
And if I want to grow up, what am I waitin' for? Here in this mirror 
Who do I see 
Am I still a boy 
Just playin' with toys 
No that isn't me Here in this mirror 
Could I be free 
If I say goodbye 
To all of the lies 
I once believed Cuz then one boy can 
Grow into a man 
Honestly Blinded by visions of fear 
Chasin' illusions that I'd never find 
But those lies would all disappear 
When one truthful moment was mine Funny when you start to realize maybe you're not the boy that you were 
Finally fightin' to breathe, forever changed, forever sure The boy in the mirror 
Starin' at me 
I think he knows 
That I cannot grow 
Until he leaves So I'll break this mirror 
Set his truth free 
And I'll say goodbye 
To that broken child 
Cuz that's what I need And then one boy can 
Grow into a man 
Honestly There's not a moment to lose 
Truth is the light for the wise 
Every boy must face the time he must choose 
To see his life with open eyes Here in the mirror 
Who do I see 
Am I still a boy 
Just playin' with toys 
No, that isn't me So I'll break this mirror 
And set myself free 
I'll say goodbye 
To all of the lies 
I once believed So now one boy can 
Grow into a man 
Honestly Now one boy can 
Grow into a man 
Honestly
