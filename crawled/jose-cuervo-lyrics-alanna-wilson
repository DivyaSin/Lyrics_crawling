Yeah he's a good drinkin buddy, 
He always shows, 
All my complainin ain't no skin off his nose, 
He always makes me happy and never sad. 
He's got a golden tan, 
Seems to me like my kinda man, 
He never picks a fight or makes me mad. My new boyfriend comes in a bottle, 
Always makes me feel like a model, 
Seems to make me forget all about you, 
He's a real good listener, a pick me up, 
We ride around for hours in my truck, 
He always understands what I'm going through, 
Took a shot through the heart with cupid's arrow, 
Gonna fix it with a shot of Jose Cuervo... Yeah he's the best, that money can buy, 
You even get to pick your size, 
Wipes away those pesky memories, 
You can take him everywhere in your purse, 
He'll come shopping and with ya to work, 
Who ever said the best things in life are free? My new boyfriend comes in a bottle, 
Always makes me feel like a model, 
Seems to make me forget all about us, 
So when some jerk that's at the bar, 
Tries to take me to his car, 
He makes me a little tough, 
Usually I find it hard to say no, 
Gonna fix that with a shot of Jose Cuervo... Yeah he likes all the songs I like, 
Always lets me be right, 
Never turns away from my touch, 
You can bring him home to bed, 
Never elbows you in the head, 
Well, not unless I've had a little too much. My new boyfriend comes in a bottle, 
Always makes me feel like a model, 
Seems to make me forget all about you, 
He's a real good listener, a pick me up, 
Yeah he always gives a... hoot, 
He always understands what I'm going through, 
Got shot through the heart with Cupids arrow, 
Gonna fix it with a shot, or two, or three, of Jose Cuervo :)
