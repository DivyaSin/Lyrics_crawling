Just forget I ever said 
That it's true love ain't enough 
Got a diamond in my head 
And a universal bluff 
Gotta find a better glue 
To hold this picture of the sun 
Gotta find a way to you 
Before all of this is done Once you strip the paint you find it 
Everywhere you go 
And you and I should know Love is enough 
Love is enough 
Love is enough at the end of the tracks 
When the white flag waves 
And the heart attacks 
Love is enough when you don't look back My country is a cross 
And my city is a vice 
In so perilous a place 
At such a blood-begotten price 
So just forget I ever said 
That's its true love ain't enough 
There's a killer in my bed 
And enough is not enough Once you strip the paint you find it 
Everywhere you go 
And you and I should know 
Everything that we esteem, forever or a day 
Don't drive my love away Love is enough 
Love is enough 
Love is enough at the end of the tracks 
When the car wrecks, heart attacks 
Love is enough when you don't look back
