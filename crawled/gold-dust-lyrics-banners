Winter's calling 
Night has fallen 
Could you always come around? 
Falling backwards 
Sinking faster 
Lost disaster on the ground Turn this darkness into sparks like blazing hearts 
I tell you darling All I know 
When the nights grow cold 
And it's all gone to rust 
We can turn it into gold dust 
Far from home 
With these aching bones 
Are you just out of love? 
We can turn it into gold dust Tired like a broken arrow 
Straight and out of aiming careful and miss the mark 
All I carry 
Silver lining 
Crashed like lightning flash in the dark Turn this darkness into sparks like blazing hearts 
I tell you darling All I know 
When the nights grow cold 
And it's all gone to rust 
We can turn it into gold dust 
Far from home 
With these aching bones 
Are you just out of love? 
We can turn it into gold dust Turn it into gold dust 
Oh, turn it into gold dust 
Oh, turn it into gold dust 
Oh oh, turn it into gold dust 
(Turn it into gold dust) All I know 
When the nights grow cold 
And it's all gone to rust 
We can turn it into gold dust
