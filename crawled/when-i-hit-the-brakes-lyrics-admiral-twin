You said, I'm a shore, I can build our castles out of sand 
The day, I got washed away and it's a long walk home again I should have known, the look on your face 
You climbed in the car, where you wanted to go 
Rumors, I'd heard, no longer ignored 
You opened your mouth but before you could speak I said no, I really, don't think, I want to know 
I really, don't think, I want to go that far, now 
Let's just stay right where we are now 
Live, well enough, alone I squint at the road but I can still see 
Windshield reflections, you're staring at me 
You've something to say, that I don't want to hear 
And it gets hard to drive, when I'm covering my ears So, I say no, I really, don't think, I want to know 
I really, don't think, I want to go that far down 
I'd rather stay uninvolved now These fevered confessions, frighten me and though you're my friend 
I swear, if you don't stop soon, it's a long walk home again You just won't quit, what made you believe 
I wanted to hear the secrets you keep? 
Now, I see what it takes, your head hits the windshield 
When I hit the brakes 'Cause I said no, I really, don't think, I want to know 
I really, don't think, I want to go that far now 
Let's just stay right where we are now I said no, I really, don't think, I want to know 
I really, don't think, I want to go that far down 
You've gotten me involved now 
Now, look what you've done
