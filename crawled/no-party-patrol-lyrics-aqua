Time is up, gotta get this party started 
Raise the roof and watch the walls come tumbling down 
Somebody made gasoline cheaper than bottled water 
Tell them I don't give a damn about tomorrow - ooh! 
Run, run, run - we're running out of water 
And now the house is on fire 
Looks like the ice cubes are melting 
And we ain't got no party patrol No, no, no, no party patrol - no, no, no, no party patrol 
The house is rocking and things are out of hand (oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh) 
Seems like everyone in this town came to party (oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh) 
Somebody made gasoline cheaper than bottled water 
Pedal to the metal, baby rock that to the roll - ooh! Run, run, run - we're running out of water 
And now the house is on fire 
Looks like the ice cubes are melting 
And we ain't got no party patrol 
No, no, no, no party patrol - no, no, no, no, no 
Hands up, here we go 
Getting down, getting low 
We wanna tear this house down, right? Split up, turn it on 
Bring it out, getting slow 
We're gonna rock this place 
So let me see your hands 
No, no, no, no party patrol 
No, no, no, no party patrol Pedal to the metal, baby rock that to the roll - ooh! 
Run, run, run - we're running out of water 
And now the house is on fire 
Looks like the ice cubes are melting 
No, we ain't got no party patrol 
Run, run, run - we're running out of water (No, no, no party patrol)
