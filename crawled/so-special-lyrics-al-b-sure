Can you feel it baby? 
I know that when I first saw you 
I knew you were that special lady - yeah [Chorus] 
All the love you give to me 
Oh is so special 
Special girl (Oh...Father) 
Special girl All the love you give to me 
Oh is so special 
In the morning is so special 
Special girl (oh no, oh no) special girl Ooh the way you touch my body I get a chill 
Everytime I see your face I know 
I know I love you still (...still will) Hold my body, hold it tight and I just might 
Take you places you've neer been before 
All through the night [Chorus: x 2] When you're not here with me I can still taste your lips 
Oh I can feel that heart beat right through me 
With just one simple kiss I'll never leave you 
(See, we were friends before we were lovers) 
Oh and we started out right 
Now we've known each other for a little while 
Let's make love all through the night [Chorus] Two hearts as one, your hand in mine 
Ooh let's make love like the first time...oh! 
Two hearts as one, your hand in mine 
Keep your eyes on me, through as as climb... Higher...oh Father 
And higher...can you help me 
And higher...understand this lady? 
And higher - oh oh Morning, noon & night hold my body, hold it tight! 
Special girl, you're my special lady Girl, can I take you higher? [Chorus]
