Holding on until last call 
I've been waiting for my alcohol Balance myself against the wall 
Debate making my 9th last call Cause I don't want to use it 
I just want to get some sleep tonight 
I feel like I might lose it The footing here's on shaky ground 
I need the traction that you've found My dirty mind just let me down 
It's such a wash this time around Cause I don't want to use it 
I just want to get some sleep tonight 
I feel like I might lose it Cause it's you that I've been dreaming of 
Yeah its you that I've been dreaming of 
Like broken hearts that wish on stars above 
Yeah its you that I've been dreaming of I've been waiting for this all to fade away 
I've been debating now if I should try and change 
To help me piece this puzzle back in place 
I think I said the words I'd never say Wait, it's so late 
I need help to fix this feeling on the inside 
But you know, you can't go 
I need help to break this feeling on the outside 
Looking in 
Where to begin? Cause it's you that I've been dreaming of 
Yeah its you that I've been dreaming of 
Like broken hearts that wish on stars above 
Yeah its you that I've been dreaming of
