I remember a different time 
I remember a different me 
When there was springtime in my heart 
But it's winter 
And I'm shivering with cynicism now 
And I long for yesterday Yesterday, a day of joy 
A day of limitless possibilities 
I remember a different boy 
With love surrounding 
Joy abounding, peace resounding 
Where, oh where did that boy go? What's wrong with me now, God? 
My world is gray, so please help me out 
I pray 
'Cause I want to live in yesterday Take me back to a time of naivete 
Neverending days 
And no need to question things 
'Cause I'm tired of staring out my window 
Wishing I were someone I should be 
I guess I remember a different me
