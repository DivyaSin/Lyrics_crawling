It's taken me forever 
But I don't want to go 
I don't need a reason 
I've been working like a dog Aaah, strung out on time 
Aaah, strung out on time I need a bomb 
Exploding in my veins 
And if you lost the power 
You need to rock & roll the dice 
It's losers happy hour I used to figure out what's in your narrow mind 
But, baby, I think it's working overtime tonight Aaah, strung out on time 
Aaah, strung out on time So where did you run Where did you run 
Lost all the fun 
You can't spotlight the sun Well, I used to figure out what's in your narrow mind 
But, honey, I think it's working overtime tonight Aaah, strung out on time 
Aaah, strung out on time 
Aaah, strung out on time 
Aaah, strung out on time
