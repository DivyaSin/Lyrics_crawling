You dream a dream 
Mm, but you never wake up 
You're so afraid 
Mm, that the dream is over Open your eyes and you'll see 
Daydreaming won't concur me 
Won't concur me, no it won't concur me [Chorus] 
'Cause only the good guys can get, what they're coming for 
And all of the dreamers must take, what's apart 
Only the good guys receive, what they came here for 
And all of you dreamers, will leave with a broken heart Reality 
You better face it 
Your blood is red 
One bite, you'll taste it Open your eyes and you'll see 
Daydreaming won't concur me 
Won't concur me, no it won't concur me [Chorus: x2] Only the good guys can get, what they're coming for 
And all of the dreamers must take, what's apart 
Only the good guys receive, what they came here for 
And all of you dreamers, will leave with a broken heart
