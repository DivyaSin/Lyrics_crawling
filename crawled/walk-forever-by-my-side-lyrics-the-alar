Walk forever by my side 
Never lose sight of the day When we will run through all our weakness 
On through the fields 
Strewn with our broken dreams 
Walk forever by my side Stay forever in the light 
Never lose sight of the way 
For I alone can't face the future 
I need your strength 
To help me make it through 
Walk forever by my side Stay forever in the light 
Walk on 'til morning 
All my days are yours 
Walk on 'til morning 
All my days are yours Hope you'll stay with me tonight 
Lift the veil from my eyes 
For I am weak and I am foolish 
I need your love 
To see me through the darkness 
Hope you'll stay with me tonight Walk on 'till morning 
All my days are yours 
Walk on 'till morning 
All my days are yours
