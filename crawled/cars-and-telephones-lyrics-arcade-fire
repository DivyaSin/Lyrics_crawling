I read the pages about me 
In her autobiography 
They were brief and to the point 
A flash, while you are getting dressed 
A memory that needs to be repressed 
I'll just wait until it's over Since you've gone away 
I never know just what to say 
Since you've gone away 
I never know just what to say Cause I like cars more than telephones 
Your voice in my ear makes me feel so alone 
Tonight I'm gonna drive 
The silver moon is shining bright 
Over the interstate 
God saying hurry don't be late 
Soon the sun will rise 
That's when the romance dies 
And I'm just tired of running around I walked 
To get the mail today 
I guess 
Your letter never came 
I'll just 
Check again tomorrow A flash while you are getting dressed 
A Memory that needs to be repressed 
I'll just wait without saying a word Since you've gone away 
I never know just what to say 
Since you've gone away 
I never know just what to say Cause I like cars more than telephones 
Your voice in my head makes me feel so alone 
Tonight I'm gonna drive 
The silver moon is shining bright 
Over the interstate 
God saying hurry don't be late 
Soon the sun will rise 
That's when the romance dies 
And I'm just tired of running around But fuck it I love you even if 
I'm gonna feel like shit 
By the time I get to you 
Now the sky is turning blue 
The stars they disappear 
One by one as the daylights nears 
And yes you're in my head 
But that doesn't make you here 
And I've lost all my friends 
But you're the one I miss the most 
And now I'm almost there 
Yeah I'm almost to the coast 
And if I had any notion 
Of how I'm gonna drive my car across 
the Atlantic Ocean, 
I'd be fucking set.
