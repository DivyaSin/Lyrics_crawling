Come on, pull out the radio for the sound 
The town, we been waitin' for, shakin' the ground 
The ground, the ground you best believe will get shook 
And a group, is gonna catch a fire cause what?

Everybody's been waitin' for the Peas to get on [Chorus]

Everlasting satisfaction 
Radioactive highway action 
System overload, heavily maxim' [Chorus x2]
