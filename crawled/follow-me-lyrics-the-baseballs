You don't know how you met me 
You don't know why 
You can't turn around and say good bye 
All you know is when I'm with you 
I make you free 
And swim through your veines 
Like a fish in the sea I'm singing 
Follow me and everything is alright 
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night 
And if you want to leave I can guarantee 
You won't find nobody else like me I'm not worried about the ring you wear 
Cause as long as no one knows 
That nobody can care 
You're feeling guilty 
And I am well aware 
But you don't look ashamed 
And baby I'm not scared I'm singing 
Follow me and everything is alright 
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night 
And if you want to leave I can guarantee 
You won't find nobody else like me Won't give you money 
I can't give you the sky 
You're better off if you don't ask why 
I'm not the reason that you going strange 
We'll be allright if you don't ask me to stay I'll be the one to tuck you in at night 
And if you want to leave I can guarantee 
You won't find nobody else like me You don't know how you met me 
You don't know why 
You can't turn around and say good bye 
All you know is when I'm with you 
I make you free 
And swim through your veines 
Like a fish in the sea ( 3x ) 
I'm singing 
Follow me and everything is alright 
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night 
And if you want to leave I can guarantee 
You won't find nobody else like me
