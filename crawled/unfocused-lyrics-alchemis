All my thoughts are unfocused. 
Help me focus the distorted - my 
Conscious span is spun all my thoughts 
Unfocused - a collage of thoughts in my 
Mind help me focus the distorted - 
Conscious span is spun protruding 
Exertion of concentration - perception 
Corruption is my frustration unbearably 
Undecided - undefined and uttered.
