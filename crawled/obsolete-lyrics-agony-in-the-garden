Verse Broken the moon 
Look what you've done 
We've fallen from grace 
Now there are none Waters they rise 
Now it's begun 
Wrestle your demon 
Your end it will come Chorus Throw your demon 
Into the sun, into the sun 
Throw your demon, into the sun 
'Til it's done 
Throw your demon 
One by one into the sun 
Throw down, it's done Verse Burning flames will shatter 
In a world made of stone 
Hear the dying children's laughter 
In a hell so new it's old Darkened sacred waters 
Go on and fill them with your name 
You can rise above the wreckage 
Go on and break your mortal chains Chorus Throw your demon 
Into the sun, into the sun 
Throw your demon 
'Til it's done 
Throw your demon 
One by one into the sun Break your demon 
Break your demon down 
Before, before the sun Broken and bleeding and 
Fighting and grieving and 
Kicking and screaming 
Into, into the sun
