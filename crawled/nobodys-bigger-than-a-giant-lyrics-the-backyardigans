Nobody's bigger than a giant 
Nobody's quite as large as me 
Nobody's bigger than a giant 
I'm humongous, wouldn't you agree? I'm large, I'm huge 
Enormous, tall and grand 
I can pick up your whole house 
And hold it in my hand I'm wider than a valley 
And taller than a tower 
I can lift an apple tree 
And sniff it like a flower I'm vast, immense 
Happy and gigantic 
I'm bigger than the oceans 
Pacific and Atlantic My hands can reach the planets 
My nose can sniff the clouds 
And when I stomp my giant feet 
The sound is really loud 'Cause nobody's bigger than a giant 
Nobody's quite as large as me 
Nobody's bigger than a giant 
I'm humongous, wouldn't you agree? 
I'm humongous, wouldn't you agree?
