If you like to play on the water 
Well so do I 
Float around on your back 
With the sun in your eyes 
I got a cooler full of cold ones 
What do ya say 
Let's spend the day on the bay Call up your girlfriends 
Bring em all along 
Everybody just loves it when 
They got their bikinis on 
And if things get a little crazy 
Well what can ya say 
It's just a day on the bay (Chorus) 
They got rockin' country music 
Life out on the barge 
And when the bands takes a break 
The radio comes on 
Blastin' fifty thousand watts above 
The air and water waves 
Everybody loves a day on the bay Boaters and inner tubes 
Cover the water blue 
I just can't imagine not sharin' this with you 
Someone check the anchor so we don't float away 
It's just a day on the bay (Instrumental) (Chorus) 
They got rockin' country music 
Life out on the barge 
And when the bands takes a break 
The radio comes on 
Blastin' fifty thousand watts above 
The air and water waves 
Everybody loves a day on the bay If you've never played on the water 
Then give it a whirl 
Float around on your back 
Not a care in the world 
Throw in some country music 
Then you've got it made 
Right at the day on the bay If you want to play on the water 
Just let me know 
We can head out and time you wanna go
