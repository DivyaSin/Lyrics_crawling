The midnight hour, I know you'll shine on through I promised myself, I promised I'll wait for you 
The midnight hour, I know you'll shine on through 
I promised myself, I promised the world to you 
I gave you flowers, you made my dreams come true How many of us out there

A brand new tomorrow where all you wish comes true 
I promised myself that I'd make it up to you 
My sister and brother know I'm in love with you How many of us out there 
Feel the pain of losing what was once there? I promised myself, I promised I'll wait for you 
The midnight hour, I know you'll shine on through 
I promised myself, I promised the world to you 
I gave you flowers, you made my dreams come true 
I promised myself
