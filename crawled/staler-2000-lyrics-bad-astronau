I'm only waving to get out of the way 
I know that the check in avoids the pain 
and I'm only lying to the one's that suggest it 
If ever I was missed, you know that I caved All I know is you came too quickly 
and left the same 
I couldn't believe it when you stayed 
I just knew you were leaving soon Enough you're so anxious 
praying on the breaking news 
and now the sun goes down to soon 
I'm only staring at your eyes dear 
to think of a reason why mine cry I wanna get you back 
so I can give you away 
Head filled with ego 
heart filled with fame
