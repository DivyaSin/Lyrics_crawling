If you're on a highway and roadrunner goes "beep beep", 
Just step aside or you might end up in a heap 
Roadrunner, roadrunner runs on the road all day, 
Even the coyote can't make him change his ways Roadrunner, that coyote's after you 
Roadrunner, if he catches you you're through 
That coyote's really a crazy clown, 
When will he learn that he never can hold you down? Roadrunner, roadrunner never bothers anyone 
Running down the road's his idea of having fun 
Roadrunner, that coyote's after you 
Roadrunner, if he catches you you're through 
Roadrunner, roadrunner that coyote's after you 
Roadrunner, if he catches you you're through If he catches you you're through 
If he catches you you're through 
If he catches you you're through.
