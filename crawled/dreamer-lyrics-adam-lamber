You see the worst of me now 
I'm all alone see 
You lost me somehow 
And what we're fighting for is peace 
Are you still in love with me? 
Or someone else?..... Well, are you such a dreamer? 
Put yourself in my shoes 
Carefull what you wish for love Uhhh! Uhhh! Uhhh! I've seen the worst of you too 
I let it go see 
Because I have to 
And well I'm falling on my kness 
You'll take my hand in yours 
What will be, we'll be..... Cause are you such a dreamer? 
Put yourself in my shoes 
Carefull what you wish for love 
Uhhh! What's the matter with our ways 
I'm missing something, not to blame 
But you don't worry , this will pass 
It's only cause my mind's been spinning No control, I've lost my head 
All of this is just begining 
Not enough, It's never enough 
I'll only want to keep on dreaming Cause are you such a dreamer? 
Put yourself in my shoes 
Carefull what you wish for love 
Uhhh! Cause are you such a dreamer? 
Put yourself in my shoes 
Carefull what you wish for love 
Uhhh! Uhhh! Uhhh!
