Music for a future age 
Don't be square be there 
All good clean fun 
(Whatever that means) 
Antmusic for sexpeople 
Sexmusic for antpeople 
Get off your knees 
And hear the insect prayer 
Dirk wears White Sox 
The brain will suffer So ride hard ride clean 
How reputations scare 
And love goes to war 
(Whatever that means) 
Antmusic for sexpeople 
Sexmusic for antpeople 
Get off your knees 
And hear the insect prayer 
You may not like it now but you will 
(The future will not stand still)
