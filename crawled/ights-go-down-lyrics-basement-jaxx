When the lights go down 
That's when we bust just a little 
Bust just a little more 
When the lights go down, down 
That's when I die just a little 
Wanna get high just a little more When the curtain falls 
And there's no more applause 
When the party's over 
And there's no one to hold ya 
Look inside yourself and find 
Your own light in your mind When the lights go down 
That's when we bust just a little 
Bust just a little more 
When the lights go down 
That's when I die just a little 
Wanna get high just a little more When the curtain falls 
And there's no more applause 
When the party's over 
And there's no one to hold ya 
Look inside yourself and find 
Your own light in your mind
