Midnight 
Not a sound from the pavement 
Has the moon lost her memory 
She is smiling alone 
In the lamplight 
The withered leaves collect at my feet 
And the wind begins to moan Memory, all alone in the moonlight 
I can dream of the old days 
Life was beautiful then 
I remember the time I knew what happiness was 
Let the memory live again 
Every street lamp seems to beat 
A fatalistic warning 
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters 
And soon it will be morning Daylight 
I must wait for the sunrise 
I must think of a new life 
And I mustn't give in 
When the dawn comes 
Tonight will be a memory, too 
And a new day will begin Burnt out ends of smoky days 
The stale court smell of morning 
A street lamp dies 
Another night is over 
Another day is dawning
