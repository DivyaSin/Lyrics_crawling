so wait 
is this my delusion 
im being left by my only friend 
come clean and just tell me the answer 
do you know what you have done 
fuck you and your life 
im wondering just what to do 
ive got nothing here now 
so leave it 
with someone who might really care to hear this 
your worthless case so fake 
your comments false and lucid 
cautious of words that rarely leave your mouth 
rethink the choices you made in emotion 
what you do 
just might destroy 
the lives of those you call friends 
did you lose sight in my absense 
in your persuit you left us all behind 
the face you always look to for answers 
becomes an anthem a fit a rage when you lost your mind 
i lost the will 
i cant change anything for anyone but me 
sometimes i think i cant go on 
well these wounds are mine 
dont try to say that this was just about you 
ignore the impulse to break down the process enough 
to just sit back and watch me drown its true we all want to be alone 
youve got no right to walk away 
seems you who never had 
a choice is now the one with no remorse 
sad to see such irony is lost on you 
because those who forget where they came from 
soon fall back to where they used to be 
i'll keep my eyes open to watch you hit the ground 
you deserve your wretched past
