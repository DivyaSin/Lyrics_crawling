You're the one that I ran to 
You had no rival 
You were my bible more fire than flame 
All the loving you gave me 
That one-off feeling 
Left while we were sleeping 
Then down came rain We're praying come back love 
Come back, all's forgiven 
Come back love 
We still burn more fire than flame You're the stop that I came to 
The good time station 
With no regulation and no masquerade 
All you have aroused in me is my suspicion 
By your own admission your eyes have strayed You have been good for me 
I never said it 
You deserve more credit 
I still need you
