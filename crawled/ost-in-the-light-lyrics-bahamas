I'm lost in the light 
I pray for the night 
To take me, to take me to After so many words 
Still nothing's heard 
Don't know what we should do So if someone can see me now, let them see you It was my greatest thrill 
But we just stood still 
You let me hold your hand 'til I had my thrill Even countin' sheep 
Don't help me sleep 
I just toss and turn right there beside you So if someone could help me now, they'd help you too. They'd help you to 
See you through 
All the hard things we've all gotta do 
'Cause this life is long 
And so you wouldn't be wrong Bein' free you and me on my own! And I held my own 
Still I rattled your bones 
I said some awful things and I take them back If we would try again 
Just remember when 
Before we were lovers, I swear we were friends So if someone could see me now let them see you Let them see you 
See you through 
All the hard things we've all gotta do 
'Cause this life is long 
So you wouldn't be wrong 
Bein' free here with me on my own!
