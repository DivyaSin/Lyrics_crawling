When he turned 18 
There was only one thing 
That he'd think about all the time 
With a scoop on the hood 
And a thundering roar, 
When you power shift overdrive 
Up on the hill 
With a head full of dreams, 
"That'll be me one day" 
When the chequered flag 
Would bring 'em all home, 
This is what the kid would say Now he's 25 got his own car, 
No. 1 painted on the side 
He may be young and he may be small, 
But you ought to see him drive 
Tearing it up through Conrod straight, 
Tyres chirpin' every gear, 
If you listen close 
To what the kid's got to say, 
This is what you're gonna hear Now I've got my wheels watch me drive right by, You can eat my dust and try to keep up 
Man I'd like to see you try, I'll have my pedal 
To the metal my claw to the floor 
And I'm always out sight, Now I got my wheels 
And I won't even wave goodbye 
(And this is me waving goodbye)
