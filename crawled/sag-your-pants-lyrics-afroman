let it go 
wha, cmon 
somebody say heeeyyy 
im just playin Before Palmdale, we use to stay 
deep in the hood where they sell yay 
i seen a gangbanger walk by real fast 
brand new khakis hangin off his ass 
at first, i didnt like the chump 
cause he looked like he needed to go take a dump 
but everybody sag in the hood 
pretty soon, it started lookin good 
1987 i started stoppin my mama from doin my school shoppin 
mama, love you right 
but these wranglers too dam tight 
stay home, cook something to eat 
daddy, take me to the SWAP meet 
walkin through the SWAP meet wit a jerri curl 
tryn to get somethin from the home girl 
Joseph, i love you right 
but them wranglers is too dam tight 
okay ima give you a chance 
but first... [Chorus:] [2x] 
Sag yo pants 
Do that gangsta dance walk, walk, walk, walkowww who invited saggin, take a guess 
i dont know but he from the west 
remember them old school rappers right 
like run dmc, they pants was tight 
dont get me wrong, i luv N. W.A. 
but they wasnt saggin the right way 
saggin come from the L.A. streets 
SWAP meets, old school beats 
move to the suburbs of Palmdale 
Kept on saggin hard as hell 
had a cool step, plus a bad rep 
didnt fit in with the preppy prep 
they crack little jokes, look down they nose 
but now they smoke weed and wear baggy clothes 
play rap music, dance and drink beer 
shit we been doin for years [Chorus:] [2x] 
Sag yo pants 
Do that gangsta dance walk, walk, walk, walkowww I sag my daddy, i sag my mama 
i got to bed and sag my pajama 
sag at home, sag in church 
sag wit the homies in the police search 
sag at work, sag at school 
sag in the airport fool 
sag when i stayin, sag when i bail 
sag when i out the county jail 
sag in the SWAP meet, sag in court 
sag when i hop out the super sport 
sag when im playin basket ball 
"pull yo pants up joey" hell naw 
sag wit my kids, sag wit my wife 
i cant stop saggin, ima sag for life 
Fist Palmdale sager, i dont bang 
but i still let, my khakis hang 
sag bold, sag nervous 
sag when im doin community service 
sag when i mac, sag when i brawl 
i bet ya 20 dollars my pants dont fall [Chorus:] [2x] 
Sag yo pants 
Do that gangsta dance walk, walk, walk, walkowww
