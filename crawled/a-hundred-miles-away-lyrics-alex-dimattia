I'm chasing after a wild thing 
With so much left to say 
And she's chasing after a wild dream 
A hundred miles away A hundred miles away 
A hundred miles away When it comes to love 
You don't have to pay to play 
Yes when it comes to love 
You can't choose 
You'll pay when you lose 
And we're all going to lose 
One day A hundred miles away 
She's just a 
A hundred miles away 
But it might as well be 
A century, a century 
I said it might as well be 
A century Don't give your heart to a wild thing 
I heard Holly say 
But I'm afraid it's far too late for me 
To be saved by Tiffany's A hundred miles away 
She's just a 
A hundred miles away 
But it might as well be 
I said it might as well be 
It might as well be 
A century
