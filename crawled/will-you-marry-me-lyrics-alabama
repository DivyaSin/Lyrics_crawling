I come here today, I'm kind of nervous 
You know how words get in my way 
It should come easy, I've been rehearsing 
I don't know why I'm so afraid, to say Will you marry me 
Put our love and life together 
Will you stay with me 
For always and forever 
On bended knee, would you take this ring 
Will you marry me, please 
Will you marry me To be with you is what I live for 
But at this moment I confess 
Though I love you, God knows I love you 
Deep down inside I'm scared to death, say yes Will you marry me 
Put our love and life together 
Will you stay with me 
For always and forever 
On bended knee, would you take this ring 
Will you marry me, please 
Will you marry me
