Well, he walks right, he talks right 
Knows what makes them girls feel fine 
He's got a way with women 
And he just got away with mine He drives a big car like a big star 
Plays a guitar that bluesy kind 
He's got a way with women 
And he just got away with mine No, he didn't ride up wearin' shinin' armor 
Ridin' on a milk white steed 
But he gave 'em quite a performance 
This I must concede, yes, yes [Chorus] No, he didn't ride up wearin' shinin' armor 
Ridin' on a milk white steed 
But he gave 'em quite a performance 
This I must concede, yes, yes [Chorus] Gonna say one more time 
'Cause this gentlemen is so darn smooth 
He's got a way with women 
And he just got away with mine
