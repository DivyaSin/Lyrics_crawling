Now I never thought 
That I'd be losing sleep at night over you 
Now I don't know what to do I promised myself 
That I would not cry over you 
Now I feel it all inside Thoughts of you 
Keep driving me crazy 
And if I don't sleep 
Then it won't even faze me Some people call it love 
I call it sprung on you Here we go, here we go 
I'm coming again 
You got me messed up, baby 
I'm sprung on it Here we go, here we go 
I'm coming again 
You got me messed up, baby 
I'm sprung on it I thought it would be easy 
To get over you 
Now I see that it's not in me I think I'm going crazy 
Going out of my mind trying to find 
Someone to take your place Thoughts of you 
Keep driving me crazy 
And if I don't sleep 
Then it won't even faze me Some people call it love 
I call it sprung on you Here we go, here we go 
I'm coming again 
You got me messed up, baby 
I'm sprung on it Here we go, here we go 
I'm coming again 
You got me messed up, baby 
I'm sprung on it When I'm all alone 
There ain't nothing I can do 
All I do is think of you 
Ain't about to take my mind off you You got me going 'round and 'round 
My whole world's upside down 
Let me love you, baby 
Let me love you Here we go, here we go Here we go, here we go 
I'm coming again 
You got me messed up 
I'm sprung on it Here we go, here we go 
I'm coming again 
You got me messed up 
I'm sprung on it Here we go, here we go 
I'm coming again 
You got me messed up 
I'm sprung on it Here we go, here we go 
I'm coming again 
You got me messed up 
I'm sprung on it Here we go, here we go 
I'm coming again 
You got me messed up 
I'm sprung on it
