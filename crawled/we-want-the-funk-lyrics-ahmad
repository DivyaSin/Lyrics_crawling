{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} 
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} [Repeat x4] 
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} 
{We want the funk!} Dig it the mic is mine I'm the incredible man, with the gift of gab 
And when I speak you'll be doin' the freak 
So if, you don't want the funk then you a punk 
Everybody out of they chairs should go for theirs, and 
If you can find anyone better or as bad as mine 
That's thick as a dreadlock and rocks like Lenny Kravitz 
Then you done great, you done good 
Wait I hope they told you, I'll explode to any track 
I'm back on top, ready to drop bombs 
I'm the only rapper that can rap like this, then do the twist 
So hold up wait a minute let put the boom back in it 
To show the Joneses can win it, and that's my crew 
That's my clan, that's my posse 
The niggaz with the funky tunes, turn up the volume 
All you ballers, with your six-four Impalas 
And bass comin' out of your trunk, you better holla if you want the funk [Repeat x4] 
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} 
{We want the funk!} Word now everybody get up, then sit back down and yell (ho!) 
The niggarole's back with a verse and it gets worse 
By worse I mean better than you and I can do 
Crews and never lose in fights because I write 
And flip scripts I rip up punks and do a cheer 
Think I'd ring the funk bell yell (party over here!) 
Now peep what I wrought and maybe I even got 
A million funk styles for ya bay-bay 
In stacks so when I rap the claps come 
Through I'm new but been hearin' cheers for years and 
Fear is a mind state, I rip up raps and do up dance stuff 
The great Ahmad, if you agree then nod 
Your head like this or like that I can rap with anyone 
And still won't fall, I do it all 
So y'all kids with tapes on your shelves and 
Twelves boomin' out of your trunk, you better yell if you want the funk [Repeat x6] 
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} 
{We want the funk!} Well I'm still kickin' the funk, don't believe it you don't have to 
But, bet a buck, you gon' believe it when I leave it stuck 
Imprinted, through a rhyme I invented 
To indent your skull cause I got SOUL 
Everybody get ready, then set go and when I let go 
Of the microphone, get your jam on 
But one more thing before I sing cause I'm fat 
And ask for you please get off your rump 
And scream if you want the funk [Repeat x4] 
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} 
{We want the funk!} [Repeat x8] 
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} 
{Party over here, bust you over there} 
{Party over here, bust you over there} [Repeat x2] 
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} {If you didn't come to dance..} {We want the funk!} [Repeat x8] 
{Give me that funky baby, give me that funk} 
{We want the funk!} {If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} 
{We want the funk!}
