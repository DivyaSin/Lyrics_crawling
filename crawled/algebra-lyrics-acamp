Why can't you just 
Forget about algebra 
It's all about you now 
And all your talk 
Of logic and formula 
Could never help you now 
Not anymore Cause you were always 
On the run 
From the darkness 
In your heart 
So you wear it 
On the outside 
Of your chest I have taken 
The liberty 
To tell your ghost to go 
Bribing them with 
Sunlight and sympathy 
They promised not to show 
For a while Cause you were always 
The little boy 
Who couldn't keep it 
To yourself 
So your heart 
Is on the outside 
Of your chest At the speed of light 
You moved inside my home 
Nothing is alright 
If you are still alone And your heart 
Is greater than 
The sum of you 
And everyone But still you're always 
On the run 
From the poison 
In your lungs 
And your heart 
Is on the outside 
Of your chest
