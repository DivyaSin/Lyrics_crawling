Oh Calling tears from deep inside 
Oh, you're so exquisite 
And in the mirror, all midnight eyes 
Oh, if I could remain, but it's just a visit 
All midnight eyes, read vacancy Twisted 
Twisted To the lovely dancing lights 
I begged, may I cut in? 
But they never stopped, playing their song 
Of a joyous song they sing 
I've heard whispers 
On a freezing note, I resonate Just like romantic verses 
Just like a joyous end 
Just like a memory, it twists me Just like romantic verses 
Just like a joyous end, twisting me You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic 
Onto the melting boy and melt away 
You light as gently you're so, cinematic 
Bathed in your radiance, I melt 
Oh In the glitter, in the dark 
Sunk into velvet, praying this will never end 
In the shadow of a star, in static pallor 
I realized I never began Just like romantic verses 
Just like a joyous end 
Just like a memory, it twists me Just like romantic verses 
Just like a joyous end, twisting me You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic 
Onto the melting boy and melt away 
You light as gently you're so, cinematic 
Bathed in your radiance, I melt All the colors upon leaving, all will turn to gray 
All the colors upon leaving, all will turn to gray 
All the colors upon leaving, all will turn to gray 
All the colors upon leaving, all will turn to gray Twisting me You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic 
Onto the melting boy and melt away 
You light as gently you're so, cinematic 
Bathed in your radiance, I melt You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic 
You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic 
Onto the melting boy and melt away 
You light as gently you're so, cinematic 
Bathed in your radiance, I melt
