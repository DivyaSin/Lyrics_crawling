i don't mind if you hate monday 
we can make it just like a saturday 
and all the fuss and whine will over 
as we drive in to the madness 
with breakfast on the go 
we'll din on city light 
did't i tell you to just sit back 
cause my girl, they all don't matter (any longer) 
cause you don't even have to try 
you've already my number one 
i don't need the mellow tunes 
and all the lines you've wasted over me 
i don't mind if time goes to soon 
we'll stay up all night and make it slower 
and when the morning comes between us 
we'll just get ready to start it over
