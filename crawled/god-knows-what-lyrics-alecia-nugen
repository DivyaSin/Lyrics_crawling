Long after the last train rolled out of town 
I had to find out if the world was round 
So I left Louisiana, big city bound 
Looking for god knows what Mama gave me her bible and choked back the tears 
Said, girl, it so easy to get lost out there 
Every night I'll remember you in my prayers 
While you're looking for god knows what God knows what I was after 
God knows what was on my mind 
Every step I took fell faster 
Everything I left behind 
Turned into the greener pastures 
What will I find after all this time 
Coming back from god knows what Pride tastes bitter and dreams got hard 
It's tough to admit but at least that's a start 
Took along way around but that old backyard 
Beats the devil out of god knows what God knows what I was after 
God knows what was on my mind 
Every step I took fell faster 
Everything I left behind 
Turned into the greener pastures 
What will I find after all this time 
Coming back from god knows what I was after 
God knows what was on my mind 
Every step I took fell faster 
Everything I left behind 
Turned into the greener pastures 
What will I find after all this time 
Coming back from god knows what God knows what (god knows what) 
God knows what
