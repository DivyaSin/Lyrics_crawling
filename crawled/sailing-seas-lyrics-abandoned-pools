Damn this destiny and damn this twist of fate 
And damn its 5 A.M. and I'm still awake 
You're haunting me, I know it's hypocrisy 
But this is not easy and this is not what we were supposed to be So haunt me 
You should know that I'll be 
Sailing seas of regret 
I can't listen to that CD anymore To hell with irony, to hell with subtlety 
'Cause I don't have time to mince words anymore 
I was there, I'm crouched down in the hall 
My ear up to the wall, I can hear you forgetting about me So haunt me 
You should know that I'll be 
Sailing seas of regret 
I can't listen to that CD anymore Haunt me, wasn't very easy 
When he took you from me 
And I can't listen to that CD anymore 
Since you walked out my door Was it certain death 
When he took off your dress 
When he finished your cigarettes So haunt me 
You should know that I'll be 
Sailing seas of regret 
I can't listen to that CD anymore Haunt me 
Wasn't very easy 
When he took you from me 
I can't listen to that CD anymore
