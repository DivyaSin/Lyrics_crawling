The biggest lie you ever told 
Your deepest fear 'bout growin' old 
The longest night you ever spent, 
The angriest letter you never sent 
The boy you swore you'd never leave 
The one you kissed on new years's eve 
The sweetest dream you had last night, 
Your darkest hour, your hardest fight I wanna know you like I know myself 
I'm waitin' for you there ain't no one else 
Talk to me baby scream and shout 
I want to know you inside out 
I wanna dig down deep I wanna lose some sleep 
I wanna scream and shout I wanna know you inside out 
I wanna take my time I wanna know your mind 
Ya know there ain't no doubt I wanna know you inside out The saddest song you ever heard the most you said with just one word 
The loneliest prayer you ever prayed the truest vow you ever made 
What makes you laugh, what makes you cry what makes you mad, what gets you by 
You highest height, your lowest low these things I want to know I wanna know you, like I know myself 
I'm waitin' for you, there ain't no one else 
Talk to me baby, scream and shout 
I want to know you, inside out 
I wanna dig down deep, I wanna lose some sleep 
I wanna scream and shout, I wanna know you inside out 
I wanna take my time, I wanna know your mind 
Ya know there ain't no doubt, I wanna know you inside out 
I wanna know your soul, I wanna lose control 
Come on n' let it out, I wanna know you inside out 
Ya gotta dig down deep, I wanna lose some sleep 
I wanna scream and shout, I wanna know you inside out 
Tell me everything
