Hold me when I'm down 
Bury my soul underneath the ground 
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
Shining like a chandelier What's a song if it don't have words? 
What's the word if it don't get heard 
You can paint it anyway that you like 
How can you get the picture if it come out blurred 
What life taught me can't be unlearned 
And every bridge can't be unburned 
You can't wait 'til you get your turn 
I could try to make it home but you're still on third 
Look, your whole life need a renovation 
Yea, let me give you a demonstration 
No limitations, no intimidation 
I'm tryna live good, that's an understatement 
They say life's about choices 
In the face of defeat I declined 
Put your soul into everything, never back down 
That's how you leave a legacy behind Hold me when I'm down 
Bury my soul underneath the ground 
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
Shining like a chandelier Hold me when I'm down 
Bury my soul underneath the ground 
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
Shining like a chandelier The world don't stop so we don't quit 
The show goes on, tomorrow's here today 
So live your life and do your thing 
Enjoy each moment, it could slip away 
'Cause nothing is promised, nothing is free 
There ain't no receipts or guarantees 
When it's done, there will be no severance fee 
Just a far away dream you've yet to reach 
That's why you have to go all out for it 
No half-time, gotta ball out for it 
Full court press, life is the test 
Can't play sick, can't call out for it 
'Cause I don't wanna fall, no skydive 
Stand tall through it all, that's a high rise 
Make a something out of absolutely nothing 
That's the definition of a survivor Hold me when I'm down 
Bury my soul underneath the ground 
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
Shining like a chandelier Hold me when I'm down 
Bury my soul underneath the ground 
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
Shining like a chandelier So let me be like the trees 
Where I can rustle my leaves 
To join the wind in the sky 
If this was all a mistake, I'd rather leave this place 
Than be a breathing lie Hold me when I'm down 
Bury my soul underneath the ground 
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
Shining like a chandelier Just keep me shining like a chandelier 
Just keep me shining like a chandelier Hold me when I'm down 
Bury my soul underneath the ground 
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
Shining like a chandelier
