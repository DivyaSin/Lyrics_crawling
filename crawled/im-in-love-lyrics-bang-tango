Darlin', does it feel good? 
Darlin', does it feel good? 
I'm waitin', waitin' for you 
I'm waitin' up in your room 'Cause I'm in love, I'm in love 
Perfection is under your skin 
Well, your affection should be a sin You tie, you tie, you tie, you tie me down 
I love it so, I love it so, so I'll stick around 
Take me Darlin', I miss your sweet lips 
Miss them so 
Need to feel your mouth, need the touch
