Yesterday, came in your eyes, I caught a glimpse of tomorrow 
And that's when I realized, that dreams come true. 
For you love there's nothing I would not do. 
Do I love you? Baby, I do. 
That's why, I'd sail across the ocean, bring you the sun. 
With you I see forever, you are the one. 
Girl, you're everything I need and more. 
You are my everything, my everything. 
For sure. My heart, beats for you. 
You are a light in the darkness. 
You make me feel brand new, 
And looking in your eyes, 
I can tell you feel the same way too. 
Do I love you? Baby, I do. I'd sail across the ocean, bring you the sun. 
With you I see forever, you are the one. 
Girl, you're everything I need and more. 
You are my everything, my everything. 
For sure. Wish I may, wish I might, 
To have you here in my arms for the rest of my life. 
I pray that you'll stay in my heart for always. I'd sail across the ocean, bring you the sun. 
With you I see forever, you are the one. 
Girl, you're everything I need and more. 
You are my everything, my everything. 
For sure.
