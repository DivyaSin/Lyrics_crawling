waiting for the one. all your life been waiting, but will it ever come? time, it only speaks to your in questions, never answers. cry yourself to sleep. in the waking hours of hopelessness, you pray for some relief. the world knows how you're feeling and remembers, but never told you. waiting, waiting. you will find your love, and you will be loved. waiting, waiting. you will find your love, and you will be loved again. waiting always hurts, when you know just what you're wanting and it's out of your grasp. fate, it only speaks to you in riddles, not solutions.
