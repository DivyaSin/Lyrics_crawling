There's a box under his bed 
that he never opens up 
but tonight he pulls it out 
cause he's come to look for 
evidence of what he fears: 
senseless tears 
wasted years 
he pulls some relics out 
studies each and every one 
he reads between the lines 
one more time before he 
breaks the spell that held him down 
those sentences that 
sentenced him Does nothing last? 
The setting sun becomes a sinking ship; 
chained to the helmlooks like he's going down... A love like that 
never should have come 
never should have gone As he feeds them to the fire 
one 
by 
one 
he's dimly aware 
he may have learned a thing or two 
but tuition wasn't cheap 
and he's only got these 
foggy notions of what he paid 
as he's burning records of a 
debt of love
