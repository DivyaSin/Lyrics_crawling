Voices, do you, do you 
Ever hear voices? 
Do you ever hear voices 
From the dark recesses of your mind? Voices, do you, do you 
Ever hear voices? 
Do you ever hear voices 
Gnawing pain, driving you slowly mad? They're always different 
They never sound the same 
The dark side is beckoning me back again The phone won't stop ringing 
Causing me endless agony 
These voices in my head are always taunting me I'm in my room 
They've got me locked away 
Nothing outside could fill all these days I'm Jimi Hendrix 
I'm Elvis the King 
I know the federal government is watching me Voices, do you 
Do you ever hear voices? 
Do you ever hear voices 
From the dark recesses of your mind? Voices, do you, do you 
Ever hear voices? 
Do you ever hear voices 
Gnawing pain, driving you slowly mad? My life has been taken over 
By a part of my mind 
Sanity has never been so far away Reality and nightmare 
Melt into one 
This constant ringing/screaming in my head won't leave me alone Curled up on the floor 
Four walls and a bed 
Me, myself and the voices in my head 
Curled up on the floor 
Four walls and a bed 
Me, myself and the voices in my head 
Curled up on the floor 
Four walls and a bed 
Me, myself and the voices in my head 
Curled up on the floor 
Four walls and a bed 
Me, myself and the voices in my head
