Everybody's here 
With a face in the crowd 
No more lookin' back 
Strung out junkies 
Computerized monkeys 
Waitin' for the place to get packed 
I don't need no doctor 
No one's got the cure for me 
Cause I'm a heartbreaker 
And a soulshaker 
Since 1973 
Star war 
So watcha waitin' for? 
I'm runnin' down the stairs 
So I won't get stabbed 
But that's alright with me 
Me me me 
Meanwhile them supernatural freaks 
Fingerprints my fee 
So put food on the table 
Some money if you're able 
No one's got the cure for me 
Cause I'm a heartbreaker and a soulshaker 
Since 1973 
Food on the table 
Some money if you're able 
Meanwhile back in Jack N' coke stable 
Cause it's a star war 
Star war 
So watcha waitin' for? 
Go go go!
