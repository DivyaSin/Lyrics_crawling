I can't think 
I can't sleep 
Can't stay steady on my feet 
I can't talk 
Can't say shit 
Can't do anything about it Don't know what I wanna do 
But I wanna do it with you The clock is wrong 
The face don't fit 
Should I fight or should I quit 
O my o my 
A crying shame 
You don't wanna play the game
