She was always walking, singing to her footsteps 
Dirt ditch paths and pine cones digging up glass bottles 
Rusty springs from feather beds, old hubcaps on the picket fence 
She planted beds of flowers, stayed outside for hours In spirit she's drifted to the ocean 
All those years of waiting for the water 
She's watching long shadows caught in the tide 
But the sunset by the sea is in her mind 
The sunset by the sea is in her mind And she was always hoping to someday leave the mountain 
Domestic chores and children, the darkness of the winter 
Painting all these mermaids wandering to the sea shore 
She wanted him to follow but his heart is with the hillside In spirit she's drifted to the ocean 
All those years of waiting for the water 
She's watching long shadows caught in the tide 
But the sunset by the sea is in her mind 
The sunset by the sea is in her mind
