Don't know what you're doing to me - but I like it 
You don't know how you're teasing me - but I like it 
Like it ... You came and ripped me up inside 
It's a longing I can't hide 
I don't know what you do, but I think I like it 
Like it The way you make me feel inside - I can't hide it 
I'm burning up but I don't know why - but I like it 
Like it Falling into million pieces 
Falling into million pieces 
Take me up and put me back together 
Like it
