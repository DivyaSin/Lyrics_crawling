experience, so you know it's gonna be some mega shit, so who is that (KM.G) 
KM.G will never be a trick 
Step up to the mic like a baller then I pimp this gift 
That only I possess 
I illustrated that way to get the shit off my chest 
I'm ghetto raise to amaze the crowd, it's quite simple 
Km.G has degrees from Unity of South Central 
I'm a graduate and it's all legit 
From the pimping, the ballin' and all that good shit 
I have the mega balls in which I speak in a slang 
While I'm peeking it wit the G's from the Ruthless gang 
Ain't nuttin change but the weather like I said before 
'Cause I'm living like hustlers and I'm checking galore 
Yo, I have to give it up to the D.O.C. 
A Ruthless brother who's down wit the KM.G 
So all hail to the niggas that's turning it out 
And maybe then, I'll take the gun barrel out of your mouth Knowledge from one generation to another, perserve 
and then transmitted, get it, done the Ruthless way, 
You know what I'm saying, so what's up Dre (Dr. Dre) 
Now I'm a swinger, I'm not a muthafuking singer 
But I bringa melody that always seems to ring a 
Bell as well, let's make it so you can tell 
Yo, it's coming from Compton where the ballers dwell 
'Cause I'm Dre, the muthafuking doctor causing propaganda 
When I'm on the mic, I demand a 
Little bit of time to express myself 
From ?(cedian)? wax, kicking the facts and it's like that 
A nigga wit a muthafuking attitude 
You know the deal, kicking some real shit 
And if a sucker ever thinks he can get some 
Yo, step off, I'm kicking lyrics for the deaf and the dumb 
But any occasion, getting the bitches wit the mega persuasion 
Then my dick starts top make an invasion 
But, yo, I can't go on 
Because this is the end of my part on the last song Real G from the streets, villianous when he speaks 
For all you busters who can't deal, give it up for real (MC Ren) 
Now when you see me, you're ducking and slipping, yo, then you fell 
down 
You fucked up and finally figured who was the cell down 
Pulling the pulls, crotching the bull 
The weak muthafuker was smelling like shit so I guess that they're full 
Of it, and I love it when I dress like a crook 
Wit a "I don't give a fuck" look 
The villain was something nuff like a hero 
Jacking all the niggas wit beef, off of relief, I mean the zeros 
The rest of the 100% was sent to do what I say 
NWA and ATL and we don't play 
The DOC is doing it, oh, so correctly 
See, I broke it down for the ones who try to check me 
But I can't be check 'cause I'm the checker 
When you see a nigga wreck believe that I'm the wrecker 
The right and for the fight and the left will attend 
We're doing wrong, MC Ren is on the last song From a genius to temporary insanity, the ganster's dream 
The bitches fanasty, Ruthless, so now we've come to the payoff (Eazy-E) 
One muthafuking two muthafuking three 
It's the hip-hop thugster Eazy-E 
So I grab the mic and then I clear my throat 
First nigga kicking lyrics in a straightcoat 
It's Eazy for me to come off like this 
So you can kiss my ass where the sun rays miss 
Or just give me the pussy and I'll be straight 
And if you don't, fuck it, I'll masterbate 
(We wanta fuck you Eazy) yea, you bitches scream 
Now bow down and praise the lord for the wing ding 
I got skill to deal and run game on bitches 
You can tell that I'm sick by the triple sixes 
I hear voices in my head for what reason 
But when the talking stops (pow) it's drive by season 
So back the fuck off and give me respect 
Now they're shipping me off 'cause Eazy played wit a half deck Criminal in his thoughts, murderous in his lyrics 
The notorious Cold (Cold 187um) 
187um, you know I gotta have it 
Now being above the law is an everyday habit 
If you think I drop some pimp shit, I ain't 
Perhaps I'll say a couple rhymes to make the bitches faint 
Now everybody wants to chill, ill 
And bill, now what the fuck is the deal 
You need a nigga like me to get the shit going 
187um has got the ultimate flowing 
Now it's time for me to go off like a maniac 
Run up for cover 'cause I'm on the ?(adidnac)? 
An untouchable player rolled up into one mind 
87 reasons why fools staying in line 
'Cause I ain't the average nigga behind the trigger 
I lay and spray anything in my way 
'Cause I'm a balls player for the streets of South Central 
believe what you want but soon you'll eventually see 
That ATL is straight to mega 
Don't be surprise 'cause we played ya like Sega 
And these bodies keep dropping, you see me keep moving on 
Peace, I'm outta here 'cause this is the last song Shout outs
