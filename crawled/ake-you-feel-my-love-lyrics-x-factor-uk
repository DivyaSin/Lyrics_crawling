When the rain is blowin' in your face 
And the whole world is on your case 
I could offer you a warm embrace 
To make you feel my love When evenin' shadows and the stars appear 
And there is no one there to dry your tears 
I could hold you for a million years 
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet 
But I would never do you wrong 
I've known it from the moment that we met 
No doubt in my mind where you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue 
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue 
Oh, there's nothin' that I wouldn't do 
To make you feel my love The storms are ragin' on the rollin' sea 
And on the highway of regret 
The winds of change are blowin' wild and free 
You ain't seen nothin' like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true 
Nothin' that I wouldn't do 
Go to the ends of the earth for you 
To make you feel my love
