First day 
high school 
being cool was a golden rule 
didn't matter what anyone else would say New shirts that our mommas' bought 
we were thinking we were mighty hot 
my chest sighed 
we were feelin like cash was free 
undesputed champions of the hallway And we were all heroes 
legends in our own minds 
chasing down dreams on friday nights 
cruisin' down the back roads 
singin' to the radio 
we were all heroes 
you might say stole the keys to my daddy's truck 
that tough old man 
I was pushing my luck 
the things you do to impress the boys with six cold old beer 
and three good friends 
a George Strait tape that never ends 
the starry nights and country girls 
no better time in this whole world We were all heroes 
legends in our own minds 
chasing down dreams on friday nights 
cruisin' down the back roads 
singin' to the radio 
we were all heroes 
you might say And I still think about those days 
but we grew up and things changed We were all heroes 
legends in our own minds 
chasing down dreams on friday nights 
cruisin' down the back roads 
singin' to the radio 
we were all heroes 
you might say You might say We were all heroes
