Fisheater got a fish in his hand 
Goes down to the bakery to see the baker man 
Says, "Even before I got your door 
I liked the way you smelled" Fisheater says to the baker man, 
"Bake me a fish cake fast as you can 
Well I don't know the ingredients 
But I know the way it tastes" Fish in the water 
Fisheater on land 
The fish mouth's connected 
To the fisherman's hand Fisheater says, "Please add a little crunch 
I go reeling from the feeling when I munch on my lunch 
You know I would prefer pecans 
But I'd abide by walnuts too" Fisheater asks "Can you shape it like a star?" 
Baker man says "That'll be an extra charge 
A dime less six would be for/four sense/cents 
And sensibility/centsibility(?)" It's indirect ascension 
This path from sea to land 
Because what was the fish meat 
Is now become the man
