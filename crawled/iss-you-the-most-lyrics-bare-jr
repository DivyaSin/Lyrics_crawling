You're over me 
But you forgot to tell me 
And I am yours completely 
But that don't mean a hill of beans 
And though you lay 
Right next to me 
Your heart has done hit the street 
And I miss you the most 
When you are close 
You don't laugh 
At my jokes any more 
Am I that much of a bore 
Seems like you left 
But you ain't gone 
Everything I do seems wrong 
And though you lay 
Right next to me 
All that you feel is week 
You just don't know 
What this means to me 
And I miss you the most 
When you are close
