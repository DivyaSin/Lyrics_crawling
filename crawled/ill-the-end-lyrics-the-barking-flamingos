The winter is calling 
Your pictures are falling 
The warmth inside me fades to grey 
Your eyes are empty 
Every time you see me 
I don't know what to say 
Oh, everything is gone 
The stars and the sun 
You're holding his hand 
With a gun in mine Dang, you've left 
You love him instead 
Bang, I'm dead 
I've blown my brains out my head 
In the street where you first said 
I love you till the end I remember the smile 
That kept me up all night 
I remember the words 
That made me feel alright 
I wish I knew what went wrong 
Did you love him all along? Dang, you've left 
You love him instead 
Bang, I'm dead 
I've blown my brains out my head 
In the street where you first said 
I love you till the end But that was all a lie 
I stay awake all night 
Dreaming of what we had 
Nothing feels alright 
Why should I try and fight 
What's the point in living life? 
I'll end the pain 
Standing in the rain 
I'll stop myself from going insane 
Bang! Dang, you've left 
You love him instead 
Bang, I'm dead 
I've blown my brains out my head 
In the street where you first said 
I love you till the end 
Till the end 
Till the end 
In the street where I lay cold 
Dear, this is the end
