She was as tender as a rose 
She was as soft as snowy down 
And from her head down to her toes 
She was a dream that hung around She was as fresh as April 
Warm as may 
And all the fellas threw their hearts away 
But all of her lovin' was Joe?s she was as tender as a rose I guess that Joe was pretty sick 
His feelings went from cold to hot 
Her love to him was just a kick 
His ego needed her a lot And when he took her away she wore a smile 
Fate crossed its fingers for that lovely child 
Cause all of her lovin' was Joe's 
She was as tender as a rose She came back walking all alone 
She wasn't gone for very long 
She came back with a heart of stone 
We knew that everything had gone wrong And when you ask her why she's out each night 
She'll say, "Brother, once I tried to be right 
Once all of my loving was Joe's 
I was as tender as a rose." 
She was as tender as a rose
