Apostles: 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening Why should you want to know? 
Don't you mind about the future, don't you try to think ahead 
Save tomorrow for tomorrow, think about today instead What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening I could give you facts and figures 
I could give you plans and forecasts 
Even tell you where I'm going - When do we ride into Jerusalem 
When do we ride into Jerusalem 
When do we ride into Jerusalem 
When do we ride into Jerusalem Why should you want to know? 
Why are you obsessed with fighting times 
and fates you can't defy? 
If you knew the path we're riding you'd 
understand it less then I 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening Let me try to cool down your face a bit 
Let me try to cool down your face a bit 
Let me try to cool down your face a bit 
Let me try to cool down your face a bit 
Let me try to cool down your face a bit 
Let me try to cool down your face a bit 
Let me try to cool down your face a bit... That feels nice, so nice 
Mary that is good 
While you prattled through your supper 
where and when and who and how 
She alone has tried to give me 
what I need right here and now What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening... It seems to me a strange thing, mystifying 
That a man like you can waste his time on women of her kind 
Yes I can understand that she amuses 
But to let her stroke you, kiss your hair is hardly 
in your line 
It's not that I object to her profession 
But she doesn't fit in well with what you teach and say 
It doesn't help us if you're inconsistent 
They only need a small excuse to put us all away Who are you to criticise her? Who are you to despise her? 
Leave her, leave her, let her be now 
Leave her, leave her, she's with me now 
If your slate is clean - then you can throw stones 
If your slate is not then leave her alone 
I'm amazed that a man like you can be so shallow thick 
and slow 
There is no man among you who knows or cares if I come or go No you're wrong! You're very wrong! 
No you're wrong! You're very wrong! 
No you're wrong! You're very wrong! 
No you're wrong! You're very wrong! 
How can you say that! 
How can you say that! 
How can you say that! 
How can you say that! Not one - not one of you!
