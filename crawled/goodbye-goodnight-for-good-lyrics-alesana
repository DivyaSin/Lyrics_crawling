Jealousy rears its ugly head 
I won't forget the things you said before you turned your back 
Goodbye, goodnight, for good remember my face when you feel the pain 
Say goodbye Now I'll fight with my eyes closed for the things I've let go 
Sweet breath escapes, 
Choke on the lies that were your last goodbye 
Hear my voice as you sleep 
Sleep tight, goodnight 
Choke on the lies that were your last goodbye Goodbye helps me to sleep without your memories 
And my shattered dreams collect dust on what used to be a lie 
It haunts me no more and now you're gone, you've left me alone 
I wasn't wrong to feel this way inside so goodbye, goodnight, for good Now I'll fight with my eyes closed for the things I've let go 
Sweet breath escapes, 
Choke on the lies that were your last goodbye 
Hear my voice as you sleep 
Sleep tight, goodnight 
Choke on the lies that were your last I find pleasure in the taste of your decay 
I anxiously watch you fade away I can't explain what's happening inside of me 
I refuse to fight you anymore 
All I know is I have to make sure 
Make sure you never wake up again Soft flesh gives way to trembling hand Beautiful eyes are sewn shut 
Searing thread suffocates the light
