Just before the sun is ready to say goodnight 
And the moon comes out of hiding to share its light 
I think about the things we used to do 
The way you held me when our love was new 
But it's no use in going back through the years 
There's nothing left for me but tears, tears, tears, tears Everywhere I go it seems I see your smiling face (smiling face) 
But when I get home there's nothing but empty space 
That single cigarette we used to share 
The time we wasted when I thought you cared 
How can I face this life without you near 
A life that only holds tears, tears, tears, tears Who'd ever thought we would be going, going our separate ways 
We promised love forever but where, oh, where is love today (love today) Do, do, do, do Darling if you'd ever change your mind 
Come back and we will leave the past behind 
I'll wipe away your doubt, dispel all your fears 
But please don't leave me here with tears, tears, tears, tears But even though my heart is breaking I wish you love 
May you find the happiness that we both dreamed of Do, do, do, do
