You yell and scream for no reason at all 
You pick up shit and throw it at me then you start to bawl 
You should see yourself! Hear yourself! A fucking child! 
I'm tryin' to find a reason for you going so wild "What's wrong?" I ask, you say "You said something mean!" 
Every word I utter, man, I gotta screen 
This shit has gotta stop before I go berserk 
Tryin' to decide which one of us is the jerk 
We yell and we fight 'til no end 
For reasons I can't understand 
And then we make up just like billions of times before For a while we're just lovers and friends 
Then shit hits the fan once again 
And then we do fight just like billions of times before Play on, Stay on 
Just like billions of times before
