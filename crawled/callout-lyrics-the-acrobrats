No point in rolling with the punches 
I've been laughed out of the race. 
And now you're flyin off the handle 
just can't handle anything 
You pay your way with tokens stolen from the meek, 
While I'm squandering each dime that I have begged -chorus- 
Call me a waste, call me an idiot 
It's just a taste of what's left behind, 
Yeah call me out, call me a real bad time, 
don't talk your shit, just don't call me anymore Fell for your tricks and sleight of hand 
but now I know I've been a fool,, 
and now you're crawlin' across the floor 
Yeah, best of luck, enjoy the view. 
You measure greatness by the company you keep, 
so how come nobody's waiting back home? (repeat chorus) -Solo- No point in rolling with the punches 
I've been laughed out of the race. 
And now you're flyin off the handle 
just can't handle anything 
You pay your way with tokens stolen from the meek, 
While I'm squandering each dime that I have begged Repeat chorus
