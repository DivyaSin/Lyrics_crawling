What in the world would cause you to question that? 
How did I come off? 
Would lead you to ask Can I help you along? 
Sun in the room 
Curtains too soon 
The day is coming closer 
The dream slipping through me will fade 
Inching slowly from the slumber And I love you a lot 
Whatever you want 
Wherever you are (Wherever you are) 
Wherever you are Wherever you roam 
Let me tell you babe 
Not every moment matters 
Across marked jots laid down 
Look you're growing faster and faster 
Heights that I held you up 
Times when I couldn't be at home And I owe you a lot 
So whatever you want 
Whatever you want (Wherever you are) 
Wherever you are 
Wherever you are Wherever you are Wherever you are 
Wherever you are 
Wherever you are 
Wherever you are Times when I couldn't be enough 
Wherever you are 
Wherever you are 
Wherever you are 
Wherever you are
