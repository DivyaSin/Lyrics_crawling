I Cannot Justify I am a white girl but what was I before? 
An Onondaga opening the door 
Coulda been a pilgrim hungry for to pray 
Or a roaming buffalo soon to fade away Was I a little boy hiding underground 
An angry soldier sent to shoot John Brown 
Might have been red clay staining tired feet 
Of a broken army suffering defeat Let me grow from these clothes 
That cling so tightly to my soul 
How can I justify the narrow vantage 
Of these eyes 
Such a good disguise, I cannot justify A hooded demon did I wear bloody boots 
Did I fall like thunder torn from ancient roots 
Black wing vulture peckin heartbroke bones 
Or was I an orphan born to die alone I am a white girl but what was I before
