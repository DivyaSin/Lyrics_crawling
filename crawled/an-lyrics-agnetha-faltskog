You are beside me 
I'm part of you now 
Love of my life this moment 
Was made for us somehow 
Where did you come from 
And how did it start 
Was it a star from heaven 
That brightened up my heart 
That light keeps shinning on me 
Since you walked into my life 
You're here 
And now I can see 
Whatever it takes 
Take care of me 
Man don't make me cry 
Don't let it die 
'Cause deep inside I really know 
That, after you 
What would I do 
So man, don't ever go 
I need you so 
This love, this feeling's gonna grow 
I love you 
I do 
That light keeps shinning on me 
Since you walked into my life 
You're here 
And now I can see 
Whatever it takes 
Take care of me 
Man, don't make me cry 
Why don't we try 
'Cause deep inside I really know 
That, after you 
What would I do 
So man, don't ever go 
I need you so 
This love, this feeling's gonna grow 
I love you 
I do
