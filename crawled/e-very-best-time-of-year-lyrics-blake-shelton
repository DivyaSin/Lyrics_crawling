There's so many things we can do this Christmas 
Just once I wanna go on a ride in a one horse sleigh 
Go caroling down the street while everybody listens 
Singing Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, jingling all the way And if snows just a little too much and there ain't no place to go 
Baby, if you want you can show me what happens underneath the mistletoe 
Hang up the cards from the people we love who miss us 
Call up the neighbors and open up a bottle of cheer 
Umm, there's so many we things can do this Christmas 
Ha ha, join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year 
Oh, yeah And if it snows just a little too much and there ain't no place to go 
Baby, if you want you can show me what happens underneath the mistletoe 
Hang up the cards from the people we love, who miss us 
Call up the neighbors and open up a bottle of cheer 
There's so many we things can do this Christmas 
Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year 
Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
