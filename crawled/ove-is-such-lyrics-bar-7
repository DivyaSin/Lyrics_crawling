Love is such a precious thing 
Something you feel with in and 
Love is such a simple thing 
But yet so complicated 
Love can fill your heart with pain 
Then build you up again 
Love can wash away the rain 
Bring back the sun again 
And when it all has gone I fell like dyin' 
Now ya make me live again 
Everything I had I feel I've lost 
And now I've got so much to give Such an ordinary thing 
Can feel so unfamiliar 
All in all it's what you bring 
That makes me whole again 
And promises were made like they were broken 
But I learned to trust again 
Now that you're the one that I have chose as my 
Reason for to live 
Star with me at happiness 
And I will do the same You are, you are, you are the one I love 
You are the only one I'm thinkin' of 
You are the one, you are the one 
You are, you are, you are
