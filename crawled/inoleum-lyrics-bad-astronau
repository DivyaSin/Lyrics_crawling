[Originally by NOFX] Possessions never meant anything to me 
I'm not crazy 
Well that's not true, I have a bed, and a guitar 
And a dog named Dog who pisses on my floor 
That's right, I've got a floor 
So what, so what, so what? 
I've got pockets full of Kleenex and lint and holes 
Where everything important to me 
Just falls right down my leg 
And on to the floor 
My closest friend linoleum 
Linoleum 
Supports my head, gives me something to believe 
That's me on the beach side combing the sand 
Metal meter in my hand 
Sporting a pocket full of shit 
That's me on the beach with a violin under my chin 
Playing with a grin, singing GBH 
That's me on the back of the bus 
That's me inside the cell 
That's me inside your head
