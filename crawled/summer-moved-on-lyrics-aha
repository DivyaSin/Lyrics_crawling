Summer moved on and the way it goes, you can't tag along 
Honey moved out and the way it went leaves no doubt 
Moments will pass in the morning light I found out Seasons can't last and there's just one thing left to ask 
Stay, don't just walk away and leave me another day 
A day just like today with nobody else around Friendships move on until the day you can't get along 
Handshakes unfold and the way it goes no one knows 
Moments will pass in the morning light I found out Seasons can't last so there's just one thing left to ask 
Stay, don't just walk away and leave me another day 
A day just like today stay, don't just walk away with nobody else around
