Inside of my heart is an army of angels 
Just coz I let you go 
Oh volunteers they are here to love and help me 
Only coz I've said no To the killer eyes 
That invite me to do things 
I would have to lie about 
And its better now 
We are safe 
You know I love you more 
From far away 
Now that all I need is God. Hey little girl 
Do you still have things 
That haunt you 
Are all the words I said unclear 
You know I was there 
Just a while ago so miserable 
Until I told the truth and prayed And the killer eyes that invite me 
To things I would have to lie about 
(just lost their sparkle) 
And its better now we are safe 
You know I love you more from far away 
Now that all I need is God. Inside of my heart 
Is an army of angels waiting for war... The killer eyes that invite me to do things 
I would have to lie about 
(lost their sparkle) 
And its better now 
We are safe you know I love you more from far away 
Now that all I need is... Inside of my heart is an army of angels 
Inside of my heart is an army of angels 
Inside of my heart is an army of angels 
Inside of my heart is an army of angels... I need you so much I am dust without you 
I'd lose all the universe just to have you 
I need you so much I am dust without you 
I'd lose all the universe just to have you.. Barbie's chuckles (hahaha)
