I remember well the smell of tequila 
One bed, one bath, two months with Steph 
Drinkin' up the sunrise 
Then sleep till eight at night 
I had a ten day birthday till Thanksgiving 
We burnt the bird and hit the road 
Blur in stereo, sonic bookmarks and bad scenes 
But not a dull moment, I barely miss living in Los Angeles 
Only took a week to start the warfare 
Eccentric neighbors on welfare 
The turntable spun to the beat of pounding on the walls 
We'd sink another drink with Billy Idol 
Have sloppy sex on the living room floor 
A whirlwind of simple pleasure principal 
Principles are gone 
It's not a dull moment 
I barely miss living in that selfish bliss with Steph 
And I always have the past to be warned 
And I always knew the last laugh was more 
And I can taste the gold ring tarnish in my mouth 
And I need a drink to wash it out 
It's not a dull moment 
I barely miss living in that state of filth 
So I cleaned the yard, the yard, the yard 
Mow the lawn, scrub the stained rug 
So what? It's safe and sound I have found
