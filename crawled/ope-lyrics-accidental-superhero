with the princess i would 
leave the city gate 
she and i would go into 
the fields and wait 
for the sky to dusk turn dark 
and feed the moon 
a knight could only hope 
light would not come soon the land looked weary as we 
walked over the tombs 
of the dead of age and 
those killed in the wombs 
only darkness could hide 
the guilt of day 
the guilt of those who did 
their best to look away so let the darkness 
earn us light 
and give us day that 
wants no night as we crossed a bridge 
i noticed her despair 
almost hidden by the 
beauty of her hair 
she was the only one 
that i would ever love 
could we only live to 
see the sun above so let the darkness 
earn us light 
and give us day that 
wants no night so let the darkness 
earn us light 
and give us day that 
wants no night the girl and i would run 
faster every day 
where two are gathered 
there is always a way so let the darkness 
earn us light 
and give us day that 
wants no night so let the darkness 
earn us light 
and give us day that 
wants no night
