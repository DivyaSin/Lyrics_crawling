Why is it all going on like this ? 
Why is this world so cruel to me ? 
Why am I the only one suffering here ? 
Is there anyone else suffering more than me ? I know one day I will regret 
Because I'm still going on the wrong way 
But I can not wake up 
I am still in my nightmare Sometimes I wish I was never born in this world 
Sometimes I feel that I'm so worthless (Because no one understand me) 
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna kill myself 
Why can't I live happily ever after (Why life goes this way) I feel like I'm in a closed box 
I feel like I'm gonna be in it forever 
But when it comes the time when I be free 
I will promise myself to do what I please Sometimes I wish I was never born in this world 
Sometimes I feel that I'm so worthless (Because no one understand me) 
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna kill myself 
Why can't I live happily ever after (Why life goes this way) I'm gonna fight 
I'm gonna run 
I'm gonna escape 
From the world 
I'm gonna do the best 
And what I can do 
When I know 
Everything is not fine 
I just deny 
And try to hide 
I'm gonna do the best 
And what I can do Sometimes I wish I was never born in this world 
Sometimes I feel that I'm so worthless 
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna kill myself 
Why can't I live happily ever Sometimes I wish I was never born in this world 
Sometimes I feel that I'm so worthless 
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna kill myself 
Why can't I live happily ever after (Why life goes this way)
