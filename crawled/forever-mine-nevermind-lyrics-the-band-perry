The airline lost my luggage and the governor lost my vote 
My best friend lost her innocence in her boyfriend's rowboat 
Your mother lost her favorite pearls, the ones that you gave to me 
Oh, I lost them when I tossed them on the day that you lost me Forever mine, forever mine oh my 
You saved my life, you said forever (Forever!) 
Never (Never!) I broke my bedroom mirror and it broke my luck in two 
Then my brothers broke the bad bad news, that you broke the truth 
So I smashed my right hand open, when I smashed the nose on you 
'Cause you smashed my heart when you did what you said you'd never do Forever mine, forever mine oh my 
You saved my life when, you said forever (Forever!) 
Never (Never!) Mine, nevermind 
You must have lost your mind 
When you said forever, you could do better (Never!) Oh I'll forget the day, I saw your face 
I lost my way, I trusted you, I trusted all your lovely words 
They were a curse, you piece of dirt, 
Ooh I trusted you, I trusted you, I trusted you Forever 
Forever mine, forever mine oh my 
You saved my life, 
You said forever (Forever!) 
Never (Never!) 
Mine, nevermind 
Did you lose your mind? 
'Cause you said forever, you could do better 
Never! Forever is a long long time 
No 
Forever mine The South lost the battle and children lose their youth 
The best day of my life was on the day that I lost you
