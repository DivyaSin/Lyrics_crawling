Well, I'm standing here looking at you 
What do I see? 
I'm looking straight through 
It's so sad 
When you're young 
To be told 
You're having fun So unplug the jukebox 
And do us all a favor 
That music's lost its taste 
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music Well, I'm standing here what do I see? 
A big nothing 
Threatening me 
It's so sad 
When you're young 
To be told 
You're having fun So unplug the jukebox 
And do us all a favor 
That music's lost its taste 
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music So unplug the jukebox 
And do us all a favor 
That music's lost its taste 
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music Don't tread on an ant he's done nothing to you 
There might come a day 
When he's treading on you 
Don't tread on an ant you'll end up black and blue 
You cut off his head 
Legs come looking for you So unplug the jukebox 
And do us all a favor 
That music's lost its taste 
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music So unplug the jukebox 
And do us all a favor 
That music's lost its taste 
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music 
Ant music, ant music
