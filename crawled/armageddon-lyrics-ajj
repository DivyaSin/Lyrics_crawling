Oh God there's a big one coming on 
The dead have begun to rise and walk 
And nobody is singing, nobody is singing 
The bottomless pit has opened up 
The Virgin Mary's crying blood 
And nobody is singing, nobody is singing Were all taking pictures with camera phones 
To prove that we were there 
For the end of days, the end of days The blood gollum is on the loose again 
He doesn't know that were American 
He just thinks we're fatter 
The hell demons are killing all in sight 
Satan's doing wheelies on his bike 
Twin heads on his handlebars Pig-tailed twins around the age of 666 
Their faces painted to look like King Diamond and Peter Criss 
For the end of days, the end of days Now its raining semen 
It smells like those summer trees you smell 
Could this be the revelation or is it simply the end of Hell? Oh God there's a big one coming on 
Hashtag armageddon 
That topic is trending 
The death cult is making jewelry 
From the corpses they dragged from the burning sea 
They're taking eyes, they're taking ears, they're taking noses, they're taking teeth 
They're taking hair and skin from tattoos 
They're taking fingers, they're taking 
The end of days very seriously Now the valley is flooded 
With piranha, tequila and knives 
But at least we got to prove that we did something worthwhile with our lives 
At the end of days, the end of days Edit Lyrics Edit Wiki Add Video
