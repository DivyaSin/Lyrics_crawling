What lures what traps? Intentions are fast snaps, fast snaps 
A simple high cage, from your whisper to rage 
Every time, every single time 
The bleeding obvious, bold as 
You complain 
The bleeding obvious, bold as 
You complain, you complain 
All of it adds, up to your trappled eggs? 
No one knows why, you can't sell it 
Lucky but how much, is give away you want to wear 
Don't you, everybody does 
The bleeding obvious, bold as 
You complain 
The bleeding obvious, bold as 
You complain, you complain 
Choose to be over, your own instincts 
Glisten me down, glisten me down 
Why can't we believe in ourselves, maybe even each other 
So bleeding obvious, you complain 
Happens over head, you scream 
So bleeding obvious, bold as 
You complain, you complain
