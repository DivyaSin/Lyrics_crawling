Random raining, ribbons of melancholy 
The moment dies right here, before me 
Grey horizons tarred to my days 
The curtain fell, still the solitary plays Dance with me, me dear 
The dance of those, who'll never return 
Bleeding traces left behind, for the living 
Hear life forging with death 
It's a gorgeous storm unfurling 
I've awaited for so long 
Now you taste like honey, dear, 
on my rigid tongue It's soothing as you delve 
Into my crescent agony 
Your lips of tragedy licking my requiem 
I am betrayed by your kiss... "Would you bleed for me again, 
For I adore its pounding 
On your fetid, lifeless shell, it becomes like satin 
No love existing, oh, my darling, see 
I am the architect of this bitter-sweet abstract" A key, a door, a vision, remnants of a dream 
Corridor of conclusions thru wide ribbons seen 
Like a statue starring with the same cold eyes 
Honey, kill me again, for know now what I am Lay down with me, my dear 
Listen to this requiem, 
You always loved to hear 
Through you knew the words 
You did sing them wrong
