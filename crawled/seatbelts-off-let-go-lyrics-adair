Tonight will be 
The last time that I think of you. 
How could you? 
Is anyone here human? I'm on the bathroom floor. 
Screaming as I die some more. 
It's a slow burn. It's a slow burn. 
It's a loss of control. So murder me. 
Over and over. 
It's a drunken blur. And I'm 
Alive but not living 
Anymore. This is a loss of innocence. 
Cheap sex and faceless friends. 
It's all wrong, all wrong. 
Seatbelts off. 
Let go.
