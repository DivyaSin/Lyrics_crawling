Cleansing my soul in temples of light 
reborn with God's love, delivered form the night 
given a second chance with a new life in sight 
and after a day there's always the night Astray-souls astray Travelling through this life 
to attain the unknown goal 
the quest for putting an end to the strife 
that binds one to one's toll 
altering adjusting the ways 
to find the golden path 
attempting to master the maze 
mitigating the inevitable aftermath Roaming between the religions 
between different ways of thought 
seeking for the meaning of life 
and what we're living for 
without capacity to solve the riddle 
we wonder 'til we are no more Outstanding the sins of the past 
leaving them all behind 
looking younder at what's ahead 
hiding the dark thoughts 
in the haze of your mind 
following guides and signs 
utilizing the different charts 
studying the sciencies 
desiring to master the art Seeking for the answers untold 
collecting knowledge to foresee what'll be 
after this death... shall it all unfold? 
after this life... is there nothing but eternity?
