I stared up at the sun 
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved 
You can feel the light start to tremble 
Washing what you know out to sea, yeah 
You can see your life out of the window, tonight If I lose myself tonight 
It'll be by your side 
I'll lose myself tonight (yeah, yeah, yeah) If I lose myself tonight 
It'll be you and I 
Lose myself tonight I woke up with the sun 
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved 
You can feel the light start to tremble 
Washing what you know out to sea, yeah 
You can see your life out of the window, tonight If I lose myself tonight 
It'll be by your side 
I'll lose myself tonight (yeah, yeah, yeah) If I lose myself tonight 
It'll be you and I 
Lose myself tonight (Whoo) 
Lose myself tonight
