Ehhhhhhh, eh, eh, eh, eh. 
Oooh, oooh, oooh. Oooh, oooh. 
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh. Oooh, oooh. It's 6:00 and I'm just waking up 
To another lonely morning without you. 
Go get my coffee and I think to myself 
(I think to myself) just what am I gonna do. 
Well, I need some help to understand 
And only you can make it clear. 
Why do you have to look for love out there 
When there's so much love here. 
(Ooooooh.) Hey, hey. I spend so much time with you on my mind. 
I really can make it through the day, oooh, oooh, 
Fighting the urge to pick up the phone 
And call just to see if you're okay. 
Then I hear your voice. 
Oh, you stop on by (Stop on by) 
And my worries disappear. Why do you have to look for love out there (Oooh, boy.) 
When there's so much love here. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. You're always on the run. 
I know you're having fun pretending to look 
For that very special someone. 
But if you keep on disrespecting me, 
I know there's gonna be a day when you're gonna find me gone. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I gonna defend you right or wrong. 
I'm always on your side. 
And you know I'll go on to see it, that's all, 
When there are troubles on your mind. 
It's just a waste of time to try and find 
Another love that's better than mine. 
I'm telling you, that dream will never appear. No, no. 
(There's no need to look for love out there) 
(Oooh, oooooooooh, oooh, oooh.) 
Don't have to look for love. 
When there's so much love here. 
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oh, oh, oh.) So much love, so much love. 
I wanna ask you something, (There's no need to look for love out there) 
Why...(When there's so much love here.) 
I just don't understand. 
(There's no need to look for love out there) 
Oooooooh, oooooooooooooh. 
(When there's so much love here.) So much love, so much love. 
I want you to have all my love. 
(There's no need to look for love out there...)
