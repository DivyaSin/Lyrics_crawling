If we had a date, let's say about eight 
Honey do you think it's wrong 
If I held you tight in the pale moonlight 
Honey do you think it's wrong If a car would stall, wouldn't go at all 
Honey do you think it's wrong 
Would your mother scold, if her baby got cold 
Honey do you think it's wrong Oh gee, oh me 
Are we having fun 
Oh gee, oh me 
Here comes your daddy with a gun If I marry you like you want me to 
Honey do you think it's wrong 
If you don't mind, I'm not that kind 
Crank it up and let's go home If we had a date, let's say about eight 
Honey do you think it's wrong 
If I held you tight in the pale moonlight 
Honey do you think it's wrong If a car would stall, wouldn't go at all 
Honey do you think it's wrong 
Would your mother scold, if her baby got cold 
Honey do you think it's wrong Oh gee, oh me 
Are we having fun 
Oh gee, oh me 
Here comes your daddy with a gun If I marry you like you want me to 
Honey do you think it's wrong 
If you don't mind, I'm not that kind 
Crank it up and let's go home
