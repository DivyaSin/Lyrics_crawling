Some things don't catch 
On fire the way that we do 
Who knew one match ignites 
The way we light you It's cool, I catch 
The ice that surrounds you 
And, still, I can't rewrite 
This temperature Girl, we could use a light right now 
Find me in the dark somehow So, as we look into your eyes, 
You see the truth 
We won't tell you any night lies 
So, as you look into our eyes, 
And see right through 
Please, don't leave Some things don't crack 
Until they're under pressure 
We won't attack until 
You ask us to Some things don't catch 
On fire the way that we do 
Stand back, relax, don't fight 
As we consume you Girl, we could use a light right now 
Find me in the dark somehow So, as we look into your eyes, 
You see the truth 
We won't tell you any night lies 
So, as you look into our eyes, 
And see right through 
Please, don't leave So, as we look into your eyes, 
You see the truth 
We won't tell you any night lies 
So, as you look into our eyes, 
And see right through So, as we look into your eyes, 
You see the truth 
We won't tell you any night lies 
So, as you look into our eyes, 
And see right through 
Please, don't leave
