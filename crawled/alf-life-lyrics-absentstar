If youve given up, would help you out if you could know 
That theres more in store if you look the other way 
If you get it all, would you ever hope for something more? 
Would it make you whole with half a life ahead? Before you give it away, you gotta take a little back 
And find another way 
Before you go it alone, you gotta learn to let to let it go 
Face another day If it's getting old, are you better off here than before? 
If you cant ignore when you look the other way 
So just let it go, take a look around and you will know 
That theres something more, when theres half a life ahead Before you give it away, you gotta take a little back 
And find another way 
Before you go it alone, you gotta learn to let to let it go 
Face another day Even after all thats said and done you worry 
Even those the odds look good you still look down 
Even after all thats said and done you worry 
Even those the odds look good you still look down Before you give it away, take it back 
Before you give it away, take it back 
Before you give it away, take it back 
Before you give it away, take it back
