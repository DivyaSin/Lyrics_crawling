i stand alone 
i chose this path for me 
and though your gone 
i'm marked for life 
one more time 
another falls 
we're going round and round again 
carve it on my stone 
on the day i die. 
as strong now 
are my feelings 
what it means and it still matters. 
live my life for no one but me 
and this path has strengthened me 
i stand tall 
it burns - i raise my fist 
declaration - my heart 
its drives me-on my stone. 
true till death. 
i look around, i dont like what i see. 
whats this about - i'm marked for life 
they've let me down, those that we once looked to 
it's so clear now - i'm marked for life 
i look around, how did it get so bad 
wont let them down - i'm marked for life 
we'll tear it down, there's nothing left for me 
get off the ground - i'm marked for life 
and here i stand - i'm my strongest ever 
and though they may fall, i'm still marked for life.
