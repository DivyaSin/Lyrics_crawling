Theres nothing more that a pirate loves best 
Than coming across a magnificent chest 
But digging a hole's just the start of the task 
The real quest is getting inside of the cask 
Unsheathing your weapon to open the locks 
And finding the treasure inside of the box 
In right stormy waters, through night and through day, 
'till the poop deck is covered with salty white spray. Woah-oh 
You don't want to end up shipwrecked. 
Woah-oh 
I'm questing upon the poop deck. 
Woah-oh 
You'd be better off watching star trek 
Woah-oh 
I'm questing upon the poop deck Sailing the red sea's a dangerous duty 
But there's more than one way to plunder a booty 
Plunging your sword through a gaping axe wound 
You'd be better to wait until the new moon 
If you are brave you can sail round the back 
By rowing your ship through a forbidden crack 
By dropping your anchor in murkier waters, 
you can be sure you'll have no sons or daughters. Woah-oh 
You don't want to end up shipwrecked 
Woah-oh 
You're questing upon the poop deck 
Woah-oh 
This song is a pain in the neck 
Woah-oh 
You're questing upon the poop deck
