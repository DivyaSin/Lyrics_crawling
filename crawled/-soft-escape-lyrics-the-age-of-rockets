We are the nothing waiting in bad dreams 
We are the first cracks in the ice 
We are the hour hand, forever love's bitch and 
We are the tears in those who have come before 
And you whisper, and you whisper this could be the end The soft escape of closing eyelids 
The haunt of long nights still to come 
First blinding light then only darkness 
The cracks in pavement spell your name 
Electric whir of closing sirens 
Each word hangs rigid in the air 
First scattered mass then constellation 
We held your hand as you learned You learned, you learned 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da...
