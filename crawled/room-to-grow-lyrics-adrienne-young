She's a buckskin baby made of silk and steel 
Daughter of her Mother's heart 
Well, dyed in the wool 
Future farmer of a brand new start 
She could've been a supermodel or a rich man's queen 
Livin up on easy street 
But the call of the wild 
and the solid earth beneath her feet Seemed to complete her 
Let her see into her soul 
To pastures greener 
Where there's room enough to grow Back to where the red fern knows 
The sweetness of the mountain rose 
And the land she laughs at all this wood and wire 
We all outgrow the skin we're in 
But we can weave, we will mend 
Stitch by stitch, row by row 
We're making sure there's room enough to grow Leaves were blowing on the pumpkins fattening in the field 
She saw a 'we got apples' sign 
Turned down a road never knowing what she might find 
He was sittin on his tractor when she caught his eye 
He gave a wave and walked her way 
He was all breath and britches hair the color of the sun on hay Through winter's hunger 
Spring and summer overflow 
With love free to wander 
where there's room enough to grow Well, it's back to where the red fern knows 
The sweetness of the mountain rose 
And the land she laughs at all this wood and wire 
We all outgrow the skin we're in 
But we can weave, we will mend 
Stich by stich, row by row 
Making sure there's room enough to grow Ohhhh ohhhhhh Back to where the red fern knows 
The sweetness of the mountain rose 
And the land she laughs at all this wood and wire 
We all outgrow the skin we're in 
But we can weave, we will mend 
Stich by stitch, row by row 
Making sure there's room enough to grow
