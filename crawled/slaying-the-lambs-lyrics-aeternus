i walk the landscape i see the land infested as a newborn plague by gods holy worms scattered around they lie christ's soldiers over distant horizons untameable flames rage demons - seeking their prey shades roar across the crimson sky christ's lambs ash - death - fire - chaos see the murdered children their faith in christ being crushed by darkness natures truth mortals and nightmares blood and bones the world burning flames and corpses in a merciless godless mayhem piles of corpses monument of war thrilled by the stench of christian blood mother earths men march the power of darkness glows in their blackened eyes the lies of christianity shall no longer be heard not ever again shall our world be branded by lies ash - death - fire - chaos see the murdered children their faith in christ natures truth being crushed by darkness
