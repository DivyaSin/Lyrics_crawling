Havin' fun in my padded cell tonight 
Havin' fun in my grey motel tonight 
Gotta lot to say, and I wanna know if it's right 
'Cause when the system shuts down 
There will be nothing left to do but fight 
But I gotta plan 
To take a stand 
And do it all over again 
Just the system of education 
Proud crowd owns the fate of the nation 
I can't live up to their expectations 
I'm on a permanent vacation 
I see my shadow shinin' in the blue patrol car light 
It seems like every time I gotta go out, I gotta get in a fight 
Rolled up in the gutter and the blood red fills my eyes 
How can I be happy when the world's pulled over my mind?
