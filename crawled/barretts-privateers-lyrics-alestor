Oh, the year was 1778, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now! 
A letter of marque came from the King, 
To the scummiest vessel I'd ever seen. God damn them all! 
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, 
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears, 
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers. Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now! 
For twenty brave men all fishermen who, 
Would make for him to Antelope's crew. God damn them all! 
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, 
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears, 
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers. The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now! 
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags, 
And the cook in scuppers and the staggers and the jags. God damn them all! 
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, 
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears, 
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers. On the King's birthday we put to sea, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now! 
We were 91 days to Montego bay, 
Pumping like madmen all the way. God damn them all! 
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, 
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears, 
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers. On the 96th day we sailed again, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now! 
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight, 
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight. God damn them all! 
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, 
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears, 
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers. The Yankee lay low down with gold, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now! 
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays, 
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days. God damn them all! 
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, 
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears, 
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers. Then at length we stood two cables away, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now! 
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din, 
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in. God damn them all! 
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, 
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears, 
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers. The Antelope shook and pitched on her side, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now! 
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs, 
And the Main trunk carried off both me legs. God damn them all! 
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, 
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears, 
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers. So here I lay in my 23rd year, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now! 
It's been 6 years since we sailed away, 
And I just made Halifax yesterday. God damn them all! 
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, 
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears, 
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, 
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
