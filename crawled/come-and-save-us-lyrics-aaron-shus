The edge of a cliff 
The dead-end signs 
That we've been ignoring all this time 
All our mistakes and crossing lines 
That sinking feeling that's not far behind 
We're less than more, we're falling short 
No matter how we try There's nothing we can do 
Nothing we can do 
Father we need You 
To come and save us If we could see 
Behind the veil 
Just a glimpse of how You love us when we fail 
Maybe we would finally see You mercy never ends There's nothing we can do 
Nothing we can do 
Father we need You 
To come and save us There's nothing we can do 
Nothing we can do 
Father we need You 
To come and save us It's all been done 
It's all been done 
You have come 
All for love There's nothing we can do 
Nothing we can do 
Father we need You 
To come and save us There's nothing we can do 
Nothing we can do 
Father we need You 
To come and save us Father we need You 
To come and save us 
Father we need You 
To come and save us To come and save us
