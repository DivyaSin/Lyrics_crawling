I am limbo, waiting on a window 
Stuck inside an interval 
I know it's unattainable 
Covered by a label's name 
Labeled by geography 
On a dying dark horse 
Placing 
I am a plagiarist 
Feeble picking up a pen 
Between a sonic precedent 
Any age I represent 
Old enough to own the store 
The noise I make, like an arrogant ingrate I'm not noteworthy for a loyalty 
The forefathers who are redeemed 
Most of whom I never revered 
Never needed or never even heard 
Emulating individuals 
Cloning the new originals 
Follow us for king land rituals I am a spokesman for a derivative 
Travelling salesman 
Selling old narrative 
True sounds of liberty 
Straining through my voice 
Only heard in their code 
One noise 
Once an introvert 
Spewing my entire worth 
Regurgitating their words from it Second coming, a second strings 
They're personating the real thing 
The odd guys that wrote bad songs 
A drug addict's dead and gone 
Who wrote the song that sold my voice 
Forcing to make my choices And the name they chose for me 
And the name chosen for me Finally, here I am 
Said to be made again 
Posing weathered statues 
Standing on old attributes 
Getting sick of this 
Feeling ridiculous 
I'm an overtold joke's punchline 
I am limbo, waiting on a window 
Resonating old song 
You're not so long Scraping the bread off my forehead 
At the speed of nearly dead 
I never found what never made 
To the sound I've already betrayed It's the name they chose for me 
It's the name they chose for me Follow us for king land ritual
