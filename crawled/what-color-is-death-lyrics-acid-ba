The shade of an ice pick sinking into flesh 
Sex-n-sex-n-sex-n-death 
I don't want you I want your flesh 
Close my eyes and dream of death 
Slip away and take a breath 
Rivers running dark and cool 
How can nothingness be cruel? 
Trip with me and meet the sun 
This orgasm of light 
Suck the world inside yourself 
Spitting forth the night 
I listen to the trees they hum 
And hold hands with the moon 
Insects whisper sweet nothings 
The solar system blooms 
The skulls of babies grow within 
The garden of the soul 
Where the girls run barefoot 
And all life lives uncontrolled 
Come on baby let's kick back and bleed with me awhile 
Nevermind the cold black truth that stains the kitchen tile
