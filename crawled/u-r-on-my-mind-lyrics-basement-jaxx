You are in my mind 
As I lay down 
You are in my mind 
As I lay me down 
You are in my mind 
As I lay down 
You are in my mind 
As I lay me down Don't know if this world is where I want to be 
Maybe we could find a planet just for you and me 
You're my stairway to my heaven 
You mean more than all those things that I could ever imagine So take my pleasure take my pain 
Cause you're the moisture in my rain, yeah 
If you believe yes it can happen 
I belong to you ultimately, yeah
