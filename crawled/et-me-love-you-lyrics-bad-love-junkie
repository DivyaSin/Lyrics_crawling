Saturday night 
Sun going down 
And you man aint around 
A north wind blowing cold 
It chills you to the bone 
And tonight you're getting stoned 
Have a little drink, ease your mind 
Slip on down to the cheating side of town Let me love you like I stole you 
Love you like I stole you 
Let me love you like the man 
Who stole your heart away 
Let me love you like I stole you 
Love you like I stole you 
Let me love you like the man 
Who stole your heart away Go ahead and dance 
Your secrets safe with me 
I will grant you a reprieve 
And you can hold me close 
Tell me your desire 
Baby I can be the fire 
Play that song that heals your soul 
Go ahead now and let go Baby I can 
Love you like I stole you 
Love you like I stole 
Tonight I'll love you like the man 
Who stole your heart away 
Let me love you like I stole you 
Love you like I stole you 
Tonight Ill love you like the man 
Who stole your heart away
