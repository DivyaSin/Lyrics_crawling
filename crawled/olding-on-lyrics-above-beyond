The failing sky grows darker every day. And moonlight fading as you 
Walk away. And all the roads that lead me to your heart 
have gone astray 
My hands are tied behind my back, and I'm weaked by, 
your slow attack, you take me in, than change your mind again. 
Yous spinning wheel won't lead me to your view, and all the words 
I need to hear from you, I'm holding on but guess I'm out of luck, 
and still in love with you 
My hands are tied behind my back, and I'm weaked by, 
your slow attack, you take me in, than change your mind again. 
Hold my face, in your hands, look into my eyes 
So understand, all the toughts, inside your mind 
Tell me it's time 
My hands are tied behind my back, and I'm weaked by, 
your slow attack, you take me in, than change your mind again.
