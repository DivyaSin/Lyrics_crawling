I've got my ticket for the long way 'round 
Two bottle whiskey for the way 
And I sure would like some sweet company 
And I'm leaving tomorrow 
What d'you say? When I'm gone (When I'm gone) 
When I'm gone 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone 
You're gonna miss me by my hair 
(Miss me by my everywhere) 
You're gonna miss me everywhere, oh 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
