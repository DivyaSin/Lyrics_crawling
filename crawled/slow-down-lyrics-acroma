Wait up now time is a story it's holding me down holding me down now 
Wait up now time is a theory it's holding me down holding me down now 
Wait up now what's it going to take going to take 
To make you see we're moving too fast now 
Wait up now what's it going to take 
Got to find the time 
I'm on my knees Now take some time 
All we need is a little time 
Just wait awhile and save ourselves some pain Wait up now who's the real enemy holding me down holding me down now 
Wait up now who dropped the bomb who's striking me down striking me down now 
Wait up now what's it going to take going to take 
To make you see we've lost our way now 
Wait up now what's it going to take 
Got to find the time 
I'm on my knees Now take some time 
All we need is a little time 
Just wait awhile 
And save ourselves some pain If this is a story just based in lies 
Can we stop the moment? 
It's destroying the world destroying it all 
If all of this is a mistake we're really just a thing that occurred 
Then why would we even try to fight it? 
Why would we even try at all? 
Why would we try? 
Try and fight it 
Why would we try? 
Why not let it fall? Take some time 
All we need is a little time 
Just wait awhile 
And save ourselves some pain now
