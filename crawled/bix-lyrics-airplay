Bix likes it when you play it cool... 
Bix like you breakin' all the rules... 
Bix likes it when it makes a score... 
Keep you comin' back for more 
Introduced you to Mary Jane... 
She'll seduce you back again... 
Don't care if it's against the law 
They keep you runnin' back for your pie in the sky. Saturday Night... the Wheelers & the Dealers... 
and Billy went out lookin' to graze in some grass. 
Cruisin' for action... lookin' for a buy. 
Now they were no doubt 7 squares 
Out to grab a slice of their pie in the sky Hearts of steel, first to rust 
When you're too cold to feel what's real there's no one you can trust 
Don't know where to draw the line... ignoring all the danger signs... 
You're dangerous, you're headed for a bust. Bix likes it when you play it cool... 
Bix likes you breakin' all the rules... 
Bix likes it when it makes a score... 
Keep you comin' back for more. Made a connection with a villain in the shadows 
Who satisfied their every need... 
Ups and downs, cocaine and weed. 
Flashin' some green.. showin' off the merchandise. 
When Billy said "I want a taste, before I pay the price for the pie in the sky" Hearts of steel, first to rust 
When you're too cold to feel what's real there's no one you can trust 
Don't know where to draw the line... ignoring all the danger signs... 
You're dangerous, you're headed for a bust
