This is the land of my sunset 
This is my Tipsy turvy sky 
I hear the soundless singing ocean 
And I don't even have to try Tumble and fumble as it rushes 
Rapidly moving in my eyes 
Breathe in enough to feel better 
Heavenly hurting as I cry Look at all these, all these reasons and 
explanations 
For damage that I've done 
I'm always trying but needing 
All I need to be, be the one I hold the jewel 
That keeps my body warm 
It's so smooth, the jewel 
That keeps my body, keeps my body warm Here are all the, all the these reasons 
Reasons to believe what's wrong 
And I can't be taken in silence 
Can't you be the one, be the one I believe 
Here it's going, so uncontrolling 
But you know I can't be free This is the land of my sunset 
This is my tipsy turvy sky 
I hear the soundless singing ocean 
And I don't even want to try Keeps my body warm
