One snap for the dying 
One click to end the day 
Another story with a mangled scene 
It couldn't happen any other way You wanna talk about it? 
I'm begging you to walk in my shoes any time 
Watch the clock 'til you unwind 
You wanna cry about it 
It's making me consider that I've lost my mind 
The way I see, you must be blind So this is the world you left behind 
This is the guilt that consumes you So die alone 
This is the one thing that I won't do 
So say your prayers 
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you Can't bribe me with money 
Can't shower me with shame 
Another killer from a broken home 
Until you come on me with manic fame You wanna know about it? 
Well I'ma be fucking with you every time 
Story broken, you're behind 
Yeah when you ask about it? 
You can rest assured I'll give you my best side 
Seems we all have friends to find So this is the hate I've been born to 
Full are the tales of the untrue So die alone 
This is one thing that I won't do 
So say your prayers 
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you And I'm waiting 
Waiting for the days to slowly pass me by 
(And all the promises I'll find) 
No hesitating, you've pulled the trigger now your story's left behind 
I know you want to see me fry 
Lock my soul you hope to burn So die alone 
This is the one thing that I won't do 
So say your prayers 
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you To die unknown 
Would crush the fish-lens we all see through 
To clear the glare 
Expose the ugliness we hold true
