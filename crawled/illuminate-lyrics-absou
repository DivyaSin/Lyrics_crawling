[Verse 1: Ab-Soul] 
Back when I first grabbed that pen 
I told myself I was gon' win 
And I ain't know when 
But it was gon' end 
Up happening, I want in 
So you can take your top 5 list 
Dead or alive and put me after M 
I'm a fucking genius 
Gripping my fucking penis, living this life 
You can't tell me nothing 
Still ain't really got no money, fucking right 
I'm all about that real, about that real 
This ain't no motion picture 
I tell you how that feel, how that feel 
Even when the odds against you 
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers 
Put 2 chains on and that ain't wrong 
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard 
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out 
Black-lipped nigga with his hair wild 
Too damn proud 
Been killing this since Cam made Oh Boy 
Oh boy, I'm the man now 
TDE, put the money in my hand, ain't shit free 
This business is quick sand and I won't sink 
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think 
Blat, blat Rest in peace, 
you just made room for the next to be 
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say when I wanna say it, Okay then 
Furthermore, we do this for y'all 
Rap is stressin', but it pays great 
That is until you lose appeal 
And your release date gets date raped 
Stay safe, hold your head 
I got two fish and a loaf of bread 
Feed the people, food for thought 
Because we are equal, who'd have thought [Hook: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar] 
They wanna share my light (Repeat x8) 
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light (Repeat x2) [Verse 2: Ab-Soul] 
I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z 
Now I feel I can run laps around Jay-Z 
Nas ain't seen nothing this nasty 
B.I.G. & Pac got it coming when I pass too 
You got the mic, I ain't the one you wanna pass to 
My niggas say my new shit past due 
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed 
HiiiPoWeR, we're on another plateau 
I know you know we need a few plaques too 
The brand new niggas with a attitude 
Poppin', Compton, or Timbuktu 
I might even sell my new shit for 10 bucks too 
Too ill when I jot these words 
True ill when I shock the world 
I know life's a bitch 
When you know life's a bitch and that's not your girl 
Cold shit, I'm hot though 
Like coal get, Ab-Soul 
This is a shift in paradigm 
I remember when I couldn't spare a dime 
Now I step in with a pair of dimes 
On P's, y'all know me 
Flow like water, admiralty 
The best author ever to breathe 
And as we proceed, to follow these dreams 
I ain't losing no sleep 
No, no on them NoDoz 
Just know "No" if it's no dough 
So high but I'm Soul-o 
Two cups and I sip slow 
Taking my time 
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show 
Now let's go [Hook: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar] 
They wanna share my light (Repeat x8) 
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light (Repeat x2) [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar] 
Time and time I drop line for line 
But only time will tell 
If I ever go Columbine 
And cop 30 nines and cock back and kill 
See the truth is 
They wanna know how close me and Dre and Snoop is 
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this to beat 2Pac 
But truth I give two shits 'bout 
Expectations or critics hating 
Shit, I just put moms on vacation 
Bitch you never know my new location, it's across nations 
Court cases get thrown out 
So tell the motherfucking King dethrone now 
I am ruler, I am highness 
The Prince Zamunda 
I am the shit like what the prune does 
Black on black tint like kin to Kunta 
Black is back bitch I came to coup de 
Black on black crime resent the shooter 
Blat, blat, blat, I intend to mute you 
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks 
Without my A-game so please don't ask 
Me about no pressure 
Bitch with the grip of my fingertip 
I can hold this coast together [Hook: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar] 
They wanna share my light (Repeat x8) 
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light (Repeat x2)
