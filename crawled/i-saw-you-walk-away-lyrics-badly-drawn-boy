You're not alone 
I'm not alone 
Maybe we're together 
Said we'd stay together through any kind of weather I've seen the rain comin' down 
And the snow fall on your eyes 
I've seen the sun pour in shapes 
Through your window a thousand times You see life in moments 
I know I've got nowhere to hide 
But I can see your face in mine 
And you'll be comin' back For the first time it feels real 
Since the day I saw you walk away 
From my head down to my shoulders 
It feels numb For the first time I can feel 
How it felt to watch you walk away 
From the ground up to my shoulders 
It feels numb If I don't crucify myself somebody will (ooh) 
If I don't do this thing myself nobody will (ooh) 
How could you say that I don't wanna live, I wanna live (ooh) 
Time that you waste turns into memories And they fade 
Fade away Now I'm alone 
There's not a soul 
No one to remind me 
Tell me you will find me, 
Put this all behind me It's not a feeling I've known 
Or one that I could find 
If I could find you if only 
To tell you I'm losing my mind You see life in moments 
I know I could run out of time 
I can see your face in mine 
And it's beautiful For the first time it feels real 
Since the day I saw you walk away 
From my head down to my shoulders 
It feels numb For the first time I can feel 
How it felt to watch you walk away 
From the ground up to my shoulders 
It feels numb If I don't crucify myself somebody will (ooh) 
If I don't do this thing myself nobody will (ooh) 
How could you say that I don't wanna live, I wanna live (ooh) 
The time that you waste turns into memories And they fade 
Fade away
