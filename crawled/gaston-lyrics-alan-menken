Who does she think she is? 
That girl has tangled with the wrong man! 
Darn right! 
No one says, "No" to Gaston! 
Dismissed! Rejected! Publically humiliated! 
It's more than I can bear 
More beer? 
What for? Nothing helps, I'm disgraced 
Who you? Never! 
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together Gosh, it disturbs me to see you Gaston 
Looking so down in the dumps 
Every guy here'd like to be you, Gaston 
Even when taking your lumps 
There's no man in town as admired as you 
You're everyone's favorite guy 
Everyone's awed and inspired by you 
And it's not very hard to see why No one's slick as Gaston 
No one's quick as Gaston 
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's 
For there's no man in town half as manly 
Perfect, a pure paragon! 
You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley 
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on No one's been like Gaston 
A kingpin like Gaston 
No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston 
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating! 
My, what a guy, that Gaston! Give five, "Hurrahs!" 
Give twelve, "Hip hips!" 
Gaston is the best and the rest is all drips No one fights like Gaston 
Douses lights like Gaston 
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston 
For there's no one as burly and brawny 
As you see I've got biceps to spare 
Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny 
That's right! 
And every last inch of me's covered with hair No one hits like Gaston 
Matches wits like Gaston 
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston 
I'm especially good at expectorating! 
Ten points for Gaston! When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs 
Every morning to help me get large 
And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs 
So I'm roughly the size of a barge! My, what a guy, that Gaston! Hold 
Girls, girls, girls, please 
There's plenty for all 
Oh yeah [Incomprehensible] No one shoots like Gaston 
Makes those beauts like Gaston 
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston 
I use antlers in all of my decorating! 
My, what a guy, Gaston!
