Back to the front lines, back to the night 
Medieval marauders, under the lights 
Back for the plunder, the thrill of the flames 
The roar of the thunder, back in the game 
Storming the castles, swords in the air 
Killing the monsters in their own lair 
Lighting the torches, setting the stage 
You get what you ask for, right in the face Six string sabers, screams in the night 
War clubs pounding, living just for the fight So we drive, through the night 
With the howling wind at our backs 
Riding on Teutonic terror 
We will, give em' the axe 
We will, give em' the axe String up the razors, sharpen the blades 
Tighten the skins up, no one escapes 
Crank up the grindstone, load up the sleds 
Saddle the horses, off with their heads! Six string sabers, screams in the night 
War clubs pounding, living just for the fight So we drive, through the night 
With the howling wind at our backs 
Riding on Teutonic terror 
We will, give em' the axe 
We will, give em' the axe 
For the roar, of the crowd 
For the raging frontal attack 
Delivering the Teutonic terror 
We will, give em' the axe 
We will, give em' the axe So we drive, through the night 
With the howling wind at our backs 
Riding on Teutonic terror 
We will, give em' the axe 
For the roar, of the crowd 
For the raging frontal attack 
Delivering the Teutonic terror 
We will, give em' the axe 
We will, give em' the axe
