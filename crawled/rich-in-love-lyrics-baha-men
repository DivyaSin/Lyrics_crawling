[Chorus] 
Well, well, well, well well, well, well 
I said I'm rich in love (rich in love) [Repeat: x 3] 
Rich in love I said I'm rich in love 
Financially I'm a pauper 
I'm not the man for you if it's money you're after [Repeat: x 2] This is not a bank 
This is not a brinks 
The best that I can buy for you is something cool to drink 
You say you want gold chains and Gucci links 
Expensive fur coats, Versace and minks 
This is not Chase Manhattan or HSBC 
Citibank or CIBC 
You say what can I do for you but what can you do for me 
You want me pay for your things but you want mine free [Chorus] Don't want an empty pocket man 
He's got to have money 
No pauper, no beggar can get none of my honey 
If you're bank book's low 
You're not my kind of man 
Well I like to shop, will you build a mall for me 
I like to fly will you buy a jet for me 
If you do all of that 
Then you're my kind of man [Chorus] Well I'm not saying I wouldn't give it if I had it 
But right now it's pure echo in your pockets 
Girl if it's money you are after please stop it 
You see I'm out of your league so just drop it. 
I know my loving can't bring you riches on the stock market 
You're loving can't even fill up my grocery basket 
And I'm sure that your loving can't pay my rentBut my loving is free girl it don't cost a cent 
So take it. [Chorus] (Ring ring) Bill Gates just phoned me 
He wants me for his queen 
He's built a throne for me 
An old rich guy 
That's my kind of man Girl look 
Love me for me and not my bank book 
I'm searching for love not for a crook 
You will get the point if you listen to the hook 
To the hook [Chorus: x 3]
