Look them act like running a gang 
Got to bring it up 
This is not a game 
We bring it up this is not my name 
I don't want them running around them They spit you are saying amen

And another one, and another one 
Why you want to hold a gun and have control on every one? Bla bla bla, look out

Talking and thinking got him living in denial 
Look ahead we are about to crash 
I'm going to do something, do something

Batteries running low and he is squeezing on the gas 
Temperatures are about to blow 
And he's heating up the place 
And what are you going to do?

Bring him on, burn him down 
Get your self a different clown 
Because historically we're damned to do the same again 
Get your story going somewhere where your story can 
Drinking water from the gutter, sucking acid rain
