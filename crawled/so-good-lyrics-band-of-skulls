Never had it before 
Never knew, the score, till now 
Never got the way it goes 
Then you walked through the door It was always a haze 
Something new to pass the days 
I was all liquored and blind then 
You, blew, my mind You're so good 
You're so good for me 
Good for me You're so good 
You're so good for me 
Good for me Tried to find the way 
Looking up, and all around 
Now you turn the lights up bright 
It's, you that, I've found And the tide is high 
And the water over-flows 
And no matter what comes and goes 
This will never die You're so good 
You're so good for me 
Good for me You're so good 
You're so good for me 
Good for me You're so good 
You're so good for me 
Good for me You're so good 
You're so good for me 
Good for me Lonely rogue 
Never thought that I would find it 
So it goes, always when you least expect it 
Only one, in the world who knows me like that 
Only one in the world who knows it You're so good 
You're so good for me 
(Good for me) 
So so so good for me You're so good 
You're so good for me 
(Good for me) 
So so, so good for me You're so good 
You're so good for me 
(So good for me) 
You're so good for me You're so good 
You're so good for me 
Good for me
