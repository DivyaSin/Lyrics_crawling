Last night once again I had the dream 
I tossed and I turned 
That old feeling's still the same 
It was so real, I woke up cold and sweating 
I wonder did I call her name? In the dream she was right there with me 
Right there with me in the bed 
She said, "Bobby, come and kiss me" 
"Never leave me" is what she said 
But when I reached out to hold her 
Oh, I woke my wife instead Once again, once again, I had the dream 
Six years since I've seen her 
Ain't no doubt about what it means, no, no 
I tried hard not to think about her 
But all she left me was this dream All she left me was the dream 
All she left me was a dream A dream All she left me was the dream I dreamed I called her name I dreamed I held my baby in my arms Oh, what a dream
