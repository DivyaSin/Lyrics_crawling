I am a whore so I sleep with boys 
It isn't nice I chose this life 
They're all suckers 
I live the life I pay the price 
I live the life I pay the price 
Ask my mother But there you stand morally unscathed 
Telling me how to behave 
I'm the sinner 
I'm not the girl I used to be 
I'm not the girl I used to be 
But I am holy I don't need to go to church 
'cause I am holy 
I don't need to preach your dirt 
'cause I am holy 
I don't need to go to school 
'cause I am holy 
I don't need to read your rules 
'cause I am holy 
'cause I am holy Call me sinner I don't care 
'cause I am holy 
I won't let you take me there 
'cause I am holy 
I'm not the girl I used to be 
I'm not the gilr I used to be 
I am holy I am a whore so I sleep with boys 
It isn't nice I pay the price 
But there you stand morally unscathed 
Telling me how to behave 
I am holy Life's a see-saw, see-saw 
It's a see-saw, see-saw 
It's a see-saw, see-saw 
What the hell do you take me for 
God's out still throwing stones 
All your man-made gods and your guilded thrones 
I am holy 
'cause I am holy Under no illusion 
I reserve the right to be incorrect sometimes 
Under no illusion 
I reserve the right to be incorrect sometimes 
(taking part) 
Teach my future what you want 
(ah, can't slow me down) 
Money would cease when I was sleepin' in the early morn 
When they were plannin' out my destiny 
(ah, can't bring me down) 
Money was saved to see what they'd invest in me 
Next step is all beginning 
Save us from our sins 
(here I am) 
As I'm lookin' toward the prison yard 
Old school, bell's hell 
This reminds me of the smell 
(I am holy) 
I'm the guarantee of the whole think-up 
Takin' newer heights 
New heights lose attention 
(yes I am) 
You're thinkin' you need another dimension 
I'm just here to let you know 
How to plant your seeds 
And watch them die, then grow 
Starts off a brash talk inside 
(and there you stand morrally unscathed) 
As they put the razzes on the tunnels around 
(telling me how to behave) 
I was lookin' for a little hope 
When he was livin' a dream 
And the others smote 
So don't point your fingers at me 
(I am holy) 
Take a look at yourself 
When you was sinnin' I was climbing trees Yes we are holy 
Sinners you don't know me 
So don't tell me I'm not holy 
It's a see-saw, see-saw 
It's a see-saw, see-saw 
It's a see-saw, see-saw 
It's a see-saw, see-saw 
It's a see-saw, see-saw 
Life's a see-saw, see-saw 
It's a see-saw, see-saw 
It's a see-saw, see-saw 
What the hell do you take me for
