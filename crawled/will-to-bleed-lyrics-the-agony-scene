I will destroy myself. 
Content to burn forever in this Hell you've made. 
This is finality. I will destroy myself. 
My body torn to pieces, yet I feel no pain. 
This is finality. Deny me your mercy. 
This time I will not beg forgiveness. 
You'll watch me die. Dear father, take my life. 
Your child has lost the will to fight, the will to bleed, 
the way you've bleed for me. 
Dear father, take my breath and I'll scream until there's nothing left. 
Just bury me. Take the sight from my eyes and the breath within my lungs. 
My fear is my reason for suffering. 
Is this the cost of redemption? 
Shall I suffer for my sins? 
I'm willing to bleed on your alter. Deny me your mercy. 
This time I will not beg forgiveness. 
You'll watch me die. Dear father, take my life. 
Your child has lost the will to fight, the will to bleed, 
the way you've bleed for me. 
Dear father, take my breath and I'll scream until there's nothing left. 
Just bury me.
