Hop, hop, hop, hop, I know someone who is lots of fun 
With a happy kind of dancing 
All of her friends say baby bop 
Do the baby bop hop 
Hop, hop, hop, 
Hop, hop, hop, hop I know someone who is lots of fun 
With a happy kind of dancing 
All of her friends say baby bop 
Do the baby bop hop 
Hop, hop, hop, 
Hop, hop, hop, hop So sing this song, you can hop along 
Whenever you feel like jumping 
'Cause when you hop, you feel tip top 
Doing the baby bop hop
