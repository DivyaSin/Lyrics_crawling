Can you see, that's baby's heart beating there on the monitor. 
And look there are it's little arms and it's little legs. 
Um, I'm not quite sure what that bit is, no. Your baby's got a flattened nose 
A widened gap between its toes 
It's smaller than it's supposed to be 
The scan shows your baby's got an imperforate rectum 
And there's a big hole in his atrial septum 
He's got signs of Left Heart Failure 
And quite abnormal genitalia 
I'll print out the scan so you can see 
There's something quite wrong with your baby 
Your baby's got Trisomy He'll have abnormal motor function 
That's to meiotic non-dysjunction 
You shouldn't have kids at 53 
He'll have severe mental retardation 
How would you feel about a termintation 
I doubt he'll live past 10 years old 
Check out his epicanthic folds and his single palmar crease 
A bit of a mong your baby 
Your baby has trisom, it's what he will die from, 
Your baby has trisomy.
