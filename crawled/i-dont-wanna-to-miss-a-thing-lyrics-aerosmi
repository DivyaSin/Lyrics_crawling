I could stay awake just to hear you breathing 
Watch you smile while you are sleeping 
While you're far away and dreaming 
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender 
I could stay lost in this moment forever 
Every moment spent with you 
Is a moment of treasure Don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
I'd still miss you baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing Lying close to you 
Feeling your heart beating 
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming 
Wondering if it's me you're seeing 
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together 
And I just want to stay with you 
In this moment forever, forever and ever Don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream will never do 
I'd still miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing I don't wanna miss one smile 
I don't wanna miss one kiss 
I just wanna be with you 
Right here with you, just like this 
I just wanna hold you close 
I feel your heart so close to mine 
And just stay here in this moment 
For all the rest of time 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall a sleep 
'Cause I'd miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream will never do 
I'd still miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
Don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall a sleep 
'Cause I'd miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream will never do 
I'd still miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing Don't wanna close my eyes 
Don't wanna fall asleep, yeah 
I don't want to miss a thing
