Been together for a while now 
Gettin' closer everyday 
I wake up in the morning and smile 
Happy to be your side 
Don't you get me wrong now 
Before we go on 
Got a thing I need to know 
Think it through, just be sure The life we live (livin') 
The way we lie (lyin') 
It's all about the G's (Baby) 
The way we think (Thinkin') 
The choice you make (Makin') 
It's all about the G's (Baby) [come be my lady] I can show you what you've always dreamed 
[don't be so shady] you can live a life of luxury 
[maybe I'm crazy] I'm just tryna think of you and me 
[this world is so cold] so so cold 
[but that's how it goes] I don't wanna doubt you 
Your love is really true 
But you see money talks 
Can easily flip your thoughts 
Wanna know if you love me more 
than the Gucci's and Dior 
Losin' you I can't afford 
You're the one I adore The life we live (livin') 
The way we lie (lyin') 
It's all about the G's (Baby) 
The way we think (Thinkin') 
The choice you make (Makin') 
It's all about the G's (Baby) [come be my lady]I can show you what you've always dreamed 
[don't be so shady] you can live a life of luxury 
[maybe I'm crazy] I'm just tryna think of you and me 
[this world is so cold] so so cold 
[but that's how it goes] Too many play it dirty 
The rocks will make'em crazy 
I need your honesty 
(oh) Too many play it dirty 
The rocks will make'em crazy 
I need your honesty ::bridge:: 
[come be my lady] let me show you - I can love you 
[on't be so shady] from the depths of my heart 
[maybe I'm crazy]I won't ignore you - I'll adore you 
[this world is so cold] this worldis so cold 
[but that's how it goes] [come be my lady] I can show you what you've always dreamed 
[don't be so shady]you can live a life of luxury baby 
[maybe I'm crazy] I'm only thinking about you and me 
[this world is so cold] so so cold 
[but that's how it goes]
