all the pictures 
spread as they fell 
and the light came in 
to dark to tell 
but you shied away 
just a little to soon 
you could've tried again 
couldn't you i thought it was you 
but you knew 
but you knew 
i took it from you 
but you knew 
didn't you? memories lapse 
when they're asked to 
you could have recalled 
couldn't you? 
but your memory 
faded a little too soon 
and the light had gone 
when you left the room i thought it was you 
but you knew 
but you knew 
i took it from you 
but you knew 
didn't you?
