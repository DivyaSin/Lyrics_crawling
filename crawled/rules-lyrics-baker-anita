Love was meant to be loving 
So many times we don't give, we take 
Love has really no conception to this rule 
Days you gave me were numbered 
And as a rule they were hard to take 
All it took was the number of a fool 
Rules were made to be broken 
So many hearts break the same way too, aw baby 
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule, yes sir 
Your answer begging my question 
It seems I left you too late to ask 
Was this really your intention 
From the start 
The nights you left me are empty, baby 
As for the answer, they changed the past 
I tried to let you explain your change of heart 
How could you change your mind 
Rules were made to be broken 
So many hearts break the same way too, aw honey 
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule 
How could they say 
It would be better this way?without you 
When by the usual rules 
I kept presuming that you would stay, baby 
So many hearts break the same way too, no mister 
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule 
You? 
Gonna get on my bad heart 
Just like everybody asks you 
You've gotta help baby 
You've gotta help me convert, too 
You better hear what I'm telling you
