Like a bird that flies 
In the morning light 
Or a butterfly in the spring 
When your spirit rides 
On the winds of hope 
You'll find your wings And your always free to begin again 
And your always free to believe 
When you find the place that your heart belongs 
You'll never leave You and I will always be 
Celebrating life together 
I know I have found a friend forever more Love is like a melody 
One that I will always treasure 
Courage is the key that opens every door Though you may not know where your gifts may lead 
And it may not show at the start 
When you live your dream 
You'll find destiny 
Is written in your heart Though you may not know where your gifts may lead 
And it may not show at the start 
When you live your dream 
You'll find destiny 
Is written in your heart
