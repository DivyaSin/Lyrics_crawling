Home Remedy Its a home remedy when you put your arms around me 
I know the working day is through 
Youre the right recipe never failing to astound me 
Time proven tried and true Passion flowers, love in bloom

Youre a soulful feeling, and my natural high 
A touch of healing in the night, feels so right You brought your laughter, I gave my trust 
You showed me patience and a healthy dose of lust 
Cant advertise it, cant box it up

Things we say without a sound
