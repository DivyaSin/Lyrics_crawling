This is not our last night 
My love won't be over 
This is just beginning 
Till we get much older Everything will 
Everything will be all right You will never lose me 
Distance shouldn't be the enemy 
I will be there for you 
Patience should be friendly Everything will 
Everything will be all right Problems will come 
And problems will go 
Just trust in what future holds We're anything but ordinary 
We're brave 
Not ashamed 
We're starting something new Countries apart 
We'll make the whole world 
fit in the palm of our hands This is our battle 
I said it won't be easy 
Together we'll make it work out 
Together we'll make it work out Everything will 
Everything will be all right
