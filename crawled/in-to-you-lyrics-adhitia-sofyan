Early in the morning I was still in bed 
You call me just in time when the sunlight comes 
You said "How was your sleep? I didn't do too well. Would you be a friend and take a walk with me?" 
My friends they all been telling me that you're no good 
You broke a lot of hearts and you don't even know 
I refuse to believe any of that is true 
But I'll hate it when they're right and tell me told you so 
I don't want to be a victim of a broken heart 
I don't want to put myself into another mess yeah 
I don't want to be a fool and make a big mistake 
I've should've known better, but it's allright 
Cause I'm in to you 
Early in the morning I was still in bed 
We've talked about an hour till my ear turns red 
You said "It's getting late, I'm gonna have to go. I'll be getting ready so how 'bout that walk?" 
My friends been telling me that I should let you go 
You broke a lot of hearts and then you run away 
I refuse to believe any of that it's true 
But I'll hate it when they're right and tell me told you so 
I don't want to be a victim of a broken heart 
I don't want to put myself into another mess no 
I don't want to be a fool and make a big mistake 
I've should've known better, but it's alright 
Cause I'm in to you 
Early in the morning I was still in bed 
The thought of you remains the biggest mystery 
I was left unsure of all this thing would go 
I guess I'll think about it when I walk with you
