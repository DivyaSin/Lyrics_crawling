I offer little resistance it's a pitiful existence 
your industry is polluting me and my mind and I 
can barely find the time to read the signs of 
things to come that's what they want you to know 
that's what they want another song won't change a thing 
a revolution I could sing but that never 
changed any fucking thing your contempt and 
disregard for human rights outrage us all 
I keep tryin' that's all I can do you've made a 
mockery of justice with your systems and your 
laws
