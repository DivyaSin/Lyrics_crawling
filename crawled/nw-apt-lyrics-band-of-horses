Northwest apartment, apartment 
I'm driving over in Oakridge baby with the whole neighbourhood in tow 
Somebody trapped in the underground basement just a few blocks down the road 
Northwest apartment, apartment With three guitars and one amplifier I'm gonna blow the dust off this scene 
Everybody in population are gonna find out what I mean 
Northwest apartment, apartment 
When all the parts equal more than the sum 
And the sum equals none This thing was built in a day knowing that the Romans took longer than that 
We brought a bass player a cold old soul and he's a first class welcome mat 
Well cleaned apartment, apartment In the morning I walk up I'm ready for the night time to begin 
And what's that over there on my pillow someone sleeping in my bed 
Northwest apartment, apartment
