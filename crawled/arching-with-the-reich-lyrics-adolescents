Stormtroopers outside every window - 
The night of the long knives. 
Jumping the Berlin Wall from windows - 
One hundred feet in the sky. 
A people split to appease the world - 
That dare to question why. 
A charismatic leader could blind a nation, 
After the humiliation at Versailles [Chorus:] 
Dreaming by day into the night 
Of marching, marching with the Reich 
'Til the day the wrongs done are put right 
We're marching, marching with the Reich Attitiudes and outlooks are changing 
And nobody wonders why. 
Passive resistance was too late for safety 
And millions had to die. 
Unconditional surrender and the glory again gone 
Of a unified state - proud and free. 
Keep the Fatherland divided, pretend nothing's wrong 
Is this the end of Germany? [Chorus]
