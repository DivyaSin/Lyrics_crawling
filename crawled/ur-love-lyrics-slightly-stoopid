Making in the industry 
Barrington Levy 
Slightly stoopid Your love taking the tone out of me 
Yes your love taking the tone out of me 
Black roses 
Can't keep the trick without you 
Can't even sleep without you 
You're my friend, friend 'til the end 
A love song to leave you around the bed 
Your love taking the tone out of me 
Yes your love taking the tone out of me And on the the run I take my lova' 
All appear to me harsh 
I be molding and I'm dumb and you go to pull the skunk 
Keep us separated we could never be apart 
Let the turn be on we moving from the very start 
Never wanna be lonely 
Listen to the karma and come home back 
The thing that I be making you control that 
You got the evening to my other that I told you Time,time,time won't be lonely 
I'm running out of time, I got my pussy 
No reason not to run up in my fussy 
If they be calling me to change them way 
Leave the man out leave the man to feel 
You smoke it on, then I wanna wanna play dumb 
Bad boy don't say no 
I wanna meet your lovin' and I'm all to the morning 
This from the bottom of my all 
Even though the world keep tearing on some ball on me
