It's my own fault, baby 
Treat me the way you want to do 
It's my own fault, baby 
Treat me the way you want to do 
Yes, at the time, you were loving me, baby 
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you Used to make your own pay checks, baby 
And bring them all home to me 
I'd go out on the hillside, you know 
And make every woman, good girl seen 
It's my own fault, baby 
Treat me the way you want to do 
Yes, at the time, you were loving me, baby 
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you Yes, you used to be here with me, baby 
But now you're running around with the boys 
You said you were gonna leave me 
You're gonna be over in Illinois 
And it's my own fault, baby 
Treat me the way you want to do 
Yes, at the time, you were loving me, baby 
At that time, little girl, I wouldn't be true Yes, fall on my knees 
Raise up my right hand 
Yes, I would do better, baby but I 
Just don't understand 
It's my own fault, baby 
Treat me the way you wanna do 
Yes, at the time you were loving me, woman 
At that time, little girl, I wouldn't be true
