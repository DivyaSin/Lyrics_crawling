Air on the streets, lights on the trees 
Eight days a week, singer's disease 
I want to be where the sun meets the sky 
I want to be there, it's out of your mind 
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping 
I want to piece of the air when I breathe in 
I want to be the gold underneath the stream 
Having my moment, you know what I mean Oh, it's a blue sky 
And the headlights, and the headlines 
It's a new day, for a new wave 
It's a perfect moment, oh 
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs Out of my way, Berlin to L.A. 
I want to stay here and never go home again 
I want to be the grass underneath your feet 
I want to be the shops on your high street 
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping 
I want to be your alarm when you sleep in 
I want to be the one you can be around 
I want to be the one who can make you proud Oh, it's a blue sky 
And the headlights, and the headlines 
It's a new day, for a new wave 
It's a perfect moment, oh 
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs
