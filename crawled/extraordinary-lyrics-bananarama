Got a handful of dreams (yeah that's all he left me) 
And I always believe now (life is not how it seems) 
All that glitters for me is gold 
Always another story to be told 
Uh oh uh oh just let it go Hey baby won't you take a ride with me 
To the other side 
I got a feeling you might be right for me 
You make me feel alive 
I need someone very 
Extraordinary 
In this ordinary life 
Uh oh uh oh just let It go Got my sights set on you (don't you keep me waiting) 
And I believe that it's true now (come on make your move) 
Destiny makes up her own mind (destiny is calling to you) 
So I leave my history behind 
Uh oh uh oh just let it go Hey baby won't you take a ride with me 
To the other side 
I got a feeling you might be right for me 
You make me feel alive 
I need someone very
