Circles in the sky 
White as paper fly 
Sound of seagulls crying fills the air 
High above the lonely one is there 
Jonathan he cares 
To feel better 
Like the passing wind 
Swooping down again 
Waitin' for the sun to turn to night 
Find him miles away in endless flight 
Longing to be free 
Telling you and me Give me wings to fly 
Tell me why, tell me why 
The answer must be heard 
And from a lonely bird 
He's giving us a reason to believe See the painted silver sunlight on his wing 
As he sails upon the wind and slowly skyward 
Flying as to music you can hear him sing 
Like the windsong on the breeze he seems to sigh Give me wings to fly 
Tell me why, tell me why 
The answer must be heard 
And from a lonely bird 
He's showing us the way we can be free
