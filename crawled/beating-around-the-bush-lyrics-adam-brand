Well living in the city puts a lock on your door 
Oh yeah uh huh huh 
And you can't appreciate little things no more 
Oh yeah uh huh huh 
I can be Jack and you can be Jill 
We can build a house up on top of the hill 
Have a ball do it all 
Beating around the bush Say goodbye to the smog 
Say goodbye to the queues 
Oh yeah uh huh huh 
It's been two long years and I've paid my dues 
Oh yeah uh huh huh 
Head up to the mountains on a long highway 
Living in the city really bothers me 
Have a ball do it all 
Beating around the bush Whoa whoa ho hey hey Beating around the bush 
Whoa whoa ho hey hey Beating around the bush 
Head up to the mountains on a long highway 
Living in the city really bothers me 
Have a ball do it all 
Beating around the bush Gonna get a big farm with a real nice view 
Oh yeah uh huh huh 
Get a horse get a dog and some chickens too 
Oh yeah uh huh huh 
When I get to thinking that I'm out of touch 
I also get to thinking I ain't missing much 
Have a ball do it all 
Beating around the bush
