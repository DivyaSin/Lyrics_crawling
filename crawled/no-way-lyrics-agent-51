Back in the days when I burned out 
I wondered to myself just why I never got it figured out 
I'm a hero on a mission in a protoplasmic sphere 
In another couple minutes I'll up and disappear 
Naivete is the key to getting caught up 
In a side of life that brings you up and tries to keep you down 
In an effort to suppress the most ecclesiastical of beings in the modern town 
We used to be the ones who said: 
No way, No way, I'm never gonna take that 
No way, No way, I'm never gonna touch that 
No way, No way, I'm never gonna do that 
Finally one day you'll give in then you'll be a burnout waste of 
(fucking) time. 
My time is up, my mind is spun 
Sitting without direction and I can't get nothing done. 
With a zero facing upwards and imaginary friends 
On a downward moving sidewalk on a street that never ends. 
Got no time for thinking, no time for reasoning 
I'm just a screaming siren in a world that has no sound. 
My feeble mind is set on autopilot 
With a socket wrench with which to pound me right into the ground. 
Syncopated and serrated, go a ride-accelerated, 
Got it right in front of me, right in front of me. 
You know that I got it and you're never gonna take it away!
