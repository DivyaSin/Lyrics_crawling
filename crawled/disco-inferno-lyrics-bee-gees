In up above my head, I hear music in the air 
That makes me know there's a party somewhere Burn, baby, burn 
Burn, baby, burn To my surprise, one hundred storeys high 
People getting loose, y'all, they're getting down on the roof 
Folks are screaming out of control, it was so entertaining 
When that boogie-woogie started to explode 
I heard somebody say (Burn, baby, burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down 
(Burn, baby, burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down Satisfaction came in a chain reaction 
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct 
The heat was on and it was rising to the top 
Everybody's going strong that is when my spark got hot 
I heard somebody say (Burn, baby, burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down 
(Burn, baby, burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down 
Burn it on down Satisfaction came in a chain reaction 
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct 
The heat was on, it was rising to the top 
Everybody's going strong, that is when my spark got hot 
I heard somebody say (Burn, baby, burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down 
(Burn, baby, burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down 
Burn it on down Burn, baby, baby, won't you burn, burn 
Burn, burn 
[Incomprehensible] 
[Incomprehensible] 
And burn, baby let the good times roll with me On a cold and gray Chicago morn 
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto 
And if there's one thing that you don't need 
It's another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto People, don't you understand 
That the child don't need a helping hand in the ghetto 
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose 
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows in the ghetto So he starts to roam the streets at night 
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto 
And then he buys a gun and he steals a car 
And he drives away but he don't get far in the ghetto As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man 
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto 
And his momma cries Oh, baby, baby, burn that disco down 
You're gonna burn, you're gonna burn 
You're gonna burn, burn, burn burn 
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn (Burn, baby, burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down 
(Burn, baby, burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down (Burn baby burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down 
(Burn baby burn) 
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down 
Burn it down Let the good times roll 
Get us loose as a goose 
Up above my head, I hear music in the air
