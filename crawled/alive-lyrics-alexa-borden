No I don't really like 
(No I don't like) 
Passion with a shelf life 
(with a shelf life) 
There's something bout the way he just rides 
You got me electrified Say you'll be mine 
Say you wanna be mine 
Keep on telling me lies 
(It's easy) 
Cause damn, you make me feel like Like I'm alive 
(When you kiss me hard in the low light) 
Alive 
(Everything you do, I'm so enticed) 
Alive 
(You brought me back to life, so lets just) 
Ride, baby, ride I like the ink on your chest 
(and your gold skin) 
I like the smoke on your breath 
(And I know I) 
Haven't behaved well before 
But I don't wanna be bad anymore Tell me you like my smile 
Wore it just for tonight 
Keep on telling me lies 
(It's easy) 
Cause you're the one who lit this fire You make me feel alive 
(When you kiss me hard in the low light) 
Alive 
(Everything you do, I'm so enticed) 
Alive 
(You brought me back to life, so lets just) 
Ride, baby, ride You are fucking crazy 
And I've been troubled lately 
So why don't we just ride? 
Oh it's a deadly match 
But I got you at last 
Somehow, I'm alive 
N-now I'm alive Like I'm alive 
(When you kiss me hard in the low light) 
Alive 
(Everything you do, I'm so enticed) 
Alive 
(You brought me back to life, so lets just) 
Ride, baby, ride 
Ride, baby, ride 
Ride, baby, ride
