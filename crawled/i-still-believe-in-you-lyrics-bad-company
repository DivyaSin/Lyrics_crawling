Everybody wants a little piece of my time 
But still I put you at the end of the line 
How it breaks my heart to cause you this pain 
To see the tears you cry falling like rain Give me the chance to prove 
And I'll make it up to you I still believe in you 
With a love that will always be, yeah 
Standing so strong and true 
Baby, I still believe in you and me You know I believe in you, baby Somewhere along the way, I guess I lost my track 
Only thinking of myself, never looking back 
For all the times I hurt you, I apologize 
I'm sorry it took so long to finally realize Give me the chance to prove 
That nothing's worth losing you I still believe in you 
With a love that will always be, yeah 
Standing so strong and true 
Baby, I still believe in you and me You see, I believe in you, baby 
I believe in you 
I still believe I still believe in you 
With a love that will always be, yeah 
Standing so strong and true 
Baby, I still believe in, I still believe in you (I still believe in you) 
(With a love that will always be) 
(Standing so strong and true) 
(Baby, I still believe in you and me) You make me feel so good (I still believe in you) I believe in you, I believe in you
