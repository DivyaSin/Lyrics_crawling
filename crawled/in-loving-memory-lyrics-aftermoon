Verse 1: 
Here you come again 
To wake my dying pain 
Don`t touch my old scar 
Look inside and see who you are Once I was trustful 
It seemed so unreal 
To say you, my dear: 
"Get away from me!" 
I`m fed up with your lie 
So go away and waste your life 
I will rise from your fall Refrain: 
The day that will never come 
In the message you`ll never get 
I`ll send you all my grief 
And pain I cannot forget 
Build up just to break it down 
My loved enemy 
Disdain I left to you 
In loving memory Verse 2: 
You`re so narrow-minded, bounded by your stereotypes, 
And I`m a daredevil, ready to cross all forbidden lines. 
You used to follow the rules; I used to set my own ones 
That`s why you always lost when I won. I`ve been intoxicated by your poison in my mind 
I was so innocent. I was so blind. 
You brought me down to earth from the elusive high 
Your love was cynical, and so am I! Refrain: 
The day that will never come 
In the message you`ll never get 
I`ll send you all my grief 
And pain I cannot forget 
Build up just to break it down 
My loved enemy 
Disdain I left for you 
In loving memory
