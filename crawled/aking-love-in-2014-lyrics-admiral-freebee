I met a girl on the bus today 
She told me all the beauty left with phase 
She said it was a easy thing to throw away, 
But so hard to replace She told me she was desperately seeking somebody she could blame 
So I gave her my number and I told her my name 
She was good at love and she was good at hate 
But to the in-betweens she could not relate. Just making love in 2014 
Making the meantime a little less mean 
And all that you love is all that you own 
Love me for my doubts and fears 
But please, please not here Now the night was to young and way to quiet 
But she was always thoughtful enough to start a riot 
She said something like we are everyone with needs 
I said is true, but the sad thing is, not everyone is you Making love in 2014 
Making the meantime a little less mean 
And all that you love is all that you own 
Love me for my doubts and fears 
But please, please not here I refuse to be the punching ball of love 
I refuse to be the punching ball of feeling good or feeling bad 
I refuse to be the punching ball of being happy or being sad 
I refuse to be a punching ball at all Just making love in two-thousand-fourth-teen 
Making the meantime a little less mean 
And all that you love is all that you own 
Yeah all that you love is all that you own 
Love me for my doubts and fears 
But please, please not here
