I feel your knife as it goes right in 
Cut to my core but I'm not bleeding 
All that you say trying to make me small 
Well, the bigger you get the harder you fall You use your words as a weapon dear 
But your blades don't hurt when you have no fear You think that you're deep under my skin 
You're trying to keep me suffering If you use your words as a weapon 
Then as a weapon, I'll shed no tears You have my heart but I lock it up 
This burning flame has been burnt enough 
My window's cracked they can be replaced 
But your arm will tire throwing stones my way You use your words as a weapon dear 
But your blades don't hurt when you have no fear You think that you're deep under my skin 
You're trying to keep me suffering If you use your words as a weapon 
Then as a weapon, I'll shed no tears I feel your knife as it goes right in You use your words as a weapon dear 
But your blades don't hurt when you have no fear You think that you're deep under my skin 
You're trying to keep me suffering If you use your words as a weapon 
Then as a weapon, I'll shed no tears I'll shed no tears 
I'll shed no tears
