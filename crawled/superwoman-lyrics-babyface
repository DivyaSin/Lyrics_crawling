Performed by karyn white Early in the morning I put breakfast at your table 
And make sure that your coffee has it's sugar and cream 
Your eggs are over easy, your toast done lightly 
All that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me 
Now you say your juice is sour, it used to be so sweet 
And I can't help but to wonder if you're talking about me 
We don't talk the way we used to talk, it's hurting me so deep 
I got my pride, I will not cry 
But it's making me weak I'm not your superwoman 
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down 
And think that everythings ok 
Boy I am only human 
This girl needs more than occasional 
Hugs as a token of love from you to me I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you 
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you 
But when you get there you just tell me you're not hungry at all 
You said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk 
You're like to think that I'm just crazy when I say that you've changed 
I'm convinced I know the problem, you don't love me the same 
You're just going through the motions and you're not being fair 
I got my pride, I will not cry 
Still I can't help but care Hook 2 times Ooh baby, look into the corner of your mind 
I'll always be there for you through good and bad times 
But I can't be that superwoman that you want me to be 
I give my everlasting love if you return love to me Hook If you feel it in your heart and you understand me stop right where you are, everybody sing along with me I'm the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet 
But you got to realize that you've got to be sweeter to me 
I need love, I need trust, your love Hook
