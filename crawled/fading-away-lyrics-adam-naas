We're both on the show 
You're killing me, you hold me down 
you call me for sure 
You're killing me, you hold me down Little talks for the better 
Tap, tap on your shoulder 
I feel love but it's over 
I go down down down 
Black stripes going under 
My skin getting older 
Feel love but it's over 
I go down 
(and you would just fading away) 
It's getting cold and feeling colder 
(and you would just fading away) Little talks for the better 
tap, tap on your shoulder 
i feeling love but it's over 
I go down down down 
Black stripes going under 
My skin getting older 
I feel love but it's over I go down down down 
We're both on the road 
You braked me you hold me down 
We share all our faults 
You braked me you hold me down 
Red lips but olders 
None has swing better 
I feel love but it's over I go down down down 
Find blood on your fingers 
Together and wilder 
I feel love but it's over 
i go down 
(and you would just fading away) 
It's getting cold and feeling colder 
(and you would just fading away) Red lips but olders 
None has swing better 
I feel love but it's over 
I go down down down 
Fake blood on your fingers 
Together and wilder 
I feel love but it's over 
i go down down down Little talks for the better 
Tap, tap on your shoulder. 
I feel love but it's over 
I go down down down 
Black stripes going under 
My skin getting older 
I Feel love but it's over 
I go down down down
