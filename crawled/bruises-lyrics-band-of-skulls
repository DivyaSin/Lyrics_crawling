Take this life and this form 
One and all 
Wish that I could give you more 
Gonna have to break the law I've got more to give 
Than I first thought to give 
We'll have to make a pact 
Or something like that Something good 
A little trouble in your neighborhood 
Or understanding that you're understood 
Oh I kinda wish you were Give yourself to the world, baby girl 
Spread your wings and uncurl 
To the world You've got more to give 
Than you first thought to give 
We'll have to make a pact 
Or something like that 
Or something like that Something good 
A little trouble in your neighborhood 
Or understanding that you're understood 
Oh I kinda wish you were Something real 
Another feeling that you never feel 
Another reason that you wanna be alive 
Just to watch the bruises heal Something good 
A little trouble in your neighborhood 
Or understanding that you're understood 
Oh I kinda wish you were Something real 
Another feeling that you never feel 
Another reason that you wanna be alive 
Just to watch the bruises heal
