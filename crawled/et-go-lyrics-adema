I'm sitting on the edge of the water 
Contemplating my strange life 
The sun starts to fall into the ground 
A breeze picks up off the waves 
And everything is fine Let go of all of your pain I know that I am not alone 
Everyone makes mistakes 
And starts to learn with time 
I am content with who I am 
There's nothing more I need to say 
I'm happy with my life Let go of all of your pain 
Let go of all of your pain 
Let go and you'll escape 
You'll be happy with yourself 
Let go of all of your pain Let go of the pain 
Let go of all of your pain 
Let go of all of your pain 
Let go and you'll escape 
You'll be happy with yourself 
Let go of all of your pain Let go, let go 
And release all this pain 
Let go, let go 
And release all this pain 
Let go, let go 
And release all this pain 
Let go, let go 
Of all of the pain
