My heart is a winding river 
Runs wherever it wants to 
Down, out of the towering hills 
Rushing toward the sea I am a watercourse 
Connecting the dots 
I am a watercourse 
Laid out and plotted My heart is a winding river 
Guided by a strong pull 
All-going and never-knowing 
Gravity is a thief I am a watercourse 
Connecting the dots 
I am a watercourse 
Laid out and plotted Evaporate then spit me out 
Over the falls then back to the clouds 
Endlessly racing onward 
Evermore, forever I am a watercourse 
Connecting the dots 
I am a watercourse 
Laid out and plotted
