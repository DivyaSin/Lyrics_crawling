She hates the world today 
I'm so good to her 
She knows but she can't change 
Tried to tell me 
But I look at hey like maybe 
She's an angel underneath 
Innocent and sweet 
Yesterday she cried 
I've been so relieved to see 
The softer side 
She can understand how I am so confused 
She doesn't envy me 
She's a little bit of everything 
All rolled into one She's a bitch, she's a lover 
She's a child, she's a mother 
She's a sinner, she's a saint 
She doesn't feel ashamed 
She's my hell, she's my dream 
She's nothing in between 
I know I wouldn't want it any other way She said: 
So take me as I am 
This may mean 
You'll have to be a stronger man 
Rest assured that 
When I start to make you nervous 
And I'm going to extremes 
Tomorrow I will change 
And today won't mean a thing She's a bitch, she's a lover 
She's a child, she's a mother 
She's a sinner, she's a saint 
She doesn't feel ashamed 
She's my hell, she's my dream 
She's nothing in between 
I know I wouldn't want it any other way Just when I think, I got her figured out 
The season's already changing 
She thinks it's cool, I do what I do 
And don't try to save her She's a bitch, she's a tease 
She's a goddess on her knees 
When I hurt, when I suffer 
She's my angel undercover 
She's been numb, She's revived 
She's the devil in disguise 
I know I wouldn't want it any other way She's a bitch, she's a lover 
She's a child, she's a mother 
She's a sinner, she's a saint 
She doesn't feel ashamed 
She's my hell, she's my dream 
She's nothing in between 
I know I wouldn't want it any other way
