Beautiful Whoo 
(Charlie:) 
Be-a-utiful 
Don't tell me girl 'cos I'm being truthful 
When I tell you your perfection 
Take a minute look at you reflection, oh 
Never put yourself down 
'Cos I'ma lift you up before you drown 
When I see you in the crowd 
The beat in my heart only gets louder 
Your head, your eyes, your style 
The way that you stretch and the way that you smile 
Girl I have been watching you for a while 
You will be making me run for a mile (Charlie:) 
Ooohh 
Your personality too much to handle 
Ya, light up the room like a candle 
Can't you see girl 
I hope you believe in destiny (Charlie:) 
The day I met you, I became somebody 
Now, I'm standing next to you 
You make me feel like somebody 
Tell me what you wanna do 
I just wanna be with you 
Wanna be with you 
Just wanna be with you 
Tell me baby what you wanna do (Leondre:) 
Come over here, we don't need to think about it 
Life is too fast to overthink about it 
It comes down what I don't want to lose 
Million girls in the world but I choose you 
You got some in the vibe, the way you move 
The way you talk I want to prove to you 
That I ain't fake, it's give or take 
Wanna slow it down for the emergency break 
'Cos you got something that I need 
My heart's with you just listen, believe 
Don't be shy when I hold you close 
You're the only one I ever want the one I want the most (oohh) (Charlie:) 
The day I met you, I became somebody 
Now, I'm standing next to you 
You make me feel like somebody 
Tell me what you wanna do 
I just wanna be with you 
Wanna be with you 
Just wanna be with you 
Tell me baby what you wanna do (Charlie:) 
Your eyes they shine to me 
Your imperfections past me 
You are perfect the way that you are 
I'll be the sky and you'll be a star 
I could be a moon to your light 
You add the goodness to my night 
Now, rest your head and go to sleep 
I will be yours for you to keep (Leondre:) 
Baby girl don't be shy, come dance with me 
Me and you on the dancefloor has to be 
When I hold you close baby my boo 
'Cos you give me a sweet taboo 
Your heart's locked up give me the key 
Forever my lady you made me see 
When I'm with you, girl they don't faze me 
In my arms you're a charm you should show it baby 
We should slow down, if you're gonna be mine 
Don't need to rush let's take our time 
(Skip a beat) Skip a beat, everytime you're around 
Baby you could be my brandy, I wanna be down (Charlie:) 
Ooohh 
Your personality too much to handle 
Ya, light up the room like a candle 
Can't you see girl 
I hope you believe in destiny (Charlie:) 
The day I met you, I became somebody 
Now, I'm standing next to you 
You make me feel like somebody 
Tell me what you wanna do 
I just wanna be with you 
Wanna be with you 
Just wanna be with you 
Tell me baby what you wanna do
