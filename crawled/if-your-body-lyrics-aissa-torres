I'm feeling new 
And I'm feeling good 
My body's feeling like it should 
You know you'd do it if you could 
If you could 
You could 
You could If your body could talk what would it say to you 
Tell you things that it really, really wants to do 
Get up off the wall and come and let it shine 
It's your time 
Your time 
Your time You can 
Throw your hands up high, high 
Reach up to the sky, sky 
Do it all tonight 
Tonight, tonight 
Tonight is your night I'm feeling new 
And I'm feeling good 
My body's feeling like it should 
You know you'd do it if you could 
If you could 
You could 
You could Take all the stress away 
Make it go away 
Tonight 
Tonight you're gonna say 
Tonight will be my night Oooh ooooh 
Don't treat me like you do, do 
I wanna dance with you, you 
Make me feel brand new 
Tonight, tonight, tonight is your night Rap 
I'm feeling good and I'm feeling brand new 
Bout to take it to the next level 
Skip right over two 
I got the rhythm and the beat is all mine 
Bout to let these people know I know how to shine I'm feeling new 
And I'm feeling good 
My body's feeling like it should 
You know you'd do it if you could 
If you could 
You could 
You could I'm feeling new 
And I'm feeling good 
My body's feeling like it should 
You know you'd do it if you could 
If you could 
You could 
You could 
You should...
