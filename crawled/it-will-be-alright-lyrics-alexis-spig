My mama told me if I can just hold on 
Never lose my faith 
Just keep pressing on 
My struggle will be over 
In a nick of time 
It will be alright I've walked down this road many time before 
But he has never failed 
To keep me in his arms 
My struggle will be over 
In a nick of time 
It will be alright It will be alright 
It will be alright 
God will take my burdens 
If I just hold on 
It will alright Weak and wounded from the trials of life 
Dreams have been shattered 
Because I've slipped on ice 
God will come and save me 
In the nick of time 
It will alright I don't care to exclaim, someday it will 
It will be alright (yes, it will) 
It will be alright 
God will take my burdens 
If I just hold on 
It will alright God will take care of me 
(He will) no matter the test or the pain of my past 
He will deliver me at all times 
(He will deliver me, yes he will) No light is shining 
The path is not so clear 
He brought me this far 
I can't him near 
He will take my burdens if I just hold on 
I know it will be alright 
Yes it will 
It will be alright 
God told me to tell you it will be all right 
It will be alright, it will be alright 
God will take my burdens if I just hold on 
It will be alright 
It will be all right (it will be alright) (it will be alright) 
(He will) God will take my burdens (he will, he will) if I just hold on (just hold on) 
God will never leave me if I stay strong 
God will see me through yes and it won't be long (it won't be long) 
It will be alright yeah
