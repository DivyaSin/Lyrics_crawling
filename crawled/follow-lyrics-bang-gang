Can you feel the sun 
Can you feel it burn 
Shining alone 
Minding it's own 
Blinding my soul 
It gets me higher Now follow me always 
Into the sky 
Where we reach the stars 
Now follow me slowly 
Over the stars 
Where we reach the sky 
Where we reach the sky 
Where we reach the sky Can you feel the sun 
Can you feel it burn 
Shining alone 
Minding it's own 
Blinding my soul 
It gets me higher Now follow me always 
Into the sky 
Where we reach the stars 
Now follow me slowly 
Over the stars 
Where we reach the sky 
Where we reach the sky 
Where we reach the sky
