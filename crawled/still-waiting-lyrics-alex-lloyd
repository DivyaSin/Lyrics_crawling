I got pictures of you that I'm still looking through 
I got no place to be, if you still needing me I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you 
I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you Do you find it too hard 
Is it just way too scarred 
Are we still looking through 
To the life we once knew I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you 
I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you I'm still feeling the same 
I'm still playing your game I got pictures of you, that I'm still looking through I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you 
I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you I'm still feeling the same 
I'm still playing the game 
I'm still waiting for you 
When they whispered your name 
All the pleasure and pain 
I'm still waiting for you Lyrics Written By: A. Wasiliev
