Blue Angel Blue angel It's the memory of your warmth 
That keeps me alive 
When I'm burning 
And my world's closing in Oh I'm on fire 
Oh I'm on fire I hold on to a wheel of burning fear Oh I'm on fire 
Oh I'm on fire And then the sky is falling in 
And I see your eyes Hiding in the shadows 
Hiding in the flames Oh I'm on fire 
Oh I'm on fire 
I'm on fire... It's the memory of your warmth 
That keeps me alive 
When I'm burning 
And my world's closing in Oh I'm on fire 
Oh I'm on fire 
I'm on fire When I feel like I am dying 
And soon I shall expire I'm on fire 
Oh I'm on fire 
I'm on fire 
Why is that 
That I feel like I'm on fire Blue angel
