I heard that you're leavin', this sleepy little town 
Bright lights must have caught your eye 
'Cause you ain't hangin' 'round 
And people been talkin', say you're makin' a mistake 
Gotta get on my greyhound, forget about what they say Just walk on by, walk on by 
Don't look over your shoulder 
Keep your head up high 
Just walk on by I've heard bad things about the city 
And I'm told that they're true 
Better watch out for those guys out there 
They're gonna hit on you So don't talk to no strangers 
No it ain't your style 
Don't give up when the chips are down 
Just turn around and smile Just walk on by, walk on by 
Don't look over your shoulder 
Keep your head up high 
Just walk on by, yeah, walk on You're old enough to know why 
You're old enough to know why You're standing at the station 
Got a ticket in your hand 
Guess you got you're mind made up 
You gotta get out while you can Don't say I never told you 
Now the rest is up to you 
Those streets can be a battlefield 
When it's hard to make it through Just walk on by, walk on by 
Don't look over your shoulder 
Keep your head up high Just walk on by, walk on by 
You're a little bit lonely 
You're a little bit shy 
Just walk on by, just walk on
