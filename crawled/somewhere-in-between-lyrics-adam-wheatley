Somewhere in between the earth and the sky 
Somewhere in between a tear and a smile 
Somewhere in between hello and goodbye 
That's where I gave my heart to the love of my life Now we're on our way 
To God knows where 
We'll know when we get there You're the faith that I'll believe 
You're the song that I will sing 
You're the summer, winter, fall, and spring 
And I'll see You there 
Somewhere in between Somewhere in between the highways and the trails 
Somewhere in between the roses and the nails 
Somewhere in between the darkness and the day 
That's where I found You, here in the grey And we're on our way 
To God knows where 
We'll know when we get there You're the faith that I'll believe 
You're the song that I will sing 
You're the summer, winter, fall, and spring 
And I'll see You there 
Somewhere in between I'll see You there 
I'll see You there
