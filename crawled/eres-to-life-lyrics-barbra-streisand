No complaints and no regrets 
I still believe in chasing dreams and placing bets 
For I have learn that all you give is all you get 
So give it all you've got 
I had my share, I drank my fill 
And even though I'm satisfied, 
I'm hungry still. 
To see what's down another road beyond the hill 
And do it all again So here's to life, 
And all the joy it brings. 
Yes, here's to life 
And dreamers and their dreams Funny, funny how the time just flies 
How love can go from warm and those to sad goodbyes 
And leave you with the memories you memorize 
To keep your winters warm 
How love can turn from warm hellos to sad goodbyes 
And leave you with the memories you've memorized 
To keep your winters warm. There's no yes in yesterday 
And who knows what tomorrow brings or takes away 
As long as I'm still in the game I want to play 
For laughs, for life, for love. 
So here's to life and all the joy it brings 
Yes, here's to life 
And dreamers and their dreams 
May all your storms be weathered 
And all that's good get better Here's to life, here's to love, here's to you. 
May all your storms be weathered 
And all that's good get better 
Here's to life, here's to love, here's to you. May all your storms be weathered 
And all that's good get better 
Here's to life, here's to love, here's to you.
