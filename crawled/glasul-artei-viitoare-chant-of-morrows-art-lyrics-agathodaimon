Oh, stranger, who's knocking on the portal 
Who are you, and where are you from? 
Oh, stranger to our world 
Answer, where do you come from? Where have you been living the nightmare 
Of these untold stories...? 
And in which star have you finally found 
The colour of our faded madness? ..."Where I come from? Where could I come from, 
when my eyes, full of sadness and regrets, 
look like two candles glowing 
in the crypt of the dead poets!!!" Behold, naked I am now, as I've trodden a long way 
Where I've been encountering, one by one, all those, 
- who wanted to sell jewels, that cannot be sold... 
- who wanted to lead the world towards "better times" 
towards that distant horizon... 
...within the eternal harmony between end and infinity... "Where do I come from? I come from the world beyond horizons 
from the world, where no one of you has ever been before!!!" So open up the gates, gather all around me 
And we'll walk together towards the world 
Where no castles and bridges exist, nor feudal ditches... 
Nor corroded bronze porches, which newcomers knock at 
Arrive yet, while time's not up and you still may chant Come now, let me set ablaze the xtinguished torches in your soul 
Its phantasmagoria and the spell of new magiks, 
And those chants, you're begging today for bread with 
I shall put together with the glowing of 'morrow's aurorae... Though, the gates are still closed to the chant of 'future art...
