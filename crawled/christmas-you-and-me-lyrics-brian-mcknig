It's seven o'clock and I'm on my way 
Eating the miles down this highway 
Say that you'll wait for me 
To light up the Christmas tree Tell you the first thing that I'ma do 
Holding and squeezing, and kissing you 
Under the mistletoe 
Girl, I've been missing you so This is the first holiday we'll spend 
Every night I pray that it never ends 
Feels like meant to be 
When I have you next to me Can't wait to have you to myself 
'Cause I need you and no one else 
There's no place in this world I'd rather be 
'Cause you're the only present that I need The perfect combination is Christmas, you and me 
The perfect combination is Christmas, you and me It's 11 o'clock and I'm almost home 
I'm just calling to let you know 
Leave on the light for me 
Soon we'll make us some [Incomprehensible] And I saw Santa is on his way 
I saw Rudolph pulling the sleigh 
Donner and Blitzen too 
And he's got some presents for you This is the first holiday we'll spend 
Every night I pray that it never ends 
Feels like meant to be 
When I have you next to me Can't wait to have you to myself 
'Cause I need you and no one else 
There's no place in this world I'd rather be 
'Cause you're the only present that I need The perfect combination is Christmas, you and me 
The perfect combination is Christmas, you I hear sleigh bells ringing and carolers singing 
And smothered turkey's that grandma's bringing 
I see children playing in the snow 
It's Christmas time and I know well 
That when I see you I just might melt 
If you don't know by now you need to know That I can't wait to have you to myself 
'Cause I need you and no one else 
There's no place in this world I'd rather be, be 
See, you're the only present that I need The perfect combination is Christmas, you and me 
Oh, the perfect combination is Christmas, you and me 
The perfect combination is Christmas, you and me 
Is Christmas, you and me
