If I could walk on water 
Like Jesus did before 
If I knew all the answers 
To keep you coming back for more 
If I could paint a picture 
And then cut off my own ear 
If I chose all the right colors 
Would this just disappear Because we run in vicious circles 
Until we're dizzy with this game 
And there's miles and miles between us 
Yet we still remain So if I could write a poem 
And find the perfect words 
And then put them all to music 
Just so my voice gets heard Because we run in vicious circles 
Until we're dizzy with this game 
And there's miles and miles between us 
Yet we still remain So if I could walk on water 
Like Jesus did before 
And if I knew all the answers 
To keep you coming back for more Because we run in vicious circles 
Until we're dizzy with this game 
And there's miles and miles between us 
Yet we still remain Because we run in vicious circles 
Until we're dizzy with this game 
And there's miles and miles between us 
Yet we still remain 
Yet we still remain
