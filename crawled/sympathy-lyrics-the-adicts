What's the matter 
Is it jealousy 
Your silly games 
Don't bother me 
What's your problem 
Are you really insecure 
It it natural 
I'm not so sure See the doctor 
For a cure 
Keep your mind 
So sweet and pure 
One day maybe 
You'll get wise 
There's no good 
In hate and lies 
If you want sympathy, don't come to me You're stagnant 
No more changes 
It's your outlook 
You should re-arrange 
What's your problem 
Are you really insecure 
Is it natural 
I'm not so sure
