Ohhh 
Ohhh Is not a question of love 
'Cause our love has never changed 
But all the little things keep piling up 
And life keeps getting in the way Don't make it harder than it is 
We both knew it'd come to this 
Better now than in a year 
More night of tears and we both hate each other 
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss 
Just let it go... And stop the madness before it explodes 
Before it's out of our control 
Lets stop the madness before it explodes 
We gotta let it go 
Before it all explodes Somethings we wont understand 
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood 
So lets just turn around and walk away 
And hold on to what was good Don't make it harder than it is 
We both knew it'd come to this 
Better now than in a year 
More nights of tears and we both hate each other 
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss 
Just let it go... And stop the madness before it explodes 
Before it's out of our control 
Lets stop the madness before it explodes 
We gotta let it go 
Before it all explodes There ain't nothing that can save us 
But you're close to the edge 
And what's the use of going on 
If we're lying to each other 
Every word that is said 
Its too late for us now 
Cause we can never count down 
Its getting close 
Its gonna blow Stop the madness before it explodes 
Before is out of our control 
Lets stop the madness before it explodes 
We gotta let it go 
Before it all explodes Gotta stop the madness ohhh Five, four, three two, one...
