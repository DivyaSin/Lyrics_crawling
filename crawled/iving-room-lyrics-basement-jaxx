All your heads boppin', 
Do your body poppin', 
Keep yourself dreaming, 
Come on let me hear you scream, 
People gonna hurt you, 
People will desert you, Come into my living room, 
And let me take all your clothes off, 
Why you got that face? 
When's it gonna happen? 
Why you got that face? 
It might be to late Come on all you loners, 
Loners and stoners, 
Middle hips steaming, 
Lads, they don't need me, 
People leave you hungry, 
They rob all your money Come into my living room, 
And let me take all your clothes off, 
Why you got that face? 
When's it gonna happen? 
Why you got that face? 
It might be too late,
