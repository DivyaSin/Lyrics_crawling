Years ago, when I was younger, 
I kinda liked a girl I knew. 
She was mine, and we were sweethearts 
That was then, but then its true Im in love with a fairytale, 
even though it hurts 
Cause I dont care if I lose my mind 
Im already cursed. Every day we started fighting, 
every night we fell in love 
No one else could make me sadder, 
but no one else could lift me high above I dont know what I was doing, 
when suddenly, we fell apart 
Nowadays, I cannot find her 
But when I do, well get a brand new start Im in love with a fairytale, 
even though it hurts 
Cause I dont care if I lose my mind 
Im already cursed Shes a fairytale 
Yeah 
Even though it hurts 
Cause I dont care if I lose my mind 
Im already cursed
