Jack handed Rita his paycheck 
With his apologies 
He said, "They're cutting back at work 
They had to let me go" And Jack expected tears, he expected worse 
But he didn't expect these words 
As Rita pulled him close and she said to him 
"Don't worry about it, baby, let me tell you something" At the end of the day 
Is really where it all begins 
With who you love, who loves you 
And who's your friends 'Cause God don't care where you live 
Who you are, what you drive or how much you make 
All that really counts is how you sleep 
At the end of the day Now Betty handed Bob the keys 
To their million dollar home 
Said, Bob, this might be living 
But it sure ain't love I thought I had to have all this, I thought it made me 'Me' 
Ah, but now I think that it's just 
Twenty cold rooms full of stuff 
I need to say it, let me tell you something else, Bob" At the end of the day 
Is really where it all begins 
With who you love, who loves you 
And who's your friends 'Cause God don't care where you live 
Who you are, what you drive or how much you make 
All that really counts is how you sleep 
At the end of the day Now when my grandpa died, he didn't have a dime 
But he was rich, they say 
And when it came time to see him off 
The whole damn county came 
And I remember he used to say it all the time At the end of the day 
Is really where it all begins 
With who you love, who loves you 
And who's your friends 'Cause you know, God don't care where you live 
Who you are, what you drive or how much you make 
All that really counts is how you sleep 
At the end of the day, at the end of the day
