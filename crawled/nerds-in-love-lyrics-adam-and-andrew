I try to process these feelings but get "does not compute" 
I tried to multiply our love but you took the square root 
Whenever I see you I don't know what to say 
Its like my mind goes from dsl to 56k 
Ive looked for girls online, but cant get any play 
Now Im forced to get off to Japanese anime 
We would stay up late playing dungeons and dragons 
You can be my Sam, and I'll be your Frodo Baggins For the last time they are not gay 
Oh yeah right 
They were just really good friends 
If Smeagol wasn't there they would've been all over each other 
Shut up! you didn't read the book Im just a nerd in love, But I dont know what to do 
Its hard to get a girl when your weight is lower than your IQ 
Maybe shell look past the headgear and all of my acne 
I still think she's leet, but she doesn't notice me I can be Hans Solo and you can be Leia 
If I was less like Screech and more like AC Slater 
You're the only girl that makes my floppy disk hard 
I can hack in a mainframe but not in your heart 
If I could be with you, I'd treat you with kindness 
And protect you from harm, like Norton anti-virus 
But you are like Hollywood and I'm like Bit Torrent 
My love for you is steady like gravitational constants That doesn't really rhyme 
Oh yeah, like Leia and Slater does 
Well at least I didn't dress up like Yoda at my star TREK themed birthday party 
Well, I was 4 years old 
Shut up you are such a nerd Im just a nerd in love and I feel out of place 
Ill have to specialize in gynecology so I can get to 2nd base 
Unless she finds sarcasm appealing and greasy hair sexy 
I still think she's leet, but she doesn't notice me I want to be with girl and not get any rejection 
Who will dress like a hot alien at star trek conventions 
Whos as precious to me as a rare Pokemon 
And who knows the difference between and a Warlock and a Shaman But Were just nerds in love, realitys too far gone 
Cause were too much like Steve Urkel and not enough like Stefan 
But one day well be CEOs and have lots of money 
But until then, our only friends will be our PCs
