(Verse) 
Started out the evident 
Ended out the water whippin' 
Whip the water just to get it 
Got my eyes on the billie 
Pussy niggas gettin' murdered 
Ain't no muthafuckin' witness 
I ain't got my fuckin' prezzie 
Ain't no muthafucka see this 
Social not far from mention 
Came back and bought a bankie 
Sold ya on ten 50 
Fuck a girl, it's a quicky 
Got so many cons in the house 
Nigga, you be kinda picky 
Got so many pounds in the kitchen 
Nigga, you look kinda mitty 
Bankroll bout the realer, hard 
Flexin' brand new jury 
VVS gone real cold 
Call it in the Matt Fury 
Yo shit blurry 
My shit iced out 
Summer time, brought the bike out 
Ti-Town, bring the white out 
Bankroll, he's a trend setter 
Nelson Margiella, motorcycle leather 
VVS stones in the desert 
Brand new Beretta, nigga try, I watch ya 
Kick ya shit like David Beckham 
Pickin' hoes like Hugh Hefner 
Kickin' up, cocaine scratchin' 
Kickin' up, cocaine extras (Hook) 
Dope Boy Shit 
Dope Boy Shit 
Dope Boy Shit 
Dope Boy Shit 
Necks on the spic 
Bricks on the brick 
Bricks in the six 
Bricks on a brick 
Give a nigga all of that work 
I neva care, all on the white brick 
Give a nigga all of the k, all of the cars 
Every ________________(?) 
Used to get it all pure 100 
Raw 50 brick, tell ya one point six 
Bitch, ya gotta call 
Know you gotta come sit with me 
Nigga Dope Boy Shit (Verse 2) 
A nigga wanna ball with me bring 100 out 
In December, shinin' like it's summer out 
Nigga got a problem pull the llama out 
Got a hundred units at my momma house 
Nigga did it thirteen summers in a row 
Muthafucka, what you talking 'bout? 
Whachyatalkinbout? Whachyatalkinbout? 
Pussy nigga now, whachyatalkinbout? 
Bank rolls ova bank rolls on bank roll 
Come check me, spent 100 roll on my neck, vee 
.40 cal in my left piece

At the Cali park me and Fred be 
Ova Brooklyn, ova Compton 
At the Crenshaw they respect me 
Real nigga do real nigga shit 
Stay away from a real nigga shit 
On a principle alone, get it to ya done 
You see what that real nigga did? 
We get it how we spit it 
Walk it how we talk it 
Get it how we live it 
That's us 
Go to prison only for a visit 
Focus on his vision, bounce back up 
And we bittin' out 
Quarter mill on me right nah 
Get it by the pound, girl 
Get it by the ki, yeah, how ya like nah? 
Aaliah what these niggas write down 
I'm turnt up, won't pipe down 
But I've turned up, won't pike down 
I'm a dope boy, no ______(?) (Hook)
