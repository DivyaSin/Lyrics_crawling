Got that sleepy feeling...got that sleepy feeling 
When the lights go out...know the lights go out 
Well, I know I should not do things...know I should not do things 
But I really must work out...really must work out 
Really must work out 
It's a chemical reaction to state your piece of mind 
God knows I'm dying Body can't keep up...with my mind 
Heard many people like me...many people like me 
On this manufactured trade...manufactured trade 
Tying to satisfy people...trying to satisfy people 
When you know they've got you whipped..know they've got you whipped 
Know they've got you whipped 
One can only hope 
Someday the sun will shine 
God, knows I'm dying My body can't keep up with my mind 
You told me I'd be dying 
At the temple was the living 
But even when you're dying 
There's some sweet joy in giving giving 
Giving, giving, giving Sometimes I sit and wonder..sometimes I sit and wonder 
In an wine and smoke filled room..in a wine and smoke filled room 
Why we sit here talking...why we sit here talking 
Only adding to the gloom...adding to the gloom 
Adding to the gloom 
Then I see the wonder 
The sky bursts into flame 
God knows I'm dying
