Funny, did you hear that? Funny 
Yeah the guy said, "Honey 
You're a funny girl" That's me, I just keep them 
In stitches, doubled in half 
And though I may be all wrong for the guy 
I'm good for a laugh I guess it's not funny 
Live is far from sunny 
When the laugh is over 
And the joke's on you A girl ought to have a sense of humor 
That's one thing you really need for sure 
When you're a funny girl
