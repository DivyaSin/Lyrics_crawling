I held the keys to that old Chevrolet 
And you held the keys to my heart 
I'd throw a fit, hit the dash, 
Get out and kick the tire 
When that old piece of junk wouldn't start 
It'd be smoking good I'd slam down the hood 
Just to see you there laughing at me 
On the other side of a dirty windshield, 
Lookin' as pretty as could be [Chorus] 
We sure saw a lot of miles, 
Never even crossed that county line 
I would've bet the farm, given my right arm 
So you'd always be mine 
Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn 
Or run out of gasoline? 
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17 In the blink of an eye high school flew by 
You went your way and I went mine 
But we swore we'd make it, 
Our love could take it 
Four hundred miles could stand the test of time Well I left that fall to play college ball, 
But my dreams would all come to an end 
'Cause you know the big leagues never called, 
And you went and fell in love with him [Chorus] Memories flash through my mind like old faded photographs 
I still think about you in that red Malibu 
And I just can't help but laugh We sure saw a lot of miles, 
Never even crossed that county line 
I would've bet the farm, given my right arm 
So you'd always be mine 
Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn 
Or run out of gasoline? 
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17 Love broke down around 3rd gear and 17 
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17
