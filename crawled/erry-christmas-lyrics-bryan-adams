i'm so very glad you're here 
merry christmas 
merry christmas a field of freshly fallen snow 
and we've got nowhere else to go 
merry christmas 
merry christmas to you i hear sleigh bells in the distance 
and songs sung by a choir 
it's snowin' and it's blowin' 
so let's stay here by the fire mistletoe and a festive tree 
there's no place that i'd rather be 
merry christmas 
merry christmas to you i hear sleigh bells in the distance 
and songs sung by a choir 
it's freezin' but it's pleasing 
to lets lay here for awhile 
oh it's snowin' and it's blowin' 
so let's stay here by the fire i'm sending lots of christmas cheer 
this season and throughout the year 
merry christmas, merry christmas 
ya merry christmas, merry christmas 
merry merry merry christmas 
merry christmas to you
