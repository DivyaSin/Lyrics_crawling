Sometimes the hole you left hurts 
My heart so bad, it cuts through 
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry 
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait 
To make us grow from dust 
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh 
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait 
To make us grow from dust 
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh 
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache 
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it 
But as time goes on and my age gets older 
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait 
To make us grow from dust 
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh 
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait 
To make us grow from dust 
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh 
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here 
You know when to make me, imagine you're here 
You know when to make me, imagine you're here 
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
