Jesus babe 
Can't you hear me crying? 
Ain't it enough 
Alone in the night 
And it don't matter what you've done 
I just want my life back 
For a while 
Is it too much to ask? The bookmarks page sittin' out in the room 
And altars of candles casting shadows on you 
You see the bed in the dark 
Well I could just sleep 
I could just sleep And hear me babe 
When I don't wanna say it 
Seein' through 
I'm back home and stayin' 
I can't be alone anymore 
And I don't blame you 
Or pretend to know 
The right thing to do Late afternoon and the knocks on the door 
A fist through the wall 
Wipe the blood off the floor 
And I can see in the dark 
Even still 
I can see in the dark Even still Well I waited for you 
All the thoughts twist around 
The visions of you get lost 
In the clouds 
What now? Jesus babe 
Can't you hear me crying? 
Ain't that enough 
Alone in the night 
I don't care what you've done 
I just want my life back for now Late afternoon and the locks on the door 
A ship through the fog 
Sweep the mess from the floor 
I can see the bed in the dark 
But I could just leave 
I could just leave oh
