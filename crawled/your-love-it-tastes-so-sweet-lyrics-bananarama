(chorus) 
Your love, it tastes so sweet (x 4) Feel the ties left tightly bound 
All that's locked up in your mind 
I'm gonna take my time 
See how slowly you unwind So come on feel you away 
Another up your face 
It's a dangerous game 
But if you wanna play 
Put your trust in me (chorus) You look so perfect lying there 
Oh it hurts me just to stare 
It's more than I can bare 
Wanna touch you everywhere So baby come to me 
You give me what I need 
You're my only desire 
And I need to get high 
You know what you do for me (chorus ad lib) publishing : In A Bunch Music Ltd 1999
