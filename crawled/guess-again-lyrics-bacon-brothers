They were drunk and they were angry 
They were big as they could be 
They were hell bent and determined 
To kick the Yankee out of me 
Insulted me they called me names 
They would not let me pass 
Oh those Redneck boys 
They left me no choice 
I had to kick some ass 
Guess again 
Must've been dreamin 
Truth is I turned high tail and ran 
Guess again 
Oh I must've been dreamin 
Dreamin I was much more of a man 
Well you know that I am six foot three 
But did you know that I'm part Cherokee 
Oh I'm a major hunk 
Have you ever seen me dunk 
You know that I'm a Spanish dancer 
I'm workin on my cure for cancer 
I drive a supersonic car 
And I'm a rock and roll star 
Guess again 
Must've been dreamin 
Maybe I just got way too much time 
Guess again 
Oh I must've been dreamin 
Since when is dreamin a crime 
See I was burstin with desire 
I was a boy of just thirteen 
She was an old friend of the family 
And a local beauty queen 
And then we found ourselves alone 
In the middle of the day 
She took me to her room 
She took me to the moon 
She took my innocence away 
Guess again 
Must've been dreamin 
Truth is she never noticed me 
Guess again 
Oh I must've been dreamin 
But it's so much sweeter than reality 
Well you know I'm not afraid of pain 
But did you know that I rope fire and rain 
Workin on my seventh book oh yeah 
I'm a gourmet cook 
I speak fluent French you know 
I got a big black belt in Tae Kwan Do 
And I'm a PHD of course 
And I'm hung like a horse 
Guess again 
Must've been dreamin 
Sometimes all these dreams are like a curse 
Guess again 
Oh I must've been dreamin 
Guess you're gonna have to sit through one more verse 
You see we booked this downtown cabaret 
My brother and the boys 
Came to sing some rock and roll 
And make a little noise 
But the audience ignored us 
No matter what we played 
We tore our soles apart 
And I sang out my heart 
They laughed and turned away 
And then we sang this very tune 
About my dreams that don't come true 
Whoa their jaws just dropped 
And you know the laughin stopped 
And they seemed to hang on every word 
Like the finest song they'd ever heard 
They rose as one and roared their love 
The angels joining from above 
We saw the light we found the cure 
An end to hate 
An end to war 
The crowd called out for more 
Guess again 
Must've been dreamin 
It's the only thing in life that's left that's free 
Guess again 
Oh I must've been dreamin 
Dreamin's always worked pretty well 
Dreamin's always worked pretty darn well 
Dreamin's always worked pretty well for me
