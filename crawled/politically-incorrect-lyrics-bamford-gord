(Gord Bamford / Byron Hill) I drive an S.U.V. 
But I don't mind those smaller cars 
I'm always watching where they are 
Even when they cut in front of me And I think about that war 
And I know which side that I'm on 
Right is right and wrong is wrong 
It's been that way all down through history 
I guess I should admit I'm just a little bit Chorus: 
Politically incorrect I've got my own opinions 
But I don't force them on no one 
Politically incorrect 
What you see is what you get 
I was born that way I can't help it 
That's just me can't you tell it 
I'm proud to say that no one's changed me yet 
I'm politically incorrect I like to hunt and fish 
But I know what my limit is 
Sometimes I just shoot and miss 
So there's no use in coming down on me And I treat a lady right 
I hold doors and I say ma'am 
Hey that's just the way I am 
Lots of guys I know are just like me I guess I should admit 
I'm just a little bit Repeat Chorus
