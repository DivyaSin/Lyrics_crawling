My nigga just made bail 
My nigga just made bail My nigga just made bail 
I just came up, on some grey 12's 
Great health, cheers to that 
Do this shit for Queens got my ears to that 
They hate us but, not more they hate theyselves 
I guess that they gotta motivate theyselves 
We can never correlate you will never see my plane 
Right in front of you but your vision is so plain 
I see it more vivid, seen it all, did it 
Round these fake fucks still keep it authentic, granted, 
Give or take fucks, how your measures rate us 
Dammit, you'll never understand it 
And even though I'm so lit 
I've seen the cards handed and I replayed mine 
Hell yeah I'm on tilt, but I'm never off handed, gotta keep good time Free your mind and everything'll follow won't you 
Free your mind and everything'll follow won't you My nigga just made bail 
My nigga just made bail 
My nigga just made bail 
My nigga just made bail Listen when you get a blessin' you don't ask why 
You just pass forward, and fast forward 
All my niggas from the hood got a passport 
And them girls already know we ain't ask for it 
Said she from the hood but her ass foreign 
Drive a Malibu but her gas foreign 
Her aspirations I can't relate with 
But I'm like a ghost cause my ass tourin' 
Burn holes in all my clothes 
But I got merch' and this cash for it 
Glass floors and no ceilings 
How I wish we could both feel it 
For all or once gone cause I miss here breathing 
Any y'all saw came any y'all part 
Got a race cars 
Penny my thoughts, nah this shit premium 
Bas Free your mind and everything'll follow won't you 
Free your mind and everything'll follow won't you My nigga just made bail 
My nigga just made bail 
My nigga just made bail 
My nigga just made bail And everything'll follow got to 
Free your mind and everything'll follow got to 
Free your mind and everything'll follow got to 
Free your mind and everything'll follow gon' Cole 
My nigga just made bail 
Tell the good lord, we gon raise hell 
We gon' pop off, like a fake nail 
Take the top off and get ill get ill get 
My nigga just made bail 
Tell the fuckin' mayor he got hate mail 
Less shake downs and more Shakespeare 
Please, all these niggas don't care 
Prepare for the new shit, that Cole is the truth shit 
Nigga this is loose shit, nigga this is Bas shit, meaning this some true shit 
Telling you shit, bout the crew, how we do shit, who sick 
And, tell my niggas in the two-six 
In the coupe, on the kickbacks with the pool stick 
This for my new chick tryin' get fit 
Say she too thick 
Ain't no such thing as too thick 
What you wanna be a toothpick? 
What you wanna get your cooch licked? 
Well I'm tryna get my flute played! 
If we the new slaves 
I am Frederick Douglass of rhetoric 
Ahead the the others 
You motherfucka's better get free 
This for that insecure girl 
Your name I won't mention 
On Instagram straight flickin' 
Bitch you a nipple slip away from strippin', might as well 
Get your clientele up 
You a pioneer 
Them girls fuck for free 
I'm never buying there 
Save that shit for the d.r 
I rock crowns and these niggas rock tiaras 
Or tiaras 
I'm pete carroll 
Left college and I fucked the pros up 
Guess it ain't luck when the luck just shows up 
Like every verse 
On the spot shit is never rehearsed 
You heard it first 
Bas I swear to god, Cole world 
We doin' it out here, in the UK fool! 
Y'all ain't ready 
I got Bas the genius over there 
I got DJ dummy downstairs 
I swear to god we doing this shit 
We gon' take on the world Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you, won't you
