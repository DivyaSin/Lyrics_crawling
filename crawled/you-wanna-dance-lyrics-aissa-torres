I don't wanna leave 
and I don't wanna go home 
Can you stay a bit longer? 
Don't leave me all alone 
The night is young 
And I wanna let loose 
Feel the rhythm from the bass 
Just let it come through 
You wanna dance 
You wanna dance 
You wanna dance 
So let's dance I feel free 
I feel energy 
When I'm on the dance floor 
Movin' my body Rush of adrenaline 
Just gotta take it in 
I feel alive 
And I need to fly I feel the beat 
Feel the groove 
Feel the drum 
Feel the mood 
Feel the rhythm 
Take me under 
It pulls me through It's the reason I was put on earth 
Forget about my hurt 
Forget about my pain 
Let the music be my rain Sending tingles through my spine 
I feel ahead of time 
I just wanna unwind 
And lose my mind It's the only thing I feel 
The only thing that's real 
And when I dance 
I am the dance I don't wanna leave 
And I don't wanna go home 
Can you stay a bit longer? 
Don't leave me all alone 
The night is young 
And I wanna let loose 
Feel the rhythm from the bass 
Just let it come through 
You wanna dance 
You wanna dance 
You wanna dance 
So let's dance Take my hand 
Don't walk away 
We'll have a good time 
Dancing the night away Let's have some fun 
The music's loud 
Just throw your hands up (hands up) 
With the crowd You know it's good 
So move your feet 
Don't be cold 
Feel the heat 
Let your hips 
Keep on moving 
To the beat You know you need to let it out 
That's what it's all about 
Let's just jump around 
And get down Don't waste time 
Don't think about it 
Let's have fun and get excited 
Follow me and move your body 
Fuel the fire that's ignited It's the only thing you feel 
The only thing that's real 
And when you dance 
You are the dance I don't wanna leave 
And I don't wanna go home 
Can you stay a bit longer? 
Don't leave me all alone 
The night is young 
And I wanna let loose 
Feel the rhythm from the bass 
Just let it come through 
You wanna dance 
You wanna dance 
You wanna dance 
So let's dance You wanna dance 
You wanna dance 
You wanna dance 
So let's dance 
So let's dance 
So let's dance I don't wanna leave 
And I don't wanna go home 
Can you stay a bit longer? 
Don't leave me all alone 
The night is young 
And I wanna let loose 
Feel the rhythm from the bass 
Just let it come through 
I don't wanna leave 
And I don't wanna go home 
Can you stay a bit longer?
