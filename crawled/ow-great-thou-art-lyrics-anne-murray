Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder 
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made 
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder 
Thy power throughout the universe displayed Then sings my soul, my Saviour, God, to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art 
Then sings my soul, my Saviour, God, to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art When Christ shall come with shouts of adulation 
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart 
Then I shall bow in humble adoration 
And there proclaim my God, how great Thou art Then sings my soul, my Saviour, God, to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art 
Then sings my soul, my Saviour, God, to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
