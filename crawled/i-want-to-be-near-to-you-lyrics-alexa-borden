I have never know such grace 
Such affection 
Just all in one kiss 
You left me at this I have never seen such beauty 
Such foliage 
Just all in one place 
Right on this lake Well the sun is setting so quickly 
I can hardly wait for the moon I'll stay right in this daze, in this thought 
I'll be certainly longing for 
I'll stay I want to be near to you 
I'll be certainly longing for you Here we are under such a setting 
In such an embrace 
Pink air on our faces Here we are and it's always shape shifting 
It's never the same 
It's constantly changing Well the sun is setting so quickly 
I can hardly wait for the moon I'll stay right in this daze, in this thought 
I'll be certainly longing for 
I'll stay I want to be near to you 
I'll be certainly longing for you
