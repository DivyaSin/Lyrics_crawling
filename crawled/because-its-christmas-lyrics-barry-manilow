Tonight the stars shine for the children 
and light the way for dreams to fly 
tonight our love comes wrapped in ribbons 
the world is right 
and hopes are high 
and from a dark 
and frosted window 
a child appears 
to search the sky 
because it's Christmas 
because it's Christmas 
tonight belongs to all the children 
tonight their joy rings through the air 
and so we send our tender blessings 
to all the children everywhere 
to see the smiles and hear the laughter 
a time to give 
a time to share 
because it's Christmas 
for now and forever 
for all of the children 
and for the children in us all 
tonight belongs to all the children 
tonight their joy rings through the air 
and so we send our tender blessings 
to all the children everywhere 
to see the smiles and hear the laughter 
a time to give 
a time to share 
because it's Christmas 
for now and forever 
for all of the children 
and for the children in us all
