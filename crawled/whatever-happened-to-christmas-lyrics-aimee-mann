Whatever happened to Christmas? 
It's gone and left no traces 
Whatever happened to the faces or the glow 
Whatever happened to Christmas? 
To Christmas way of living? 
Whatever happened to the giving? 
The magic in the snow? 
Remember the sights and the smells and the sounds 
And remember how love was all around? 
Whatever happened to it all? 
Whatever happened to Christmas? 
Bells in the streets are ringing 
Whatever happened to the singing? 
The songs we used to know 
Where was I? 
And whatever happened to you? 
Whatever happened to Christmas and you?
