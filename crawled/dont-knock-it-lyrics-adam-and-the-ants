I know that love is blind 
Don't you know it 
Don't you know it And I know that love's unkind 
Don't you know it 
Don't you know it And love can break your heart 
Like a windowpane 
If you don't want to know 
Well, it's about time you did I know that love's a power 
Don't you know it 
Don't you know it Your love's like a poison flower 
Don't you know it 
Don't you know it One kiss upon your deadly lips 
And I feel the pain 
If you don't want to know 
Well, it's about time you did One day your lesson will be learned 
And you won't hurt me no more 
Wait till you hear me laughin' 
You'll know the score You'll know that love is cruel 
Well, don't you know it 
Don't you know it And you'll know you've been a fool 
Well, don't you know it 
Don't you know it One look and you'll see me 
Standing here all alone 
Then if you wanna know 
It'll be about time you did Don't you know it 
Don't you know it Don't you
