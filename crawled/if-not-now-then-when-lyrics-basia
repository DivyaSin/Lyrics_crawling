What would you say if I told you - day and night you're in my head 
I can only imagine how this could be like having beside me someone like you 
One thing I know - you won't see me wasting any time 
It doesn't pay to be careful when my starving heart is on the line what will you say when I ask you - who would love you more than I? 
This could be right and every cliche in a love song will be applying to us 
Take me as I am 
If not now, then when? 
You don't want to miss the best thing in your life what would you say if I told you - day and night you're in my head 
I can only dream how this must be like having with me someone exactly like you 
I will waste no time, one thing I know now 
It doesn't pay to be careful when my starving heart is on the line oh, what will you say when I ask you - who would love you more than I? 
This could be right and every cliche in a love song will be applying to us 
Take me as I am 
If not now, then when? 
You don't want to miss the best thing in your life I could sit and cry 
Instead I'll risk my pride 
'cause baby I'm determined not to miss the best thing in my life yes, you are, oh, the best thing in my life 
'cause if not now then when? 
What would you say? 
What would you do? 
Why wait? 
Why not now, why not now, why not now?
