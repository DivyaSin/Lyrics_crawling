They can't see me peering outward through the window pane 
Heart is beating, glass is fogging, breath inside escapes 
Can you hear me? Thoughts are creeping from my mouth in vain 
Pull the handle 
Heed the Flashes 
God I love this place CHORUS 
Fate has shined upon my brow 
Fate has shined upon my brow Line of heartbeats on the pavement, tears roll down a face 
Rocks are cracking under pressure, left to right....now stay 
Lips are moving. Looking through them, Chardonnay in hand 
Part the masses 
Swallow harder 
Take your place and stand CHORUS 
Fate has shined upon my brow 
Fate has shined upon my brow They can't see me peering outward through the window pane 
Heart is beating, glass is fogging, breath inside escapes 
Can you hear me? Thoughts are creeping from my mouth in vain 
Pull the handle 
Heed the Flashes 
God I love this place CHORUS 
Fate has shined upon my brow 
Fate has shined upon my brow La la la, la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la laaaaa
