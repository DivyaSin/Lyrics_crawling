I stand, I stood, I'm standin' 
but it ain't doin' me no good 
I wait here on this agate road 
while the robbers ask me where it goes I suppose I can tell you where it goes 
goes to the king, but the king is dead 
black flies are buzzin' round his head I've been here so long staring at the stone 
I can't remember how to get home 
swim in the river, dive in the well 
I don't wanna go to heaven 
but I will go to the water 
or in the waterway 
I will find it: what a glorious day I swim, I swam, I'm swimmin' 
and I love who I am 
because I'm in the water 
in the waterway, 
and I have found it: what a glorious day
