I know there's a word for this 
I know there's a word for the way I'm feeling 
I know there's a word for this 
I know it, and it's on the tip of my tongue 
and it won't go any further. 
I know there's a word for this 
I know, 'cause it's in the dictionary 
and when I find what it is 
I'll write it down in case it comes up again 
I'll be certain to avoid it. 
[Chorus] 
So, take this down: I just feel so beat 
and I think it's time to admit defeat 
I thought I got mine 
but that uphill climbing is never through. 
I know there's a word for this 
I know 'cause we've all at sometime said it 
like when we were little kids 
we'd fight each other 'til someone would give in 
and you'd make him tell you 'uncle'. 
[Chorus] 
So, take this down: I just feel so beat 
and I think it's time to admit defeat 
I thought I got mine 
but that uphill climbing 
is never through
