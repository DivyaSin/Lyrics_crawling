"Hello?" 
"Hi baby what's up? I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight, don't stay up and wait for me." 
"Where are you?"

"Hello?" 
"You ain't reachin me now, I think my battery must be low, Listen if you can here me we're gonna be at a place nearby, gotta go." Let me tell the story bout the call that changed my destiny 
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery 
Were about to go home when there she was standing in front of me 
She said "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?" I should've said no 
Someones waiting for me 
But I told my girl I'm Innocent Chorus: Listen baby I'm sorry 
Just wanna tell you don't worry 
I will be late don't stay up and wait for me 
I say again your dropping out 
My battery is low 
just so you know 
We're going to a place nearby 
Gotta go Now tears are gone whats done is done 
If one of her friends found out 
She wasn't my only one 
And it eats me from inside 
That shes not by my side 
Just because I made that goner Chorus Listen baby I'm sorry 
(oh, oh, oh) 
Listen baby I'm sorry 
(oh, oh, oh) 
Gotta go Let me tell you the story bout the call that changed my destiny 
Me and my boys went out just too end up in misery 
Was about to go when there she was standing in front of me 
She said "Hi" 
"I gotta little place nearby, wanna go" Chorus 2x
