Oh, I was perfect For the circus If he dared me I do it Love makes you stupid Give it up, but I guess it was not enough Cause he never seemed satisfied CHORUS: I no I'm not perfect But at the end of the day, who is? He wanted someone that's perfect, well ok But can you tell me who is? Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah He set the bar Just above the sky A rocket couldn't reach it But I still kept on reaching Watch me try At least a thousand times If he love me he'd stop me But no.. CHORUS: I no I'm not perfect But at the end of the day, who is? He wanted someone thats perfect, well ok But can you tell me who is? I saw our future in his eyes So wrong, so wrong Yes, I was there to put more in my love Cause he didn't break me down He made me strong Oh CHORUS: I no I'm not perfect But at the end of the day, who is? He wanted someone thats perfect, well ok But can you tell me who is? Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah. .
