I can make you better babe 
I could wipe your tears away 
I can make you better babe 
If you let me 
I could be the better plays 
I could be your everyday 
I could be your saving grace 
If you let me [Chorus:] 
The only thing between us should be the sheets 
I wanna feel your heart beat 
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep 
The only thing between us should be the sheets 
I wanna feel your chest breathe 
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep I could be that thing you need 
If you just believe in me 
It's everything I wanna be, if you let me 
Baby let me kiss your face 
I promise I won't run away 
Say bye bye to all the pain 
If you let me [Chorus:] 
The only thing between us should be the sheets 
I wanna feel your heart beat 
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep 
The only thing between us should be the sheets 
I wanna feel your chest breathe 
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep [?] off till you turn the light off 
Lay me down tell him come on up 
You know which way to go so baby don't stop 
You're going down low then take me to the top 
Whoa, oho, [Chorus:] 
The only thing between us should be the sheets 
I wanna feel your heart beat 
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep 
The only thing between us should be the sheets 
I wanna feel your chest breathe 
I wanna know you better than me, skin deep I can make you better babe 
I could wipe your tears away
