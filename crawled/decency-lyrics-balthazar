We take the moon right from the sky 
Yeah take it down, cage it in, left forsaken lie 
Yes we've been rats 
Just long enough 
Nothing but chewing on those strings of love While the moon slips out the door 
Keep asking back for more 
It's what we came here for 
She won't see us any more 
Now what will we sing 
What is it we'll shout out for 
Or leave this trace 
We're on the run 
We'll keep our ways 
Hide from the one 
Yes we've been rats for quite a while While the moon slips out the door 
keep asking back for more 
It's what we came here for 
She won't see us any more 
Now what will we sing 
What is it we'll shout out for 
The porridge is starting to mold 
the porridge is starting to mold 
Where we heading 
Where we heading Yes we've been rats for quite a while 
Lacking of decency and style
