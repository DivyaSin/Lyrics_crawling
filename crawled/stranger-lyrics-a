Nothing more than strangers 
Passing by out on the street 
Memories are fading though 
It's only been a week 
All the little things are gone 
The things we used to be 
Nobody could take us down 
There was only you and me And without you I can't be 
You're the universe to me 
You're the air in my lungs 
You're the fields where I run 
You're the sky where I'm floating It's you, you, you 
It's you, whoa And without you I can't be 
You're the universe to me 
You're the air in my lungs 
You're the fields where I run 
You're the sky where I'm floating It's you, you, you 
It's you, whoa Don't want to be a stranger 
Want to be the one you need 
I can be your world, your life 
Your lover, all for free 
All the little things come back 
The things we used to be 
Nobody can take us down there 
It's only you and me And without you I can't be 
You're the universe to me 
You're the air in my lungs 
You're the fields where I run 
You're the sky where I'm floating
