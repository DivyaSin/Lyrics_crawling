Baby, how'd we wind up this far apart 
Using words as weapons 
Like daggers to our hearts 
This stand off of indifference 
Isn't solving anything 
But baby, I've been thinking 
'Bout what I stand to lose 
I can live without being right, 
So if I have to choose I can't live without your love 
I can't live without your touch 
The pride I stand to gain 
Isn't worth the pain 
I can't face another day 
And I don't care who's to blame 
If this is what it takes, 
I'll be the one to break 
I'm not giving up 
I can't live without your Footsteps down the hallway, 
The strength you have within 
How much you say in silence, yeah, 
Your breath upon my skin 
Don't know who I am without you 
Just like the very air I breathe I can't live without your love 
I can't live without your touch 
The pride I stand to gain 
Isn't worth the pain 
I can't face another day 
And I don't care who's to blame 
If this is what it takes, 
I'll be the one to break 
I'm not giving up 
Cause I can't live without your love As we sit here in the quiet, 
There's a pounding in my head 
I feel the weight of 
A thousand angry words between us 
The bitter things we said 
So I'm reaching out to you tonight 
Yeah, I don't care who's wrong and baby, 
I don't care who's right 
We've come too far 
To let this slip away now 
I'm asking you, I'm telling you 
I'm begging you I can't live without your love 
I can't live without your touch 
The pride I stand to gain 
Isn't worth the pain 
I can't face another day 
And I don't care who's to blame 
If this is what it takes, 
I'll be the one to break 
I'm not giving up I can't live without your love 
I can't live without your touch 
The pride I stand to gain 
Isn't worth the pain 
Can't face another day 
And I don't care who's to blame 
If this is what it takes, 
I'll be the one to break 
I'm not giving up 
I can't live without your love I can't live without your love 
I need you, baby
