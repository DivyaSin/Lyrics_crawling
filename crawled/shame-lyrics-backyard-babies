I've been down too many times 
I can't feel my bones 
I've been down all the time 
I would not even feel 
If a train came crushin' into my soul 
Don't blow me away Sometimes I need some piece of mind 
Shakin' like a dog left behind 
Sometimes I get so sick of it all 
I would not even feel 
If a train came crushin' into my soul Shame, shame you blew me away 
I don't need no sister to cry for me 
I need someone to please 
But I don't need to go down in flames I can't get my feet on the ground 
Jumping around with the devil in my vein 
Some motherfucker tried to hold me down with love and chains 
I would not feel 
If a train came crushin' into my soul Shame, shame you blew me away 
I don't need no brother to cry for me 
'Cause I need someone to please 
But I don't need to go down in flames You like to see when I fly down below 
Why don't you borrow my eyes so you can see what I see What I see 
What I see 
What I see 
Now, look what you're done It's a shame, shame you blew me away 
I don't need no sister to cry for me 
I need someone to please 
But I don't need to go down in flames Shame you blew me away 
I don't need no brother to cry for me 
'Cause I need someone to please 
But I don't need, no, I don't need It's not the end of the world when the sun goes down 
Rise and shine, people, and realize the shocking truth 
You all need some resurrection 
To rise up the thin road of secret action 
And, now get this into your head 
Diesel and power, a truck, a church of love 
Where the priest is gasoline and the devil is behind the wheel 
Try to break this psycho circus on steel 
I've born to lose, born to ride 
And this is how we all look 
No trespassing and no way back 
This is a one-way, motherfuckin' track 
So do you wanna come with me, bitch Well, it's a shame
