We carried you in our arms on Independence Day 
And now you throw us all aside and put us all away 
Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun could treat her father so 
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always tell him no Tears of rage, tears of grief 
Why must I always be the thief 
Come to me now, you know we're so alone 
And life is brief It was all so very painless when you ran out to receive 
All that false instruction which we never could believe 
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it were a purse 
But, oh, what kind of love is this which goes from bad to worse Tears of rage, tears of grief 
Why must I always be the thief 
Come to me now, you know we're so alone 
And life is brief We pointed you the way to go and scratched your name in sand 
Though you just thought it was nothing more than a place for you to stand 
I want you to know that while we watched you discover no one would be true 
That I myself was among the ones who thought it was just a childish thing to do Tears of rage, tears of grief 
Why must I always be the thief 
Come to me now, you know we're so alone 
And life is brief
