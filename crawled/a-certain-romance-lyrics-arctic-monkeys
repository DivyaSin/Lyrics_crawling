Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks 
Or knackered Converse 
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks 
But all of that's what the point is not 
The point's that there ain't no romance around there And there's the truth that they can't see 
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me 
And if you could only see them, then you would agree 
Agree that there ain't no romance around there You know, oh it's a funny thing you know 
We'll tell 'em if you like 
We'll tell 'em all tonight 
They'll never listen 
Because their minds are made up 
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way And over there, there's broken bones 
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones 
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes 
To see it's a little different around here Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands 
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands 
And just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans 
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know 
We'll tell em if you like 
We'll tell em all tonight 
They'll never listen 
Because their minds are made up 
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way I said no 
Oh no 
Oh you won't get me to go 
Anywhere, said anywhere 
I won't go 
Oh no no Well over there, there's friends of mine 
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time 
And yeah they might overstep the line 
But I just cannot get angry in the same way 
Not in the same way 
Not in the same way 
Oh no, oh no no
