take me over, cause you know it's been a while 
win me over with your devil killing smile 
and soak my bones 
in your overtones 
and tear down my walls till the darkness shows 
pull me under where the river sings my death 
light a candle with your holy cigarette 
come down with me 
in kerosine 
and walk through the flames till it burns us clean i scream to breathe. 
i scream to breathe. so won't you place your hex on me 
drive the ship and ride with me 
let's run away to your galaxy 
where children bathe in delusion streams 
drain away the poison out of me wear the letter cloth and i will drink your shame like an ocean let me 
dream until i go insane until i go insane 
like a shot through your brain 
take a trip through your veins 
until i go insane
