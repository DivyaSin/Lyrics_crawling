Look at us now we got this far, but far she says only China is. 
I step aside, I make place for the gambler with my face. Would you swim with me? I'd be thrilled honestly. 
Would you swim with me? I'd be thrilled honestly. 
Would you bring me the head of the girls that I met? 
I've heard the the jugglers who threw me here return this day next year. I, I felt like shit before, 
but when I think of, my baby, leaving, I can't take this smell no more. 
I, I walked this street before, 
I ain't the one that is moving, baby, but this town ain't like home anymore. How many friends should I sleep with in here to make the weight of my burden all clear? 
I'm passing on my highest card, now the gambler took my part. Would you swim with me? I'd be thrilled honestly. 
Would you swim with me? I'd be thrilled honestly. 
Would you bring me the head of the girl I was with? 
And all the jugglers, the jugglers, who threw me here. 
And all the boxers they step out of the ring, take their bathrobes and sing. I, I felt like shit before, 
but when I think of, my baby, leaving, I can't take this smell no more. 
I, I walked this street before, 
I ain't the one that is moving, baby, but this town ain't like home anymore. [x2]
