I'm your secret 
You're my worst friend 
I know, I know 
I know the river runs to the sea 
All of the time 
Still, I keep coming back to land 
Come, come 
Come again 
Karmageddon, my friend 
Please come again 
I know, I know 
The water will support the whale 
Though some girl always has a hold of the tail I think this itch is trying to undo you 
Straight off the plane and already swimming inside you 
Recall the nights when the morning wouldn't come? 
When I stuck you with a tequila bottle until the sun shone through 
You swim on to get what you want 
Then drunkenly come home singing me a siren song, so... I'm your secret 
You're fair weather 
I know, I know 
The mountain never ducks for the rain 
At any time 
I'll never come your way again 
Come, come 
Come again 
Karmageddon, my friend 
Don't come again 
I know, I know 
The water will support the whale 
Though some girl always has a hold of the tail I think you say whatever you need to say to 
Get your fuck on and somebody to pay for you 
All of those lines and lines and lines and lines 
That shot out your mouth and came rearing up behind you 
A tidal wave when the water was inside you 
I drunk you like a coca-cola when I should have stoned you
