Electrify my heart, electrify my soul 
Oh Baby don't, don't lose control 
Electrify my skin, electrify my brain 
Oh Baby don't leave me again 
No matter what I do, I do it just for you 
Love will last forever 
You are a part of me, I'm not blind to see 
We'll stay together Don't take away my heart 
Don't break it and depart 
I'll be right here next to you 
Don't take away my heart 
Don't break it and depart 
When my heart beats, oh it's true 
Why do you promise, why do you promise love, 
Don't say it's over 
Why do you promise, why do you promise love, 
I'll be your lover Electrify my life, electrify the rain 
Tell me the number of heaven again 
Electrify my night, electrify my time 
You are always on my mind 
Why do I you love so, cannot let you go 
Dreams will last forever 
The way you look tonight, lighting up my life 
Let's stay together I will stay, I will go, oh my baby let me know 
I will die, I will steal, baby if your love is real
