(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) If tomorrow is Judgement Day (Sing Mommy) 
And I'm standing on the front line, 
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life, 
I will say, I spent it with you 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) If I wake up in World War III, 
I see destruction and poverty

It's OK, if you're comin' with me 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Oh yeah) Your love is my love, 
And my love is your love

And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us Your love is my love, 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us, 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter) 
And I'm homeless on the street (on the street, oh Lord) 
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station (OK) 
It's OK, if you're sleepin' with me 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) As the years they pass us by (years the years the years) 
We stay young through each others' eyes (each others' eyes) 
And no matter how old we get, 
It's OK (OK) as long as I got you babe 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) Your love is my love, 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us, 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us Your love is my love, 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us, 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us If I should die this very day (very very very day) 
Don't cry (don't cry), 'cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay 
(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright) 
And no matter what the people say (really don't matter) 
I'll be waiting for you after the Judgement Day Your love is my love, 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us, 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us Your love is my love,
