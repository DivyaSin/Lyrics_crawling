Your cousin Cindy touched me once 
I did not stop her so we carried on 
During family holidays 
She and I always found a way 
You never knew, you never knew 
You never knew I was so untrue 
Because I lied, because I lied 
Because I lied, I lied and I lied and I lied 
When I said I was with Paul I was with Felicity Jones 
the big-chested red head I swore I did not know 
She cornered me while you were buying me a beer 
She knew who you were but she did not care 
You may have been wise 
The whole time 
You knew the wrong 
Numbers were right 
I hope the whole time 
You were doing the same 
So I will not have to 
Swallow all of the blame 
You said you were leaving 
Because you did not feel needed 
So I lied as I tried to agree 
So you left me alone 
With me and myself 
So I drank and I drugged 
To become someone else
