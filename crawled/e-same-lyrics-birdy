I've tried to be fair, 
And pretend like I care, 
But no asset is worth all the time. Spent listening and laughing, 
To dramas that mean nothing, 
Can't find any depth to these minds. Purity lost in vain 
You think I should be the same. Don't assume I will follow, 
And drop all my morals, 
So you can look good for the crowd. You don't care for my thoughts, 
Just the light that I brought, 
I'm tired of helping you out. They chose to be blind, 
When lonely and shy, 
I searched for acceptance at first. Said the trait didn't match, 
Now you take it all back, 
When it adds something more to your worth. Purity lost in vain 
You think I should be the same. Don't assume I will follow, 
And drop all my morals, 
So you can look good for the crowd. You don't care for my thoughts, 
Just the light that I brought, 
I'm tired of helping you out. All this time you chose never to care, 
But now you won't leave me alone, 
Like we've always been close, 
I'm telling you nothing has changed. Purity lost in vain 
You think I should be the same
