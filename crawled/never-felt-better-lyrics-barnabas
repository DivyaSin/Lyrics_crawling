Some people call us wolves in sheep's clothing 
They don't like the kind of music we play 
"Dropped out of school, a pack of lazy young fools 
They haven't even combed their hair today" 
I have no intention to cause an intervention 
In the way its thought my life ought to be 
But why not take the time to walk a mile in my shoes 
And you will see the way this world looks to me And we've never felt better 
Not looking back; got no tome to back track 
Never better 
And it still doesn't matter what they say 
Rock and roll is here to stay Stabbed in the back by a few we once trusted 
Then left to bleed alone in the dirt 
Unfounded lies behind innocent eyes 
Without a thought about the ones that were hurt This may be a disappointment, but we're not dead yet 
It doesn't matter anymore what they say 
'Cause the truth's in the music, and the music's in me 
So I guess that means we're here to stay And we've never felt better 
Won't get embroiled in a fruitless turmoil 
Never better 
'Cause no matter what the critics might say, rock and roll is here to stay Fame is a liar and a silver-lined hole 
It says compromise is quicker to pay 
Strike a vinyl gusher, let the good times roll 
There's mammon in the message today 
Still its all gonna burn, every cent that is earned 
And its only just a manner of time 
But with innocence dead, there is conflict instead 
When 'Spirit led' becomes pantomime But we've never felt better 
Straight for the sky baby, do it or die 
Never better 
And its ok to be this way 
'Cause rock and roll is here to stay
