Everyone's so kind and humble 
Don't you know that I can see right through it? 
Keeping all their comments down 
You know it ain't a boast if you can do it 
And everyone says "Say hey" 
And everyone says "Did you see that kid play?" 
I've got to give the kid a hand 
But there's nothing that he can do better than I can 
I'm Ted Fucking Williams People say it's hard to like a man 
Who doesn't fail and show he's a human 
But failure's not a sign of grace 
It only means you don't know what you're doing 
And everyone says "Hey, Mick" 
Mantle this, Mantle that, it makes me sick 
It's just so hard to see 
Why do they like him better than me? 
I'm Ted Fucking Williams And everyone says "Hey, Duke" 
Like everything I did was some kind of fluke 
I gotta give the Duke a hand 
But there's nothing that he can do better than I can 
I'm Ted Fucking Williams
