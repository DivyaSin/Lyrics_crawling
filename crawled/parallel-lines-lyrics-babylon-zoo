The road blinds a white man 
We don't want to walk on the pavement Paint on your canvas, 
see the colours blow the critics moan 
Paint on your canvas, lose control Parallel line 
Parallel line 
Parallel line, parallel 
Parallel line 
Parallel line 
Parallel lines 
Parallel Automation of the world 
Automation, automation of the world 
Automation of the world, automation Traffic holds up a groovement 
We don't want to walk on the pavement Paint on your canvas 
See the colours blow the critics moan 
Paint on your canvas, lose control Parallel line
