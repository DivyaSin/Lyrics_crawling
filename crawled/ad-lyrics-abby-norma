VIOLENCE! The language of the human race 
SILENCE! The masses are the missiles in place 
THE END! Of reason is the one last resort 
DEFEND! Existance as we plunge into war 
M. A. D. INVADE! and conquer like a thousand times before 
REPEAT! The history have we learned nothng more 
BODIES! And enemies on the television news 
HARVEST! the ratings and the battle ensues 
M. A. D. Mutually Assured Destruction DESTROY! Tomorrow won't admit our defeat 
DISTORT! Our sorrow we've beaten the week 
LOOSER' S! And orphans feed a rage that will grow 
CELEBRATE! The hate until the next violence show 
M. A. D.
