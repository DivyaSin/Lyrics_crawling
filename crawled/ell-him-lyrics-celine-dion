I'm scared, so afraid to show I care 
Will he think me weak if I tremble when I speak? 
Ooh, what if there's another one he's thinking of? 
Maybe he's in love, I'd feel like a fool 
Life can be so cruel, I don't know what to do I've been there with my heart out in my hand 
But what you must understand 
You can't let the chance to love him pass you by Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes 
Reach out to him 
And whisper tender words so soft and sweet 
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat 
Love will be the gift you give yourself Touch him with the gentleness you feel inside, I feel it 
Your love can't be denied, the truth will set you free 
You'll have what's meant to be, all in time you'll see Ooh, I love him, then show him 
Of that much I can be sure, hold him close to you 
I don't think I could endure if I let him walk away 
When I have so much to say Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes 
Reach out to him 
And whisper tender words so soft and sweet 
Hold him close to feel his heart beat 
Love will be the gift you give yourself Love is light that surely glows 
In the hearts of those who know 
It's a steady flame that grows Feed the fire with all the passion you can show 
Tonight love will assume its place 
This memory time cannot erase 
Your faith will lead love where it has to go Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes 
Reach out to him 
And whisper, whisper words so soft and sweet 
Hold him close to feel his heart beat 
Love will be the gift you give yourself Ooh, never let him go
