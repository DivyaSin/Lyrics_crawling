Walked away, heard them say 
"Poison hearts will never change", walk away again 
Turned away in disgrace, felt the chill upon my face 
Cooling from within Hard to notice gleaming from the sky 
When you're staring at the cracks 
Hard to notice what is passing by with eyes lowered You walked away, heard them say 
"Poison hearts will never change", walk away again All the cracks, they lead right to me 
And all the cracks will crawl right through me 
All the cracks, they lead right to me 
And all the cracks will crawl right through me 
And I fell apart
