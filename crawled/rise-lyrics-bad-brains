Did you ever question any of the things 
They thought while you were at school? 
And did you ever question, "Oh my teacher 
Why do you take me for a fool?" Rise up, you got to rise up, wake up and rise 
When you're all alone 
You'll search for love but they'll have none This is the seed that they have sown 
Don't be afraid, a better place has yet to come 
And when they won't teach or reach or feed 
And all they do is leave you deceive you Be true to yourself and save your mind, lesson for the young 
So now let's fly away into the light of a brand new sun The time has come, rise up, you gotta rise up, wake up and rise 
We'll meditate, communicate, escalate, don't be late 
We just can't wait to liberate this human race Go, rise up, you gotta rise up, wake up and rise 
Don't let them take away your culture 
Don't let them take away your future, rise up, you got to rise
