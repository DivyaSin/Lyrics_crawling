I feel much stronger now I know You 
Your beauty pierces my heart 
And I get it, Your love is so much deeper 
And bolder than the purest dark And if Im stronger, its 'cause the fear is over 
Youve taken all my shame And I dont know if Ill ever fathom 
What it took to give it all away 
And I dont know if Ill ever know 
All the debt Ill never have to pay You take the coldest part of my heart 
And turn it to overflowing joy 
And I get it, all I need is in You 
And this beauty is what You have restored And if Im stronger, its 'cause the fear is over 
Your love has paved the way And I dont know if Ill ever fathom 
What it took to give it all away 
And I dont know if Ill ever know 
All the debt Ill never have to pay You gave Your life in place of 
What I should have paid my debt for 
How could I have ever lived without You? And I dont know if Ill ever fathom 
What it took to give it all away And I dont know if Ill ever fathom 
What it took to give it all away 
And I dont know if Ill ever know 
All the debt Ill never have to pay And I dont know if Ill ever fathom 
What it took to give it all away 
And I dont know if Ill ever know 
All the debt Ill never have to pay
