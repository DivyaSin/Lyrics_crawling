When I look around it makes me wonder 
Am I worthy of the most amazing life that I've 
Been given 
Did not care before but I'm older 
I see things in a different light 
My grateful thoughts I raise to heaven Thank you for letting me dream and hope 
Thank you for this man who's always been true 
And I do know that I'm lucky to be this strong 'Cause some of us our weak 
If they only knew 
Oh if they knew When I walk the streets it makes me wonder 
Am I deserving of the most amazing home 
That I've been given 
All the cardboard boxes are much colder 
And when I watch our children grow 
My grateful thoughts I raise to heaven
