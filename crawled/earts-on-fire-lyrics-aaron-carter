Chorus 
Hearts on Fire, Hearts on fire 
Tonight, Tonight, Im gonna put it down for you for me girl 1x Verse 1 
I know just how it feels I know just what you like 
Im never all prepared I know you still care 
So dont tell me you dont love me baby 
Im your only man 
And even though it kinda feels wrong I gotta do what I can Chorus 2x Verse 2 
I see it when it burns, Flames are never good 
The fires in our hearts, And its tearing me apart 
Im committed to this girl Im with, Ive been here from the start 
And even though it kinda feels wrong, I gotta do what I can Chorus 2x Verse 3 
What more is there to do, What more is there to say 
The flame is burning now, The truth is coming through 
I want ya darling, I need ya loving 
Its time to make a change now, and even though it kinda feels wrong 
I gotta do what I can Chorus 4x
