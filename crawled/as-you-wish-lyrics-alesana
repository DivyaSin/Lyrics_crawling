Life is meaningless without you 
Love can be such a beautiful torture 
My heart breaks as I long for you 
Love can be such lovely torture I will climb the hills, draw my sword 
And take down anyone who tries to stand in front of me 
Please know I'll never run away without you in my arms One day lovers will dream of this undying kiss 
Not of romeo or juliet 
Stories told of our love will never die I've slain the most unholy things 
I've endured such terrific pain 
Finally I'll feel your caress again 
I've braved the cold and lonely seas 
I have prevailed against the odds, then again I will climb the hills, draw my sword 
And take down anyone who tries to stand in front of me 
Please know I'll never run away without you in my arms One day lovers will dream of this undying kiss 
Not of romeo or juliet 
Stories told of our love will never die Will you forgive what I've done 
To give you four white horses? 
Will you forgive what I've done 
To give you four white horses? Will you forgive what I've done 
To give you four white horses? 
Will you forgive what I've done 
To give you four white horses? 
Will you forgive what I've done 
To give you One day lovers will dream of this undying kiss 
Not of romeo or juliet 
Stories told of our love will never die
