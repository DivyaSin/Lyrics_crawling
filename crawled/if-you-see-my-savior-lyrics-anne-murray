I was standing by the bedside of a neighbor 
Who was bound to cross Jordan's swelling tide 
And I asked him if he would do me a favor 
And kindly take this message to the other side 
If you see my Savior tell Him that you saw me 
Ah, and when you saw me I was on my way 
When you reach that golden city think about me 
And don't forget to tell the Savior what I said 
Though you have to make this journey on without me 
Oh, that's a debt that sooner or later must be paid 
Well, you may see some old friends who may ask about me 
Oh, tell them I am coming home someday
