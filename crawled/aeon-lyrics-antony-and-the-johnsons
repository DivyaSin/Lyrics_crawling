Oh aeon 
My baby boy 
Oh aeon will take care of me All the stars, your eyes 
Raining just for me 
Oh aeon will set me free Oh aeon 
My baby boy 
Oh aeon will repair me Oh his heart enjoyed 
Restores eyes alloyed 
Carry me through the olden void Oh aeon 
His arms are warm 
Oh aeon was never born Aeons eyes forlorn 
He contains the storm 
Hes the pasture of my dawn Oh aeon 
My baby boy 
Oh aeon will take care of me Hold my father 
For it is myself 
Without him I wouldnt exist Oh aeon 
Love my father 
For my father is myself Hold that man 
In your tender clutch 
Hold that man I love so much
