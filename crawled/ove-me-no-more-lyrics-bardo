I toss and turn in bed 
Can't get you out of my head 
Even though you're so far away 
I need you here with me 
Oh boy, why can't you see 
That I can't live without your love? 
When I close my eyes 
I think of you 
Well, I wish I had you here with me 
But there's nothing I can do, oh, oh [Chorus] 
Counting every day that goes by 
And the tears that I cry (tears that I cry) 
You don't want to love me no more 
Wish that you could hold me tonight 
I'm hurting inside 
'Cause you don't want to love me 
'Cause you don't want to love me 
Love me no more I tried to call your phone 
But you ain't been at home 
I need to find out where you are 
So I can make you see 
That you belong with me 
For me there is no other love 
When I close my eyes, I think of you 
I wish I had you here with me 
But there's nothing I can do, oh, oh [Chorus] All I know is that I can't live without you 
Oh, but I want to know 
What made you feel this way 
I'll be right here for you (right here for you) 
And everything that you do (thing that you do) 
But how can I get close to you? 
When you don't feel the way I do, ah, ah [Chorus]
