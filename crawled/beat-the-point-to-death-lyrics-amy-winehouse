Make a name for myself in different ways 
All the while you will see my songs of praise 
How can I concentrate when all the while my head 
Throw me scenarios so I tease my self esteem 
Though I can talk it through 
Really I finally talk 
My frustration is released but nothing let em know 
And added to that Im sick of having to seek some peace 
Because I need emotion with my physical release Cant help 
But bring it up and beat the point to death 
But my 
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath 
Cant help 
But bring it up and beat the point to death 
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Now everywhere I got and I always stare 
I justify attraction by your hands, your lips, your hair 
And so although I always look I know that I cant touch 
And because I can only take a full time man so much 
And now I reached a point where I dont care anymore 
Its a necessity just like it was before 
Many says I ignore the way my body aches 
Cause Im the shit I earn I cant look for my sins 
Oh, oh, no Cant help 
But bring it up and beat the point to death 
But my 
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath 
Cant help 
But bring it up and beat the point to death 
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help 
I cant help but bring it up, no 
But my 
Nothing, no 
Cant 
I cant help, no, no 
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help 
But bring it up and beat the point to death 
But my 
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath 
Cant help 
But bring it up and beat the point to death 
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help 
But my 
Cant help 
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath
