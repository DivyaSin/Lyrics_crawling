I took my fire upon a mountain 
To mock all truth that flatters men 
And I damned all hope 
That tomorrow shows 
For I cursed all life there is 
As screaming ghosts 
No heaven knows 
And I want to be high as the suns that shine 
All the time 
I took my fire upon a mountain 
To sift through thoughts of all beasts and men 
And I purged the gold thru which the world shall end 
For I courted the Dragon 
Yeah that old serpent 
And I got to be high as the suns that shine 
All the time 
And all of thee 
Shall be drunk of me 
Oh yes you will 
I think I'm 
Deggael
