You let me hit you 
So I won't touch the children 
So how hard do I have to fuckin' beat 
You to have a crack at the kids? Looks like you fell down the stairs 
On the way to the hospital again 
And not soon enough 
And not soon enough I have a coat hanger abortion lined up 
For our six year old sweet little princess 
Before the bandages come off your eyes
