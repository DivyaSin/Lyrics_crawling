Just a young girl 
Imagine this 
She made me shake inside with 
Her first kiss 
No illusions 
Made it clear 
She found another friend when 
She whispered in my ear 
She said 
I am the only one 
And you've been hungry to see 
That if I 
I am the only one 
Can you really satisfy me 
Took me over 
To her room 
Our bodies drenched in sweat and 
Her perfume 
Slipped her shoes off 
And then her dress 
Pulled me close and you can 
Guess the rest
