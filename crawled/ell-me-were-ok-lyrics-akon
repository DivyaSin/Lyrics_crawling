[Verse 1] 
Tell me what you feel, don't tell me it's nothing 
It's gotta be something, still want from me 
Tell me what you hear, if my words mean nothing 
Wish they would say something, something that would heal [Chorus] 
But I have my pride and you know it, know it, know it 
I show it, show it, show it 
And I'm running outta time, I know it, know it, know it 
You show it, show it, show it 
Just tell me that we're okay 
There's nothing left to say, just tell me we're okay 
Just tell me that we're okay 
If there's something left to say, just tell me we're okay [Verse 2] 
Tell me through your tears, that this don't change nothing 
And we still mean something cause some things are real 
Tell me that you know, that I would be nothing 
But we could be something, for all our years [Chorus] 
But I have my pride and you know it, know it, know it 
I show it, show it, show it 
And I'm running outta time, I know it, know it, know it 
You show it, show it, show it 
Just tell me that we're okay 
There's nothing left to say, just tell me we're okay 
Just tell me that we're okay 
If there's something left to say, just tell me we're okay 
Please tell me that we're okay 
If there's something left to say, just tell me we're okay 
Tell me that 
Tell me that, tell me we're okay
