Will not back down now 
I've got no place else to run and hide to 
Have come to far to buckle now 
Can't lay this one down to the likes of you And i don't say that with some bullshit sense of pride 
I need you to know that I'm not done screaming 
About whether or not your foot has the right 
To be in some kids face Will not back down now 
I've got no plave else to run and hide to 
Have come to far to buckle now 
Can't lay this one down to the likes of you And if that's the case 
Then i say arm us all 
And we'll get this asshole contest 
Right under way But it would be just like you to drag your keyboard to a gunfight 
And so long after the smoke had cleared 
I stood there all night if you had so much to say 
Instead of running home lion tail between your legs 
Crying about some little needle stuck in your paw I don't give a fuck if my words have grown old 
I've never been so willing to see a relationship fray 
I don't give a fuck how thin this ice has become 
I'm stomping on it anyway
