If you ever been in love, though it ain't easy 
Every time you pack up, you never in the believing 
Talk like you're so bad, telling your girls I have hurt you back 
And everything that was alright with the other way 
And now you're standing there, with tears in hand 
Anything that I ... to say when he left, he change with the weather 
But if you don't know nothing else you know what I take around is there 
So when you fall and scrape your heart don't look for another one 
Just trust don't 
I won't need no two hearts if you break it, put a band aid over and then move on, 
hurt them too strong, and then follow, it's not a secret 
The pain is ... hope you can take it, put a band aid over and then move on, 
girl don't wait don't wait two strokes 
Put a band aid over ya, put a band aid over ya Whenever I go out, I love when you see me 
And my ... ain't held down, you can't believe it 
Tell me what you expect I will be struck up in my bed 
It's not the end of the world just cause you went away 
I'll find somebody else to love me the way that you couldn't 
And everything is ... and I'm so much better 
So if I don't know nothing else, know we can take care of me well 
So when you call I press ignore and I give another thought, oh I I won't need no two hearts if you break it, put a band aid over and then move on, 
hurt them too strong, and then follow, it's not a secret 
The pain is ... hope you can take it, put a band aid over and then move on, 
girl don't wait don't wait two strokes 
Put a band aid over ya, put a band aid over ya We came in crying tears of right away, of right away 
We kissed once more and made it all threw away, oho 
I'm good, I'll patch myself up and keep rocking, I'm good 
I'm good, you can hurt me boy but it ain't no stopping, I'm good, 
I'm good, I'll patch myself up and keep rocking, I'm good 
I'm good, you can hurt me boy but it ain't no stopping, I'm good,
