Dr. seuss is dead 
We await life 
Dr. seuss is dead A cloud of flies obscure the sun 
A stone is dropped the dream undone 
Ripples grow and ride the tide 
The dead things crawl from deep inside With its dying, sour breath 
The burning smell of insect flesh 
Hungry things in circles crowd 
Around tv's turned up too loud (Go) We are the dead next door 
(It's up too loud) Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor 
(It's up too loud) Taste the light, inject the lord 
(It's up too loud) I cut myself again because I'm so fuckin' bored 
(It's too fuckin' loud) We are the dead next door 
(It's too fuckin' loud) Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor 
(It's too fuckin' loud) Taste the light, inject the lord 
(It's too fuckin' loud) I cut myself again because I'm so fuckin' bored 
Motherfucker! We await life 
Dr. seuss is dead The dream is swirling, I'm alone 
Where the streets are paved with bone 
Buildings with a hundred eyes 
Watch me through the swarming flies Behind shades pulled down tight 
Things are growing without light 
Hungry things in circles crowd 
Around tv's turned up too loud (Go) We are the dead next door 
(It's up too loud) Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor 
(It's up too loud) Taste the light, inject the lord 
(It's up too loud) I cut myself again because I'm so fuckin' bored 
(It's too fuckin' loud) We are the dead next door 
(It's too fuckin' loud) Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor 
(It's too fuckin' loud) Taste the light, inject the lord 
(It's too fuckin' loud) I cut myself again because I'm so fuckin' bored 
Motherfucker! The dream sea has been poisoned 
The stop light flashes me red (Motherfucker!) 
Innocence suffocated in its sleep 
Dr. seuss is dead (Motherfucker!) (verse X2) Dead (repeat) 
He's fuckin' dead
