We're marching to the top, to the top, to the top 
Yes, we're marching to the top of Dragon Mountain 
Up, up, up, up there is no place to hide 
'Cause a dragon lurks inside At the top of Dragon Mountain 
At the top of Dragon Mountain Do you think that the dragon is scary? 
Yes, I do 
Do you think that the dragon is hairy? 
No, do you? Do you think that the dragon plays games? 
I hope so 
Do you think that he shoots out flames? 
Please say no We're marching to the top, to the top, to the top 
Yes, we're marching to the top of Dragon Mountain 
Up, up, up, up there is no place to hide 
'Cause a dragon lurks inside At the top of Dragon Mountain 
At the top of Dragon Mountain Do you think that the dragon will greet us? 
That be neat 
Or perhaps he will try to eat us 
You say eat? Perhaps we won't fit in his belly 
Then I cheer 
Don't dragons like goblins and jelly 
I'm outta here We're marching to the top, to the top, to the top 
Yes, we're marching to the top of Dragon Mountain 
Up, up, up, up there is no place to hide 
'Cause a dragon lurks inside At the top of Dragon Mountain 
At the top of Dragon Mountain 
At the top of Dragon Mountain At the top of Dragon Mountain 
At the top of Dragon Mountain 
At the top of Dragon Mountain
