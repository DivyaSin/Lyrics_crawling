[Garnet] Take a moment to think of just, 
Flexibility, love, and trust; 
Take a moment to think of just, 
Flexibility, love, and trust; Here comes a thought, 
That might alarm you, 
What someone said, 
And how it harmed you, Something you did, 
That failed to be charming, 
Things that you said, are; 
Suddenly swarming Oh, 
You're losing sight, 
You're losing touch, 
All these little things, 
Seem to matter so much, That they confuse you, 
That I might lose you, Take a moment, remind yourself, to, 
Take a moment and find yourself, 
Take a moment to ask yourself, 
If this is how we fall apart, But its not, 
But its not, 
But its not, 
But its not, 
But its not, It's okay, 
It's okay, 
It's okay, 
It's okay, 
It's okay, You've got nothing, 
got nothing, 
got nothing, 
got nothing to fear, I'm here, 
I'm here, 
I'm here. [Stevonnie] Here comes a thought,
