oh where did my goldfish go 
swam away now 
where did my golfish go oh oh! oh where did my goldfish go 
swam away now 
where did my golfish go oh oh! so you think you shound surreal 
just imagine how it feels outside 
no surprises at corners are found 
when you go round and around and around 
day after day after day 
should have tried it a different way 
by now by now 
but t's the glass walls we never see 
the invisible boundary some how 
so you think you sound surreal 
to breath n the rarefield air 
it's an endless ocean out there 
oh where did my goldfish go 
he swam away now
