Oh the holy earth's a mural 
seen from way up high 
abstracted natural bas-relief 
witnessed from the sky 
clouds that cast a single shadow 
drifting moving on the ground 
creating an illusion 
as the world goes round Places where the folks inhabit 
have a geometric grace 
circles, squares, sometimes triangles 
rules and lines in space 
waterways and craggy mountains 
seemingly reveal a plan 
just as if somebody drew it 
with a great big giant hand Life's a repetition 
it's an action of repeat 
act of doing, act of saying 
something bitter, something sweet 
acts of life that keep occurring 
ghosts appearing through the sound 
waving at us from a distance 
'cause the whole wide world is round and round and round and round 
the whole wide world is round Generations generating 
bring the people here en masse 
living in a world where 
everybody's second class 
forming moving in a circle 
ghosts appearing through the sound 
waving at us from a distance 
cause the whole wide world is round and round and round and round 
the whole wide world is round People here before us 
leave their memories behind 
actions done and actions written 
acts impressed upon our mind 
forming moving in a circle 
ghosts appearing through the sound 
waving at us from a distance 
cause the whole wide world is round and round and round and round 
the whole wide world is round Round and round and round and round 
the whole wide world is round
