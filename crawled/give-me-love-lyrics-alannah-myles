Uhuh... 
Uhuh... 
Try a little kindness baby 
Show a little empathy 
When my eyes are filled with blindness 
Try a little sympathy with me 
Careful of the things you say with me 
If you wanna have your way with me 
Whisper in my ear real low but, 
Spare Me The Sorrow... 
Spare Me The Sorrow... 
(Give me love and youll never be sorry, Id rather be alone than lonely) 
(Theres a price to pay for freedom, I wanna know if you are for me) 
Uhuh... Uhuh... 
Give love and youll never be sorry 
Theres a price to pay for freedom 
I can smell the morning glory Will it in your heart and your will be done with me 
Careful of the time you spend with me 
If you wanna learn to bend with me 
You can have your way you know but, 
Spare Me the Sorrow... 
Spare Me The Sorrow... 
O child, comon child, comon child, 
Oh, oh child, comon child 
Oh, oh, oh, comon child 
Oh, oh, cmon, comon child 
Mmmmm... 
I only wanna see you smile 
Rather be alone than lonely 
Id rather be, Id rather be alone than lonely 
Ah... with you 
Spare Me The Sorrow... 
Spare Me The Sorrow... 
Try a little kindness baby!
