In your mind's eye lives a memory 
Hard to find, blinded by sorrow 
And her cold voice sings a melody 
Hear her sing, hell frozen rain falls down She can't hear your voice. 
She can't hear you call 
You have burned your choice 
If you're here, can you prove you're really here? There is a moment in time 
When all the cards that you've played divide 
You feel the temperature dive 
And all your demons inside come crashing through In your mind's eye lives a memory 
Hard to find, blinded by sorrow 
And a strange voice sings a melody 
Hear it sing, hell frozen rain falls down Everything is wrong 
This is not my home, is it? 
Do I know your face? 
Does my mind wish to forget? A toast to lonely souls 
Who never could take control of life 
And all the missing we love 
I hope the darkness they find will give them light In your mind's eye lives a memory 
Hard to find, blinded by pain 
And a cold voice sings a melody 
Hear it sing, hell frozen rain Our safe hearts feeling dangerous 
Missing truth frozen in lies 
Is your family just a memory? 
Once again, hell frozen rain falls down Of all these pieces of broken dreams 
This one that scares and confuses me 
If all these things that you say are true 
You should be someone I always knew In your mind's eye lives a memory 
Hard to find, blinded by pain 
And your father sings a melody 
Hear him sing, hell frozen rain Our safe hearts feeling dangerous 
Missing truth frozen in lies 
Are your loved ones just a memory? 
Burning pain, hell frozen rain falls down 
Down... Life is cold here. Empty hallowed ground 
In my head blood-colored rain falls down
