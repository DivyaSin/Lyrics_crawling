Just when I thought 
I had handled solace 
I could soften my guard behind false confidence Just when I felt 
Humbled by insipid 
Except from this blind-side and from reading a script 
'Cause I am seduced by reaction and under the influence I'm slipping again I'm 
Up to my tricks off my wagon 
I have no defense I'm 
Wreaking havoc 
Wreaking havoc and consequence I get reduced by my own willfulness as 
I reach for my usual odd replacements 
'Cause I wish for sanction it lacks in my steps I'm slipping grip I'm 
Up to my tricks off my wagon 
I have no defense I'm 
Wreaking havoc 
Wreaking havoc and consequence If forgiveness is understanding that I 
Affirming a compact for the millionth time 
From this tumbling house of cards of mine I am beaten by my impulsiveness 
By this uncanny foreshadowing of regret 
'Cause I'm repulsed by restriction at least that's my excuse I'm slipping again I'm 
Up to my tricks off my wagon 
I have no defense I'm 
Wreaking havoc 
From v 
Wreaking havoc and consequence 
I have no defense I'm 
Wreaking havoc 
Wreaking havoc and consequence
