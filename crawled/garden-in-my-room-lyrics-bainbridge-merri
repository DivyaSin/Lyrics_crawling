There's a garden in my room 
Would you like to take a look? 
There are fascinating things you'll find there And if you dare to come inside 
There is nothing I will hide 
Come where there is sweet perfume 
In the garden in my room There's a garden in my room 
Would you like to take a look? 
Rest your body on my velvet roses Once you've tasted my delights 
Many days will turn to nights 
There is nothing you won't do 
For the garden in my room
