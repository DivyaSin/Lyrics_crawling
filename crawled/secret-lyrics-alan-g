Uh-uh-uh-uh Baby, when you touch me 
I can sense you movin' through me 
But I'm feelin' 
That you're reelin' 
Like you're hidin' a secret Baby, when you look at me 
I can feel you gettin' crazy 
Are you thinkin' 
You'll be sinkin' 
In the sea of your secret So why do I 
Always find my guy 
In a closet 
To uh-uh-uh-uh I know, I know, I know what you've been hidin' 
I know, I know, I know that you've been lyin' 
Ya can't deny the truth that's right behind ya' 
It's time to satisfy what's deep inside ya' 
Cuz when we uh-uh-uh 
I know you're hidin' a secret Baby, on the fence now 
I can feel you gettin' tense now 
Seems my fella's 
Kinda jealous

To whisper quietly 
To use my mouth for
