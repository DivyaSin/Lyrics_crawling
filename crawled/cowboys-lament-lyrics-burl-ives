As I walked out in the streets of Laredo 
As I walked out in Laredo one day 
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen 
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy 
These words he did say as I boldly walked by 
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story 
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing 
Once in the saddle I used to go gay 
First down to Rosie's and then to the card house 
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today Get sixteen gamblers to carry my coffin 
Get six jolly cowboys to sing me a song 
Take me to the graveyard and lay the sod o'er me 
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin 
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song 
Take me to the valley and lay the sod o'er me 
For I'm a young cowboy, I know I've done wrong Oh beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly 
Play the Dead March as they carry me along 
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin 
Put roses to deaden the clods as they fall As I walked out in the streets of Laredo 
As I walked out in Laredo one day 
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen 
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
