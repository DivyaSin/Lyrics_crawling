[Chorus: BandoMoss] 2x I'm booted up...I'm booted up... 
I'm booted up...I'm booted..... Tricking bitches....selling drugs down in the south..... 
put that money on the phone make that money talk [Verse: BandoMoss] Tricking bitchs...selling drugs down in the south.... 
put that money on the phone make that money talk.... 
let that money talk nigga stop running yo mouth..... 
get this shit nigga how you living right now..... 
I'm booted up...I'm booted up...... 
got a lil freak bitch the trap she down to fuck...... 
call the plug up and tell him I'm looking for a dub...... 
you know I'm bout that money getting.... 
you know I'm bout that pimping..... 
tricking bitches and kitchens..... 
taking flights with no tickets....

whipping dope like it's chilli..... 
put a bitch on every corner in every city.... [Chorus: BandoMoss] 2x I'm booted up...I'm booted up... 
I'm booted up... 
I'm booted..... Tricking bitches....selling drugs down in the south..... 
put that money on the phone make that money talk
