It's not the same as it was when we started out 
When we liked it 
When everything was fine 
It's not the same as it was when we started out 
I wanna give you everything I never gave you but I can't afford the world 
I wanna give you everything I never gave you but I... 
Your salty lips kiss tragedy 
Just to spite me your salty lips kiss calamity 
Straight to the gallows 
But, they won't rid me of these things 
Straight to the guillotine 
It's not the same as it was when we started out 
When we liked it 
When everything was fine 
It's not the same as it was when we started out 
I wanna give you everything I never gave you but I can't afford the world 
I wanna give you everything I never gave you but I... 
I was once a king 
People exclaimed my name 
They cleared the streets for me 
But I will be known for the fires I start and the wars I cause 
I was a king 
It's not the same as it was when we started out 
When we liked it 
When everything was fine 
It's not the same as it was when we started out 
I wanna give you everything I never gave you but I can't afford the world 
I wanna give you everything I never gave but I... 
Tell me what it takes to breathe 'cause I can't define it 
Tell me what it takes to breathe 'cause I can't define it
