I'm a high school lover, 
And you're my favorite flavor 
Love is all, all my soul 
You're my playground love Yet my hands are shaking 
I feel my body remains, 
Themes no matter, I'm on fire 
On the playground, love You're the piece of gold, 
The flushes all my soul 
Extra time, on the ground 
You're my playground love Anytime, anyway, 
You're my playground love
