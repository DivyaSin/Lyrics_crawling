I want a bad girl 
Someone with dark rings under her eyes 
I want a bad girl 
Someone who can take me by surprise 
People talk about about their sinners and their saints 
Some folks are what other folks ain't 
I want a bad girl 
Why bring an angel to shame? 
I want a dancer 
Someone who can move to a song 
I want a fast girl 
Someone I don't have to drag along 
People talk about their morals and their rules 
What makes some folks happy makes other people fools 
I want a bad girl 
Nice girls only make me cruel Maybe it's something in my style of living 
Maybe it's something in my frame of mind 
Maybe it's something in the things I'm used to giving 
But I don't mind you staying out all night long 
I don't mind you drinking til you drop 
I don't mind you sleeping with another guy 
I'm sleeping with another girl, I'm not gonna stop I want a bad girl...a very, very bad girl I don't mind you staying out all night long 
I don't mind you drinking til you drop 
I don't mind you sleeping with another guy 
I'm sleeping with another girl, I'm not gonna stop 
I want a bad girl...
