A walking nightmare, the incarnation of your worst fears 
You shed tears when I come near and think about a new career 
but your stuck here with the terror of the void 
gainfully employed and I've enjoyed the way I've seen your team destroyed 
Best check the minimap I'm coming to take lives 
With limbs sharp as knives giving out free hugs and high fives 
Here comes the tower dive I'll start it with a rupture and silence 
and follow up with unbelievable violence 
I own the battlefield I'll never yield no need for heals 
You want to get to my carries? It's like a tapdance through a minefield 
I'm hard like German steel and I got mass appeal 
This hunger's so unreal and your team's looking like a five course meal 
How bout we make a deal? You let this tower go 
And I'll let you know in chat when it's safe to farm so you 'll look like a pro 
We'll be at Baron though, feel free to try and show 
I still need a stack and you seem like the perfect thing make me grow Let me introduce myself I'm Cho'Gath the gentleman 
I'm very pleased to meet you on the fields of justice once again 
and every now and then I think about our very last encounter 
When you proved to be the most exquisite man ever devoured We've got you pushed back hard, can't even leave the Nexus 
Minions pour in so fast that it feels like the stream is endless 
This game's on life support, base totally defenseless 
Time to retreat to fountain trying to stop us would be senseless 
My stacks are maxed out, it's time to back out 
I've got no doubt that this next fight is set to be full on rout 
Your team is wiped out, my team is right stout 
Your towers are all down so /ff cause it's lights out Let me introduce myself I'm Cho'Gath the gentleman 
I'm very pleased to meet you on the fields of justice once again 
and every now and then I think about our very last encounter 
When you proved to be the most exquisite man ever devoured
