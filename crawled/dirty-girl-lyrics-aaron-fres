And The Baton, The Baton For The Dirty Mover 
Right In Her Eyes She Could Read My Junior 
Tell The DJ Get Behind The Cerato 
Throw On The Aaron Fresh And A Movato 
Sippin Henny Colato With Me And My Vatos 
And She Taste Colato And Her Waist Is Flaco 
And This Bucket Of Alco Got Me Stuck As A Taco 
And She Going Where I Go If You Like It Or Not Though 
She Told Me She Wanna Go Malitia To The Crib
