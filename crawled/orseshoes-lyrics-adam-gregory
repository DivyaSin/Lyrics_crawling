Sittin' on the front porch 
Rockin' on the porch swing 
Wayon on the radio 
Listen to the crickets sing 
Hi yi yippi yi 
Yippi yi yeah While the sun shines 
Better make hay yeah 
I feel lucky tonight, yeah 
And everything's gonna be alright Ringing those horseshoes 
Ringing those horseshoes Kickin' back, kickin' butt 
Knockin' on wood 
There oughta be a law against 
Feelin' this good 
Life is a rodeo 
A one horse town 
Get back up 
When it kicks you down I'm feelin' lucky tonight, yeah 
And everything's gonna be alright I got it good I got it made in the shade 
I feel like Gretzky on a breakaway 
For no good reason things are goin' my way 
I got to tell you 
Life I love it, love it 
Love it yeah I'm feelin' lucky tonight, yeah 
And everything's gonna be alright
