You're breakin' my heart, I'm fallin' apart, you make me crazy, crazy 
You're breakin' my heart, I don't wanna start a new day, new day 
I'm wreckin' my brain, I'm feelin' insane, you make me crazy, crazy 
I'm changin' my ways, I'm leavin' today, but things look hazy, hazy' I can't express the words to tell you 'bout the feelings I got, 
Locked up inside 
If only you would give me a reason why you're so uptight, 
What's on your mind? Maybe we could make it one more time, maybe we should try it again 
Maybe we could make it one more time, baby please let me know when 
You're breakin' my heart, I'm fallin' apart, you make me crazy, crazy 
You're breakin' my heart, I'm spinnin' apart, I'm lookin' this and that way I can't express the words to tell you 'bout the feelings I got, 
Locked up inside 
If only you would give me a reason why you're so uptight, 
What's on your mind? What's on your mind, what's on your mind, what's on your mind - tell me 
Maybe we could make it one more time, maybe we should try it again 
Maybe we could make it one more time, baby please let me know when I can't express the words to tell you 'bout the feelings I got, 
Locked up inside 
If only you would give me a reason why you're so uptight, 
What's on your mind? I can't express the words to tell you 'bout the feelings I got,
