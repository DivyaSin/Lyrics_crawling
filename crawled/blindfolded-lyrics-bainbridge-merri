It's not usual 
To mix the pleasure with the pain 
It's not usual for me 
This is so familiar 
We're like oil and water 
Maybe theres some relief here 
In a cover of the day 
In the afternoon 
I feel so very strange 
Like I'm walking on the moon 
And if love flies past your eyes blindfolded 
Know when to run and when to catch and hold it 
It's not usual 
To mix the pleasure with the pain 
It's not usual for me 
And it's not so peculiar to find 
The strength in something weak 
Not so peculiar to me 
In the corner of my mind 
In a quiet place 
Remembering a smile 
An expression on your face 
And if love flies past your eyes blindfolded 
Know when to run and when to catch and hold it
