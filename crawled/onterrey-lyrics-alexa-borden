I met my love in Monterrey 
He was the heir of a wanted name 
We drove all night to Sante Fe 
Smoked cheap Virginias 
And slipped away Oh, you know I'm in heaven 
When you're touching me, darling Pick me up, let's leave tonight 
In my black leather while he's gettin' high 
Loosen me up, you know I'm shy 
To those pretty crystals in the pale moonlight 
But I kinda feel like letting someone down I watched the madness grip his reigns 
But nothing could scare us, nothing 
I wash my hands with champagne 
It's gettin' the blood off 
Numbs the sting Oh, you know that it's heaven 
Even when you're killing me, darling Pick me up, let's leave tonight 
In my black leather while he's gettin' high 
Loosen me up, you know I'm shy 
To those pretty crystals in the pale moonlight 
But I kinda feel like letting someone down He's my darkness, yet he's the light 
And I can't imagine anything less 
He's gonna be troubled for life 
But I couldn't do with anything else Oh, you know I'm in heaven 
When you call my name, darling Pick me up, let's leave tonight 
In my black leather while he's gettin' high 
Loosen me up, you know I'm shy 
To those pretty crystals in the pale moonlight 
But I kinda feel like letting someone down Mmm...
