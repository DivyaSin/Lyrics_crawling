Take no prisoners 
Hold the line and shoot the blame 
There's something in us can't let go 
We've changed 
Words dont come easily anymore 
And when they do 
They come out wrong Chorus: 
And we fight 
Like there's a war going on 
We fight like guns and daggers are drawn 
We fight all night and into the dawn 
And wonder what went wrong 
And we're at war 
And we're at war Bitter tasting 
Kisses from your lips 
Empty spaces between us still Chorus: 
And we fight 
Like theres a war going on 
We fight like guns and daggers are drawn 
We fight all night and into the dawn 
And wonder what went wrong 
And were at war 
And were at war 
Won't someone wave the white flag 
There's a chance we might still last 
Retreat and get back on track 
All we want is our love back 
Dont want us to be strangers 
Is still love you Chorus: 
And we fight 
Like there's a war going on 
We fight like guns and daggers are drawn 
We fight all night and into the dawn 
And wonder what went wrong 
And we're at war 
And we're at war Wont someone wave the white flag 
Theres a chance we might still last 
Retreat and get back on track 
All we want is our love back 
Dont want us to be strangers 
War 
I still love you 
Something to change us War (repeat)
