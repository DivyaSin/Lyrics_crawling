If ever you love again, if such luck could be 
You must fall in love again with nobody but me 
For now that I see you 
I know that we should have met long ago Where have you been? 
I wanna know where have you been? 
My life was a loosing fight till the lucky night 
Baby, you happened in From what I had heard about love 
I thought it was all sorrow and sin 
But now that we meet at last, I forget what's past 
Baby, where have you been? I was a fool un-befriended 
In the debts of despair 
When out of the blue you descended 
And somehow ended every care So if you will give me a break 
And all of the love seem to begin 
So close to your side I'll stay, you will never say 
"Baby, where have you been?" I was a fool un-befriended 
In the debts of despair 
When out of the blue you descended 
And somehow ended every care So if you will give me a break 
And all of the love seem to begin 
So close to your side I'll stay, you will never say 
"Baby, where have you been?"
