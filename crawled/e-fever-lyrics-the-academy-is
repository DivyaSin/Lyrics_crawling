Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
And I don't believe you When the summer is gone 
It won't be long 
'Til someone's got the fever creeping inside When the city is moving 
And your eyes, they are a-moving 
And you just can't fight that feeling 
But you said it's the last time Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
And I don't believe you 
Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
And I don't believe you 
Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
And lies are lies I can't fight it, no, I just can't fight it 
Can't fight it, no, I just can't fight it, now 
When the summer is gone 
It won't be long until someone's 
Got the fever creeping inside When the city is moving and your eyes 
They are a moving and you just can't stop 
You just can't fight it, ya This is the last time 
Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
And I don't believe you 
Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
And I don't believe you 
Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
Lies are lies Can't fight it, no, I just can't fight it 
Can't fight it, no, I just can't 
Well, we all agree that we don't believe 
This is the last time 
This is the last time Well, they promised you 
Now you see the truth 
This is the last time 
This is the last time 
This is the last time 
This is the last time And everyone's got the fever 
(Lies are lies, lies are lies, lies are lies) 
Lies are lies 
(Lies are lies, lies are lies) 
Lies are lies in everybody's eyes Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
And I don't believe you 
Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
And I don't believe you 
Lies are lies in everybody's eyes 
Lies are lies Can't fight it, no, I just can't fight it 
Can't fight it, no, I just can't 
Well we all agree that we don't believe 
This is the last time 
This is the last time Well, they promised you 
Now you see the truth 
This is the last time 
(Times five) When the summer is gone 
It won't be long until someone's 
Got the fever
