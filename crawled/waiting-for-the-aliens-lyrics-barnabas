Seen it on my tv for the past couple nights 
Freaky, but it seems to be true 
Captured earthlings vanish in a flicker of light 
And there's nothing that the air force can do 
The guys at work all say that its a message from space 
An omen of the good things to come 
An interstellar rescue for whats left of the race 
Now that the troublemakers are gone Its gonna be alright 
They say its gonna be alright 
That born-again buffoonery has been dealt with at last 
And now we're one big happy family again Sightings are abounding, so we know that they're here 
To help us chart a new destiny 
They've done away with Jesus and that hellfire fear 
So we can get loose and be free 
They're burning all the bibles 'cause it's cheap energy 
They're turning all the churches to bars 
No more silly fables or religious debris 
We know our masters come from the stars Seen it on my tv for the last couple weeks 
Freaky, but it seems to be true 
Everything sounds rosy when the new order speaks 
Informing us of what we must do 
So we're waiting for the aliens with our hearts open wide 
Clinging to their every command 
They say they're coming soon, so we should trust the new guy 
Who wants to put that mark on our hand
