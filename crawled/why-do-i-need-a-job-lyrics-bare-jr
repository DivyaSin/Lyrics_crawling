Why do I need a job, why do I need a job 
I feel so free, I got nowhere to be 
So why so I need a job 
I once worked for an old bastard 
Who always pushed me to work faster 
He made fun of me 
'Cause my hair was green 
He tried to stick his hands into my jeans 
My girlfriend is a stripper in Abilene 
She likes me to stay home and watch TV 
She pays for my food 
She likes to be rude 
She undresses her friends for me 
I don't have a clue 
What I want to do 
Maybe I could invent 
Something cool 
Or I could do time 
For committing a crime 
Then sue for a million 
Or two 
I traded my car for a van 
Filled it with gas, guitars and this band 
They pay us with beer 
We stole all this gear 
So why don't ya'll 
Give us a hand
