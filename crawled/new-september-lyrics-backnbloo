Your touch 
My skin quivers letting down my guard 
Who knew giving in would ever be this hard 
Cause I can't go on pretending you are nothing more 
Than one night, heeeyyyy Heart stops 
Pretend not to see you and slowly walk away 
Eyes lock 
Crowds I won't push through, tell me and I'll stay 
Cause I can't go on pretending you are nothing more 
Than one night, heeeyyy CHORUS 
We just can't go right back to how it used to be 
I see you look at me 
You want it, I want it....ah haa hahahaha 
Just look into my eyes and tell me what you see... 
How 'bout another try....aaaaaayyyyyyyyy Lips lock 
Feels like the first time, two in one collide 
Awestruck 
Love only part time, terror is sublime 
Cause I won't go on pretending that you are nothing more 
Than one night, heeeyyy CHORUS 
We just can't go right back to how it used to be 
I see you look at me 
You want it, I want it....ah haa hahahaha 
Just look into my eyes and tell me what you see... 
How 'bout another try....aaaaaayyyyyyyyy BRIDGE 
Oh oh oh, oh, oh oooohhh, oh oh 
Hey ey, heeyy ey, ayyyyyyyyyy CHORUS 
We just can't go right back to how it used to be 
I see you look at me 
You want it, I want it....ah haa hahahaha 
Just look into my eyes and tell me what you see... 
How 'bout another try....aaaaaayyyyyyyyy ah haaa hahahahaha
