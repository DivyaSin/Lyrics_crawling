Kiss my name 
Mama in the afterglow 
When the grass is green with grow 
And my tears have turned to snow Im only a child 
Born upon a grave 
Dancing through the stations 
Calling out my name Oh mama kiss my name 
I am trying to be sane 
Im trying to kiss my friends 
And when broken, make amends Kiss my name, the curtains white 
The turtle doves embroider light 
As I lie, murdered in ground 
The rain compacting sodden sound 
Of songs I sang the years before 
When it was time to rain 
Upon the coal that I became
