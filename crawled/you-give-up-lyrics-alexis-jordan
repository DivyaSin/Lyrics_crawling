Why stick around when it just hurts, that's the million dollar question 
What's the point of trying to work it out when it just don't work 
I keep trying, 
The problem is that I know the answers, 
I'm supposed to say cause love is what the whole means 
But what do you do when the fairy tale truth, just don't work for you anymore You give up, you give up, throwing the towel away ... 
Say you had enough, you give up, you give up 
When there's no more fight left in you 
And your best just ain't enough 
There's nothing left to do but give up Why struggle on when you can't win, that's the million dollar question If everything says let it why can't you let it in 
Why keep ... yourself, you see the problem is that I know the answers 
I'm supposed to say cause love is what the whole means 
But what do you do when the fairy tale truth, just don't work for you anymore
