i guess its time, time for me to give up on you 
i know what i promised, i promised forever but you took the future away 
seems like I'm always taking a beating fighting your past and your pain 
and its so fucking cold in your life that its almost frozen up mine 
lips like addiction alive inside 
id embrace your twisted love if you let me 
but you and i both know that nothings ever good enough for you to be alive just once again inside of you and your big distrust 
I'm a jester in your dramas whimpering for your affection 
visualizing extra sexy I'm in junkie mode and it dent stop 
coming at you coming at me coming in your face 
because love makes it that much better 
and i know I'm the man who's job you all just shitcanned 
but if you'll wake up soon baby, you might realize what's right in your face 
but until then I'm nothing without you you've quietly killed all your sleepwalking demons and you've given them all to me 
i wish id learned how to help myself while i was taking care of you 
and there is still nothing that i wouldn't do in the realm of keeping your 
smile safe 
but your love equals lies in the eyes of the ones that you would die for 
lips like addiction alive inside 
id embrace your twisted love if you let me 
but you and i both know that nothings ever good enough for you you're so fucking wise about yer life yer past yer brain 
you've got every other person into two categories 
either help you or hurt you there's no in between 
either play the part or get out, is that right? 
did you know id never leave you forever just to breathe you 
and you knew that i could give you all the love you deserved 
so still you took all that i could give 
and i know you really liked to fuck me 
but there's still so much more you never let us explore 
but its irrelevant now that your the one that nobody trusts 
but what the hell 
I'm nothing without you 
I'm nothing...
