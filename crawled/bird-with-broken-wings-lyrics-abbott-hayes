I pointed to the map and said pick a place 
Just when I thought there would be no reply 
A western wind came howling in my face 
And I was flying "Oh don't you take it slow 
I've been blowing down this road 
And I've been searching high and low 
I've been searching high and low" So then and there I tried to plead my case 
And like a bird with broken wings I tried to fly 
A western wind has moved me from this place 
And now I'm fine 
She pushed me as if saying 
"Come this way! 
Hurry now, you're wasting too much time 
And you will never get to heaven at this pace!" 
Oh and she was right "Oh don't you take it slow 
I've been blowing down this road 
And I've been searching high and low 
I've been searching high and low"
