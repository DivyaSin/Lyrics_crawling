Verse 1: 
I see you looking at me lately 
And I cant seem to hide 
The loneliness I try 
I cant see you thru the madness 
Desires locked inside 
Were falling from your eyes 
And you bring me to life with Chorus: 
One Song one night 
Moonlight and a bottle of wine 
For the first time 
Im Perfectly Known 
Lost in your touch 
Facing never wanting to rush this 
But right now 
Im Perfectly Known 
I dont wanna escape from you Verse 2: 
You never thought Id throw out resigned 
To find out what is true 
But for to have bled for you is something new 
How can it be so lost 
Know exactly where I am 
Hold me in your arms Chorus: 
One song, one night 
Moonlight and a bottle of wine 
For the first time 
Im perfectly known 
Lost in your touch 
Facing never wanting to rush this 
But right now 
Im Perfectly Known Bridge: 
I dont wanna escape from you 
(I dont wanna escape from you) 
I dont wanna escape from you 
I dont wanna escape from you Chorus: 
One song, one night 
Moonlight and a bottle of wine 
For the first time 
Im perfectly known 
Lost in your touch 
Facing never wanting to rush this 
But right now 
Im Perfectly Known
