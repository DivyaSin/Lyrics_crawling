We might find and feel something different (That's okay) 
Something I'm sure (That's alright) 
Spending countless year Whatever happens I'm sure 
There's sacred hope (I can tell it) 
I can feel it(I can tell) 
What's in front of me now 
As long as there's 
I just wanna find out I can't tell what it is 
But it's for sure 
Something in the other side 
Maybe the future Yes, my dearest let's go finding out 
Shall we go find out 
Yes, my dearest let's go finding out
