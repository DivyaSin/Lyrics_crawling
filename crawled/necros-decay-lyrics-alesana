our empire has fallen 
the columns came crashing down 
faster that children could outrun the shadows 
drunk with hysteria the survivors are running for their lives 
as precious dreams erupt before their very eyes tonight, it's over...at long last we will fall 
ruins will fight in our stead my flesh is burning from the embers 
but still the brilliant tale of our utopia survives 
tonight her beautiful exterior may crash and burn to ash 
but the fight for her honor will rage on 
I hope I never see the end 
I hope I never have to live without her comfort 
but for now she dies... oh Rome! so full of majesty, you're gone... wind chokes on the ashes as acrid smoke strangles the sun 
their jealous arrows ran, hollow drums pound at the gates 
breaking the din of screams 
our feeble offerings to forgotten Gods are left to rot in temples of their lust 
as they lay forth their plans to destroy our pride, our home tonight, it's over...at long last we will fall 
ruins will fight in our stead my flesh is burning from the embers 
but still the brilliant tale of our utopia survives 
tonight her beautiful exterior may crash and burn to ash 
but the fight for her honor will rage on 
I hope I never see the end 
I hope I never have to live without her comfort 
but for now she dies... oh Rome! so full of majesty, you're gone... 
...beg the flames for our mercy... 
these aged walls have seen too much 
to forget the past in the face of this final trial 
watch her crumble so true as mayhem cuts her down 
let them have our treasure, her voice lives on 
let them take our city for her splendor lives on ...at long last we will fall...
