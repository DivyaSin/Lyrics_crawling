Tell me tomorrow There's something in the air tonight 
You make it real, you make it right 
It's what you do to me 
'Cause I'm a girl who's hard to please 
Don't fall in love that easily 
But you shot your arrow through my heart Tell me tomorrow you'll be here 
Tell me tomorrow this is real 
Do you feel, like I feel 
In your arms 
Tell me tomorrow I can't wait 
Tell me tomorrow that you'll stay 
Do you feel, like I feel 
In your arms You know you got me hypnotized 
When your body's close to me 
You know you leave me breathless 
I'm falling fast, I'm sinking deep 
The way you haunt me in my dreams 
And I can't get you off my mind Tell me tomorrow you'll be here 
Tell me tomorrow this is real 
Do you feel, like I feel 
In your arms 
Tell me tomorrow I can't wait 
Tell me tomorrow that you'll stay 
Do you feel, like I feel 
In your arms Tastes so sweet 
Like honey 
You're all I need 
Keep it coming 
Do you feel, like I feel 
In your arms 
Dance with me 
To the rhythm 
Feel the heat I'm burning up 
Do you feel, like I feel 
In your arms Tell me tomorrow you'll be here 
Tell me tomorrow this is real 
Do you feel, like I feel 
In your arms 
Tell me tomorrow I can't wait 
Tell me tomorrow that you'll stay 
Do you feel, like I feel 
In your arms
