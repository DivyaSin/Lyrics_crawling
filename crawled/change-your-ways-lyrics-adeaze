My brother sing, Yeaahhhh yeahhhh yeahhhhh Verse 1 - 
Many people think that playing's alright 
Let me tell you its not, your playing with something that's hot, stop 
Love is something that you shouldn't mess with 
Cos one day you'll wake up and you've missed a spot in heaven 
Learn to be responsible for your life, sit down and face this way 
There's something we wanna say Chorus -x2 
Change your ways, my brothers can u help me say 
Change your ways yeahhhhh make the future a brighter day 
(For the next) For the next generation is on its way yeahhh Verse 2 - 
Don't be dissing family; they love you 
And if u feel they don't there's someone else to turn to 
there were times when you will feel the pressure 
Stop thinking keep your cool, your someone who's better 
Drop the gun, don't kill yourself, your someone 
Take a look at me and Nainz, we'll tell u we love you
