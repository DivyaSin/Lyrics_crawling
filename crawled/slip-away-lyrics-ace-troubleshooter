Let me try to understand and let it come 'round my way 
Will You hold out Your hand? A little tremble, I feel faint 
A little misty, a little hazy. I know without You I'd go crazy You take my hand, I slip away 
I don't know how to feel, I don't know what to say Spit into the wind, I fall in sin, hear a little cry 
Don't I know what I've felt before? Don't know why...
