When we were young, we pledged allegiance 
Every morning of our lives 
The classroom rang with children's voices 
Under teacher's watchful eye 
We learned about the world around us 
At our desks and at dinnertime 
Reminded of the starving children 
Cleaned our plates with guilty minds The stones in the road 
We played like marbles in the dust 
Until a voice called for us 
To make our way back home 
The stones in the road When I was ten, my father held me 
On his shoulders above the crowd 
To see a train draped in mourning 
Pass slowly through our town 
His widow kneeled with all her children 
At the sacred burial ground 
And the TV glowed that long hot summer 
With all the cities burning down And the stones in the road 
Flew out from our bicycle tires 
Worlds removed from all those fires as we raced 
Each other home 
The stones in the road Stones And now we drink our coffee on the run 
Climb that ladder rung by rung 
We are the daughters and the sons 
But here's the line that's missing The starving children have been replaced 
By souls out on the street 
We give a dollar when we pass 
And hope our eyes don't meet 
We pencil in, we cancel out 
We crave the corner suite 
We kiss your ass 
We make you hold, we doctor the receipt Stones in the road 
Flew out from beneath our wheels 
Another day, another deal, before we get back home The stones in the road 
Leave a mark from whence they came 
A thousand points of light or shame 
Baby, I don't know Stones in the road Stones In the road
