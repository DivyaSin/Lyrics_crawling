I don't like walking around this old and empty house 
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear 
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake 
It's the house telling you to close your eyes And some days I can't even trust myself 
It's killing me to see you this way 'Cause though the truth may vary 
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore Don't listen to a word I say 
The screams all sound the same Though the truth may vary 
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore 
You're gone, gone, gone away 
I watched you disappear 
All that's left is the ghost of you. 
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, 
There's nothing we can do 
Just let me go we'll meet again soon Don't listen to a word I say 
The screams all sound the same 
'Cause though the truth may vary 
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore Don't listen to a word I say 
The screams all sound the same 
'Cause though the truth may vary 
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore parapaparapaparaparapa 'Cause though the truth may vary 
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
