Oh, Oh 
Fortune favors the brave 
Oh, Oh 
Fortune favors the brave We have swept to glory 
Egypt's mastery expands 
From the Nile's northern most Delta 
To the dry, dry southern sands The more we find, the more we see 
The more we come to learn 
The more that we explore 
The more we shall return Oh, oh 
Fortune favors the brave It's all worked out, my road is clear 
The lines of latitude extend 
Way beyond my wildest dreams 
Toward some great triumphant end We seize the day, we turned the tide 
We touched the stars 
We mocked the grave 
We moved into uncharted lands Fortune favors the brave The more we find, the more we see 
The more we come to learn 
The more that we explore 
The more we shall return Nothing is an accident 
We are free to have it all 
We are what we want to be 
It's in ourselves to rise or fall This is easy to believe 
When distant places call to me 
It's harder from the palace yard 
Fortune favors the free Oh, oh 
Fortune favors the young 
Oh, oh 
Fortune favors the brave
