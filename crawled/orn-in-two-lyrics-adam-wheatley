I won't hide 
What good would that do now? 
You found me with my face on the ground I can't lie 
Sometimes I won't do right 
'Cause I'm weaker when I don't let You inside Would You remind me who I am in Your eyes? If I was torn in two 
If I was torn in two 
Between the way I run 
And the way I need You Would You tell me something true? 
Would You tell me something true? 
I want to believe 
I want to follow through So come like a soldier 
Dressed up for the war 
'Cause we're going to battle all these demons 
Knocking down my door Would You remind me that You've come to fight? 
There's no losing with You on my side If I was torn in two 
If I was torn in two 
Between the way I run 
And the way I need You Would You tell me something true? 
Would You tell me something true? 
I want to believe 
I want to follow through Save me from myself 
I'll be Yours forever If I was torn in two 
If I was torn in two 
Between the way I run 
And the way I need You Would You tell me something true? 
Would You tell me something true? 
I want to believe 
I want to follow through
