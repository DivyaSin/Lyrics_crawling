It's getting late 
And it's cold outside 
I wonder should I wait 
Or should I say goodbye [Chorus] 
But I ain't too sure 
If I should be staying 
Taxi's waiting 
But here in your arms 
I could be persuaded But here with you 
Oh it feels so right 
I just close my eyes 
And lose track of time [Chorus] When we touch 
Doubts fade away 
But I just don't know 
If I should stay Your taxi's waiting 
I could be persuaded 
Oh [Chorus] I could be persuaded 
Oh, I could be persuaded 
Your taxi's waiting Oh, I could be persuaded
