The night was black, the air was still 
The stars refused to shine 
Twelve men set out upon the sea 
Their Master, left behind 
The hours flew, the night grew cold 
But still no shore in sight 
The wind whispered a warning 
In the third watch of the night A storm came up on Galilee 
The wind began to moan 
The rolling sea grew angrier 
Twelve men felt so alone 
And suddenly they saw a shape 
Come walking on the sea 
A ghostly vision of a man 
Where no man could be The twelve men all cried out in fear 
Perhaps they even prayed 
But Jesus answered from the waves 
"It's me; don't be afraid" 
And Peter in his eagerness 
Said, "If it's really you 
"Just say the word and I'll come walking 
On the water, too" Then Peter stepped out on the sea 
But he began to doubt 
And looking down he felt afraid 
And sinking, he cried out: 
"Lord save me! Save me Lord!" he cried 
And Jesus took his hand 
"Oh ye of little faith" He said 
As He helped Peter stand
