I hid away 
All the promises that I made 
Lost the light I need to find my way to You You called me out 
I found beauty in the breaking down 
Surrender played a song that I could sing Where else can I run 
Where all my fears will come undone? 
So I'll keep holding on to You, my love 
I'll keep holding on You drew the line 
I took my chances and I walked the wire 
Fixed my eyes on You and I was changed You've won my soul 
Broke the silence and my heart of stone 
You walked right in and gave my heart its beat Where else can I run 
Where all my fears will come undone? 
So I'll keep holding on to You, my love 
I'll keep holding on There is no fear in love 
There is no fear in love 
There is no fear in love with You Where else can I run 
Where all my fears will come undone? 
So I'll keep holding on to You, my love 
I'll keep holding on
