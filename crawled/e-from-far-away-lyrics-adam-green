I made love behind her 
I was scared to know her 
Now the high is over 
Because I need a shoulder Love is on it's way 
Sometimes you're me from far away 
Just waiting to get blow up I went to her island 
And had a sad assignment 
It was like a movie 
That I was watching through me Love is on it's way 
Sometimes you're me from far away 
Just waiting to get blow up You're a leaky world 
You're bleeding girl 
You're a pain in heaven 
You are all your friends Love is on it's way 
Sometimes you're me from far away 
Just waiting to get blow up
