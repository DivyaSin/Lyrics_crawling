Though Noone seems to realize 
EveryThough Noone seems to realize 
Everytime, when someone dies 
I feel the sorrow in My Heart... But then, tomorrow is today 
Again and again, nothing left to say 
But We ALL do re-live it. But now I hope you you'll understand 
That I'm just fighting for my promised land. 
Burning in the atomspier. 
We can't always live in fear. Though everyone is still afraid. 
We steal the income of the home we made. 
Away it goes, all away from here 
But no one really knows for sure. But now I hope you you'll understand 
That I'm just fighting for my promised land. 
Burning in the atomspier. 
We can't always live in fear. Nothing's over! Well, well, well. 
We will find for us some place to dwell. 
And there, we will NEVER have any kind of sorrow 
But deep inside I know we'll all be gone tomorrow. 
Tomorrow.
