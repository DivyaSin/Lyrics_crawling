You don't know me 
You don't care 
Mary, my hope 
My own sweet sister knows me 
You don't owe me 
But you should share 
Just before dawn 
The spotlight's on the lawn 
Helicopter 
Cameras on ya! You wanna be the show 
For all the people you know 
Then you steal it from me, you know 
You know I take it too slow 
Be the show 
For all the people you know 
Then you show it to me, you know 
No matter what you say 
I want you anyway, 
whoa, whoa You should see me 
You should see me now 
Mary, my hope 
My own sweet sister knows me 
If the world could see me 
If you could be me now 
Now that you know 
I think I'll steal the show 
Helicopter 
Cameras on ya! You wanna be the show 
For all the people you know 
Then you steal it from me, you know 
You know I take it too slow 
Be the show 
For all the people you know 
Then you show it to me, you know 
No matter what you say 
I want you anyway, 
whoa, whoa
