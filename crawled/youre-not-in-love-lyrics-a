something in the way we touch 
you hold my hand and hold back so much 
somethings changed and somethings gone 
something i cant put my finger on 
baby youre not in love i tried to be the boy you knew 
so i cut my hair and I cleaned my shoes 
but ive been cheating on myself 
saying we could make it through 
baby your not in love love is cruel love is hard 
love it makes you blue 
grips your heart without regard 
for the ones who dont love you I tried to be the boy you knew 
so i cut my hair and I cleaned my shoes 
but ive been cheating on myself 
thinking we could make it through 
baby your not in love
