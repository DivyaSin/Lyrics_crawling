Have the people went to the high hill? 
From the start they didn't know exactly why, why 
Winter came and made it so - oh look alike, look alike. 
Underneath the grass would grow aiming at the sky. It was swift, it was just another wave of a miracle, 
but no one, nothing at all, will go for the kill. 
If they called on every soul, in the land, on the moon. 
Only them, what they know, a blessing in this curse. The curse will come from the underground down by the shore, 
where all grow even hunger to live like before. 
The curse will come from the underground down by the shore, 
where all grow even hunger to live like before. Tell me more of the very soul, look alike, look alike. 
Do you know this strangle hold covering their eyes? 
If I call on very soul in the land, on the moon. 
Tell me if a lover known a blessing in this curse.
