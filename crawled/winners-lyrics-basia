Keep on dreaming 
Keep on believing 
There's no cloud on your horizon 
What a day to dare 
?cause if this game won't break us 
It will make us stronger 
It's not a place to be faint-hearted 
Fortune loves the brave! you know, that we can't all be winners 
God only knows how hard we try 
Different odds 
A different ball game 
Our time will come but we are winners today 
It's the way that we play 
We are winners today 
It's the way that we play the game 
Winners today 
It's the way that we play 
We are winners today 
It's the way that we play the game give your best shot 
Show what you're made of 
Learn to fight against all odds 
And prove you can survive 
?cause it's a game of two halves 
Hold your faith undaunted 
Now and then a perfect match 
So keep this dream alive
