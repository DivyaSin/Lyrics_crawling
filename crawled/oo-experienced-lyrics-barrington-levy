She doesn't want me around 
She's got something to hide 
I think she want's a clown, someone to take for a ride 
What I keep telling her I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll 
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride 
And I know its not my foolish pride She hates the sight of me 
Because I turned her offer down 
She's always saying we were meant to be 
Somehow she thought Id be her clown 
And this is what I sing I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll 
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride 
And I know its not my foolish pride She doesn't want me around 
She's got something to hide 
I think she want's a clown, someone to take for a ride 
This is what I sing I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll 
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride 
And I know its not my foolish pride
