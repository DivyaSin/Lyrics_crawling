Sex is the reason that I tried, 
Hoped I have you believe in that your my type, 
And all I wanted was a one night thing, 
She said I knew it's just a one time thing, She won't tell the world just what we did, 
I just wanted to tell it's what it is, 
your lips since were your hair, 
Your hair, Dig a little more, 
Just a little kiss, 
You know you'll like this baby, 
I want a little more, 
Just a little dip, 
'Cause that's electring lady, 
I know you like what I do, 
I know you like to get used, 
Sometimes you're meant to get used, 
Sometimes you're meant to get used, She's been tellin' me all the things she likes, 
Whisperin' what she's great at and what she would try, 
And all I wanted was a one time thing, 
And all she wanted was a little day dream, She's not tellin' her girls just what we did, 
Why won't the world know what it is, 
your lips since were your hair, 
Your hair, 
your lips since were your hair, 
Your hair, Dig a little more, 
Just a little kiss, 
You know you'll like this baby, 
I want a little more, 
Just a little dip, 
'Cause that's electring lady, 
I know you like what I do, 
I know you like to get used, 
Sometimes you're meant to get used, 
Sometimes you're meant to get used, Your gonna use me, 
I'm gonna use you, 
Your gonna use me, 
I'm gonna use you, 
I'll fucking use you, Dig a little more, 
Just a little kiss, 
You know you'll like this baby, 
I want a little more, 
Just a little dip, 
'Cause that's electring lady, 
I know you like what I do, 
I know you like to get used, 
Sometimes you're meant to get used, 
Sometimes you're meant to get used, 
Sometimes you're meant to get used, 
I'm fucking usin' you.
