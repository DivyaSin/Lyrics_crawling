Hey now! The iron gates clang in a steel mill town 
A man breaks down to that unemployment sound 
He takes a last walk down that old coast road 
In the dying death throes of all that he knows 
The sight of those men walking through the gates 
Was like a lame pit pony at the end of its days (Fire, Fire, Fire) In a Deeside town eight thousand went down 
In a February day in the driving rain 
No winners just losers and cuts and bruises 
As the picket lines fell, the industry died 
There's still one question after all this time 
Is a working man bom to live and then die? Fire Fire Fire. To build the ships to set the sails 
To cross the sea of fools 
To be dealt the cards 
To play our hand 
To win or else to lose 
In this cruel world that kicks a man when he's down (Down to the ground) (Hey now) And Lady Luck smiles on the few in this world 
And I hope and I pray that she smiles on you 
I ain't gonna preach, no I ain't gonna teach 
I 'm just gonna sing about the things that I need A little bit of love, a little bit of hope 
A little bit of strength, some fuel for the fire (Fire Fire Fire) To build the ships to set the sails 
To cross the sea of fools 
To be dealt the cards 
To play our hand 
To win or else to lose 
In this cruel world that kicks a man when he's down. (Down to the ground) A little bit of love, a little bit of hope 
A little bit of strength, some fuel for the fire (Fire Fire Fire) To build the ships to set the sails 
To cross the sea of fools 
To be dealt the cards 
To play our hand 
To win or else to lose 
In this cruel world that kicks a man when he's down. And all around the world the lights are going down.
