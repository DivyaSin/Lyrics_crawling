I don't know how to break the news, but 
It's pretty clear you'll be asked to choose between 
What you lack and what you excuse in this 
Tug of war 
You can't say that didn't warn you 
Though you'd rather that they just ignore you 
'Cause your devices are not working for you 
Anymore 
What you want 
You don't know 
You're with stupid now 
You don't know how to manufacture 
Sturdy bones with a hairline fracture 
The crazy will of a Margaret Thatcher 
That they've all got 
Though you pay for the hands they're shaking 
The speeches and the mistakes they're making 
As they struggle with the undertaking of 
Simple thought. 
What you want 
You don't know 
You're with stupid now 
What you know 
You don't want to know 
You're with stupid now 
What you want 
You don't know 
You're with stupid now 
What you know 
You don't want to know 
You're with stupid now 
So on with the show
