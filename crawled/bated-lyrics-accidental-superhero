on bated breath i wait 
and the scent i smell 
anticipated death from 
the windowsill 
beg the rains flow 
give the wind your will 
pray the gods you serve 
get their greedy fill pass the cup you spill 
at the demons will 
unwanted speech did preach 
through the fishes' gill 
but the boughs quaked 
and the waters flowed 
and the stones you threw 
stood up to tell i wondered the state 
of the cross, and again 
i wondered the state 
of the cross, and again derived to find if i'd 
open wide my lips 
and touch your 
burning fingertips 
that honey you've fed me 
but you've led me 
to my grave 
Monday did show 
that the city'd glow 
the ashes rose up high 
and the rains did flow
