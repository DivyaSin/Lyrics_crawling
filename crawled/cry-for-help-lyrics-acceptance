Hard times the throw is off line pictures of black and grey 
Soft minds backed up by hard drives standing in single file 
Anything to pass the test Like screaming in the air a sound for all who care 
The siren rings in vain 
When lightning hits the ground to all who stand around 
A shock of ignorance Black lines can turn into battlefields when they are drawn in pain 
Stop signs like human apathy can cause a fatal crash 
The feeling hard to tell a word can break the spell
