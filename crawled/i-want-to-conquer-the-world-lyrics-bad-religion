Hey brother christian with your high and mighty errand 
Your actions speak so loud I can't hear a word you're saying 
Hey sister bleeding heart with all of your compassion 
Your labors soothe the hurt but can't assuage temptation Hey man of science with your perfect rules of measure 
Can you improve this place with the data that you gather 
Hey mother mercy can your loins bear fruit forever? 
Is your fecundity a trammel or a treasure? I want to conquer the world 
Give all the idiots a brand new religion 
Put an end to poverty, uncleanliness and toil 
Promote equality in all of my decisions 
With a quick wink of the eye and a "god you must be joking!" Hey mister diplomat with your worldly aspirations 
Did you see your children cry when you left them at the station? 
Hey moral soldier you've got righteous proclamation 
And precious tomes to fuel your pulpy conflagrations
