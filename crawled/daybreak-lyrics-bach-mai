I know that I am not alone 
And if you think there's nothing more for you then won't you come on home? Cause there's pain, there's dark, there's hate, there is heartache 
But there's love, there's light, there's hope, there is daybreak. I know that I am not alone 
And if we try a little harder maybe we could build this home Built with pain, dark, hate, and heartache 
And with love, light, hope, and the daybreaks I know that we are not alone 
And if our hearts are rooting for us there's nothing to keep us from our warmth We all have our pain, our dark, our hate and our heart aches 
But we have our love, our light, our hope and the daybreaks And if we sing a little harder 
Then our fluttering hearts could breathe a little fuller I know that we are not alone 
(I know that we are not alone)
