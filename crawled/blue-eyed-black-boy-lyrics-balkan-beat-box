I try to figure out but I don't understand 
What makes one man better then another man 
I try to figure out if there's something I can do 
To change the way u see me and I see u The color of my skin, unlike the color of my eyes 
Is getting me in trouble, costing me a hefty price 
I try to stay away from all those sacred clans 
I'll try to stay in town, I'll try to make a stand Heads down, make sure your head's down 
Don't get to this town, face down 
Face down, make sure u stay down 
Don't stay in town, heads down If u look in to my eyes, u will see the color blue 
If I look at u I'll see a human who is living in this town 
Like I live every day 
Trying to survive, trying to find his way If u are looking at my skin u see the color black 
We better look ahead then look back 
We better make this town a better place to live in 
Cuz what u are going to get, is what u are giving Heads down, make sure your head's down 
Don't get to this town, face down 
Face down, make sure u stay down 
Don't stay in town, heads down
