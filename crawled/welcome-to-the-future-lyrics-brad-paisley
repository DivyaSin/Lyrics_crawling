When I was ten years old 
I remember thinking how cool it would be 
When we were going on an eight-hour drive 
If I could just watch TV 
And I'd have given anything 
To have my own Pac-Man game at home 
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade 
Now I've got it on my phone Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah 
Welcome to the future My grandpa was in World War 2 
He fought against the Japanese 
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma 
Mailed them from his base in the Philippines 
I wish they could see this now 
The world they saved has changed you know 
'Cause I was on a video chat this morning 
With a company in Tokyo Hey, everyday's a revolution 
Welcome to the future Hey, look around it's all so clear 
Hey, wherever we were going, well we're here 
Hey, so many things I never thought I'd see 
Happening right in front of me I had a friend in school 
Running back on the football team 
They burned a cross in his front yard 
For asking out the homecoming queen 
I thought about him today 
And everybody who'd seen what he'd seen 
From a woman on a bus 
To a man with a dream Hey, wake up Martin Luther 
Welcome to the future 
Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah 
Welcome to the future
