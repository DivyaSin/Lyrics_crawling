Last night 
I took a walk into the back of my mind 
Through the trash and the warning signs 
There was a party full of jokes and clich's 
I couldn't think of anything to say 
And so I slipped into the men's room there 
I saw my hair a way it's never been before I took the stairs from my head to my heart 
I didn't know they were so far apart 
The heart is like a little chapel somewhere, 
The pretty lights and the empty chairs 
But I'm gonna bring a broom next time 
I'll sweep out all the broken strings I find She walks me down to my private train 
And lays me down in my sleeping car 
She keeps my elephant out of the rain 
And sees to the care of my vintage cars 
She is the blood of my life 
Without her I would starve Who you gonna run to? 
Who you gonna hide behind? 
Who you gonna turn to 
When there's nobody home but you? What's a father to do 
With all theses school-less injuns 
Running in circles around the wagons 
What's a father to do 
With all these monster debts 
Around my neck 
On a sad sun deck 
Oh, my children, the times are jaded 
The simple life is complicated 
Oh, my children Now if the dark of the night 
Arrives in the middle of the day 
I'm gonna say my prayer 
For sweetness and light, 
Gonna fix myself a Coke, 
And hope it's alright If the bat-winged beast sweep down 
For a feast on me 
I'm gonna pin my soul 
To a hot-air balloon 
Gonna make it pop 
And shoot me to the moon Now you've had another piece of my mind, 
A cup of coffee and a slice of time 
If you'll excuse me I should say goodbye 
I gotta go now.
