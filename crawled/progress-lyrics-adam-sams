It takes a lot of work to keep something alive 
We've been putting all our efforts into second tries 
Tired of filling up the cup 
Tired of being content with just barely enough Let there be peace 
Where the city street runs 
Let there be life 
In the hot, dry sun 
Let there be progress in my bones 
Progress, and not just maintenance I'm sick of standing by while our hearts run dry 
I'm not gonna lie 
I've just been going through the motions 
Tired of filling up the cup 
Tired of being content with just barely enough Let there be peace 
Where the city street runs 
Let there be life In the hot, dry sun 
Let there be progress in my bones 
Progress, and not just maintenance I want to build 
Don't want to just stand still Let there be peace 
Where the city street runs 
Let there be life In the hot, dry sun 
Let there be progress in my bones 
Progress, and not just maintenance
