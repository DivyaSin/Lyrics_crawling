I buy when you're selling out 
But the price has never been this high 
And my words never been this loud 
I don't say what you wanna hear 
A white boy with a blackened eye 
And a knuckle ride up, underground 
I don't die cause I don't have time 
And my mouth keeps saying Songshit 
Wrong bit 
The song's a hit 
And we all know what to do 
The wrong will fit 
- Shut the fuck up! x2 
What makes me want to? 
And the final countdown too 
Shut the fuck up! x2 
I will defeat you too On your right side there was 
nothing left, and on the left side 
Your head's bigger than your cowboy hat 
there was nothing right 
A slingshot and a band grenade 
You trying target 
I'll pick your teeth with my baseball-bat 
practise in the dark 
You only brag about your dirty deeds but your storm's not coming 
Songshit 
The song's a hit 
And we all know what to do 
Wrong bit 
- Shut the fuck up! x2 
The wrong will fit 
And the final countdown too 
Shut the fuck up! x2 
What makes me want to? I will defeat you too 
I won't mistreat you 
I will delete you 
Pick any way you want 
- Shut the fuck up! x2 Shut the fuck up! x2 
What makes me want to? 
I will defeat you too What makes me want to? 
- Shut the fuck up! x2 
Shut the fuck up! x2 
I will defeat you too
