Oops, your daddy showing up and drag 
Your mama's dressed up in expensive rags 
You got comments, spill it out your bag 
I really feel I'm killing it, I don't mean to brag 
Just do it! [Chorus] 
Let's set the world on fire tonight 
Let's set the light of lace 
Let's set the world on fire tonight 
You will remember my name 
You do it Do run, run, run, do run me 
Do run, run, run, do run me Some might say we ain't got no class 
But where we're from, it's too hot for that 
The guys and the dj's ... 
We're taking on the night yeah we're taking it back 
Do run, run, run, do run me, do it 
Do run, run, run, [Chorus] 
Let's set the world on fire tonight 
Let's set the light of lace 
Let's set the world on fire tonight 
You will remember my name 
You do it Do run, run, run, do run me, do it 
Do run, run, run, [Chorus] 
Let's set the world on fire tonight 
Let's set the light of lace 
Let's set the world on fire tonight 
You will remember my name 
You do it.
