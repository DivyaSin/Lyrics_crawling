[Chorus] 
Just you take your time, oh 
Just you take your time Do you remember when 
We used to take our time 
You'd write me a letter, baby 
And I'd wait for you all night (oh) 
Now it seems everyone's 
Rushing around including you and I 
I wanna take a little time Just to fall in love again 
Cause they're telling me [Chorus] When I think about yesterday 
Everything was easy 
Everything was okay 
(Now, now, now) 
Now everything is going fast 
You're the best thing I ever had 
Aw and losing you 
Aw it'd make me, make me 
That would make me 
Feel so bad (hey, hey) 
Would you help me saying [Chorus] Sing low and take it slow 
I'm inclined to agree 
Cause ain't nobody living 
Can try to hurry me (can try to hurry me) [Chorus:Repeat x3]
