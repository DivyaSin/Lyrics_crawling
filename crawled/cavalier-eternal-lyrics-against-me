girl im sorry but i'm leaving. 
we're both at fault, we're both to blame. 
and it wasn't the other men cause there were other women. 
this just isn't love, it's just the remorse of a loss, of a feeling. 
even if i stayed it just wouldn't be the same. double this drink up into the, tallest glass you got. 
you know i aint used to sleeping all, alone. 
gonna make it to the moon tonight on a 1 way kamikaze flight. 
if i could get so high i'll leave behind my problems, 
take em out with the empty bottles. oh girl sorry but i'm leaving. 
we're both at fault, we're both to blame. 
and it wasn't the other men cause there were other women. 
this just isn't love it's just the remorse of a loss of a feeling 
even if i stayed it just wouldn't be the same. me & this guitar are going swinging blind into the unknown. 
you know a song & a stage is all i ever needed of a home. 
someday i, will call from a payphone in a truckstop on the road 
& you'll tell me how much better off you've been on your own.
