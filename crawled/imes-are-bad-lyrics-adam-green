Well, times are bad 
And all the time you're feeling sad 
And people are laughing 
Telling you to go away 
And your feet are trudgin' 
You're always acting like a curmudgeon 
Well I know I know 
That it's hard hard hard Well it's hard to walk around 
Feeling like a circus clown 
Grab a big baton 
And twirl it like a magic wand 
'Cause your cards are dealt 
And everything is deeply felt 
Well I know I know 
That it's hard hard hard And the people that you love 
Are attacking you from above 
And everyone that you trust 
Is just selling you a bucket of lies 
Well just believe 
That it's all gonna be ok 
Well I know I know 
That it's hard hard hard
