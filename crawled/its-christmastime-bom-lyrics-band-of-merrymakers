All year 
We been waitin' on some good cheer 
Cause even when the cloudy skies 
won't clear we say 
Fa la la la 
Laughter 
And happiness is what we're after 
Right before we turn the chapter 
New Years Day We take the plane to the train 
To the streets we know 
To the town to the house 
To the one place we call home Ring all the bells 
Light all the lights 
You know that it's Christmastime 
Take all your cares 
Leave em behind 
You know that it's Christmastime 
The whole world comes alive 
It's Christmastime 
Fa la la la Old friends 
Droppin by before the night ends 
Talkin' bout the good old times when 
We were young 
Fa la la la 
Listen 
Kids are laughin' in the kitchen 
Wishin' for a merry Christmas everyone Ring all the bells 
Light all the lights 
You know that it's Christmastime 
Take all your cares 
Leave em behind 
You know that it's Christmastime 
The whole world comes alive 
It's Christmastime 
Fa la la la Take the plane to the train 
To the streets we know 
To the wreath on the door 
To the mistletoe 
And our hearts get warm 
When the air is cold 
Cause there's love everywhere 
In the one place we call home Ring all the bells 
Light all the lights 
You know that it's Christmastime 
Take all your cares 
Leave em behind 
You know that it's Christmastime 
The whole world comes alive 
It's Christmastime 
Fa la la la 
Fa la la la 
You know that it's Christmastime 
Fa la la la 
Fa la la la 
You know that it's Christmastime
