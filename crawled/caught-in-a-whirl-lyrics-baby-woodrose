Did you think you life would turn and change, girl? 
Did you think it just could stay the same, girl? Did you find 
You just got caught in a whirl 
Caught in a whirl Did you think you'd get so carried away, girl?

You just got caught in a whirl 
Caught in a whirl Did you think you'd get a second chance, girl? 
Or did you lift you're mind into the dance, girl? Did you find 
You just got caught in a whirl 
Caught in a whirl 
Caught in a whirl 
You just got caught in a whirl
