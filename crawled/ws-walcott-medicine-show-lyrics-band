When your arms are empty, got nowhere to go 
Come on out and catch the show 
There'll be saints and sinners 
You'll see losers and winners All kinds of people you might want to know 
Once you get it, you can't forget it 
W.S. Walcott medicine show You know he always holds it in a tent 
And if you're looking for the real thing 
He can show you where it went There's a young faith healer, he's a woman stealer 
He will cure by his command 
When the music's hot then you might have to stand To hear the Klondike Klu Klux Steamboat Band 
Don't you sweat it, you can't forget it 
W.S. Walcott medicine show I'd rather die happy than not die at all 
For a man is a fool who will not heed the call Gonna see Miss Brer Foxhole 
Bright diamonds at her teeth 
She is pure gold down underneath She's a rock and roll singer and a true dead ringer 
For something like you ain't never seen 
Once you get it, you can't forget it
