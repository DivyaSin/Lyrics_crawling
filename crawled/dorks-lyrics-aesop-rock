Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage 
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face? 
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain 
I'm tryin' to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste 
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch 
Deep in a self imposed Stockholm and Lima influx 
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks 
Made any mingling akin to bein' seasoned and stuffed 
It's a theatre of jumpin' jellyfish, jealous little sycophants 
Miserable and flimsy from the skivvys to the pissy pants 
Each one seperately convinced 
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands 
Delusion turn a communication of prison camp 
You fuckin' dorks ain't a threat to the cause 
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost 
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts 
Step out the tempest to measure Of what the spectrum involves 
Maybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there Don't need no help, all by myself I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene 
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe 
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive 
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe 
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong 
The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog 
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws 
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs 
And a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry 
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling 
God almighty chop an ivory tower to piano keys 
Play your own dirge on the way to surfin' maggot beach 
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art 
You can't be cooler than the corners Where you source all your parts The poker face, all it takes a couple sordid remarks 
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark 
Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there Don't need no help, all by myself I view the rattling of sabres like a show to expose 
Insecurities exploding in emotional code 
With braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross 
Corrode a homie til his probity is notably ghost 
Before the hobby was a job he was a manager, 
Hell You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle 
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill 
That you was anything menacing is a difficult sell 
In a whistle-and-bellorama, black mollies to dress up like piranha 
It's not even compelling melodrama 
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga 
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata 
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need 
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed 
I'm off in coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen 
Don't make 'em show the regency what disobedient means 
Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there Don't need no help, all by myself
