Casting lines that have no meaning 
Wasting time and only dreaming 
Fasting is just part of preening 
Lasting can be so demeaning Fishing for a compliment 
Wishing it was really meant 
Dishing out the sentiment 
When only flowers pay the rent All alone and all together now The carousel is going round 
The band is playing without a sound 
The music box has been unwound 
The Brooklyn bridge is falling down
