I'll burn the fucker down, then wait to watch the fire spread. 
Millions look on, as I end what you've claimed yours. 
I won't remain silent forever, eterrnity deafens the masses. 
These screams of protest will make your ears bleed, 
choking on the ashes of what used to be. 
We won't remain silent forever, 
we'll burn the fucker down and watch the fire spread.
