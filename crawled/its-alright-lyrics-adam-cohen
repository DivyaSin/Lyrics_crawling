Forget that you don't have 
Forget that you don't 
Just forget it Forget that you're afraid 
Forget that you are, don't plan it 
Forget that you're alone 
Everyone's alone, think about it And it's alright 
I know it ain't easy, but that's life 
You don't have to worry, it's alright 
We're all in the dark, looking for the light, that light 
So, don't you worry Forget that you can't love 
Forget that you can't 
Just forget it Forget the reasons why 
Forget the reasons, can you do that' 
Forget that you are lost 
Everyone gets lost in the journey And it's all right 
I know it ain't easy, but that's life 
You don't have to worry, it's alright 
We're all in the dark, looking for the light, that light 
So, baby, don't you worry Stop 
Take a look around you 
Just stop 
Maybe it'll be better, if you calm down It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright 
I know it ain't easy but that's life You don't have to worry, it's alright 
We're all dark looking for the light, that light 
So you don't have to worry, it's alright It's no big deal, it's just life 
And you don't have to worry, it's alright 
We're all in the dark, we're all in the dark 
Looking for the light Forget that you can't love 
Forget that you don't have 
Forget that you can't love Forget the reasons why 
Forget that you can't 
Forget that you can't love Oh, it's alright 
We're all in the dark looking for the light 
Looking for the light, it's alright, it's alright 
It's no big deal, it's just life
