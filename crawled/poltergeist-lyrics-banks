I started all the wars, I started all the wars 
I've been getting messages from my deep waters 
I'm being a resentful caretaker 
Blame me for your false indicators 
You're mistaking all my mistakes for my crooked nature Oh my god, I think I saw a ghost 
Follow me everywhere I go 
Don't even try to get creative 
I smell a clown looking goofy, dressed up as a native Won't you come here? You don't even know 
Acting like a fool when you roll over 
We could go away, you won't even know 
Blame me, looking cool smoking on the clover I started all the wars, I started all the wars 
I've been getting messages from my deep waters 
I'm being a resentful caretaker 
Blame me for your false indicators 
You're mistaking all my mistakes for my crooked nature Oh my god, I think I saw a ghost 
Why you're here walking around on my home street, bothering me? 
Got your shoulder, you've been affected 
I smell the chemicals, I don't see miracles 
I'm at the pinnacle, you're so material 
Why don't you get what you need? I started all the wars, I started all the wars 
I've been getting messages from my deep waters 
I'm being a resentful caretaker 
Blame me for your false indicators 
You're mistaking all my mistakes for my crooked nature
