Verse 1 
Grander earth has quaked before 
Moved by the sound of His voice 
Seas that are shaken and stirred 
Can be calmed and broken for my regard Chorus 
And through it all, through it all 
My eyes are on You 
And through it all, through it all 
It is well And through it all, through it all 
My eyes are on You 
It is well with me Verse 2 
Far be it from me to not believe 
Even when my eyes can't see And this mountain that's in front of me 
Will be thrown into the midst of the sea Chorus 
Through it all, through it all 
My eyes are on You 
Through it all, through it all 
It is well 
It is well Bridge x3 
So let go my soul and trust in Him 
The waves and wind still know His name (repeat last line during 3rd run) It is well with my soul 
It is well with my soul 
It is well with my soul 
It is well with my soul 
It is well it is well with my soul x3 Chorus x2 (softly slowly) 
Through it all, through it all 
My eyes are on You 
Through it all, through it all 
It is well with me.
