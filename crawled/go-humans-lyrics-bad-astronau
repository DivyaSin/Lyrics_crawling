Go human time bombs 
Go robotic believers 
Protect your only war reserves Go great destroyers 
Killers of holy nurture 
Legacy of genocide rulers 
And tyrants 'Cause God do we have to be 
Perversions of our innate pride and arrogance Have to learn 
Have to learn 
Have to learn 
We have to swallow Go humans go destroyers 
Go until it's gone (What would it cost you) 
(To face your thoughts) 
(You needed your sovereignty and) 
(Your precious things hurdle everything) God do we have to be 
Competitors to be the worst in history Cannot learn 
Cannot learn 
Cannot learn 
We cannot store it Go humans go destroyers 
Go untill it's gone
