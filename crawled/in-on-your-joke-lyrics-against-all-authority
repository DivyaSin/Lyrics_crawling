its your story 
and i'm just the antithesis 
to your american dream 
and i sit here in this fucken nightmare watching you, 
biding time 
and telling lies and im wondering why your even here at all its your salvation 
that leaves me in this eternal hell 
to a complacent life of shit that leaves me choking on the smell of 
ruined lives, and wasted minds 
and good ideas that leave 
people shot down in the street 
children cold with nothing to eat 
the homeless with their shoeless feet 
and fat cats and their wealthy hags 
pass people living out of bags shit can someone give me hope your goal in life is to live until you die 
my goal in death is to escape this pathetic human sky 'cause where the air is poison 
and the raindrops burn 
and sex is death well its hard for me to see whats left 
when generals are struck down from the sky 
and politicians are victims of their lies 
when all the cops are locked in jail 
and all the priests have gone to hell 
when lawyers rot in growing heaps 
and our world leaders are buried deep well thats the day 
thats the day ill find my hope
