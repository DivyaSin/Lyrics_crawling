I still think about us in the rush that we felt 
With the rag top down and the radio blasting 
You were riding shot gun in nothing but a bikini and a seat belt 
Looking better than the law should have been allowing, oh mercy We hit the corners going 90 
Love had blindly fallen head over heels over you 
Every feeling that we felt 
Was a feeling that felt brand new And you looked just like an angel 
With that cross on your necklace 
You were young, I was wild 
We were reckless We'd drive on down to the river 
Burnin up those hot summer nights 
Laughing at the cowboys getting crazy 
Picking fights but it wasn't funny When that deputy caught you and me 
Steaming up those windows 
And how your daddy never found out about it 
Honey, heaven only knows We hit the corners going 90 
Love had blindly fallen head over heels over you 
Every feeling that we felt 
Was a feeling that felt brand new And you looked just like an angel 
With that cross on your necklace 
You were young, I was wild 
We were reckless, oh yeah I looked into your eyes 
And I promised you forever 
And I beleived you without my heart 
I just didn't know any better Getting over you took years 
How to spot those tears I cried 
I'd do it all over again 
All for the thrill of the ride Hit the corners going 90 
Love had blindly fallen head over heels over you 
Every feeling that we felt 
Was a feeling that felt brand new And you looked just like an angel 
With that cross on your necklace 
You were young, I was wild 
We were reckless 
Young, wild and reckless
