I went to the doctor and opened up my heart 
Got my symptoms all mixed up, he didn't know where to start 
Ain't no doctor in this world that can keep a broken heart from falling apart 
'Cause they don't know, oh, they don't know I went to my mother to show me how to cry 
She said, "Baby let me shed your tears, I'll make the sacrifice" 
But ain't no crying in this world's gonna take the place of mine 
'Cause they don't know, they don't know Some questions have answers and others just lead you on 
Some answers don't answer enough 
But I know the answer is love 
But they don't know, oh, they don't know I went to my brother to help me understand 
Asked him why they're walking by, don't seem to give a damn 
Don't they see the love they pass walking by empty handed? 
'Cause they don't know, they don't know I went to my father to get some prayer for me 
He said I hold my head up high 'cause there's something there for me 
Crying but I'm smiling through 'cause suddenly I see 
What they don't know, they don't know That sometimes some questions have answers and others just lead you on 
Some answers don't answer enough 
But I know the answer is love 
But they don't know, oh, they don't know
