Lady where's your love gone? 
I was looking but can't find it anywhere 
They always offer when there's loads of love around 
But when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday 
?No chance, you'll get nothing from me? 
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there 
And he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be, just like me Let's go down, down low down 
Where I know I should not go 
Oh, and she thinks she's the one 
But she's just one in twenty-four 
And just 'cause everybody's doing it 
Does that mean that I can too? Lady where's your love gone? 
It was the antiseptic to the sore 
To hold you by the hand must he first be in demand? 
How he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more Let's go down, down low down 
Where I know I should not go 
Oh, and she thinks she's the one 
But she's just one in twenty-four 
And just 'cause everybody's doing it 
Does that mean that I can too? Her eyes went down and cut you up 
And there's nothing like a dirty look from 
The one you want or the one you've lost An ache in your soul it's everybody's goal 
To get what they can't have 
That's why you're after her and that's why she's after him 
But saying it won't change a thing 
And now realizing it won't change a thing 
Realizing it won't change a thing
