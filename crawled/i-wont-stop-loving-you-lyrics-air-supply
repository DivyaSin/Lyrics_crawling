I'm not afraid to say 
And maybe you would stay 
You see it's all I've got 
And I hope it's not too late 
The truth is just the truth 
Whichever way So if you have the time 
And stay away from me 
I know I'm on your mind 
And though you disagree 
It's written on your face 
To read so easily And there between the lines 
I see a place for me Yeah, yeah (13x) 
I won't stop loving you 
I won't stop loving you 
You're everything to me 
And all I want is you 
And if you think it's time 
For you to hesitate 
Don't you be too sure 
You know I just can't wait I won't stop loving you 
I won't stop loving you 
And everything I say 
You know that it's so true 
So if you think it's time 
For you to hesitate 
Don't you be too sure 
You know I just can't wait ** I don't expect to win 
More than the words I choose 
If heartache is a sin 
I'm guilty as accused 
So if you see me 
Please don't come the other way So if you have the time 
And stay away from me 
I know I'm on your mind 
And though you disagree 
It's written on your face 
To read so easily And there between the lines 
I see a place for me Yeah, yeah (13x) I won't stop loving you 
I won't stop loving you 
You're everything to me 
And all I want is you 
And if you think it's time 
For you to hesitate 
Don't you be too sure 
You know I just can't wait I won't stop loving you 
I won't stop loving you 
And everything I say 
You know that it's so true 
And if you think it's time 
For you to hesitate 
Don't you be too sure 
You know I Won't Stop Loving You
