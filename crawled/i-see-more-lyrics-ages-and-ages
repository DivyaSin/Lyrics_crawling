In light of day we made a move through the rest 
All darkness air lost its will to deflect 
Our fight was not so easily banned 
When things were getting old And when this happened I was weighed, I was warned 
?? at the wounds I had sworn 
To never end up in there, as it turns out now I guess that I was wrong AND STILL I, STILL I SEE MORE And in the following it's been had, it's been hashed 
They're lying still like some appeal in my past 
Whatever's up it shows the take out the back 
My place was rugged all along But if you ever feel an urge to be friends 
Or even notice any light that's to share 
I know you brought me round the way there instead 
And hoped for how it was before STILL I, STILL I SEE MORE Spit out your loses, pile under buses 
Maybe it's ok, maybe it's ok 
Spit out your loses, pile under buses 
Maybe you'll decide, maybe you'll decide 
Spit out your loses, pile under buses 
Maybe it's ok, maybe it's ok 
Spit out your loses, pile under buses 
Maybe you'll decide, maybe you'll decide 
Spit out your loses, pile under buses 
Maybe it's ok, maybe it's ok I'LL BE ON YOUR SIDE
