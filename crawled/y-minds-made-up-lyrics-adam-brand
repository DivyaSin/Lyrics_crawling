We'd better stop before we go 
Look to the left and right and go a little slow 
Take some time just to see if we are really meant to be 
The whole world says it's you and me Hey little girl when you talk that way 
My minds made up and I have to say 
You're the one I'm dreaming of 
I finally find myself in love All it takes is one kiss 
To make my heart melt down like this 
My walls come on down like Jericho baby, you tore them down 
You turned my world upside down Frankie and Johnny, Jack and Dianne 
Lois Lane and Superman 
My pretty woman, my little white dove 
My guardian angel sent from Heaven above
