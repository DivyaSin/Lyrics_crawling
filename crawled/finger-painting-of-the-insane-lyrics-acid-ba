Turning the knife buried in your stomach I woke up 
alive black with stain glistening 
and new the sunset's coming 
fingerpaintings of the insane come on and sterilize me 
kneel down and idolize me suck me 
fuck me 
resurrect me 
rut me 
cut me 
and infect me 
slice me 
dice me 
I wanna die screamin the thoughts of dead babies 
wiped away with my semen bleed me 
feed me 
and inject me 
feel me, 
kill me 
then dissect me
