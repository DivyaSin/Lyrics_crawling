Ain't nobody gonna tell me s**t 
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip 
and all my friends they love to call me whipped 
but what they just don't know 
Is I've looked in New York City 
and I've looked in Boston too 
I found a couple that were pretty 
but I'm still gonna stay with you Ain't nobody gonna tell me shit 
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip 
and all my friends they love to call me whipped 
but what they just don't know. 
Is I've looked in San Francisco 
and I've looked all through LA 
I've looked in Dallas, Texas 
but something didn't feel the same. 
So I looked in Detroit city 
then I checked back at Duke 
I found a couple that were pretty 
but I'm still gonna stay with you Still gonna stay with you
