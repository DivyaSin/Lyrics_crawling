Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah If I threw a party, would you be there? 
Would you bring your friends too? 
'Cause why should we stay at home 
When something's better to do 
It started in the house 
It moved on to the streets 
C'mon and follow me And have some fun, with the funk 
Turn up the bass and pop the junk 
This party's gonna bump 
Keep bopping buddy, oh 
Let's have some fun, with the funk 
Turn up the bass and pop the junk 
This party is too short 
So c'mon, get on board 
And have some fun 
Yeah, yeah, yeah We all need a permanent vacation 
From the things that get us down 
So just turn it up and turn it out 
'Cause it can never get too loud 
Let's take it from the street 
And move it to the beach 
The sand beneath our feet And have some fun, with the funk 
Turn up the bass and pop the junk 
This party's gonna bump 
Keep bopping buddy, oh 
Let's have some fun, with the funk 
Turn up the bass and pop the junk 
This party is too short 
So c'mon, get on board

'Cause it's no secret why 
It would never mean as much to me 
Without you by my side

Stop staring at the walls, all you girls and boys 
It's time to make some noise!
