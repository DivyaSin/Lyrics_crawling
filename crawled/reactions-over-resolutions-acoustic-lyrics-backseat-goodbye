Are you sure that's what you want to say? 
Think back, relax and get back to me 
This is not your everyday reaction 
More like a two-time, forgettable, satisfaction Well, I've been thinking about it, planning in my head 
The ways, the time, the days that just stick out 
And I've come to the conclusion 
That there is no resolution for your ways 
Think this one's a keeper, save it for another day It's about time you realize the truth 
Circle takes the square and it all points back to you 
Distant disaster and we all know the proof 
What I know, you know, they know you're getting into Well, I've been thinking about it, planning in my head 
The ways, the time, the days that just stick out 
And I've come to the conclusion 
That there is no resolution for your ways 
Think this one's a keeper, save it for another day, yeah I hate to say but I told you so 
I hate to say but I told you so 
I told you so, I hate to say but I told you so, oh We're gonna sing 'til it's over 
We're gonna sing 'til it's over 
We're gonna sing 'til it's over 
It's not over, it's not over, it's not over 
Until we say it is We're gonna sing 'til it's over 
We're gonna sing 'til it's over 
We're gonna sing 'til it's over
