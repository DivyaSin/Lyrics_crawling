I think you like it a lot 
I think you like what you see 
I know you like what you got, babe 
That's what you got with me [Chorus] 
This heart, these hands 
Are made to understand 
This girl and that man 
If we don't make it no one can 
Oh baby Oh I cry myself to sleep at night 
I'm so in love 
'Cause I cry myself to sleep at night 
I'm all shook up 
'Cause I cry myself to sleep at night 
This woman is in love I think you like a little solo 
A little one on one 
A little old fashioned feel good 
Make me emotionally numb [Chorus] I cry myself to sleep at night 
I'm so in love 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
I'm all shook up 
'Cause I cry myself to sleep at night 
This woman is in love [Chorus] I cry myself to sleep at night 
I'm so in love 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
I'm all shook up 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
'Cause I cry myself to sleep at night 
I'm so in love 
I cry myself to sleep at night 
I'm all shook up 
And I cry myself to sleep at night 
I'm so in love 
I cry myself to sleep at night
