I'm always thinkin' about you 
I wonder if you can tell 
These things I'm feelin' inside me 
I keep them all to myself 
Scared to show my true emotions 
Don't wanna love for love Because I fall so deep 
You'll never know 
How far I go 
And I know why hearts beat 
Desperately 
I fall so deep Some people think love is foolish 
While others think it's a game 
I think that love is a fire 
I'm burnin' up in your flame 
I'm so lost in my emotions 
Wanting you ever more Because I fall so deep 
You'll never know 
How far I go 
And I know why hearts beat 
Desperately 
I fall so deep I fall so deep 
I fall so deep 
I fall so deep And I've come so close to the part 
Where I reveal my heart to you 
But I lose my nerve 
Can't find the words 
To tell that it's true 
I fall so deep I fall so deep 
You'll never know 
How far I go 
And I know why hearts beat 
Oh so desperately 
I fall so deep I fall, so deep 
You'll never know 
(Never know) 
How far I go 
(You'll never know) 
And I know why hearts beat 
Desperately 
I fall so deep I'm always thinkin' about you 
(I fall so deep) 
I wonder if you can tell 
(And I fall so deep) 
These things I'm feelin' inside me 
(I fall so deep) 
'Cause I fall so deep
