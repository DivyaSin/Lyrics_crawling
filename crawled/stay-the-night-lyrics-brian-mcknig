I want you so Try to say how I feel when I'm holding you close to me 
But my temperature rises so I can hardly believe 
That finally you came to me we made loneliness our enemy 
Don't go, don't you know Feels so right, and I can hold you longer 
If you stay the night, oh 
The time is right and we will grow much stronger 
If you stay the night tonight pretty baby 
Stay the night Words cannot express to you how I'm burning up deep inside 
I took one look and I knew this was a feeling I couldn't fight 
But now that you're here with me now that you're here with me, hey 
Let's make togetherness our destiny, don't go Feels so right, and I can hold you longer 
If you stay the night, oh 
The time is right and we will grow much stronger 
If you stay the night tonight with me baby At the start I thought it was too good 
To be true, but know I know that all along 
It should have been me and you At the start I thought it was too good 
To be true, but know I know that all along 
It should have been me and you Feels so right 
If you stay the night 
The time is right 
If you stay the night Feels so right, and I can hold you longer 
If you stay the night, oh 
The time is right and we will grow much stronger 
If you stay the night It feels so right
