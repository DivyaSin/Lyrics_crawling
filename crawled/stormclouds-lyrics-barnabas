Turned on my radio, to listen for awhile 
But the junk they play gets worse every day 
Flipped on the tv, hoping for a smile 
Until I felt my brain begin to decay Unborn children murdered by the millions 
Sacrificed so mom can run free 
Shattered victims scattered through the wreckage 
Picking through what once used to be As the stormclouds roll from the crest of Mount Zion 
Who will turn away and be saved? Captured spirits, bloodied on the inside 
Languishing in chains they can't see 
Hopeless captives, clawing at their bindings 
Running from the one with the key Foolish dreamers, trusting in tomorrow 
Counting on what never can be 
A lying promise dangles in their faces 
"Take the mark and walk away free" Holy Saviour, murdered by the masses 
Sacrificed so man could go free 
Patient Father, waiting for the harvest 
Reaching out for you and for me And when the good news shimmers in the spotlight 
Freedom finds a home on the stage 
So come and join us; your life won't last forever 
Its over with the turn of a page As the stormclouds roll from the quest of Mount Zion 
Will you turn away and be saved?
