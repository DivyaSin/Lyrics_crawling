i entertain all the pain 
saw the hope wash down the drain - it's nothing 
it's not the flame that burns insane 
i slipped up, messed up when you i blamed 
don't sign for sorrow, i'll keep the heart i borrowed 
from somebody else hurt me badly 
i don't feel it anymore 
sell me cheaply 
just like everyone before i don't remiss the things unfixed 
i sank to deep and left, unmixed 
it's not the song you used to sing 
it's simply unfelt trite you bring 
don't fight tomorrow 
it'll crush the heart that's hollow 
despite how we felt hurt me badly 
i don't feel it anymore 
sell me cheaply 
just like everyone before
