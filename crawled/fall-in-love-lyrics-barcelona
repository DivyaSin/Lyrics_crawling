We've been on for a minute 
No more feeling alone 
We're trying hard not to bruise it 
I said, "If forever's gonna last then 
we'd better find the same direction." I've been gone for a minute 
I've been out on the road 
And the night got me thinking 
Thinking about lying in bed in the dark in the warm and we're naked I want you for so long 
Tell me is it so wrong 
Even if we fall in love 
Fall in love 
I don't wanna hold you down, dear 
Trying to make it so clear 
Hoping that we fall in love 
Fall in love It's getting hard not to take it 
I wanna ask but I don't 
But it's time for me to face it 
Keep telling myself run away, run away, run away, don't chase it Don't give up on me, baby 
When I stumble along 
When I act a little crazy 
Remember my love for you won't fade, won't fade, you keep it blazing I want you for so long 
Tell me is it so wrong 
Even if we fall in love 
Fall in love 
I don't wanna hold you down, dear 
Trying to make it so clear 
Hoping that we fall in love 
Fall in love When you hold on to me 
When you let me in 
You better know that I got you 
Under my skin 
Ooh, you got me restless 
I can't sleep alone 
You better be waiting 
'Til I get home I want you for so long 
Tell me is it so wrong 
Even if we fall in love 
Fall in love 
I don't wanna hold you down, dear 
Trying to make it so clear 
Hoping that we fall in love 
Fall in love
