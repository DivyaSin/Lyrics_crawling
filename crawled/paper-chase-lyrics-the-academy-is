Please stand by, we've come so far 
These years, we survived the ride that turned us inside out 
Repeat after me, just scream and shout 
"It was the best of times from broken homes and battle scars to where we are" [Chorus:] 
Graduate, paper chase 
We'll get out of this place 
Don't turn around. Hit the highway 
Pour some liquor out for this town 
Now that's all for us, it's last call to drink up Roll it out, it's over now 
We're the cast outs with messed up friends who never did fit in 
Don't know where it ends 
It doesn't matter now 
As long as we're as one, we'll take the next bus 
Destination: setting sun [Chorus: Repeat 2X] This is an open invite for all to attend 
Don't ask too many questions now 
Don't tell us how it ends 
Because we're the ones who wrote the end [Chorus: Repeat 2X]
