I can hear the wind song that heals 
Naked feet on the dirty sand, I kneel down 
We made the promise that we would take it all 
So grab your things it's there, just burst it all A silhouette with a baseball hat appears 
While I'm still twirling with the art of South America 
The giant vessel is now a lightning bug 
Sailing to the ice of Antarctica Let's go to town and scream 
Puerto Viejo 
Scarecrows and bums are awake 
We'll find them Only one night to make the best of a mystery 
I know the story, I don't lack bravery 
Walter Castillo leads us, a joyous gang 
Telling us his tales of costume jewellery Let's go to town and scream 
Puerto Viejo 
Scarecrows and bums are awake 
We'll find them Rambling the streets and the dog with the kicky twitch 
Psychedelic cats playing with rats in a colorful ditch Let's go to town and scream 
Puerto Viejo 
Scarecrows and bums are awake 
We'll find them
