little children snuggle 
under soft black stars 
and if you look into their eyes 
soft black stars 
deliver them from the book 
and the letter and the word 
and let them read the silence 
bathed in soft black stars 
let them trace the raindrops 
under soft black stars 
let them follow whispers 
and scare away the night 
let them kiss the featherbreath 
of soft black stars 
and let them ride their horses 
licked by the wind and the snow 
and tip-toe into twilight 
where we all one day will go 
caressed with tenderness 
and with no fear at all 
their faces shining river gold 
washed by soft black stars 
and angels' wings shall soothe their cares 
and all the birds shall sing at dawn 
blessed and wet with joy 
you and i will meet one day 
under the night sky 
lit by soft black stars.
