I sat on the front porch 
Guitar in my hand 
Playing the same chords 
Over and over again 
I wasted my morning 
And half my afternoon 
But by the of the day, 
Im going to find a different groove I've got a good friend 
And lord he can play 
And lately Ive been wonderin 
How does he do it this way 
The boys got a rhythm 
Ill follow it soon 
Gonna put my soul into music 
And find a different groove And Ive been around 
Everywhere under the sun 
Only to find out 
Somewhere, somehow its all been done 
But Ive made up my mind 
Startin today 
Yes Im goind to 
Find a style 
That makes me smile 
And play it my way Im done with the two-step 
I can find a beat 
I cant make it swing 
On account of my two left feet 
Ive got to keep moving 
Shuffling my shoes 
Gonna put my soul into music, 
And find a different groove
