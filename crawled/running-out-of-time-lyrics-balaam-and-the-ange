Sometimes it's hard 
Sometimes there's no solution 
Right from the start 
There's always been confusion 
Sometimes it's strange 
Caught in a revolution 
Within a change 
There's still the sound of silence 
And with this startling romance 
I'll never let it get me down 
Yet again 
We're running outof time
