Scarred by time and bruised by bitter days 
With a rusty, haggard frame and a cynical gaze 
Worn out where the years took their toll 
Trying to turn these shattered shards into something whole I'm banging on a tight wire 
Trying to find meaning in the coughs and the rattles 
I'm banging on a tight wire 
Turning it into a song Most of the greatest lessons I have learned 
Fell out of the failures that left me feeling burned 
This road is hard and this world sure ain't kind 
But my broken parts are a sign that I'm alive I'm banging on a tight wire 
Trying to find meaning in the coughs and the rattles 
I'm banging on a tight wire 
Turning it into a song I'm playing with a wild fire 
Creating control 
I'm playing with a wild fire 
It's all I know I'm banging on a tight wire 
Trying to find meaning in the coughs and the rattles 
I'm banging on a tight wire 
Turning it into a song
