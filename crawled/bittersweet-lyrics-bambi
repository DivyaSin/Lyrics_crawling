See ya gotta know what i wanna do 
When i'm with you 
Can't you see that i wannabe 
Next to u 
And i dont get whats so great about 
Wasting time just making out 
Puttin ur hands up on my chest 
Uhn uh i dont like that 
Cant u see, y u gotta be that way 
Sometimes i completely adore u 
Other days, just wish i could ignore u I wanna chill out 
Wannabe 
Laid back 
Like before 
Lie down 
Sit aound 
Laugh out 
Hear me shout 
Don't care 
What'd u say? 
Dont listen anyway 
So tell me 
Baby 
Why cant 
U see 
That what u wanna do 
What u wanna do 
Makes u bittersweet
