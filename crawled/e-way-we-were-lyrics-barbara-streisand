Mmm Mmm 
Memories, light the corners of my mind 
Misty water color memories of the way we were 
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind 
smiles we gave to one another 
for the way we were. 
Can it be that it was all so simple then 
or has time rewritten every line? 
If we had the chance to do it all again 
tell me would we? Could we? 
Memories, may be beautiful and yet 
what's too painful to remember 
we simply choose to forget 
So it's the laughter we will remember 
whenever we remember 
the way we were.
