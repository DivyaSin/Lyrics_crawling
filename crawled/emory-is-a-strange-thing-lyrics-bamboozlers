words and music: Steven Rhodes 
There was always that old man when a little boy 
You don't go near his house or even close 
And you passed his house you went across to the other side 
He would sit on his porch and inside himself cry 
Then 15 years later you found out that he died 
Then you went back home, and you crossed on his side 
Chorus: 
And oh darlin memory is a strange thing 
It's like a distant passed world that we'll never remember but we'll 
never forget 
And oh darlin memory is a strange thing 
No matter how much we want to erase, to it we'll always cling 
Do you remember your first love? 
I do?at the time I thought she was perfect but oh man how I was wrong 
If I could just know then, what I do know now 
I would turn in all my jersies and I would gracefully back out 
There are lots of little things that we don't forget and we don't know 
why but we don't regret all the little mischevious things that we've 
done because aside from them life'd be no fun 
Now as a little boy, everything made me happy 
It could just be as simple as playin in a ditch or one of mom's homemade 
sandwiches 
I could dress up as some superhero, or some legendary figure to take my 
mind off things at hand?but now I can't
