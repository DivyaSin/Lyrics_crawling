Life as we know it 
Has come to an end 
A suburban catastrophe 
It's time to start mourning 
The death of a friend 
Who's standing in front of me And I can't stop the hatred 
That wells up inside 
As I look for a glimmer 
In his vacant eyes 
And I can't do a damn thing 'cause 
I can't feel a damn thing 
With a hole in my heart 
That's a thousand miles wide 'Cause the smile has left his face 
The portrait of happiness he can't retrace 
Gone is the love that once lived there 
It's cold as a stone, cold as a stone It's laid out before him 
With trembling hands 
But the parts don't seem to fit 
And the 34 winters 
Haven't left him as cold 
As this one conversation did And I don't understand 
With eyes open wide 
Why you see love so clearly 
But it still leaves you blind 
And I can't do a damn thing, 
'Cause I can't say a damn thing 
And I can't stop this woman 
From pushing him aside 'Cause the smile has left his face 
The portrait of happiness he can't retrace 
Gone is the love that once lived there 
It's cold as a stone, cold as a stone Life as we know it 
Has come to an end 
Nothing can be the same
