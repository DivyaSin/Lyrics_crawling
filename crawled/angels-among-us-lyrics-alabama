I'm there at 8:00 not 8:01; and stay late to get it done and tolerate the bosses son good jobs don't grow on trees there's even rumors going round their going to shut this factory down it'll kill this little town if it goes overseas You can hope for the best and plan for the worst if lighting doesn't strike you first who knows what's going to happen in the end I just work like its all up to me and pray like its all up to him I got that Friday paycheck in my hands minus a bite from Uncle Sam but no complaint I understand its the nature of the game 
I pay the water bill, electricity, the morgate and that policy that takes care of my family should the good Lord call my name You can hope for the best and plan for the worst if lighting doesn't strike you first who knows what's going to happen in the end I just work like its all up to me and pray like its all up to him At the end of the day when I've done all I can I drop to my knees and leave it all in his hands and I just hope for the best and plan for the worst if lighting doesn't strike you first who knows what's going to happen in the end I just work like its all up to me and pray like its all up to him Like it's all up to him
