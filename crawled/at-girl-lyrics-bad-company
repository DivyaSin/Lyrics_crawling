I've heard the rumours, i hear one every night 
They say that you've been cheatin' on me, i know they're not right 
They don't really know you, they just don't understand 
I know you wouldn't do that, wouldn't be so underhand [Chorus] 
And still they say, that girl, yeah the girl is playin' 'round again 
That girl, yeah they say i oughta know 
They say i haven't noticed, that you want to be alone 
And sometimes no one's there when i answer the phone 
They say you tell me stories about the places you go 
If there's somethin' you're not tellin' me, i've got the right to know 
Yeah [Chorus] I hear it every night, that girl, they say if i know what is good for me 
Hey that girl, they say that i should let her go 
My friends are tellin' stories, about your goings on 
I just want to talk to you, babe, i've got to know what's goin' on 
They don't really know you, they just don't understand 
I know you wouldn't do it, you wouldn't be so underhand 
Yeah - [Chorus] Hear it every night 
That girl, then they say it's for the company 
That girl, i hear it everywhere i go 
That girl, they say that i'm too blind to see 
That girl, it seems she can't say no 
That girl...
