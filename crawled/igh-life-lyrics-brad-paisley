I can still remember when 
Grandpa died and our ship came in 
Daddy said he left momma and him more money than we'd ever seen 
And just like that we were thousandaires 
Had a brand new boat and a Frigidaire 
And all us kids in our underwear were jumping on a trampoline A bunch low lives living the high life 
Money burning a hole right through the pockets of holey jeans 
Grandpa's with Lord now, but we got a new Ford now 
And we can watch the Big Orange now on a 57 inch TV, that's right Money was gone by mid-July and we went back to just getting by 
'Til momma slipped on a patch of ice outside of Chick-Fil-A 
Now we knew they was a Christian bunch 
So we didn't ask for all that much 
Settled out of court for ten thousand bucks 
And free chicken 'til I die a day A bunch low lives living the high life 
Money burning a hole right through the pockets of holey jeans 
Momma's got a limp now but we all get to swim now 
'Cause we got an above ground sitting out by the trampoline We rocked, we rolled, we lived it up 'til it started running thin 
We began looking for a way to spend that will again I heard a song a couple months ago, was Carrie Underwood on the radio 
Reminded me of a poem my brother wrote back in second grade 
I know she didn't steal it but so what? We lawyered up and we sued her butt 
These days we figured we'd pretty much get paid to go away A bunch low lives living the high life 
Money burning a hole right through the pockets of a holey jeans 
This song's another one now, know I get a hot tub now 
Set it next to the above ground, which is next to the trampoline It's gonna run out some day 
And that ain't gonna be a fun day 
But as long as it ain't a Sunday 
We can go to Chick-Fil-A and eat Man I love those Waffle fries (I know) 
That Chick-Fil-A has got some good waffle fries (I'd say, that's right) 
Maybe I'll get a diet Coke, 
I don't know (I wish they had beer, it'd be perfect) 
I like the little trays that the food comes on (I like the Polynesian sauce)
