I remember the way your hand reached out and 
Closed doors. I remember, though memories serve no 
Purpose anymore. Wrong direction. I now see what 
I didn't look for. Feed all prefection and bite 
The hand you once adored because... Now you've gone too far. So let me show you 
How I will win every war and the battlefield is all 
Mines. Thieving, Grieving 
Beliving the opposition. Failure 
To say you're devoid of sympathy. Your forced opression is one thing that I can 
Tell you, for sure, just won't affect me... so just 
keep trying to push it more. Your sub-human 
Surprise keeps my hatred alive. Be thankful to survive 
Because I'm just getting started now... See how you've gone too far? Attempts to put 
Me down won't succed anymore. But, your actions 
Will leave a scar. Thieving, Grieving 
Beliving the opposition. Failure 
To say you're devoid of sympathy. Now life taken away, breaking away 
Destroying it, now I'm fine 
Blinded willingly, until recently suspicion 
Was set free. That was then... so what? 
This is now. 
Tell them this is now. Thieving, Grieving 
Beliving the opposition. Failure 
To say you're devoid of sympathy
