Wake me 'coz I'm in the place to be 
Call me just takin' a breath of you 
Once more than I do realize 
You're gonna disappear as the daylight Voice wave your body can't get to me 
Lay down what you can read about 
So far and close at the same time as we disconnect 
Just to figure it out the two of us Sun, rain, comin' again 
So just lay back, lay back I'm callin' you 
Once more than I do realize 
You're gonna disappear as the daylight It doesn't come easy when I'm talkin' on the phone to you 
As you share the best of you, share the rest of you 
It takes me down, it takes me down, take me down 
Take me deep down 'coz it doesn't make me feel good You're my sun and my rain but the rain flow away 
So what you trying so hard, so where you going so fast 
Can't you forgive for the past may I'm blowing you? No way 
I'm talkin' about your critical point of no return Flow my fingers on the keyboard still 
Flow the screen to my open wide eyes 
Eyes my fingers on the keyboard still 
Flow the screen to my open wide
