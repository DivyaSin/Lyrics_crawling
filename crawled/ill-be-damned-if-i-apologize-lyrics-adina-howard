Damned if I do, damned if I don't 
Sometimes I will, sometimes I won't 
I can't take it Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down 
Sometimes I get rough, sometimes I get clowned 
I can't break it I got home late, so I'm gettin' called 
I'll let you sleep 'cause I know you work hard 
So you call me in the mornin' 
Askin' me where the hell I been Why didn't I check in, I can't win 
Maybe we should just be friends 
But I love you so much, you got me strugglin' 
Like a junky 'cause I need your touch Do you trust me? I'm not doin' no dirt 
So why you tryna bust me? 
Let me make it up tonight 
I just can't get it right Damned if I do, damned if I don't 
Sometimes I will, sometimes I won't 
I can't take it Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down 
Sometimes I get rough, sometimes I get clowned 
I can't break it Adina, let me feel ya So you say you want my trust 
And you say you're down for us 
Well, what am I supposed to do? You stay out late 
And you come home when you want to 
And you expect me not to be upset 
When I'm too nice, tears are all I get I've been hurt before 
And I don't wanna be hurt no more 
Seems I can't win Things start out nice, we fight in the end 
Mmm, I can't get it right 
Let's make it right tonight Damned if I do, damned if I don't 
Sometimes I will, sometimes I won't 
I can't take it Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down

I can't break it I'm no good without you 
Let's try and work it out 
We belong together, you're my lady 
Oh, ohh yeah Damned if I do, damned if I don't 
Sometimes I will, sometimes I won't 
I can't take it Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down 
Sometimes I get rough, sometimes I get clowned
