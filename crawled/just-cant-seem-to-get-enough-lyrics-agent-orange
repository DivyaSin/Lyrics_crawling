It's like a form of addiction 
It's a fear that I just can't hide 
Although it seems like a gift from god 
It's a pain that I feel inside 
I know I've got to move quickly 
And I know I've got to do it right 
Always feeling reckless 
Always searching day and night 'cause I just can't seem to get enough 
I've tried - but it's just no use 
I just can't seem to get enough 
I've tried - but I just can't take any more abuse let me tell you something 
If I could, you know I'd sell my soul 
Every time I hear that sound 
You know I lose all self control 
Sometimes I feel like a hero 
Doomed to die in a raging war 
Sometimes it seems like it's over 
But I know there's got to be more
