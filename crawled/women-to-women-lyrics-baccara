You and i 
We love the same guy 
Don't it make you sad 
Don't it make you cry 
You and i 
Asked you to choose 
Someone must win 
And one of us has to loose Women to women 
Women to women to man 
Oh tell me something 
Something I don't understand 
Once in the lifetime 
Someone like him comes along 
Bringing you a new day 
Singing you a sweet song 
He'll hold in the palm of his hand 
Bringing you sunshine 
Singing you love songs 
Women to women to man Women to women 
Women to women to man But it's no I that command 
What in a lifetime 
Someone so big and so strong 
Bringing you 
Bringing you sunshine's 
He'll hold in the palm of his hand Bringing you laughter 
From now and after 
Women to women to man You and i 
We love the same guy 
So he will choose 
Who say goodbye 
Someone must stay 
So he'll decide 
Who walk away 
They're hurting inside Women to women 
Women to women to man 
Oh tell me something 
Something I don't understand 
Once in a lifetime 
Someone like him comes along 
Bringing you new day 
Singing you sweet song 
He'll hold you in the palm of his hand 
Bringing you sunshine 
Singing you love songs 
Women to women to man Women to women 
Women to women to man What in the life time 
Someone so big and strong 
Bringing you goodbye 
Bringing you sunshine
