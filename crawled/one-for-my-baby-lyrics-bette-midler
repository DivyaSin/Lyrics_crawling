Okay, and once again, here's Bette Midler {"Well, you know, when they asked me to come on and 
I can't believe it, the last, the last guest 
The last fool Mr. Carson will have to suffer gladly 
You are the wind beneath my wings 
Oh, well he is"} Quarter to three 
There's no one in the place except you and me 
So set 'em up, Joe 
Got a little story, I think you should know We're drinkin', my friend 
To the end of a sweet episode 
Make it one for my baby 
And one more for the road Got the routine 
So drop another nickel in the machine 
Oh, gee, I'm feelin' so bad 
Wish you'd make the music so dreamy and sad You could tell me a lot 
But it's not in a gentleman's code 
Let's make it one for my baby 
And one more for the road You may not know it but buddy you're a kind of poet 
And you've had a lot of things to say 
And when I'm gloomy, you always listen to me 
Until it's talked away Well, that's how it goes 
And John I know you're getting anxious to close 
So, thanks for the cheer 
I hope you didn't mind me, bending your ear For all of the years 
For the laughs, for the tears 
For the class that you showed Make it one for my baby 
And one more for the road 
That long, long road "Thank you, Bette, ah"
