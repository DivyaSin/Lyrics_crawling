With one more look at you 
I could learn to tame the clouds and let the sun shine through 
Leave a troubled past and I might start a new 
I'll solve the mysteries if you're the prize, refresh these tired eyes With one more look at you 
I might overcome the anger, that I've learned to know 
Find a peace of mind, I lost so long ago 
Your gentle touch has made me strong again, and I'll belong again For when you look at me 
I'm everything and more than I had dreamed I'd be 
My spirit feels a promise, I won't be alone 
We'll love and live more, love and live forever With one more look at you 
I'd learn to change the stars and change our fortunes too 
I'd have the constellations paint your portrait too 
So all the world might share this wondrous sight 
The world could end each night With one more look at you 
With one more look at you 
I want one more look at you 
Are you watching me now? Watch closely now Your eyes are like fingers 
Touching my body, arousing me so 
I'm riding the passion arising inside me 
How high can I go? You're comin' with me, I'm gonna show you how 
And when it's scary 
I won't look down 
Are you watching me now? Watch closely now I see the hunger arise in your eyes 
And it's urging me, urging me, urging me on 
Higher and harder and it's faster and farther 
Than I've ever gone Your pleasure is part of the secret of flight that I found 
When I feel like an eagle, my soul has no place on the ground 
Born out of madness, I'll double the danger with no net at all 
If you don't look away I'm secure, in the fact that you won't let me fall Watch closely now, are you watching me now? I'm the master magician, who'll help you escape 
From the lies you've been told 
When they're breaking your back, bring the last straw to me 
I'll turn straw into gold I break chains made of boredom that others have lived with for years 
I leave good news on doorsteps and laughs where there used to be tears 
I'm gonna need you later, when you're not around 
But I can take it, yeah, I won't look down Watch closely now, are you watching me now? 
Watch me now, are you watching me now? 
Are you watching me now
