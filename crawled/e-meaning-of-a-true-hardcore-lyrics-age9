I don't care what they say. 
Their prejudice won't change me. 
I do what I feel is right that's how I am, 
and I'll stay straight right till the end. 
I speak my mind, 
I don't talk shit. 
I use my mind not my fists. 
I live my life, 
I live my life strong. 
I define the meaning of a true hardcore. 
Strength of one don't test my will, 
my will is strong. 
San't change me. 
They try and they try but they can't changed me. 
They test my will, 
my will is strong. 
A strong will lies within us all. 
A straight path is an unbroken path. 
My broken path lies in the past. 
What I say is what I mean. 
I know too much to nave. 
I talk the talk, 
I walk the walk. 
I define the meaning of a true hardcore.
