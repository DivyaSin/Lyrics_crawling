coming down the dirt road through the town tonight 
there is a crowd around i can feel it breathe 
more than a thousand souls out in the night 
i get so blinded i can see smoke is rising from the fire that burns 
sky is purple and the water rise 
people talking quiet as they start to learn 
to see with their own eyes their lives and our lives different as any other 
my pain is your pain tell me, do you want to go under? you will feel it when the night starts burning 
feet shuffle on that day 
when we're going to find what we're going to be fighting 
come again 
you will feel it when the night starts burning 
makes you want to stay 
light will fill your eyes we got the seeds of life 
hidden in our hands 
blinded by ourselves though can't you see that 
we've got the seeds of life do you understand? 
and hear the calling you've got love though 
love we got inside 
it's time to open our eyes and really wonder 
and really wonder 
if it's enough for all we need in life 
can you take me back, can you take me back?
