i'm behind you sniffin out your trail 
i can smell you $weating while you fail to hypnotize 
rotten $kin $hedding from its $nake 
politician, nothing but a fake, lobotomized 
SO BRING IT TO ME 
SO I CAN WATCH YOU BLEED 
{ until the next time . . . } 
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO 
INFECT WITH YOUR DI$EA$E . tellin people what they want to hear 
all your pretty bull$hit in their ears you $pin and $ell 
give away so you can $teal 
getting paid to hide your real $elf, 
while you die in million dollar hell so throw the bone and kill your prey 
and send the hounds who feed on your decay 
push your face into the sand 
and pull the nail you dug into your hand
