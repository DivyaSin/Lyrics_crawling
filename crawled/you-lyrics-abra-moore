Hey, you, you are the one for me 
And you, you're making me feel all right 
And when you smile, I can't help it if I fall 
And when you speak to me like that 
I will answer every calling 'Cause we, we are the ones who can feel it 
And we, we're making it feel all right The way you go, love will follow 
Where you go, my love will follow you 
Where you go, love will follow, follow 
And you, yeah, my love will follow, follow 
And you, my love will follow, follow And you, you are the one for me 
And you, you're making me feel all right 
'Cause where you go love will follow 
Where you go, my love will follow you 
Where you go, love will follow, follow
