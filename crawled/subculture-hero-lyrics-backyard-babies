Hey, baby, you will rot in hell 
I'm so god damn sorry, I'm alive & well 
And sometimes you don't know 
Who I am when you're at my show 
And I've got a feeling this is suicide 
But, hey, Mr. Sunshine, I am ready to die 'Cause sometimes I believe 
That your opinion is my relief 
I saw your face on the TV 
Just like Mickey in 3-D 
But I know you can't see me now Subculture hero 
Subculture hero One dead sucker going down in flames 
He didn't get paid but at least he got laid 
But sometimes I don't know 
If you understand what I'm trying to do 
I saw your face on the TV 
Just like Mickey in 3-D 
But I know you can't see me 'Cause I'm a subculture hero 
Subculture hero I fell down and broke a head or two 
But yet still by 
Then all of a sudden I decided what to do 
Working overtime 
Good god damn I'm god damn good 
Standby for this famous guy 
And damn you God if you don't let me try 
To be somewhere high I saw your face on the TV 
Just like Mickey in 3-D 
But I know you can't see me I'm a subculture hero, something new 
Subculture hero, just like you 
Subculture hero
