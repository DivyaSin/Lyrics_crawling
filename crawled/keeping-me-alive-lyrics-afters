It's like I've never lived 
Before my life with you 
So much was missing here 
I never even knew 
I still picture the place we were 
When I fell into your world My heart is in you 
Where you go you carry me 
I bleed, if you bleed 
Your heart beats inside of me 
Youre keeping me alive I don't know why I feel this way 
But somethings right 
You're like the morning air 
Before the light arrives 
No more lonely and no more night 
No more secrets to hide My heart is in you 
Where you go you carry me 
I bleed, if you bleed 
Your heart beats inside of me 
Youre keeping me alive I'll hold you near 
Together, we'll never die 
Your love is keeping me alive 
Your love is keeping me alive, alive My heart is in you 
Where you go you carry me 
I bleed, if you bleed 
Your heart beats inside of me 
Youre keeping me alive 
Keeping me alive
