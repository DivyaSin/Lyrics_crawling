Moonchild Noontide 
They both at once woo the Midnight 
Kinglike Seaside 
Lucifer's emerald eyes glance 
Side by side in Fairyland's gold sand 
Infernal empire in good hand 
Ripe Peach of Love Beach 
Smiles aglow at the dead 
Cool souls Who'll lose 
Every lights for had gone to the bad 
Side by side in Fairyland's garden 
White and Black in much colours. See them! 
See them! Love them! 
You need 
All Fairylands of Men 
See them! Love them! 
You need 
All commandments of Ten 
Midnight at Noontide 
Slight ounce licks an ice-cream vendor 
Deep Blue Pinewood 
Like an old lonely bell peals a folk song 
Turquoise sword is sundering Our Sin 
Crimson Sun of Fairyland's shining...
