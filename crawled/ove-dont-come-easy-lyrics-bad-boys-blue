Words cannot explain how much you mean to me. 
I long to hear you say I'll be the one. 
Long to hear you say that you will take my hand. 
Tell me pretty baby. Can I be your man? 
Through many things and time this love has changed. 
You broke my heart I feel the burning pain. Love don't come easy. 
Everyday I wake, I hope it won't be long. 
Love don't come easy. Will you be my woman? I will be your man. 
Take me in your arms. So girl come back to me. 
Don't you know this love could be so real. 
When they call your name I feel a burning pain. 
Give me all your love and ease my pain. 
Behind those tears I cried for you. 
Now tell me baby what am I to do? Promised me the heavens and you gave me hell. 
Many dreams I have for you are real. 
Took my world and you turn it upside down. 
Tell me baby how am I to feel? 
You notice I'll come running back to you. 
So tell me baby what am I to do?
