I'd like to thank you all for having me 
In this village filled with tragedy 
This is something you won't wanna miss 
I swear it doesn't have to be like this Check these fools that ain't been checked 
Bless this food that ain't been blessed 
We'll stay true while you obsess 
With who knows who and what comes next Here's to the losers, the substance abusers 
The beaten and broken down but don't look now 
All the bluish skies are turning black There's a killer on the loose again 
Save me from this pool of blood I'm drowning in 
So be thankful for this day my friend 
At any given time it all could end Check these fools that ain't been checked 
Bless this food that ain't been blessed 
We'll stay true while you obsess 
With who knows who and what comes next Here's to the losers, the substance abusers 
The beaten and broken down but don't look now 
All the bluish skies are turning black [Incomprehensible] 
[Incomprehensible] Let's remember this day when we're sober again 
There's nothing that they can say 
That can ever take, take, take that away Here's to the losers, the substance abusers 
The beaten and broken down but don't look now 
All the bluish skies are turning black (Skies are turning black) 
Here's to the losers 
(Skies are turning black) 
Substance abusers 
(Skies are turning black) 
Here's to the losers
