I will meet you underwater. 
dressed in white. your eyes ablaze. 
tonight you'll sleep out on my couch while 
I lie in bed all night awake. 
a room away while l listen 
to you breathing in and out. 
and I wait. I started falling 
so long ago, when I met you. 
and oh, to hit rock bottom. 
you will know it when I do. I will meet you underwater. 
I'll let you kill me every day. 
but God I'm tired and I'm burning. 
can I be there when you rain. 
when you rain. it hurts so bad. 
it hurts so bad. 
can you make this go away?
