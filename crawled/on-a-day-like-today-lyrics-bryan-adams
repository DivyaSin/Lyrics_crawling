Free is all you gotta be 
Dream dreams no one else can see 
Sometimes ya wanna run away 
But ya never know what might be comin' round your way 
Ya ya ya On a day like today 
The whole world could change 
The sun's gonna shine 
Shine thru the rain 
On a day like today 
Ya never wanna see the sun go down 
Ya never wanna see the sun go down Somewhere there's a place for you 
I know that you believe it too 
Sometimes if you wanna get away 
All ya gotta know is what we got is here to stay 
All the way On a day like today the whole world could change 
The sun's gonna shine shine thru the rain 
On a day like today no one complains 
Free to be pure free to be sane 
On a day like today 
Ya never wanna see the sun go down 
Ya never wanna see the sun go down Free is all we gotta be 
Dream dreams no one else can see 
But ya never know what might be comin' for you and me 
Ya it's gonna be On a day like today
