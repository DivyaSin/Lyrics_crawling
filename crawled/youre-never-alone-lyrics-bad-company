I can't sleep tonight 
The Manhattan skyline keeps shining through 
I just call out your name 
And pray to God I make it home to you If there's such a thing as forever 
Then I want to spend the time with you You're never alone when you love someone 
Even when they're so far away 
You're never alone when you need someone 
Just close your eyes and drift away When you love someone I made you promises 
Did I let you down with those little white lies? 
You let me hold on to my shattered dreams 
And you never walked no damn(?) one step behind If there's such a thing as forever 
Then I want to spend the time with you You're never alone when you love someone 
Even when they're so far away 
You're never alone when you need someone 
Just close your eyes and drift away Heaven knows I'm a friend to you 
I brought my whole love around you 
Never want to let you slip away 
I wanna be the air that surrounds you 
And when I think what you wanna do 
I guess there's nothing left to say The night fades away 
Oh, I think of you as I face another day 
You see, tomorrow I'm coming home to you 
God only knows how I made a fool You're never alone when you love someone 
Even when they're so far away 
You're never alone when you need someone 
Just close your eyes and drift away You're never alone when you love someone 
Even when they're so far away 
You're never alone when you need someone 
Just close your eyes and drift away Baby drift away 
(You're never alone when you love someone) 
You're never alone, even when they're so far away 
When you love someone 
(You're never alone when you need someone) 
Just close your eyes and drift away 
You're never alone, you're never alone
