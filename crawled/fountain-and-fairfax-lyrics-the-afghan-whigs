Angel, I'm sober 
I got off that stuff 
Just like you asked me to 
Angel, come closer 
So the stink of your lies 
Sinks into my memory 
She said baby, forever, but I don't like to be alone 
So don't stay away too long 
Baby, forever, well it's Tuesday now 
I hear him breathing inside of her 
Let me drink 
Let me tie off 
I'm really slobbering now 
Let it stink 
Let it dry up 
It's impossible 
How? 
Angel, forever 
Don't you promise me what you cannot deliver 
Angel, together 
I'll be waiting for you on Fountain and Fairfax
