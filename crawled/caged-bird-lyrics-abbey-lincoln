The birds who live in cages 
never spread their wings 
They sit with ruffled feathers 
upon their tiny swings 
and speculate the birdseed 
and while away the day 
tuck their heads in feathers 
of colorful arrays I know why the caged bird sings 
a sweet and soulful song 
I know why the caged bird sings 
when everything seems wrong 
I know why the caged bird sings 
and flaps his tethered wings 
birds were made to fly away 
and birds were made to sing The birds who live in cages 
feel the morning sun 
shining through the window 
where the captain lives by gun 
and stretches forth his body 
and warbles for the day 
moves his head from side to side 
and listens for the way I know why the caged bird sings 
a sweet and soulful song 
I know why the caged bird sings 
when everything seems wrong 
I know why the caged bird sings 
and flaps his tethered wings 
birds were made to fly away 
and birds were made to sing
