My love don't comfort me. 
She toys with my sincerity. 
On that, I can depend. 
I've found that nothing's straight. My twisted mind is bent all out of shape, 
But you will come back, 
And you will live on. 
Indeed, I know, But you wouldn't lie when I told you to - 
Had to waste your time and tell the truth. 
This one is three; this is one is three. 
Indeed, I know, You got me figured out now. 
Now, we're both disappointed. 
What's done is now undone. 
Let's cut the line and have the action, 
In time, I will be able to give.
