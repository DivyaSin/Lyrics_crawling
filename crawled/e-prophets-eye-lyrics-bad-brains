The Prophets eye 
What did aya see 
The Prophets eye We know you sit there and see what's going on, 
and take a sigh 
Cause after all you done for them one still can't learn, 
nourish the land 
Well if you think it's easy to give up 
then why are we still trying 
Beefsteak to mistake don't beam me up Scotty 
Let the words of I and I mouth be acceptable 
in thy sight 
And the meditation of I and I, Oh Ras Tafari The Prophets eye 
The Prophets eye We know you sit there and see what's going on, 
and take a side 
Cause after all you done for them one still can't learn, 
nourish the land 
Yes they're theirs, there's a brighter side 
And we not going to stop till we find it, 
not going to stop till we reach 
Lord 
not going to stop till we reach Zion The Prophets eye 
What did aya see 
The Prophets eye Let the words of I and I mouth be acceptable 
in thy sight 
And the meditation of I and I, Oh Ras Tafari The Prophets eye 
The Prophets eye The Prophets eye 
The Prophets eye 
The Prophets eye
