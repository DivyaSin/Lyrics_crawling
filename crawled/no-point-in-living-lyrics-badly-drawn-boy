I don't live for the winter freeze 
I don't live for the summer breeze 
I don't care about any of these 
You know I can't help living without you I don't live for the summer breeze 
I don't live for the winter freeze 
I don't care about any of these 
You know I can't help living without you 
There's no point in living without you There's no point in living without you No point in living without you 
No point in living without your love We sang the tunes 
Still boxed in my mind 
You know I can't move 
No point in living without you 
No point in living without you 
No point in living without you I don't live for the summer breeze 
I don't care about any of these 
You know I can't help living without you 
No point in living without your love
