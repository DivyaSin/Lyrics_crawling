I met a girl named Faith 
She lied straight to my face 
One day she walked to the door 
I don't see Faith anymore Faith is walking out the door 
Hope doesn't live here anymore 
Love is all I need 
Love is all I need I met a girl named Hope 
She told me I had to cope 
One day she walked to the door 
I don't see Hope anymore Faith is walking out the door 
Hope doesn't live here anymore 
Love is all I need 
Love is all I need I met a girl named Love 
She gave me a turtledove 
One day I heard a knock at the door 
Love lives here forever more Faith is walking out the door 
Hope doesn't live here anymore 
Love is all I need 
Love is all I need Faith is walking out the door 
Hope doesn't live here anymore 
Love is all I need 
Love is all I need
