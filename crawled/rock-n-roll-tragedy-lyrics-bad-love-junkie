Cigarettes 
Whiskey from the bottle 
Scattered photographs from the pas 
tAnd on the "Rolling Stone" 
Faces of the Gods and Kings 
Looking down from their thrones 
They court meThe haunt me 
While I danceLike a moth draw to the flame 
I would rather burn alive than fade away 
They love me 
They kill me 
Before my time 
So the whole wide world can see 
It's just another rock n roll tragedy 'They New York Times 
Snaps a shot of people crying 
As the news hits the street 
Someone writes the book 
Fills it up with lies 
About the sex and all the drugs I took 
They hurt me 
They hold me while I dance 
Like a moth drawn to the flame 
I was born to burn alive not fade away 
Love me 
Kill me 
Before my time 
So the whole wide world can see 
He's just another rock n roll tragedy 
He's just another rock n toll tragedy 
He's just another rock n roll tragedy I close my eyes 
I don't want to wake up 
To my ordinary life 
my ordinary life 
my ordinary life 
my ordinary life 
my ordinary life 
my ordinary life 
I would rather be 
Just another rock n roll tragedy
