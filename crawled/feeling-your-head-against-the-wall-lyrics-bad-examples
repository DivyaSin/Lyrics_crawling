So this is not your golden year 
When you add up the blues and the greys 
And you're standing face to face with your fears 
Feeling your head against the wall 
So maybe you're not the golden child 
Just this once, your luck is not enough 
Oh, and no one that you ask can tell you why 
You're feeling your head against the wall Your brow is wet with blood and sweat 
Hoping that someday you'll see the sunshine streaming through 
Oh, and I wish I could tell you that this was the worst it could get 
Feeling your head against the wall No no no no no no no no no no 
It goes on and on and on into the endless night 
It will be over soon 
Through it goes on and on and on into the endless night 
It will be over soon 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...
