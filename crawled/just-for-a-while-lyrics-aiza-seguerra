Just for a while 
All that I want is a chance to be near you 
Just for a while 
All through the day 
All that I need is to see and to hear you 
I dream of how it must feel to embrace you 
In my heart I long to hold you 
Just for a while Refrain: 
I know deep within me 
That you and I, we are worlds apart 
That I never will have a part of your heart Chorus: 
Yet I go on to dream about you 
Dreamin all day for a chance to be near you 
Or just to feel you close and to kiss you 
Even just for a while 
And I go on and I pray that one day 
Love will be kind to me in someway 
But until then I know Ill have you 
In my dreams I know Ill keep you 
For a while I closed my eyes 
And I imagined that you are beside me 
I closed my eyes and I feel you inside me 
What I feel is as real as can be for a while 
(Repeat refrain) 
(Repeat Chorus)
