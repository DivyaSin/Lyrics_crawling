Breathe, 
I'm listening close to every word that you 
Speak, 
Don't try to blame the things that bring you down just 
See, 
I'm on your side and counting down the days to 
Be, 
Right beside you when you sleep and when you 
Dream 
Dream Leave, 
All of your rage behind and realise it's 
Me, 
Hold on before I'm gone 'cause one day we will 
Need, 
Someone to understand the things that make us 
Free 
Free
