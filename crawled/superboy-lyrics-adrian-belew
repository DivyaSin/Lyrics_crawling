(belew/fetters/nyswonger) I see you as a real live superboy 
Wide-eyed at a world brand new 
Can't wait to get your hands in the machinery 
Make me think there's nothing you won't do 
Welcome here, dear fearless superboy 
Never bother with the training wheel 
Off the sidewalk to the middle of the street 
Look ma, no hands, no feet You're on a roll, you can't relax 
A solid gold prize in your crackerjacks Fly little superboy I know you are a bonafide superboy 
Looking through me with those x-ray eyes 
No problem at the bottom of the ocean 
Blasting off for the open skies 
Welcome here, dear fearless superboy 
We hope it was a pleasant flight 
Touching base on the blue-green face 
Another trip at the speed of light Be patient son, we know you're bored, 
Living here amongst us dinosaurs Shine little superboy
