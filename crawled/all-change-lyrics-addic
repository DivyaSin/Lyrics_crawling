The trouble is the you think you've time 
Enough to waste enough to embrace 
Enough to let you just talk about what you will do Totally lost, fully undone 
How do you change 
What you've become? 
It's all change now Do the best you know 
How when desire ends 
Peace will come again 
So do it now, do it well Tomorrow all will have changed again 
Be awake be amazed 
Be a guest at the best parade
