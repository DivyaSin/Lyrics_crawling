That's when it hurts 
Yeah, oh, oh, yeah 
That's when it hurts, ooh You don't kiss me like you used to do 
You don't miss me, darling 
Darling, darling, darling when the night is through 
So I sit at home turn off the light, here comes the night That's when it hurts? I'm going downtown to Joey's place and I know that, darling 
I'm gonna walk right in and I'll see your face 
Yes, you'll be dancing with someone new, here comes the pain That's when it hurts? Then you're gonna see me sitting all alone, baby, at a corner table 
And I'll be sitting there smiling, honey, 
Sitting over there somewhere by myself 
Smoking a cigarette 
Then you're gonna feel that you'll have to come over 
And say something real nice to me 
Oh, baby, that's when my eyes will get wet Then I'll walk out the door and I'll walk a-back home 
Take the same street that we used to take when we walked alone 
Then I'll see your friends all pitying me 
Whoa, their sympathy That's when it hurts 
Oh, oh, oh, yeah 
That's when it hurts 
Yeah, yeah 
It hurts, it hurts, oh, yeah 
That's when it hurts 
Oh, oh, oh, yeah 
That's when it hurts 
Yeah, yeah 
It hurts, it hurts, oh, yeah
