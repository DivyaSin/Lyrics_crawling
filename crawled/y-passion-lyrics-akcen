I still got feelings you are my passion 
you are the one for me 
I still got feelings you are my passion 
you are the one for me can you, can you hear me say 
when I'm moving closer 
you keep going away 
'cause you're my guilty pleasure 
and you caught me so tight 
I wanna love you always 
let's melt into the night [CHORUS] 
don't let go 
don't run away love 
I still got feelings you are my passion 
don't let go 
don't run away love 
you are the one for me 
[x2] can you, can you see the flame 
that burns inside my body 
everytime you are here 
'cause you're the one I dream of 
everyday, the night 
don't give away my feelings 
and come into my life [CHORUS] 
don't let go 
don't run away love 
I still got feelings you are my passion 
don't let go 
don't run away love 
you are the one for me 
[x2] [CHORUS] 
don't let go 
don't run away love 
I still got feelings you are my passion 
don't let go 
don't run away love 
you are the one for me 
[x2]
