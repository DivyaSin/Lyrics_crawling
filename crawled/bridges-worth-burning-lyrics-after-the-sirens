One more rainy day serenade 
and i tend to fall apart 
when the summer shatters recklessly 
into masterpieces and melodies 
about the day she broke his heart 
into a million missing pieces... Well so much for the sunset, 
I tell myself the clouds 
would not be here if you were. 
And so much for forever; 
forever's almost never 
what we make it out to be. One more ever-after will fade 
and our friendship falls apart 
when your letters yellow helplessly 
into folds and creases and memories 
about the day you broke his heart 
into a million missing pieces... So much for the sunset baby 
So much for forever 
maybe you never were, 
you never were to me... Well so much for the sunset 
I tell myself the clouds 
would not be here if you were, 
but you aren't, and they are 
and they would, but you won't no, you won't...
