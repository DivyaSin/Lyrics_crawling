The party's over in the morning light 
My head is spinning lost my appetite 
Barking dog much too loud 
Chuck him a bone and get me out of this town Voices I hear I can't explain 
Those neon lights they hurt my brain 
Feeling no pain my body's numb 
From Hell's kitchen to Kingdom Come Not feeling happy not feeling sad 
Not feeling anything good or bad 
I'm not in Heaven I'm not in Hell 
This must be limbo now can't you tell Not feeling happy not feeling sad 
Not feeling anything good or bad 
I'm not in Heaven I'm not in Hell 
This must be limbo now can't you tell Lost in limbo we're just lost 
Lost in limbo Baby we're just lost 
Lost in limbo with nowhere to go The morning after is such a bore 
Can't even focus on the kitchen floor 
Telephone please don't ring 
want to forget about everything
