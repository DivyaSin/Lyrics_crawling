I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead 
I say, I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead 
To pick up me a tombstone, and be pronounced dead When I read your letter this morning baby, that was in your place in bed 
When I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed 
That's when I decided, that I would be better off dead The letter read, no use in you looking, or ever hoping to get me back 
No use, no use in looking for me baby, or ever hoping to get me back 
Because it's all over now baby, baby you can bet on that
