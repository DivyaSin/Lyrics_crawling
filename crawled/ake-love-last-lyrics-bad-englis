Now the sun is shifting through your life 
The hands of time are twisting to your days 
A captured moment in your kiss, like winter snow, it's gone, melted away There's a chapel on the edge of town 
Baby take my hand before they tear it down 
'Cause now we find nothing's what it seems 
Let me hold you close through these drivin' dreams 'Cause the world is turning much too fast 
And time won't wait, gotta make love last 
'Cause the fields are burning, and there's no returning 
Till the future finds the past, we gotta make love last, make love last Like a rose exploding in the sun, a precious time to live before it's gone 
Tears fall on the ocean from different skies 
Inside your kiss I wake and find the dawn In temporary ways we give, but eternally, our hearts will live 
For now we find nothing's what it seems 
You better run with me through these drivin' dreams 'Cause the highway's fading much too fast 
And time won't wait, we gotta make love last 
'Cause the fields are burning, and the season's turning 
Till the future finds the past, this time, we gotta make love last 'Cause the world is turning much too fast 
And time won't wait, we gotta make love last 
'Cause the fields are burning, and the season's turning 
Till the future finds the past, this time, we're gonna make love last 
We gotta make love last 'Cause the highway's fading, and the world is turning much too fast 
We gotta make love last, make love last
