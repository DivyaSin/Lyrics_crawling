God of unending grace 
I come to You on my face 
I need to hear You speak to me 
Won't You make me, new right now? God of omnipotent power 
Visit us in this hour 
And may we leave here changed 
Because we've met with You, God You've been more wonderful to me 
Than I could have ever imagined 
You've shown more love 
Than I could show in a thousand years And although it seems at times 
Like it all means nothing to me 
You gotta know that I love You 
You gotta know that I need You God of wisdom and love 
Settle down from above 
Give us all a taste of what 
Your Holy Spirit can do Time and time again we've betrayed 
But our debt's already been paid 
And all that leaves me wanting 
Is to live for You, God You've been more wonderful to me 
Than I could have ever imagined 
You've shown more love 
Than I could show in a thousand years And although it seems at times 
Like it all means nothing to me 
You gotta know that I love You 
You gotta know that I need You When the world crashes 
Down around me 
I know You'll be there to pull me 
Out from the rubble When my enemy surrounds 
And I call on Your name 
You'll be there to deliver me 
From my troubled soul You've been more wonderful to me 
Than I could have ever imagined 
You've shown more love 
Than I could show in a thousand years You've been more wonderful to me 
Than I could have ever imagined 
You've shown more love 
Than I could show in a thousand years You've been more wonderful to me 
Than I could have ever imagined 
You've shown more love 
Than I could show in a thousand years And although it seems at times 
Like it all means nothing to me 
You gotta know that I love You 
You gotta know that I need You You gotta know that I love You 
You gotta know that I need You 
You're more wonderful
