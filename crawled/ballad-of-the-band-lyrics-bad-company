Who is that band the're been raving about' 
Who is that band selling all the girls out' 
They've turned the music bus'ness inside out 
What is their name' It's on the tip of my tongue 
You know the ones you must have heard the song 
It's played a racket all day long The critics acclaimed 'em said you boys are the end 
You're gonna take over from our last weeks trends 
You're gonna be huge once your advance to spend 
Sonny watch your money cause now baby you're in rock 'n' roll Well nobody's has heard' em till an hour ago 
Well now they're livin' out on Malibu Beach 
They got luxury homes and toilets with phones 
But a knighthood is still out of reach 
It can't be bad I've heard the woman are rife 
Hope they ain't dump though and get sued by a wife 
And end up paying for the rest of their life Sonny watch your money cause now baby you're in rock 'n' roll 
Sonny watch your money cause now baby you're in rock 'n' roll 
Sonny watch your money cause now baby you're in rock 'n' roll
