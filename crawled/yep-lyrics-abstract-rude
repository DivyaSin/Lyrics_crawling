Yep! 
That ATUY2K, here. 
Up and do it on my mass men affiliates. 
Now, vibes. 
You like that? All we gotta do is Record the song and tweak the mix 
Compile the album, go down the list 
Some hit some miss, that risk you take 
One hit, you rich, that dream you make Ya cash advance, for master dat 
If you have the chance, don't slack on wax 
Get radio spins, from shakin' they hands 
When you read they palms, they made you spend It's sold not told, go platinum gold 
Pay back what's owed, whether fast or slow 
Be black and bold, just have some soul 
Many lack the flow, only half of whole (Chorus) 
I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn 
People not open never fall asleep 
Yep! 
I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn 
People not open never fall asleep 
I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn Hip hop (Hip hop) 
Hip hop, if it were not for you, I'd probly Walk the street, carry clocks and heat 
Be on some ill s**t that you would not believe 
Maybe a cat thief, givin' you grief, family beef 
Instead I use the inner-eye energy and chi That all seems simplified for you and me 
Though we hardcore unorthodox mass ministry (Yep!) 
So my folks is loc's, all my dogs is hyped 
You for sure got jokes, all talk with a mic You lost your stripes, ghetto pass revoked 
Don't let cash get low, can't go back no mo' 
In the game there's pain, small fries big names 
Some die in vain, it's a cryin' shame (Chorus) 
Follow instructions, don't lose the context 
Follow instructions, don't lose the context 
Yep! 
Follow instructions, don't lose the context All we gotta do is Collect the wards, show respect on tour 
Don't neglect the floor, to the top we soar 
Dear God it bumps, if you've got the humps 
Speakers in your trunk, and you're blazin' skunk And you're diggin' the vibe with me and Tribe Unique 
Up to the highest peak, public outreach 
See what works for you may not work for me 
I give 'em the same feelin' of our first LP You want work released, I move merchandise 
Yeah you took that heat, was it worth the price 
Many hurt themselves, helps they record sales 
End up next in jail, makin' threats and bail Be a musical person, you're confused and you're searchin' 
You know danger is lurkin', you'll be hurtin' for certain 
Many chase the lights, but they game ain't tight 
Coulda sunk the shot, but they aim wa'nt right (Chorus) 
I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn 
Follow instructions, don't lose the context 
Yep! 
I thought I oughtta tell you, better yet warn Powerful artistic inspirational new tunes
