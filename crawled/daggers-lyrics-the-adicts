Well I just found out 
Looks can kill 
There's no doubt 
Looks can kill 
She didn't have to break my heart 
She didn't have to tear my emotions apart 
I thought that I turned to stone 
I felt my blood run so cold 
She did it but I don't know why 
Why did she give me the evil eye 
Well I just found out 
Looks can kill 
There's no doubt 
Looks can kill 
She cut me down to size 
Cut me with her steely eyes
