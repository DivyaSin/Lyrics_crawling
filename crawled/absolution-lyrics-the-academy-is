case is closed, you're back into focus 
the jury's out, you're closing in 
this battle of mind over matters spent 
this scar, this scar is not permanent 
choices or chances, or what sinks in water 
your secret's out, what you held within 
you've found your plague, your cancer, stop 
i bet you've got something clever 
this house is caving in 
your last words, caught trembling 
decisions, make decisions for your fate 
your choice is the chance that you have to take 
burn, stop, your time is up 
you've found all of the answers 
so take a breath and end this chapter 
i'll bring the fire if you bring the water 
face to the grave, will the killer be saved 
saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life 
hero be safe from the killer you made 
saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life 
case is closed, you're back into focus 
the jury's out, you're closing in 
this battle of mind over matters spent 
this scar, this scar, rising the judge screams 
"the courtroom is in order, you bring the victim, and we choose the martyr!" 
taking time to make it up, i can't hear you scream 
this house is caving in 
your last words, caught trembling 
decisions, make decisions for your fate 
your choice is the chance that you have to take 
burn, stop, your time is up 
you've found all of the answers 
so take a breath and end this chapter 
i'll bring the fire if you bring the water 
face to the grave, will the killer be saved 
saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life 
hero be safe from the killer you made 
saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life 
from this point on hear no evil, speak no tongues 
and the rhythms of past lovers come together or not at all 
from this point on hear no evil, speak no tongues 
and the riddles don't buy onto one 
burn quick, sink slow, your heart grows colder than regret 
your burden stone 
your heart grows colder, stillbeat, weak, and frozen 
face to the grave, will the killer be saved 
saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life 
hero be safe from the killer you made 
saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life
