I'm not staying, I'm not staying around 
I'm not staying, I'm not staying around 
How did you get get get, so down 
I cannot pick you up, I cannot even pick up myself 
You're only happy when you're, mad at the world 
How can I stay mad at you 
Count the scars on your skin 
A cry for help, or a cry for attention 
I'm not staying, I'm not staying around 
I cannot pick you up, when nothing is ever good enough 
You're only happy when you're, mad at the world 
How can I stay mad at you 
You're only happy when you're, mad at the world 
How can I stay mad 
It always has to go this way 
You thrive on conflict, you live to complain 
Tears of a crocodile, advertise your suicide 
Your half empty cup, runneth over 
Your scarred wrists, a child's fists 
You're only happy when you're, mad at the world 
How can I stay mad at you 
You're only happy when you're, mad at the world 
How can I stay mad at you 
Can I stay mad at you
