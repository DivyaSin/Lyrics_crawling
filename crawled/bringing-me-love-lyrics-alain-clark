I can think of a thousand reasons 
You could say bye bye I'm leaving 
And baby girl I could never blame ya 
If you walked off, see you later 
And I know that I haven't been perfect 
When the truth is you're more than worth it 
Even I recognize I blew it 
girl I don't know how you do it You keep bringing me love, you keep bringing me love 
Love, love, love 
No matter what I do 
you keep bringing me love, you keep bringing me love 
Love, love, love I can hear what your friends are saying 
There's no way girl he ain't changing 
I ain't saying that they're all wrong 
But I'm glad that you feel I'm the one you want And I get caught up sometimes in my work 
my phone, my friends, my music 
I know most girls would lose it 
Still don't know how you do it You keep bringing me love, you keep bringing me love 
Love, love, love 
Said you keep bringing me love 
you keep bringing me love, you keep bringing me love 
Love, love, love And girl I wonder if I still deserve it 
The way I hurt ya 
The way I do you sometimes 
And I don't know what it was 
but I must have done something right 
for you to be here and to want me in your life, babygirl You keep bringing me love, you keep bringing me love 
Love, love, love 
But you keep bringing me baby 
You keep bringing me love, you keep bringing me love 
Love, love, love I don't understand it baby 
But you keep bringing me love, you keep bringing me love 
I don't deserve it baby 
love, love, love 
Still I must have done something right 
you keep bringing me love 
you keep bringing me love 
You keep bringing me love 
love, love, love I don't know what I did, but I must have been right 
I don't know what I did, but I must have been right
