It was all fun between us 
Now I pick up the pieces 
And I fell in the deepest 
In her cavern of secrets I would tell her that I love her 
In a romance so divine 
And if you didn't ever get to see her 
Gypsy love you'll never find We're gonna drink some tequila 
Already know that you need some 
Let it sink in between us 
All around let it heal ya Dancing, flowing under moonlight 
Eyes and lips as sweet as wine 
But when the night really started swinging 
Gypsy love left me behind We're gonna drink some tequila 
Already know that you need some 
Let it sink in between us 
All around let it heal ya I had always thought she loved me 
But she had to say goodbye 
And if you ever see her you'll be smiling 
But you'd better think it twice
