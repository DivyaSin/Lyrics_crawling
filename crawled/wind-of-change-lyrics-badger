The walker may get to where he wants to go 
He may lose his stride on the way 
In boots made of leather 
Although well put together 
I don't believe a word he has to say 
I don't believe we can make it pay The runner, you may think he'd make it 
With his lightning feet and all those bursts of speed 
He's so quick to take his chances 
So smooth he almost dances 
But he's chained like a dog on a lead 
Chained like a dog on a lead Flying over mountains on a wind of change 
Sifting over valleys of a timeless dawn 
The flyer is a free man 
Although he ain't no he-man 
You'll find he don't need your strength at all Although I hear you callin' 
It's no use I'm free fallin' 
Down the wall The runner, you may think he'd make it 
With his lightning feet and all those bursts of speed 
He's so quick to take his chances 
So smooth he almost dances 
But he's chained like a dog on a lead 
Chained like a dog on a lead Flying over mountains on a wind of change 
Sifting over valleys of a timeless dawn 
The flyer is a free man 
Although he ain't no he-man 
You'll find he don't need your strength at all
