Out of money 
Out of cash, man 
It's the only thing that makes the world go round 
I need diamonds 
I need gold, man 
Cause I can't make a scene without the green Don't come telling me that love is the priority 
I'm broke as hell, man 
I need a wishing well, man 
Born with a spell, man 
I love that smell, man I got no reason to lie 
I need cash or I will die 
I got no reason to lie I can't control it 
I just want to hold it 
Cause it will make me feel that I'm a man 
So give me money 
I said, give me money, man 
'Cause I don't care as long as I'm in command Don't come telling me that it is just an enemy 
I'm broke as hell, man 
I need a wishing well, man 
Born with a spell, man I got no reason to lie 
I need cash or I will die 
I got no reason, I got no reason to lie I'm broke as hell, man 
I need a wishing well, man 
Born with a spell, man 
I love that smell, man 
I don't want to dwell, man 
Let's go to hell, man I got no reason to lie 
I need cash or I will die 
I got no reason, I got no reason to lie Don't come telling me love is the priority 
Everything is blue 
And don't you see how it's killing me
