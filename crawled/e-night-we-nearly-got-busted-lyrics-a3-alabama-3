undercover men on every corner of their property 
Jack he just took Jane by the hand 
he said, "come over here awhile honey, 'cause tonight 
I'm gonna take you right back 
'cause you remember that night? 
we used to feel so fine" the night we nearly got busted 
got down on our knees

Jane, all those thrills they started to spill all out all over 
she said she could, she could hear 'em talkin in the hall 
an'gonna, 
Jack just used to fill up that broken cup 
he swore he saw 'em looking through the holes in the motel wall 
he said, "hey, baby, we got time to kill, 
eat another goddamn pill,

'cause I believe our ship is comin in tonight 
and I feel so fine I'm gonna 
spin out another tale of sweet testimony now
