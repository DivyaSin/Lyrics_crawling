My baby knows me 
The good, bad, and gross things I never like to tell 
And those places deep inside 
Those shameful retreats of mind 
That she can always seem to find Oh she knows all the roads I am prone to wander 
She knows all the rocks I've been crawling under 
She knows all the places I can be found 
She knows her way around My baby loves me 
Despite the ugly words I throw her way 
And she still wins every fight 
No matter if she's right 
She sees right through me every time Oh she knows all the roads I am prone to wander 
She knows all the rocks I've been crawling under 
She knows all the places I can be found 
She knows her way around I wouldn't have it another way 
She calms my fears and keeps me safe 
When someone gets you it gets you sane 
It's good to know that I am known She knows all the roads I am prone to wander 
She knows all the rocks I've been crawling under 
She knows all the places I can be found 
She knows her way around She knows all the roads I am prone to wander 
She knows all the rocks I've been crawling under 
She knows all the places I can be found 
She knows her way around Yeah, she knows her way around
