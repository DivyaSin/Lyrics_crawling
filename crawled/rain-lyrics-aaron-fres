(Chorus x2) 
Just let the rain fall down down down 
All the all the way down down down 
Let the rain fall down down down 
On her (Verse) 
Everything was alright, alright 
Everything was all good, yea 
You was always by my side, by my side 
And I would never be good yea 
All the kissing and hugging, wish we didn't do that 
'Cause you tell me how we hit and now you're runnin right back 
Girl I can't take this no more 
So I guess I gotta let the rain pour (Pre-Chorus) 
I thought of telling that your boyfriend ain't real 
But baby who don't tag a feel 
I'm just sayin you already noticing 
Forgive me if I'm wrong (Chorus x2) 
Just let the rain fall down down down 
All the all the way down down down 
Let the rain fall down down down 
On her (Verse) 
So why you callin me now? 
I put the phone on vibrate so I wouldn't hear a sound but uh 
To see your picture come up 
My heart single but my friends seem to give up 
And I'm like... 
I wish we didn't start as friends 
That way this relationship would be much easier to end 
And I'm sorry 
But no need to pretend 
I could find a next girl, give my love once again (Pre-Chorus) 
I thought of telling that your boyfriend ain't real 
But baby who don't tag a feel 
I'm just sayin you already noticing 
Forgive me if I'm wrong (Chorus x6) 
Just let the rain fall down down down 
All the all the way down down down 
Let the rain fall down down down 
On her
