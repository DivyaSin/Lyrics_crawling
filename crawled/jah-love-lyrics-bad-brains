It's not the clothes that you wear, 
It's not the style of your hair, 
It's not the way that you walk, 
It's not the way that you talk. It's Jah, Jah-Jah love, 
Jah, Jah-Jah love. It's not the clothes that you wear, 
It's not the way that you walk, It's Jah, Jah, Jah-Jah love. It's not the clothes. 
It's not the way. Jah-Jah love. Jah, Jah-Jah love. It's Jah, Jah love, 
Jah, Jah love. Not the clothes that you wear, 
It's not the style of your hair, 
It's not the way that you walk, 
It's not the way that you talk. It's Jah, Jah-Jah love, 
Jah love leading the way. 
Jah, Jah-Jah love, 
Jah love leading the way. 
Jah, Jah-Jah love, 
Jah love leading the way.
