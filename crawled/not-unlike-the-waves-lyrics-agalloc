Aurora swims in the ether 
Emerald fire scars the night sky 
Amber streams from Sol 
Are not unlike the waves of the sea 
Nor the endless horizon of ice 
Aurora swims in the ether 
Emerald fire paints the twilight 
Heidrun bleeds the golden nectar 
For the raising sun and the moon 
The midnight wolves who watch over the dawn 
Solstafir!!!
