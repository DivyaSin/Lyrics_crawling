I'm used to being in control 
To being wanted and never let go 
I am used o being by myself 
And never needing any help 
And never needing someone else 
Never thought anyone would change this 
Until I felt your strange kiss 
'Cause baby [Chorus] 
Baby you make me tremble 
You make me tremble, tremble inside 
When you touch me I tremble 
Touch me I tremble, I'm open wide I must admit I'm liking this 
And once you've started, I can't quiet 
There's fire in your fingertips 
And in the way you touch my lips 
And in the way our bodies fit 
Now I'm feeling so desperate 
For someone I've just met 
'Cause baby- [Chorus] Can you read my mind, baby? 
How do you find a way to make me fall apart? 
You make my heart go wild Never thought anyone would change this 
Until I felt your strange kiss 
'Cause baby [Chorus]
