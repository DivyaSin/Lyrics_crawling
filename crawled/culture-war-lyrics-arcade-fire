Now the future's staring at me 
Like a vision from the past 
And I know these crumbs they sold me 
They're never going to last Though we know the culture war 
We don't know what it's for 
But we've lived a southern strategy 
But no, it's never going to last 
So keep it in the past These are different times that we're living in 
These are different times 
Now the kids are growing up so fast 
They're paying for our crimes You left while I was sleeping 
You said it's damning 
Oh, I've read a little Bible 
You see what you want to see Oh, we know the culture war 
We don't know what it's for 
But we've lived your southern strategy 
We know it's never going to last 
So keep that shit in the past These are different times that we're living in 
Because these are different times 
Now the kids are growing up so fast 
They're paying for our crimes These are different times that we're living in 
These are different times 
Now the kids are growing up so fast 
They're paying for our crimes The dominoes, they never fell 
Our bodies they still burn 
I throw my hand into the fire 
But still I never learn 
Will I ever learn? These are different times 
Now the kids are growing up so fast 
Paying for our crimes We'll be soldiers for mommy and dad 
In your culture wars 
We'll be soldiers for mommy and dad 
Don't know what it's for We're soldiers now 
In the culture war 
We're soldiers now 
But we don't know what it's for We're soldiers now 
In the culture war 
We're soldiers now 
But we don't know what it's for So tell me, what's it for? You want it? You got it 
Here's your culture war 
You want it, now you got it 
So tell me, what's it for? You want it? You got it 
Here's your culture war 
You want it, now you got it 
So tell me what's it for? Yeah tell me, what's it for?
