I was nearly a soul getting ready to go 
Having one last talk with my maker 
He said you're going to earth for better or worse 
We'll see you back here sooner or later So I said to him, as I spread my wings 
Would you do one thing for me Would you build me a girl from all over the world 
I promise I will always adore you 
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California 
Brazilian walk, hair from New York, pretty Parisian curls 
Build me a girl 
Build me a girl Well the days went by 
Wondering why, why it was I hadn't found her 
I was staring at eyes 
Smiling at smiles 
Still I was none the wiser And you know I don't 
Don't mean to impose 
But I thought we had a deal You would you build me a girl from all over the world 
I promise I will always adore you 
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California 
Brazilian walk, hair from New York, pretty Parisian curls 
Build me a girl 
Build me a girl So calling all woman who fit this description 
If I'm what you're missing 
Then please just listen to the wind 
The clouds they're all screaming out, 
They're trying to bring you to me 
So please don't shut them out 
Because there is a lady who is made for me 
Yes, there is a lady who's been made for me Cause I said build me a girl from all over the world 
I promise I will always adore you 
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California 
Brazilian walk, hair from New York and pretty Parisian curls 
Build me a girl Build me a girl from all over the world 
I promise I will always adore you 
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California 
Brazilian walk, hair from New York and pretty Parisian curls 
Build me a girl
