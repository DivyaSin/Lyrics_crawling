And as I introspect, 
I see the hate. 
I feel the pain. 
Why do you invade me, Tell me my life is a mess? 
I don't deserve this. 
I try so hard. 
I try for me. I'm trying everyday. 
Why can't I be left alone? 
I want you off my back. 
And it's everyday and everyone. Why don't you leave me alone? 
You don't even stop to think that I've got problems. 
I've got troubles. 
I've got worries of my own. You just try to change me, 
Make me another clone. 
That just don't make sense. 
If you ask me, That's ignorance. 
By making me the same, 
You say the world don't need change. 
And it's everyday and everyone. Why don't you leave me alone? 
I want you off my back. 
You patronize. 
You tell me my whole life's a lie. You take away my right to life, 
And as if you're not satisfied, 
You change my name. 
You change my face. Make me part of your human race. 
I don't want your hate. 
I don't want your pain, 
Or anything you do ordain. You tell me this. 
You tell me that. 
I told you I don't live like that. 
You order me. 
I order back I want you off my back!
