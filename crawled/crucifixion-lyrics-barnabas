My God, my God! Why hast thou forsaken Me? 
Be not far from Me, for trouble is near 
For bulls have surrounded Me, they open wide their mouths at Me 
I am poured out like water, all my bones are out of joint 
My heart is like wax, melted within Me 
Dogs have surrounded Me, and nailed my hands and feet 
I can count every one of my bones, they look and curse and stare at Me Mary, why do you weep? For now you see its Me 
I've risen from the dead; the others shall come and see 
God gave me the victory over satan and this world 
I hold the keys to death and hell, proclaim my name to all the world
