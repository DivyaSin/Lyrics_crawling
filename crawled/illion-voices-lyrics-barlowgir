Tell me who'd have thought that we would be so controversial 
And stand up against the normal 
Are we too outspoken, loud and messing up the comfortable 
Well, we've been messed up also How can we be silent 
When a fire burns inside of us? 'Cause we're a million strong and getting stronger still 
They'll remember we were here 
With a million voices breaking silence 'till 
They'll remember we were here We were made to start the riot, take on the impossible 
And we will slay the giants 
We are done with fake religion fighting now to find the movement 
Won't stop 'till we find it How can we be silent 
When a fire burns inside of us? We're a million strong and getting stronger still 
They'll remember we were here 
With a million voices breaking silence 'till 
They'll remember we were here We're a million strong and getting stronger still 
They'll remember we were here 
With a million voices breaking silence 'till 
They'll remember we were here We're a million strong and getting stronger still 
They'll remember we here 
With a million voices breaking silence 'till 
They'll remember we were here 
They'll remember we were here You will remember 
Yes, you'll remember 
You will remember 
Yes, you'll remember
