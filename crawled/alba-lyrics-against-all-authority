Black beans on the stove, malta in my hands 
Tears in Alba's eyes as she dreams of a far away land 
"I've been stripped of my country, I've been spit on by my race" 
I said "It'll be okay!" as I wiped a tear from her face 
And she said "No quieroir la mentira que vivo aqui!" 
"Yo quiero volver a mi pais!" 
"You'll never know the pain that I feel inside 
I've been stripped of my country and robbed of my pride 
I don't know where I'm gonna go but I don't belong here!"
