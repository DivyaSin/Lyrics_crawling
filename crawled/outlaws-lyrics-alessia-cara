Run, run like the devil's behinds us 
Run to where no one can find us 
Be my accomplice to my crime 
Oh baby 
Run, run cause we're guilty as sin 
Run 'cause we know we won't win 
We know together we kill time You'll never face a judge without me 
You'll never battle the gavel alone 
And if they lock us away 
Then I'll be still here 
Proudly waiting to kill more time, with you We'll be outlaws 
We'll take on the world 
We'll be outlaws Run, run like you never did 
'Cause they found the evidence 
And they found your fingerprints 
All on me and baby run 
Run like your life depends on it 
Let's make forever in this moment 
Tell me you love me again, oh again 
And I would waste away without you 
You're the shine into my star 
I'd be searching till I found you 
Wherever you are you are We'll be outlaws 
Partners in crime 
We'll take on the world together 
I'm Bonnie you can be Clyde 
We'll be outlaws 
You and me 
They'll never understand the honor 
Among these thieves You'll never face a judge without me 
You'll never battle the gavel alone 
And if they lock us away 
Then I'll be still here 
Proudly waiting to kill more time 
With you 
Oh with you 
With you 
With you We'll be outlaws 
Partners in crime 
We'd take on the world together 
I'm Bonnie you can be Clyde 
We'll be outlaws 
You and me 
They'll never understand the honor 
Among these thieves 
We'll be outlaws
