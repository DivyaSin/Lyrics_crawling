And I am all alone. 
There is no one here beside me. 
And my problems have all gone, 
There is no one to deride me. But you got to have friends the feeling's of so strong. 
You got to have friends to make the day last long. I got some friends but they're gone 
Someone came and took them away 
And from the dusk till the dawn here is where I'll stay. Standing at the end of the world boys 
Waiting for my new friends to come. 
I don't care if I'm hungry or poor, 
I'm gonna get some of them.
