Never knew a boy like you 
You don't give up 
Wouldn't stop at anything to give my love 
Told me I was everything your dreaming of But I thought you weren't my type 
Now I believe in love at second sight [Chorus] 
Got me you got me where you want me 
I'm yours and nothing's gonna stop me 
Got me you got me where you want me 
I'm your girl 
Got me you got me where you want me 
Falling for you, you finally caught me 
Got me you got me where you want me 
I'm your girl Wasted time on boys who did not treat me right 
I can count on your devotion day and night 
Thank god that you finally made me realise The only one I need 
Was standing right there waiting patiently [Chorus] Cause when I look into your eyes 
Something inside just feels right 
I've never loved a love so real so true 
And that's all because of you [Chorus]
