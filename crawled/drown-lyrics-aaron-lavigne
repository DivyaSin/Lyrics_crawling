Its getting harder each day. You're not smiling too often 
With a weight on your chest and a nail in the coffin 
You try to express that the best is lost and you're looking for something better 
While traces of light fade out of sight 
From the crack in your boat and the red blue sky 
You think home and wonder as you choke and go under 
Would you throw me a life jacket please? Don't' run away without me 
Don't leave it all behind 
With an effortless smile, stay for a while and tell me everything else will be fine 
Hoping that you're gonna save my life Just don't let me drown 
Save me before you go To hate myself around you is to hate the things about you 
I don't understand what you were thinking or 
How you thought that this was fine 
Now I'm breathing alone but I'm breathing alright 
I'm gonna have to find my way home tonight without you 
Without you, tonight 
Counting on you still to save my life 
Can you save it? 
Can you save it or... Will you let me drown, my love? 
Would you let me drown, mylove? 
Come and rescue me, my love. 
Cause I'm begging you, my love. 
Don't let me drown my love. 
Would you let me drown, my love? 
Come and rescue me, my love 
cause I'm fading fast, my love I might not make it out this time 
I might not make it out this time alive 
But you know what, my love? 
This time's for me, my love. 
This time's for me, my love 
My love Just don't let me drown 
Save me before you go Don't let me drown, my love. 
Would you let me drown my love? 
Come and resucue me my love
