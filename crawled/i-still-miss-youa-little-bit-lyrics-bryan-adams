you said you always keep me happy 
you said you always be true 
you said you always keep me warm at night 
i didn't know that be someone else there too 
But i still miss you... a little bit 
don't mind me, i'll get over it 
learn to live, live to love another day 
i'll be my oldself in a week or two 
until then i'll be sad and blue 
yes i admit, i still miss you... a little bit 
you said you always be my lover 
you said you be with me till the end 
you said we'll always be together 
i wasn't count on you sleeping with my friend 
But i still miss you... a little bit 
don't mind me, i'll get over it 
learn to live, live to love another day 
i'll be my oldself in a week or two 
until then i'll be sad and blue 
yes i admit, i still miss you... a little bit
