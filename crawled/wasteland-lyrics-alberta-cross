We're apart of something new 
And you can hide away 
You can shake the state 
Give me something to pursue 
To ease my mind a bit 
When you tried to quit 
Don't turn your heart to something blue 
To give a high away 
With nothing to replace 
We're apart of something new 
Don't matter where you stand 
We are apart of wasteland If lack time 
It's unbelievable 
Into new life 
It's undeniable 
Time to let down 
The city goes 
Time to let down 
Time to let down It's every bodies wasteland 
Kicking from the cradle 
It's every bodies wasteland 
Falling from the fable 
Wasteland Don't give in 
Don't lose control 
You outta admit 
But we're apart of it 
Then you turned on your soul 
No matter what you planed 
We're apart of wasteland If lack time 
It's unbelievable 
Into new life 
It's undeniable 
Time to let down 
The city goes 
Time to let down 
Time to let down It's every bodies wasteland 
Kicking from the cradle 
It's every bodies wasteland 
Falling from the fable 
When everything drifts away 
You always let yourself down 
It's every bodies wasteland 
Kicking from the cradle 
Wasteland If you lack time 
It's unbelievable 
It's time to let down 
It's time to let down It's every bodies wasteland 
Kicking from the cradle 
It's every bodies wasteland 
Falling from the fable 
When everything drifts away 
You always let yourself down 
It's every bodies wasteland 
Kicking from the cradle 
Wasteland
