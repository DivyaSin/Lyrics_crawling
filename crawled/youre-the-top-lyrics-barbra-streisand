At words poetic I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best 
Instead of getting it off my chest 
To let 'em rest unexpressed 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you how great you are 
You're the top - you're the Coliseum. 
You're the top - 
mmm? you're the Louvre museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss. 
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeare sonnet, You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile - You're the tower of Pisa. 
You're the smile - on the Mona Lisa. 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop. 
But if baby I'm the bottom, you're the top. You're the top, you're Mahatma Ghandi. 
You're the top - you are Napoleon brandy. 
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain. 
You're the National Gallery, 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You are sublime, you're a turkey dinner. 
You're the time - the time of the Derby winner. 
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop. 
But if baby I'm the bottom, you're the top, top. Steve, there is something I got to tell ya.. 
What is it Judy? 
Well, umm? You're the top (I am?) - mmm You're a Wardof's cellar 
Oh No, no let me say it 
You're the top (me too?) - You're a Berlin ballad You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire 
(Actually I don't dance very well) 
You're an O'Neill drama, you're Whistler's Mother - 
Mama (oh), You're Camembert. 
You're a rose, (mmm. sweet) 
You're Inferno's Dante. 
You're the nose - watch it!I mean 
Whatwhatwhawha what- on the great Durante.That's better 
I'm the lazy lout who is just about to storm Let's not storm 
But if baby I'm the bottom, 
She's the one for me 
And I've got 'I'm 
Coz if baby I'm the bottom, 
You're the top.
