Beat by beat as Becky falls to sleep 
She sits in her electric chair and watches the TV. 
And its so quiet here in tonight, she looks skinny in the light, 
In her under wire her face so fair, shes higher than a kite. 
She says: "well, what about me; am I dying silently? 
Have you ever wanted anything so bad you couldnt see?" (Chorus) 
No oh oh ; 
no oh oh not me; 
no oh oh... 
I dont wanna be on TV And the man down at the TV station, cracks his knuckles bare. 
Hes starin at a woman, she is starin back at him. 
You can cut the tension with a knife; were expecting rain tonight. 
Theres a weather system blowing in from Santa Ana all night. 
She thinks: "well what about me? So what, you're on TV? 
I dont care about your pompous ass, I care about this baby." No oh oh ; 
no oh oh not me; 
no oh oh... 
I dont wanna be on TV Everyone in this city seems to take it like a drug. 
Sit up all night, faces so white, they just cant get enough. 
And the shows are all the same, and theres something I cant name. 
The snickering on this flickering screen, the noise numbing my brain. 
So I think: "Well, what about me? Will I just die silently? 
With all these walls and bars and endless whores just dying next to me? No oh oh ; 
no oh oh not me; 
no oh oh... 
I dont wanna be on TV 
No oh oh ; 
no oh oh not me; 
no oh oh; 
no oh oh...
