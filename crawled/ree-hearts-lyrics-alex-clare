Was grey autumn day, I was under paid 
Making minimum wage 
Now I got some money, honey 
You're a lucky charm that came my way 
Gonna work, gonna save, 
Gonna sell it all up for you and me 
Need to build a home 
Gotta make a house, for just we three One heart 
Soon became two 
Now there's three hearts beating 
Under my roof 
One heart 
Soon became two 
Now there's three hearts beating 
Under my roof When I saw your face, with such grace 
Hope my kids will look the same 
I never had no one 
Now I got you and another one the way! 
Yes a traveling heart 
Chasing cars, girl we have gone so far 
Soon we'll have a home, 
With a fridge and a porch and a great big old backyard One heart, (one heart) 
Soon became two 
Now there's three hearts beating 
Under my roof 
One heart, soon became two 
Now there's three hearts beating 
Under my roof One heart 
Soon became two 
Now there's three hearts beating 
Under my roof 
One heart 
Soon became two 
Now there's three hearts beating 
Under my roof One heart 
Soon became two 
Now there's three hearts beating 
Under my roof 
Under my roof (hoo hoo hoo hoo) 
Under my roof (hoo hoo hoo hoo) 
Under my roof (hoo hoo hoo hoo)
