Dear Paul oh my old friend 
I always liked you but you always liked to go 
I loved you from the classroom window 
But you were busy making girls like me miserable 
Chasing the high school girls Dear Paul I was changed 
My very first addiction was named after you 
And I stared and I shed some tears 
Then started writing songs to comfort me while I wait 
But like some things you never came Dont you know eleven years is a long time 
To freeze a heart eleven years is long enough 
To make a girl insane Dear Paul would you stay far 
And be the bicycle that I never had 
And Ive tried different kinds of ice cream 
And some made my throat sore 
But you were only bliss 
So ill visit you in dream Cause you know eleven years is a long time 
To freeze a heart eleven years is long enough 
To make a girl insane Paul You make a girl insane Paul 
You make a girl insane Paul 
You make a girl insane
