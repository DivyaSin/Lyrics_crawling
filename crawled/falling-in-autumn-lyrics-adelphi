i wish one bad dream would bring me back from this sleep that i've spent with you 
the morning time is when it hurts the worst 
waking up alone 
staring at a silent phone it would hurt to know you feel the same way as i do 
but i'd hate to know you don't 
and i know if this emptiness is called love, i don't want to fall in i'll spend another sleepless night chasing thoughts of you 
well this cold sweat keeps me from bed 
and i, i'm dying to be next to you 
and all this emptiness was never worth one kiss you can be so cold 
the words you've never said always ringing through my head 
and the words you spoke, i hold onto every one 
with every breath i breathe, trying not to choke if the sky fell, i know where i'd be 
but who'd be there for me? 
yeah who'd be there for me? 
i just remember the time i fell in love with a girl who didn't have the time for me 
she didn't have the time for me i'll spend another sleepless night chasing thoughts of you 
well this cold sweat keeps me from bed 
and i, i'm dying to be next to you 
and all this emptiness was never worth one kiss i'll spend another sleepless night chasing thoughts of you 
well this cold sweat keeps me from bed 
and i, i'm dying to be next to you 
and all this emptiness was never worth one kiss i'll spend another sleepless night chasing thoughts of you 
well this cold sweat keeps me from bed 
and i, i'm dying to be next to you 
and all this emptiness was never worth one kiss
