Love's calling, I can see your face 
Warm expression fills up all this space 
True reflections of your world in me 
Deep inside I know I found your key Lay down next to me 
Show me you care 
Slowly, I'm lost inside 
It's all there in your eyes [Chorus] 
What you gonna do with the good times 
What you gonna do with this game 
What you gonna do there's no holding back 
'Cause love won't wait 
When you want to love just call me 
It is always the same 
What you gonna do when the love runs out 
Who's to blame So if we're falling can I turn your key 
Pure emotion wells up inside of me 
Lost forever, in a world of dreams 
There are things in us we must keep Will you confess to me 
Will you reveal 
We are lost in each others eyes 
'Cause the love never dies [Chorus: x2] Love won't wait 
Lay down next to me 
Your face 
Lay down 
Your face [Chorus]
