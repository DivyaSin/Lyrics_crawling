Time after time I'm reminded that I fall apart 
When I run away from you 
Even when every mistake 
Leaves me broken and bruised 
I can hold onto you Tonight, tonight we're gonna put it all, put it all behind 
Tonight, tonight we're gonna make it all, make it alright 
We'll be who we want to be tonight, tonight Why do I feel like a space 
That just waits to be filled 
Looking for something new 
When ours is a love that is already perfect 
And I, I know I belong to you Tonight, tonight we're gonna put it all, put it all behind 
Tonight, tonight we're gonna make it all, make it alright 
We'll be who we want to be tonight When tomorrow comes we're gonna feel alive 
Somehow forget about the tears we cried 
There's so much more we have to gain 
Than we could ever lose Tonight, tonight we're gonna put it all, put it all behind 
Tonight, tonight we're gonna make it all, make it alright Tonight, tonight we're gonna put it all, put it all behind 
Tonight, tonight we're gonna make it all, make it alright 
We'll be who we want to be, we'll be who we're meant to be 
Tonight, tonight, when tomorrow comes we're gonna feel alive
