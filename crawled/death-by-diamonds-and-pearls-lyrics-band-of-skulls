She grew up in a nice neighborhood 
But it didn't do her no good 
'Cause she's just a sum of her influence 
Hell, and I can't tell you the difference 
By the cracked windscreen on her car 
Something is telling you don't know how lucky you are 
You're just like the rest of those girls They're all death by diamonds and 
Death by diamonds and 
Death by diamonds and 
Death by diamonds and pearls 
Death by diamonds and pearls You got your figure all nice 
But the heart stays colder than ice 
You got twenty-five grand on the bubble 
And you're the one telling me that you don't think you're in trouble 
I might be a fan of your insolence 
But that don't make you the innocent 
You're just like the rest of those girls They're all death by diamonds and 
Death by diamonds and 
Death by diamonds and 
Death by diamonds and pearls
