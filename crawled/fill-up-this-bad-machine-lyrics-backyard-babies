Well, I've been drivin' around the countryside 
Way too many miles 
I ain't got no home, no place to sleep 
And I rather be alone 
And I know what I like 
And I know what I feel 
Am I dreaming Sitting home by the telephone 
If somebody would give me a call 
Do you wanna know why I got this feeling inside 
Makes me wanna jump 
Going nowhere fast on a one-way train 
Livin' in a world of hallucinating angels, yeah And if I jump inside I will never ever come back home again 
I never trust anybody 'cause they only lie to me 
And if I try to admit it I will only fool myself 
So come on baby won't you fill up this bad machine There's a place I know and there is always a door 
Where we can stay for a day or two 
Oh, and it really doesn't matter what you say to me 
'Cause I will never ever go home 
Going nowhere fast with a circus from hell 
Can't you understand that my head is in a million pieces And if I jump inside I will never ever come back home again 
I never trust anybody 'cause they only lie to me 
And if I try to admit it I will only fool myself 
So come on baby won't you fill up this bad machine 
Come fill it with this baby Hey, ho, let's go 
Hey, ho, let's go 
Raw power 
Can you feel it 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, let's go 
Oh, oh, oh, oh And if I jump inside I will never ever come back home again 
I never trust anybody 'cause they only lie to me 
And if I try to admit it I will only fool myself 
So come on baby won't you fill up this bad machine 
So come on baby won't you fill up this bad machine 
So come on baby won't you fill up this bad machine now
