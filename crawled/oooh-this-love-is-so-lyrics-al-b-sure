Ooh this love is so 
Um, that I won't let you go 
Ooh this love is so 
Um, that I won't let you go Taking the time to show my love for you, no 
Do you love me too girl? 
Ooh don't tell me, let it show 
When you're with me I know for real 
That out love can't help grow 
Because the passion you bring to me, my lady 
Ooh I won't go 
I see a rose in the sky 
I'll reach for you my love 
And if a petal should fall 
I'll catch your heart for you 
Oh no 
Whisper to me 
So that I can see you closer to me 
I'm wanting you more and more each day 
That's why I'll say Ooh this love is so, this love is so 
Um that I won't let you go (I won't) 
Ooh this love is so that I won't let you go You're lying there waiting for me to make love to you 
I'll take all the time I need for you to B. Sure! of my love 
Don't be afraid to yell my name 
When the love feels this way 
And maybe soon you'll see that I'm sincere 
Ooh you'll say Ooh this love is so 
Um, that I won't let you go 
Ooh this love is so 
Um, that I won't let you go Roses are red and violets are blue 
Love is blind and I don't know what to do (When you're) 
With me you see that I have no fears 
But when you leave me all I can say is Ooh this love is so 
Um, that I won't let you go 
Ooh this love is so 
Um, that I won't let you go
