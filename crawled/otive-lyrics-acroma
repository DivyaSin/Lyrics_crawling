In your naked blood flow 
With a scream you flee me now 
Who really needs a motive? 
In your perfect Eden 
Everyone's a reason now 
Who really needs a motive? In every word you say 
I sense the blasphemy 
In every word you say 
I can feel you running through me 
Won't you free me? 
Won't you show me? 
Won't you heal me? 
Won't you save? In your naked blood flow 
With a scream you kill me now 
Who really needs a motive? 
In your perfect Eden 
I'm the virus feeding now 
Who really needs a motive? In every word you say 
I sense the blasphemy 
In every word you say 
I can feel you running through me 
Won't you free me? 
Won't you show me? 
Won't you heal me? 
Won't you? Shut out the laughs in every eye I see 
The vacant front line desperation this wave erasing me 
Should I collapse into these eyes I see? 
Into the front line desperation 
Into this wave Erased said now you know 
And when you seem alone you see this wave this wave 
(Chorus out)
