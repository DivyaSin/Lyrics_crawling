Lassitude your demeanor 
You go on getting leaner 
As they dearly sell you anodynes and death 
And you're restless Have you knocks at all the doors? 
And can you feel at all 
It's all you can do to go on breathing? And I can't stand by I'd do anything, anything at all 
To get you, won't forget you 
On the other side, over here Here, my friend, take some of mine 
It's freely given and will 
Cost you everything you have 
But drink, my cup runs over Have you knocks at all the doors? 
Have you knocked at all? 
It's all you can do to go on waking And I can't stand by I'd do anything, anything at all 
To get you, won't forget you 
On the other side, over here 
It's clearer as your mirror shows Yeah, I'd do anything 
And I'd do anything 
And I can't stand by I'd do anything, anything at all 
To get you, won't forget you 
On the other side, over here I'd do anything, anything at all 
To get you, won't forget you 
On the other side, over here I'd do, I'd do, I'd do anything 
Do anything, do anything 
Do anything, do anything 
Do anything, do anything 
Do anything, do anything
