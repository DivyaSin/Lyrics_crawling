There's not a thing that I could do 
To keep you right here in this room 
Your mind's made up, decision's tight 
Pack up the memories tonight Nobody wants to play the fool this time 
But we both will when we say our last goodbye You're running circles around my heart 
When love and hatred both play their part 
You're right beside me, but I'm all alone 
Your words have cut me right to the bone Nobody wants to play the fool this time 
But we both will when we say our last goodbye We could talk till the moon turns red 
But we both know where this is headed 
So, honey, when our words are through 
I'll try not to think about you Now there is nothing left to say 
Our last goodbye is on its way 
And one more kiss is one too much 
'Cause now your lips are cold to the touch Nobody wants to play the fool this time 
But we both will when we say our last goodbye 
We both will when we say our last goodbye 
We both will when we say our last...
