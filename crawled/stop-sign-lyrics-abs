Stop! 
She was banging 
But lovin' was cold 
Keep it up, it's going 
To be a love TKO Trying to find my direction 
Instead of feeling the love 
You break it all down into section 'Cause I want you baby 
And I need you lady 
Don't stop acting shady 
Take a detour 
I'm singing to you lady What's the matter, don't 
You love me (Tell me now) 
Don't you really care now 
(Care about you) 
Oh, I'm about to lose 
My mind with your stop sign I didn't mean to get myself 
So involved 
Second time around back 
Round we go 
It feels right when I'm next to you 
So why you gotta make me so blue She's telling me 
Why 
She's thinking that she 
Needs another 
Guy 
Somebody that ain't gonna 
Make her 
Cry 
Well lady I can be that 
But your stop sign's not letting 
You see that Why won't you let me hold you 
(Hold you tight) 
In my warm embrace 
(Sweet embrace) 
Why won't you let my love shine 
In your stop sign Oh no check the flow 
You ready with the base 
Let's go 
My sound abstract 
Cut the loop and bring the 
Beat back 
Bounce to the hot new flavor 
Turn up the high end on the 
System fader 
It ain't that I hate you 
But I don't want to know 
Yo, I'll see you later Why won't you let me hold you 
(Hold you tight) 
In my warm embrace 
(Sweet embrace) 
Why won't you let my love shine In your stop sign (I love you baby) 
In your stop sign 
(I need you baby) 
In your stop sign 
(I want you baby)
