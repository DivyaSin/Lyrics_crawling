There are maybe ten or twelve things I could teach you 
After that, well, I think you're on your own 
And that wasn't the opening line it was the tenth or the twelfth Make of that what you will 
Make of that what you will Once there was a haunted loop of your deep, fallen tears 
A forehead resting on a record shelf 
Amid moving boxes stacked I'm still waiting for the right words Make of that what you will 
Make of that what you will And the eyes they were a color I can't remember 
Which says more than the first two verses 
And it is the devil you know that will slam the door harder Make of that what you will 
Make of that what you will 
Make of that what you will 
Make of that what you will
