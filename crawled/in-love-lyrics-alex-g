Say what you will 
Well I know what I am 
Uncertain that meds 
You wish I'm to I came through 
On an evening with you 
Is it living a lie 
Certain i'm sitting in love 
Talking in love 
Leading in love 
Well I wont rock the boat 
I dont buy just to sell 
I swallow my pride 
Running to you are my queen 
I will follow you down 
Down darby creek 
Crying 
I'm running in love 
Losing in love 
Scratching in love 
Wired in love
