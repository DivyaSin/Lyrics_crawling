Traffic Jam 
Randy Bachman Lightning stikes inside of my brain 
I wonder if it'll happen again 
This never was really part of the plan 
Traffic jam Screaming nightmares that nobody hears 
Still running crazy after so many years 
Is life just something we hold in our hands 
Traffic jam And as the dreams unravel 
So many roads to travel 
Life is a battle in the palm of your hand 
You take each hit you pay your dues 
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose 
Life's like a sandbox without sand 
It's a traffic jam, it's a traffic jam Rag dolls and broken airplanes 
Empty toy box and pieces of games 
Parts of this puzzle I don't understand 
Traffic jam The organ grinder is down on his luck 
So is the monkey with a little tin cup 
Who's running this circus and where do I stand 
Traffic jam And as the dreams unravel 
So many roads to travel 
Life is a battle in the palm of your hand 
You take each hit you pay your dues 
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose 
Life's like a sandbox without sand 
It's a traffic jam, it's a traffic jam Is there a place where everyone goes 
When they come to the end of their road 
If there's no heaven, it's all been a scam 
Traffic jam And as the dreams unravel 
So many roads to travel 
Life is a battle in the palm of your hand 
You take each hit you pay your dues 
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose 
Life's like a sandbox without sand 
It's a traffic jam, it's a traffic jam
