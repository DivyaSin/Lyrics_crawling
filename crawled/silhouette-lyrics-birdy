There are shadows in my dreams 
Storms that send me out to reach 
And you just wait on my defeat So I built an army underneath 
And now they got me while I sleep 
And this worn-out frame will carry me Don't go holding your breath 
You know that I'm not done yet 
There's still a fight in me left 
Don't go shouting out loud 
That you're claiming the crown 
I'm done but not out And the bittersweet of every new defeat 
Is I'm stronger than before 
Baby, on my knees, but I still believe 
These broken wings will soar Undone, my silhouette, it's all that is left of a broken heart 
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks 
Through oceans dark In the dust I wrote my name 
And from the ruins, hopes were praised 
'Cause all that's messed can be replaced in time Don't go holding your breath 
You know that I'm not done yet 
There's still a fight in me left 
Don't go shouting out loud 
That you're claiming the crown 
I'm done but not out And the bittersweet of every new defeat 
Is I'm stronger than before 
Baby, on my knees, but I still believe 
These broken wings will soar Undone, my silhouette, it's all that is left of a broken heart 
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks 
Through oceans dark Undone, my silhouette, it's all that is left of a broken heart 
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks 
Through oceans dark
