Kissing as we cross 
Kissing as we cross 
Kissing as we cross again I saw your fate tonight 
Your summer has no reason 
I ask my body no questions 
And it tells no lies I know it's been a while 
But I can say without ego 
That I never stopped loving you 
I never even tried All your moves are real to me 
You're the only one No one else can ever compare to me and you 
I was her once with the blonde hair, who wanted you 
And when you run, you don't stop running But we'll be kissing as we cross 
Kissing as we cross 
Kissing as we cross again Vast internal world 
And the lonely wolf theory 
If you're a weaker man then 
Don't have daughters like me Sick of suffering fools 
Youth is just planless 
If you never dare, never dare 
To break on through
