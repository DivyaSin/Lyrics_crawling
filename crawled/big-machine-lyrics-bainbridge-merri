It's a crime that I have truly tried and tested 
It feels so good that I could get myself arrested 
It's more for the pleasure and pain 
When you're tied to a big machine 
When you drop from an aeroplane 
Go down in a submarine 
Throw your arms around me 
Caress me till I am clean 
Love has finally found me 
It's a big machine 
It rains it pours and I think I'm getting wetter 
I'm sure you saw that that I would get to know you better 
I saw you jump from a speeding train 
Go down in a submarine 
I saw you jump from an aeroplane 
Tied to a big machine 
Throw your arms around me 
Caress me till I am clean 
Love has finally found me 
It's a big machine
