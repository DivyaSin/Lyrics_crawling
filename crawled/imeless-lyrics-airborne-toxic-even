As she disappeared alone in the darkness, 
I felt her spirit stay in the room. 
And I wished that our lives were just endless 
'Cause it's all too short, and I'm leaving soon. I want to hold on to all of the people I lost, 
I want to keep them with me. 
We will never part. We are, we are, 
We are timeless, timeless. 
Everything we have, we have, 
Everything oh my god. 
You are, you are, 
The only thing that makes me feel like, 
I can live forever, forever. 
With you, my love. I see her, they run through the tall grass 
Such thoughtless minds, I wish I was thoughtless too 
What is this hole in my heart, that I cannot abide 
I just want you to stay with me tonight. We are, we are 
We are timeless, timeless 
Everything we have, we have, 
Everything oh my god. 
You are, you are, 
The only thing that makes me feel like, 
I can live forever, forever 
With you Just help me through this moment 
After everything I told you 
How the weight of their loss is like the weight of the sun. 
I see their faces near me, 
I hear their voices callin, 
It's like their lives were over before they begun. Oh ooh oh We are, we are 
We are timeless, timeless 
Everything we have, we have 
Everything oh my god 
You are, you are 
The only thing that makes me feel like 
I can live forever, forever 
With you. We are, we are 
We are timeless, timeless 
Everything we have, we have 
Everything oh my god 
You are, you are 
The only thing that makes me feel like 
I can live forever, forever 
With you, my love Oh ooh 
With you, my love
