Oho, baby, I'm in love again, 
I love the way you baby talk, 
Oho, baby, I'm in love again, 
I love the way you babe walk that walk 
You're driving me out of my mind, 
I'm losing my self-control. Hey, hey, I'm in love again, 
Falling down on my knees, 
I never thought I'd ever feel this way again. I was walking out late last night, Hanging out in Central Park, 
Saw a man coming up with a light in his eyes, Shinning out in the dark, 
He said, hey where you going, you know, I said it ain't no business of yours because, Hey, hey, I'm in love again, Falling down on my knees, 
I never thought I'd ever feel this way again. Look out baby. Yeah, yeah. Hey, hey, I'm in love again, Falling down on my knees, 
I never thought I'd ever feel this way again. Hey, hey, I'm in love again, I'm falling down on my knees, 
I never thought I'd ever feel this way again. Hey, hey, I'm in love; I'm in love, Falling down on my knees, 
I never ever thought I'd feel, this way, This way, again. 
Yeah, yeah, I'm in love, in love, With a beautiful girl.
