Ayo L, aye L 
Danny get the car 
We gotta get the fuck outta here Dan Murder, death, kill pull a one 87 
If you ain't gon' give it motherfucker I'ma take it 
Boy I'll turn ya' to a raisin 
Just to bring home the bacon 
For me to see heaven I would need to meet Satan 
So my heart so vacant 
My mind's on some 'take shit! Break shit! Spray shit!' 
In some raw day shit 
Face-lift braces, unsolved cases 
Hittin' up the witnesses so can't nobody say shit 
I think the reaper callin' 
Picked up the phone and said 
"I got a couple coming" 
'Cause blood in my eye and I'm thirsty for death 
(?) walking up heaven's steps 
Got a getaway driver, just chillin' in a stolen 
Parolee with a 40 that'll take what you owe me 
'Cause I'm no (?) 
And the last thing yo' ass wanna hear is these words Guns are in the trunk 
Money in the seat 
Guns are in the trunk 
Think they gonna and get us, never 
Uh, the white OJ in the hallway 
The long .44 spray 
One leg up on the Velour grey 
Gettin' straddled while I'm eatin' strudle 
We fuck you up so bad that you will never take a normal doo-doo 
Or a pee-pee, bedridden 
Now I'm laughing while head is given 
No fucks are given ever cause I'm rotten to the core 
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya right into the door 
Aah, cross the street when you see us by the store 
I'm off the leash, dick hanging on the floor 
Box cutters rolled up in the waistband of the 09's 
You thought you had your little shit 
Clickin' now, but no mas 
My bitch will choke you out with strong thighs 
Strong features in the face from New Guinea 
Smokin' dope, doing 360's in a Mini 
She half Dominican and Trini 
Bad news
