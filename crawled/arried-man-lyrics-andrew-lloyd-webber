Married Man Dreams of summer 
Secret smiles between us 
Our first meeting 
You thought they had seen us 
We first tried explaining 
Then it started raining 
Then you said "I love you, girl" and then 
"I'm much too old to fall in love again" Time was golden 
I felt I was falling 
Waiting, smiling 
Hoping you'd be calling 
Loving eyes above me 
Showing me you love me 
I woke up beside you once and said 
"I don't think I could fall in love again" Married man, you were happy and you let me know 
As you run up the stairs to reach my door 
But I cried every time you had to go 
Should have said, "don't come here anymore" Winter's silence 
Shadows on the ceiling 
You said, "you're too young to know that feeling" 
Then, your voice seemed colder 
Then you said "I told her" 
I said "well, she's older, but then 
She's young enough to fall in love again" Though I tried to forget her as you live with me 
But you cried when she begged you to return 
You said "no, that's all over" but you lied 
Married man, are you too old to learn? Spring can be a very cruel season 
Help me, help me 
Don't ask for a reason 
Please you must believe me 
I want you to leave me 
One day if you're free 
But not till then 
I'm young enough to fall in love again 
I'm young enough to fall in love again.
