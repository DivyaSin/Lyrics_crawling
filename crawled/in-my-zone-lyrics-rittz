I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along 
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't 
'Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
In my zone (Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh) 
In my zone (zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh) 
In my zone (zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh) 
When I'm in my, when I'm in my 
(Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh) in my zone In my old school bumpin' that "Kiss of Life" beneath the city lights 
Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed 
'Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight 
This dream difficult for me to visualize 
And that was real when they said the limit is the sky 
But my feets on solid ground, no more stalling now 
On the road to get it 'cause, when it rain, it pour 
But now the storm finally calming down 
Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining 
My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds 
I ain't got a bunch of money 'cause it cost to grind 
Silly beats being burnt up with my stomach growlin' 
In the darkest island, got the heart to fight 
I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant 
Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling 
I'll be up in Neiman Marcus smiling 
Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe 
You could say that you played in the major league 
Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave 
I feel wet from the sweat on my famous tee 
I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf 
'Cause runaways for me is unknown 
So I lit up my J, from a kid up was straight 
Crown Royal, now I'm in my zone I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along 
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't 
'Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
In my zone This ain't no ordinary, dog 
I was sick of being poor and said enough 
Right up 85 North, I never was 
Working, breaking down doors and barriers 
Still representing Georgia, I'm feeling the support 
Spread the word 'cause the more, the merrier 
Nobody blowing off the torch I carry 
Got annoyed from every time they point and stare and judge 
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde 
And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style 
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts 
Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down 
In case you wanna come and duke it out 
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce 
And we just blew an ounce 
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge 
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round 
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive 
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in 
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this 
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist 
I got the backseat bass and the lobster bisk 
And took a shot of whiskey to the dome 
Made a toast to the homies that are gone 
Two for the fans and the love they shown (I'm in my zone) I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along 
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't 
'Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
In my zone My calendar at this caliber's for the life of a bachelor 
I'm burning through cannabis canister after canister 
Um, so many cameras, they flashing, I never glance at 'em 
Lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer 
I'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer 
Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on 'er 
I'm a modern day Galileo who lives in Atlanta 
The capital of the ratchets, aristocrats and traffickers 
A practitioner, practice until I master it 
Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate 
Anything less to describe me is just inaccurate 
You're a student of classes in which I am a graduate 
Immaculate vernacular, Bat-mobile look like Dracula 
Giving these boys the blues while telling these hoes to saddle up 
You catching feelings, I think you squarer than Madison, I'm 
I'm in my zone, ain't no way I'll ever snap out of it I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along 
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't 
'Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone 
In my zone Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh (in my zone) 
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh (in my zone)
