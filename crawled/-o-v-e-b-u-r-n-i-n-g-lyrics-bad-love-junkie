A fallen angel wakes my sleep 
I open my eyes she's all over me 
She's so intoxicated 
She bites her lip 
Unfolds her wings 
oh I can't get enough 
Love burning me up Fire in her words, 
Fire in her touch 
The fire of her love 
Is burning me up 
Fire in her eyes 
Fire in her kiss 
The fire of love 
Burning me up 
Burning me up Make up running down her face 
She's pulls me in,I love how she tastes 
I'm so intoxicated 
I'm addicted to the love we make 
Oh....I can't get enough 
Love burning me up Fire in her words 
Fire in her touch 
Fire of her love 
Is burning me up 
Fire in her eyes 
Fire in her kiss 
The fire of love 
Burning me up 
Burning me up
