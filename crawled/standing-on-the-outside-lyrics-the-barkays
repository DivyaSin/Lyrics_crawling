You and I, we were alright 
And then you suddenly changed 
Without a cue, I had lost you 
As if I never knew your name So many things to say 
And I need to find a way 
?Cause it?s though you're here but gone 
And I'm left here all alone On the outside, well 
(Standing on the outside) 
Whoa, baby 
(Standing on the outside) 
I'm standing on the outside, yeah 
(Standing on the outside) Maybe you do, then maybe you don't 
Or maybe you don't even care 
He has no love and he has no heart 
And baby, I know that's not fair, no baby So many things to say 
And I need to find a way 
?Cause it?s though you're here but gone 
And I'm left here all alone On the outside, oww, whoa, baby
