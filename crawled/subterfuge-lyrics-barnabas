Survival is not guaranteed in strange, tumultuous times 
When the quest of our humanity strays from the narrow line 
The cause of world insanities rests deeply on the few 
Whose self-inflicted vanities require your servitude In days of lies and subterfuge are times most opportune

Because the kings of men have failed again in obscene impudence 
It will only be the ending of a strange, tumultuous dream 
For those who've found the Saviour, waiting and willing
