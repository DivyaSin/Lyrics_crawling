Hehehehehe 
Hahahahaha 
Hahahahaha Chorus(x4) 
Im so muddy 
Youre so muddy 
Were so muddy 
Lets get muddy I swing a hatchet like a warrior 
Told you all the dirty history my life observed 
Showed you how to keep rolling while you acting a fool 
Now you want get all muddy cause you underground too 
Dont be blinded by those mainstream raps 
Eagle eyeing all your dollars but wont give you a dap 
Ive seen them come, Ive seen them go 
People get so emotional 
Especially when you dont let them know 
You see the love they show 
All I know is that I pay mad dues 
So respect what you getting 
Cause I do it for you 
And if you feeling how Im feeling 
Then Im doing it right 
So lets get muddy underground for the rest of our lifes Chorus (x6) 
There is no history known not to have a trace of dirt on it 
From history books, to scriptures, to missing literature 
Inner self or outer selves were all dusty in some way, shape or form 
Its like a survival kit we rub on to keep unnoticed 
Some spread it on thin while others pack it on like its the fountain of youth
