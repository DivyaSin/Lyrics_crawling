Lord, I hope this day is good 
I'm feelin' empty like You knew I would 
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should 
But Lord, I hope this day is good Lord, have You forgotten me? 
I've been praying to You faithfully 
I'm not saying I've done all I can 
But Lord, I know You'll understand I don't need fortune and I don't need fame 
Send down the thunder, Lord, send down the rain 
But when you're planning just how it will be 
Plan a good day for me Lord, I hope this day is good 
I'm feelin' empty like You knew I would 
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should 
But Lord, I hope this day is good you've been the King since the dawn of time 
All that I'm askin? is a little less crime 
It might be hard for the devil to do 
But it would be easy for You Lord, I hope this day is good 
I'm feelin' empty like You knew I would 
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should 
But Lord, I hope this day is good 
Lord, I hope this day is good
