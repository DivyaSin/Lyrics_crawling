Now is the time to redeem those black souls 
Into a peaceful brand... 
Or get out! 
Can you tell me where to looking for? 
Can you tell me where looking now for the answers? 
Walking out every morning 
With some questions that seems to grow with no answers. 
There's no love having an empty pocket 
There's no blessings going through any moments 
There's no love for some people in this world. 
Can you tell me what to find for? 
Anything that could fix my way to the answers 
Or the solutions for a down class man. 
No vision, no horizon, no tomorrow 
If you think that everything comes overnight 
With no work! 
Sit straight and wait a hundred more. 
Now is the time 
Yesterday is gone.
