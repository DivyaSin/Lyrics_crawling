I had a dream, a dream about you, baby. 
It's gonna come true, baby. 
They think that we're through, but baby, You'll be swell! You'll be great! 
Gonna have the whole world on the plate! 
Starting here, starting now, 
honey, everything's coming up roses! Clear the decks! Clear the tracks! 
You've got nothing to do but relax. 
Blow a kiss. Take a bow. 
Honey, everything's coming up roses! Now's your inning. Stand the world on it's ear! 
Set it spinning! That'll be just the beginning! 
Curtain up! Light the lights! 
You got nothing to hit but the heights! 
You'll be swell. You'll be great. 
I can tell. Just you wait. 
That lucky star I talk about is due! 
Honey, everything's coming up roses for me and for you!
