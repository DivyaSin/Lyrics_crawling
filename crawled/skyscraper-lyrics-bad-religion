Come let us make bricks 
And burn them hard 
We'll build a city 
With a tower for the world And climb so we can reach 
Anything at all 
Build me up, Tear me down 
Like a skyscraper Build me up, then tear down 
These joining Walls 
So they can't climb at all 
I know why you tore it down that day You thought, if you got caught 
We'd all go away 
Like a spoiled little baby 
Who can't come out to play You had your revenge 
Build me up, tears me down 
Like a skyscraper 
Build me up, then tear down These joining walls 
So they can't climb at all
