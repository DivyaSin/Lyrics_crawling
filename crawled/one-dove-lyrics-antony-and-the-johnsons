one dove, you're the one i've been waiting for, 
through the dark for, the nightmares the lonely nights. 
i was born a curling fox in a hole hiding from danger 
scared of being alone. one dove to bring me some peace. 
in starlight you came from the other side to offer me mercy, mercy, mercy. one dove, i'm the one you've been waiting for. 
through your skin i am born again. 
i wasn't born yesterday. 
you were old and hurt. i was longing to be free. 
i see the things you were too tired, you were too scared, to see. one dove to bring me some peace. 
in starlight, you came from the other side to offer me mercy, mercy, mercy. (repeat)
