Around the corner ten storeys high 
There lives an angel who caught my eye 
I want to know her but me oh my 
I'm not allowed to join the crowd 
around the corner... (around the corner...) Around the corner, my shining star 
has pretty dresses, a fancy car 
But I'm in trouble the way things are 
Because I know I shouldn't go 
around the corner... (around the corner...) Everybody tells me to my face to just forget her 
That I should know my place and keep in line 
But there's something deep inside of me 
that tells me better... 
I'll make her mine... (I'll make her mine...) 
I'll make her mine... (I'll make her mine...) 
I'll make her mine Around the corner and down the street 
There is an angel, oh, I've got to meet 
Soon she'll be making my life complete 
Go there I must for love is just 
around the corner... (around the corner...)
