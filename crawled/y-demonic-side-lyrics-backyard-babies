I'm in a world of reality 
But think again cause it's misery 
How come I feel like I'm on the run? 
Turns a boy into a man Can't get through 
I'm out in the blue 
Look what you put me through 
I'm out in the blue [Chorus] 
Tell me this 
Would you follow me to hell and back? 
Are you living in a broken dream? 
I've been hiding my demonic side 
Because the promises were lies My world's spinning in a roundabout 
I wake up scared and I scream and shout 
What kind of man rides a chicken race? 
A boy that wants to be a man Can't get through 
I'm out in the blue 
Look what you put me through 
I'm out in the blue [Chorus] Somebody save me 
You'll never understand 
You think maybe it's complicated 
Baby what you see is never what you get
