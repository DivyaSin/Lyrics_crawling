Yours dearly, your true. 
And I don't mind you as much as you think I do. 
I will play this part over for you. 
Yours dearly, your true. You are such a wonderful friend. 
And I will stand by you in your defense. 
I will be the beacon for you then. 
Yours dearly, your true. And though you tell me 
that you're dragging me down. 
You'll start to cry, 
I'll tell you you're not allowed. 
I will stroke your hair and 
dry your eyes out. 
I will play your fool. And though you tell me 
that you're dragging me down. 
You'll start to cry, 
I'll tell you you're not allowed. 
I will stroke your hair and 
dry your eyes out. 
I will play your fool. Do, do, Yours truly. 
Mm, mm. Shy and unruly. 
You mustn't be lonely. 
I will be the guidance for you always. And though you tell me 
that you're dragging me down. 
You'll start to cry, 
I'll tell you you're not allowed. 
I will stroke your hair and 
dry your eyes out. 
I will play your fool.
