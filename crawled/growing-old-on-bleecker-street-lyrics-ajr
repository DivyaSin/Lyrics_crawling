No point in dreaming if you're alone 
No point in walking without the road 
No point in crying without that someone there beside you 
Saying it will be OK I'll take my time 
I'll take my time 
You cannot rush 
What can't be timed And its tough believing 
There's someone living out there 
Happier than me 
Happier than me We may be lost 
And gone forever 
The rain will wash our memory 
But when we cry 
We cry together 
Like it was meant to be I woke up last night from a dream 
That we'd grow old on Bleecker Street 
Sit by the fire and I'd play my guitar 
But dreams are only dreams And then I wonder when we leave 
Will the moon still be white 
And the river green 
Sometimes I wonder if we matter at all 
If we're not written down 
Who will remember now We may be lost 
And gone forever 
The rain will wash our memory 
But when we cry 
We cry together 
Like it was meant to be We may be lost 
And gone forever 
The rain will wash our memory 
But when we cry 
We cry together 
Like it was meant to be
