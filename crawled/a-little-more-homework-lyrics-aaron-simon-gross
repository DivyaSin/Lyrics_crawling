Evan: 
If you stand here behind me 
And you call me a man 
And youre counting on me to come through 
You should know that Ill give you the best that I can 
But we all have a little more homework to do If youre walking beside me 
And you wanna be friends 
You should know Im depending non you 
So you gotta hang in there till the whole story ends 
Cause we all have a little more homework to do Cause Ive been looking in the back of the book for the answers 
Hoping the bell wouldnt chime 
But Im not ready to put down my pencil just set 
There are too many answers that I didnt get 
I need a little less pressure and a little more time Im trying to follow 
Im trying to lead 
Im trying to find what is true 
But if youre going to stand with me 
Then you have to concede 
That we all have a little more homework to do Charlotte: 
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today 
You get a little bit older 
A little bit taller

Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today 
And the days before all go too fast 
You cant hold on 
So, you go Evan & Charlotte:

Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today 
And Im a little bit older 
A little bit faster 
A little bit closer

Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today 
And the sky goes blue 
And the sky goes black 
And no matter what you do 
You cant go back
