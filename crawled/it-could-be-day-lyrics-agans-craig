It could be the middle of the day , it could be the middle of the night 
I dream I hear your voice call, is everything alright? 
It might right now be summer, but it also could be spring 
It could just be the sound of, the liberty bell that now rings.. 
What are you thinking, is something wrong? 
Has your record been skipping, playing the same old song 
The scene it may be changing and the future it may be far 
But it's about you i've been thinking, when I'm drivin' in my car.. 
Tomorrow could be yesterday, it seems hard to believe 
But somebody's arm has been itching from the ace stuck in his sleeve 
Great reasons have been shouted at me, and whispered to me by some 
By guardians of my future, telling me what I should become.. 
But nothing really matters now, you say you know the way 
There's so much I have to tell you, that I can't even start to say 
But I'll see you at the gathering, you'll be waiting at the door 
And it could be day, and it could be night, but I just will not be 
sure..
