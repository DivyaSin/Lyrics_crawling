Let me remind you all again 
That there is never any room 
For any doubt 
I feel it in my heart, I shout it out 
And if I decide to change my ways 
It's not because I've found the latest craze 
It's just that I've got more to lose this time you know that you can count on one thing 
I would never let you down 
As crazy as this world may seem 
The thing that keeps it spinning 'round 
Is always there 
So close and yet so far and you can believe it's true 
A reason behind everything I do 
A twist that makes it different every time 
There are those who say "it's all been done" 
There's nothing stopping us 
From having fun 
And that's why I'll be coming 'round again you know that you can count on one thing 
I would never let you down 
As crazy as this world may seem 
The thing that keeps it spinning 'round 
Is always there 
So close and yet so far... ...away - but it gets a little closer every day 
And I will hold it in my hand before I die 
You know there isn't any way that we can lose 
And you don't have to be confused 
By hollow words that never mean a thing 
When tragic things keep happening 
To everyone around you 
You don't have to be the same 
This is the song that begs to set you free 
A sparkle in the night 
When we come face to face 
Don't close your eyes 
Don't ever turn away because the only way you'll ever know 
Is if you ever really try 
So find out for yourself 
Then you won't ever have to wonder why 
As crazy as this world may seem 
The thing that keeps it spinning 'round 
Is you because you're always there 
So close and yet so far
