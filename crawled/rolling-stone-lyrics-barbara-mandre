I don't want to tie you down 
With some lines spoken in sorrow 
With some hopes pinned on tomorrow 
You've got your bedroll and your guitar 
And there you are 
Ready to be alone, rolling stone I don't want the phone to ring 
I can't talk when I'm crying 
Your voice shakes when you're lying 
Saddle the wind and ride for the sun 
The way you run 
You'll never have a home, rolling stone But if you don't love what you've found 
Just remember the world is round 
And whatever rolls away 
Can always roll back home some day When you sleep beneath the sky 
With your coat making your pillow 
As the wind cries on the willows 
And your bed holds no tenderness 
Remember this 
You made it on your own, rolling stone, roll on
