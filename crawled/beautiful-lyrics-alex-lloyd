All goodbyes disappeared, 
When I first set my eyes on you, 
I found a world so pure and blue Today, I vow to you, 
That every little piece you see, 
Is coming from the heart of me You are so beautiful, 
And you're filling up my day, 
With the things I can't explain You are so beautiful, 
And we're holding on today, 
Yeah, we're holding on, 
We're holding on Among the broke glass, 
A road we've all been down before, 
But this time there's an open door A code so set and sealed, 
Where nothing is unbreakable, 
And every missing piece is found You are so beautiful, 
And you're filling up my day, 
With the things I can't explain You are so beautiful, 
And we're holding on today, 
Yeah, we're holding on, 
We're holding on All goodbyes disappeared, You are so beautiful, 
And you're filling up my day,
