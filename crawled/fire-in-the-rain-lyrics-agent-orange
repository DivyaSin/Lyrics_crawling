Right from the beginning 
Clouds began to form 
But we were all too young 
To feel the power of the storm 
If we had lost our hopes 
We know our dreams would still remain 
Because nothing is impossible 
And nothing burns like 
Fire in the rain Thunder rocked the mountains 
Lightening cracked the sky 
No one that survived this hurricane 
Would dare deny 
If fate had played it's part 
There would be nothing to explain 
What was once a very tiny spark 
Is now a blazing fire in the rain Now - see the sun - coming out 
From behind the darkest clouds 
Say goodbye - to the storm 
As it moves across the sky 
See the fire - burning brighter 
Than it ever has before 
Move in close - touch the flame 
Burn like fire in the rain
