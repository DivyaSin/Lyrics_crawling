Talking bout a silver spoon 
Money stocks and shares 
Daddy's little sweetheart and private affairs 
Said you looked so divine 
Seen dining at the Ritz 
And Daddy's little sweetheart 
Is looking for a fix 
Oh yeah ooh 
Talking bout the silver spoon 
And such expensive clothes 
And Daddy's little sweetheart 
Would love some of those 
I may be going crazy but I swear you're looking thin 
Don't know where you're going 
I sure know where you've been 
So come on and kick it 
Oh baby if you could only see 
Come on 
Rescue me 
Feels like I'm falling on a whiskey sea 
Come on baby and rescue me 
Talking bout silver spoons 
Money stocks and shares 
And Daddy's little sweetheart 
And private affairs 
Said you looked so divine 
Seen dining at the Ritz 
And Daddy's little sweetheart 
Is looking for a fix 
Round and round she goes 
Round and round she goes 
Oh baby if you could only see 
So come on and rescue me 
Feels like I'm fallin' on a whiskey sea 
So come on rescue me
