[Intro.] 
Every, Every moment that I'm awake. Every, every hour of every day I love how you take my breath away. 
[VERSE 1] 
In your arms I'm safe, secure, every care around me melt away.When you hold me I forget every word that I wanted to say. I am freely lost in your love there's no one else for me, I surrender, completely. Ooh, ooh... 
[CHORUS] 
My heart's racing I'm shaking, caught up in the love we're making. This is no, this is no ordinary love. Oh, baby your skin on my skin, it feels so good, I feel like crying. This is no, this is no ordinary love. 
[VERSE 2] 
I don't ever want to say good-bye, I can never breath never survive. Baby your my reason why I believe there's meaning inmy life. I have faith in love, faith in us and faith that this is right. I surrender, forever, tonight. Ooh, ooh... 
[CHORUS] 
[VERSE 3] 
Extraordinary more than special, every moment we're together. More than love, more than enough I'm never leaving never. Every second, every minute, love and I have fallen in it with you and only you. Ordinary just for you. Ooh, ooh.. 
[CHORUS]
