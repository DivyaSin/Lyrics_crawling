The week is done gonna treat it like a holiday 
Grab the fellas hit it fast on the highway Song is bumpin' in the car get the dance on 
Lookin' for a dance club, gotta get my sound 
Hit this spot where the beat is feeling kinda right Shake it up shake it down, move it left and right 
Now you're doin' it movin' it to the beat you and me 
All night Let the rhythm take control 
You can do it, nothing to it 
Now you know you grooving when you Put your hands way up high (we rubbin') 
And wave them from side to side (we rubbin') 
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin') 
And shake shake shake, we rubbin' Put your hands way up high (we rubbin') 
And wave them from side to side (we rubbin') 
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin') 
And shake shake shake, we rubbin' I feel it, I know you feel it too. 
And if your doin' it right let me hear you say, oooh. 
Don't stop, hit it, get it, hop hop, hit it hit it, 
Get up on your feet and get rubbin' Make sure the DJ puts rubbin' on 
And everybody in the house just sing along 
And if you didn't bring a friend make a new one 
Just start the rubbin' it's a lot of fun Let the rhythm take control 
You can do it, nothing to it 
Now you know you grooving when you Put your hands way up high (we rubbin') 
And wave them from side to side (we rubbin') 
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin') 
And shake shake shake, we rubbin' Put your hands way up high (we rubbin') 
Wave them from side to side (we rubbin') 
Put your hands on your hips (we rubbin') 
And shake shake shake When the body is dead, we got to get it jumpin'-acap
