Those were the last days of disco 
Those were the last days of having fun 
From New York City all the way to Frisco 
We thought it'd only just begun When did all of the hatred begin 
They burned all of our records 
While we were all making love 
Tell me which is the greatest sin All we wanted was to have a good 
The night to last forever 
Now tell was that a crime 
Tell me which is the greatest sin Those were the last days of disco 
Those were the last days of having fun 
From New York City all the way to Frisco 
We thought it'd only just begun All the heartaches we danced them away 
We forgot all of our troubles 
Nights of no work and all play 
Then slowly it all fell apart Too much fun can drive a person insane 
All the things you took they 
Finally blew out your brain 
That's when all of the troubles began 
We were dancing our lives away Those were the last days of disco 
Those were the last days of having fun 
From New York City all the way to Frisco 
We thought it'd only just begun Those were the last days of disco 
We thought it'd never go away 
From New York City all the way to Frisco 
Miami Beach straight to L.A. No doubt about it, it's so hard to get along without it 
No doubt about it, it's so hard to get along without it 
Without it, without it, without it Those were the last days of disco 
Those were the last days of having fun 
From New York City all the way to Frisco 
We thought it'd only just begun Those were the last days of disco 
We thought it'd never go away 
From New York City all the way to Frisco 
Miami Beach straight to L.A.
