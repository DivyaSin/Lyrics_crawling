Every day, every night 
Passion's burning deep inside 
I've never felt this way before 
It's killing me but I want more Every time I close my eyes 
Obssesion close to bigger size 
It's running like a hurricane 
There's been a raging through my veins The way you tease 
Play hard to get 
Don't make it easy 
To get this dream out of my head You feed my hunger, 
My appetite 
It's so much stronger 
All I fantasize Now, I'm a timebomb, timebomb 
I'me waiting so long, so long 
To make snooze of situation 
And the worse has yet to come 
Now, I'm a timebomb, timebomb 
I'm waiting so long, so long 
I'm longing for the excavation 
Pretty girl, you turn me on You're in slow motion 
Your moving wings 
A tale as potion 
I'm just begging to be safed. You're my addiction 
I need to score 
Girl I will fix them, 
Fight it anymore Now, I'm a timebomb, timebomb 
I'me waiting so long, so long 
To make snooze of situation 
And the worse has yet to come 
Now, I'm a timebomb, timebomb 
I'm waiting so long, so long 
I'm longing for the excavation 
Pretty girl, you turn me on Yeah Oh - whoa - oh - oh - oh 
Oh - whoa - oh - oh 
Oh - whoa - oh - oh - oh 
Oh - oh -oh -oh Now, I'm a timebomb, timebomb 
I'me waiting so long, so long 
To make snooze of situation 
and the worse has yet to come 
Now, I'm a timebomb, timebomb 
I'm waiting so long, so long 
I'm longing for the excavation 
pretty girl, you turn me on Now, I'm a timebomb
