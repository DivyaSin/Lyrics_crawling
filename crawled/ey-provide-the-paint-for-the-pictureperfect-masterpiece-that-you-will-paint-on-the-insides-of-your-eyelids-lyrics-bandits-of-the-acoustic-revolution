There is a man with no face and a name I don't remember 
Always in the house in the middle of the woods 
He said once, "Son don't you laugh out loud 
For they are listening, oh, they are listening 
Oh, you've got to be strong 
Oh, you've got to keep holding on 
It's now just a matter of time 
(Head for the hills, go!) They provide the paint for the picture-perfect masterpiece 
That you will paint on the insides of your eyelids 
Can you possibly see anything you want to see? 
No (Hell no!) 
There's nothing wrong with the way I see And he wanted to be a soldier in the next great war 
He wanted to kill and fight and maim 
But not be told what he was fighting for 
And that's the way its gonna have to be my friend 
And that's the way its gonna have to be my friend I passed a man on the corner in the city yesterday singing, 
"Yada yada yada and tomorrow it'll end" 
I never thought I'd live to see another sunny day 
But I'm here and I feel I'll be here until the end So watch your mouth or you're gonna make a grave mistake 
Hold your tongue or you're gonna catch a bullet in the head 
Watch your mouth or you're gonna make a grave mistake 
Don't die for anything less than the best of life 
(1, 2, 3, go!) The things he said went to your head 
You never tried to understand 
What they take you will never take back 
'Cause they take what they take when they can 
'Cause they can from you You follow me and you follow me but you never ask why 
And I wonder what you're under, could this be another piece 
Of the, 'I don't care, I just do what they say 
Because they say what to do in a matter-of-fact way' Don't stop because you might get burned 
And you might just learn to stand on your own two feet 
And I think that it's neat how you learn to repeat 
Everything that you hear in the street so well 
(Learn to repeat everything that you hear so well) 
(Learn to repeat everything that you hear so well) Oh, well everyone was resting because they thought it was the end 
And even if it wasn't they decided they'd pretend 
And somewhere in the distance, I could hear him whispering 
You can fight all you want, they will win in the end Sometimes in the evening when I'm lying in my bed 
I am taken to the forest to that isolated shed 
And I wake with his words resonating in my head 
And I can't stop thinking about the gist of what he said So watch your mouth or you're gonna make a grave mistake 
Hold your tongue or you're gonna catch a bullet in the head 
Watch your mouth or you're gonna make a grave mistake 
Don't die for anything less than the best of 
Everyone settles for the rest not the best of 
I will die for no less than the best of life
