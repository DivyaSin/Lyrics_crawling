I was confused 
I couldn?t seem to come through 
I have a lot on my mind 
And not enough time to think things through 
And if only I could go 
Back in time to fix things with you 
I would tell you how I really feel 
About you 'cause I've fallen 
I found out I'm in love with you 
Its how I feel, even though we?re through 
I'm not over you 
I'm not over you I know your mad I know your sad 
But can you listen now 
Why don?t we give our love a chance 
I know your mad I know your sad 
But can you listen now 
Why don?t we give our love a chance 'cause I've fallen 
I found out I'm in love with you 
That?s how I feel even though we?re through 
I'm not over 
I've fallen 
I found out I'm in love with you 
That?s how I feel, even though we?re through 
I'm not over you 
I'm not over you 
I'm not over you
