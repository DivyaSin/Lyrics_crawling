Well the docks lie crippled 
In the northem towns 
The boys have all gone away 
Trying to find work down south And mister I walk in the valley of the shadow 
Won't someone have mercy on my soul 
On my soul, soul, soul HALLOWED GROUND how sad is the sound 
In a valley that once sang out sang proud 
HALLOWED GROUND where the ships run aground 
To die in the harbour in a rust ridden town, town, town, town Now I've seen the future 
And I've seen the past 
And I've seen the lights go down 
On this world fading fast And mister I walk in the valley of the shadow 
Won't someone have mercy on my soul 
On my soul, soul, soul HALLOWED GROUND how sad is the sound 
In a valley that once sang out sang proud 
HALLOWED GROUND where the ships run aground 
To die in the harbour in a rust ridden town, town, town, town And mister I walk in the valley of the shadow 
Won't someone have mercy on my soul 
On my soul, soul, soul HALLOWED GROUND how sad is the sound 
In a valley that once sang out sang proud 
HALLOWED GROUND where the ships run aground 
To die in the harbour in a rust ridden town, town, town, town Now I've got a wife and a young child 
Back home in my house 
Oh I've got someone 
I've got to take care of somehow
