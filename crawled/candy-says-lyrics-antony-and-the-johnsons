( Live / Lou Reed Cover ) Candy says 
I've come to hate my body 
And all that it requires 
In this world Candy says 
I'd like to know completely 
What others so discretely 
Talk about I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly 
Over my shoulder 
I'm gonna watch them pass me by 
Maybe when I'm older What do you think I'd see 
If I could walk away from me Candy says 
I hate the quiet places 
That cause the smallest taste 
Of what will be Candy says 
I hate the big decisions 
That cause endless revisions 
In my mind I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly 
Over my shoulder 
I'm gonna watch them pass me by 
Maybe when I'm older What do you think I'd see 
If I could walk away from me
