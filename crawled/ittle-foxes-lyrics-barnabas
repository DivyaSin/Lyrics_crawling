I can still hear momma say 
"Win or lose, its how you play" 
Aw mom, no harm in a little sin 
That's how its done today (Do it!) Every evening after school 
A couple joints, a couple brews 
No harm done in a little fun 
So don't tell me what to do Tell me children, have you heard 
The devil's golden rule 
A simple line used all the time 
Spit on me, I'll spit on you Little foxes destroy the vine 
Satan laughs: "Your ASS is MINE" 
"Kiss it goodbye, kiss it goodbye, kiss it GOODBYE" Neatly disguised, you seek to have them all 
In prideful hate, you bleed them white 
They laugh us off, but then to you they crawl 
You shoot them up with cheap delights Come on baby, loosen up 
Let the fun begin 
Never mind what momma said 
To hell with discipline Little by little, drop by drop 
You'll hardly feel a thing 
Until you stand before the Throne 
To plead your case in vain Little foxes spoil the vine
