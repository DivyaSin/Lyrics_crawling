I can hear them talking as I'm walking down the street 
They're saying, "You're a fool, got to get back on your feet" 
You tried so hard to keep her love and don't know what to do 
And ever since she left your life, she left you feeling blue Johnny try to forget her 
Maybe you better, then you won't feel so blue 
Johnny try to forget her 
It wasn't forever, what else can you do? Johnny, don't feel blue 
Oh Johnny, it's up to you 
She left your life a year ago, and you're still by yourself 
Put all your feelings in a case then you put it on the shelf You tried so hard to keep her love, your life has fallen through 
You know you made a big mistake, you're still feeling blue 
Johnny try to forget her 
Maybe you better, then you won't feel so blue Johnny try to forget her 
It wasn't forever, what else can you do? 
Johnny, don't feel blue 
Oh Johnny, it's up to you You tried so hard to keep her love and don't know what to do 
And ever since she left your life, she left you feeling blue 
Johnny try to forget her 
Maybe you better, then you won't feel so blue Johnny try to forget her 
It wasn't forever, what else can you do? 
Johnny, don't feel blue 
Oh Johnny, it's up to you I said Johnny try to forget her 
Maybe you better, then you won't feel so blue 
Johnny try to forget her 
It wasn't forever, what else can you do...
