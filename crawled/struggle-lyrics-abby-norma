Is there something on your mind 
Does that something now reside 
Is it eating at your soul 
Will your heart mend the hole 
Will the wicked pain replace all your shame 
Or is it the same solitude 
Reality, well it don't come free 
Rate your dignity as it should Did the rotting fame of decaying days 
Bring you to your knees where you stood 
Self democracy breeds hypocrisy 
reflected vanity sure looks good Play as role as fate consumes you whole 
Deny it if ya could 
What's the toll can you save your soul 
Halleluiah if ya could Is there something on your mind 
Is there danger deep inside 
Is it eating at your soul 
Do you think you'll loose control Will the wicked pain replace all your shame 
Or is it the same solitude 
Reality well it don't come free 
Rate you dignity as it should Hallelujah!
