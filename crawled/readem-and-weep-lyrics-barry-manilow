I've been tryin for hour just to think of what exactly to say 
I thought I leave you with a letter or a fiery speech 
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play 
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense 
I like to know why you gave up and threw it away 
I like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant 
Well, I can tell you goodbye or maybe see you around 
With just a touch of sarcastic thanks 
We started out with a bang 
And at the top of the world 
Now the guns are exhausted 
And the bullets are blanks 
And everything's blank [Chorus:] 
If I could only find the words 
Then I would write it all down 
If I could only find the voice 
I would speak 
Oh its there in my eyes 
Oh can't you see me tonight 
Come on and look at me 
And read 'em and weep [Chorus] I've been whispering softly 
Trying to build a cry up to a scream 
We let the past slip away 
And put the future on hold 
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream 
And I've been dreaming forever 
Hoping something would eventually come 
I saw your eyes in the dark 
I felt your kiss on my lips 
I traced your body in the air 
'Til the bodies were numb 
Well, I could tell you goodbye 
Or maybe see you around 
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks 
But now the rooms are all empty 
The candles are dark 
The guns are exhausted 
And the bullets are blank 
And everything is blank [Chorus] Oh it's there in my eyes 
And coming straight from my heart 
It's running silent and angry and deep 
Oh it's there in my eyes 
And it's all I can say 
Come on and look at me 
And read 'em and weep
