13 horses swimming in the sea 
Waiting for someone to find them 
Their ship is gone 
And now they are alone 
With water everywhere around them 
The men were saved 
From the sinking ship 
Right before it started to burn 
And while they're safe 
Their loyal friends need help 
Patiently waiting for their turn 13 horses swimming in the sea 
They don't even know it's pointless 
Their pride remains 
But this time it won't help 
They used to be so tall 
And suddenly they're small 
There's a couple waiting far behind 
So they will be out of sight 
But then who cares? 
They're dying anyway 
All of them are doomed this night 11 horses swimming in the sea 
The sea they fought was just a river 
They're used to this 
It's probably just a race 
That helps to ease their minds 
But where's the finish line 
The night grows dark 
The body wants to rest 
It hurts to breathe 
And still they do their best 
They want to live 
No matter for how long 
Their thoughts all disappeared 
'Cause now they're really scared 7 horses struggling in the sea 
Waiting for someone to find them 
They don't look back 
'cause what's the point of that 
There is only death behind them 
They cry for help 
But help will never come 
They don't now where to swim 
Or what they're swimming from 
They try to swim some more 
When panic starts to spread 
They're swimming in to shore 
But only in their heads The 3 last horses 
Dying in the sea 
Shouting out their cries but no one 
They're born to win 
They're screaming in their hearts 
The strength of thousand men 
They're fighting to the end The sun is out 
Birds are everywhere 
They're flying high 
Surfing in the air 
It's nice to live 
When life is such a blast 
One horse that swims 
It seems to be the last The thirteenth horse 
Has always been the best 
His honour will be proud 
But now he wants to rest 
He's longing for his home 
The girl will give him food 
Good boy, she'll say 
Together they will play 13 horses swimming in the sea 
Soon they will be gone forever 
And while they swim, 
One thing still remains 
And that's the hope that never dies 
It never dies 
It never dies
