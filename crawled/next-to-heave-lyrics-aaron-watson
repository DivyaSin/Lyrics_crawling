Pinch me I must be dreaming 
Waking up with you and feelin' 
the tender touch of your good morning kiss 
no where else on earth 
is better than being next to you 
next to heaven 
it doesn't get any better than this Chorus 
Next to Heaven lies my fate 
my best friend and my soul mate 
God knows this kind of love 
only comes from up above 
your the answer to my prayers 
nothing else compares 
cause I'm next to heaven 
when I'm next to you And you look just like an angel 
tangled in white satin sheets 
lying there with you hair all in a mess 
And I swear you look your best 
all dressed up in next nothing 
Next to Heaven it doesn't get any better than this Chorus
