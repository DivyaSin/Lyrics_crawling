Yes sir is Bobby Ray, aka A. B.O.B. (O) 
I can't be eco conscious, I'm always burning trees 
And is there fire, fire, call it that third degree, 
And call me supersonic I shake the earth beneath ya 
Hell yeah you heard of me it's quite a emergency 
The way I take the game and I beat it so un-unmercifully, yeah Ladies with curly features, wait at concerts to see you 
They can roll home with B.O., and maybe service me up 
But if you wanna work for me then girl you need your working visas 
And if you ain't working then you just should not converse with me 
That's not that serious, don't take it so personally 
Plus currently I prefer the girls who prefer the three C.P.O. 
C.P.O. I think I think I'm Neo 
I'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload 
And if this is what I caught girl I would have to appeal 
I think that the defendant have some things that must reveal 
Heels ha, heels ha, tell me what's the deal, man 
Got me chasing you to see if I could cop a feel, huh 
I gotta keep it real, kosher, kosher, kosher 
Cause she don't want that bullshit, no sir, no sir, no sir 
Her thighs go round like roller-coaster motors 
And like a minute bundle, I had to roll them over 
Had to plug the headset into her motorola 
This bout to get scary like the end of October 
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so 
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
I'm at the fryin pan, your shit is so cold 
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so 
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold So cold like a hobo wearing no clothes and it's snow globe when the temperature is below froze 
I mean below freezing and there's no reason to be so cheesy, got my own team and my own league 
My own lane and my own speed, it's a long road so I don't sleep 
If I don't know you I don't speak, it's a small world and it's gonna shrink 
If you're full of shit, then you're gonna stink 
I'm a realist I'm gonna think, with a pair of eyes so I'm gonna see 
I'll be whatever the fuck I wanna be, I'll be everything except a wanna be 
I'll be everything you ever wanna be, if you're clever enough you can corner me 
But what's a corner to me, I'm geometry 
So tell me who gave you the authority? Who the fuck are you? The authority? 
What am I supposed to be orderly? pardon my honor you're charging me? 
Saying something I oughta be but I got some much heart that my arteries will always be partying like a camaraderie 
Man I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious 
Just like P Diddy victorious to the B.I.G. Notorius, 
I'm a champion, I'm a warrior, I bring war to ya, 
So if you got beef that's unfortunate, we'll hang ya'll out like portraits And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so 
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold 
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so 
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow 
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
