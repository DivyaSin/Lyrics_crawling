Wrong side of town on the second floor 
Couple blocks down from the liquor store 
I got a love seat and a couple DVD's we can watch 
Or not 
I can call a car it will be two minutes 
'Til it's at the bar and we hop in it 
It's pretty clear that we're both here to get over someone So if you wanna come over, come on 
If you need a shoulder, it's on 
I know you got your past and baby I got mine, but Every goodbye 
Can be the start of something new 
Maybe that starts with me and you 
We got all night 
To get to know each other better 
And try moving on together, together 
I could kill the pain that you've been in 
You can be my heartbreak medicine 
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining 
Every goodbye 
Can be the start of something new 
I wanna start something with you There's a reason that we're both here right now 
And a reason everything didn't work out 
We're two sets of previous relationships at the same time Every goodbye 
Can be the start of something new 
Maybe that starts with me and you 
We got all night 
To get to know each other better 
And try moving on together, together 
I could kill the pain that you've been in 
You can be my heartbreak medicine 
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining 
Every goodbye 
Can be the start of something new 
I wanna start something with you Oh baby come over, come on 
If you need a shoulder, it's on 
I know you got your past and I got mine But every goodbye 
Can be the start of something new 
Maybe that starts with me and you 
We got all night 
To get to know each other better 
And try moving on together Baby come over, come on 
If you need a shoulder, it's on 
I know you got your past and I got mine 
But every goodbye
