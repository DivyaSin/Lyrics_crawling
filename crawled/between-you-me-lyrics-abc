So trouble comes strolling through the door 
But anything worth having's worth fighting for 
Fiction or fact you'll supply the plot 
We'll both be featured - like it or not 
Yes i guess you think i'm stupid and brutal 
I should confess that the feeling is mutual It's not between the devil and the deep blue see 
Not between the truth and hypocrisy 
Not between freedom and democracy... 
But between you - between you... 
Between you and me 
Between you - between you... 
Between you and me The stars and stripes meet the hammer and sickle 
Not for honour but roubles and nickles 
It ain't fisticuffs, it's a full scale war 
Your secrets no secret anymore Yes i guess you think i'm stupid and brutal 
I should confess that the feeling is mutual
