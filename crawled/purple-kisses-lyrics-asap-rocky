Its so easy to fall in love 
Its so easy to fall in love 
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky] 
Purple kisses on her neck, thinkin bout the day we met 
Body drippin sweat, eat that, eat that pussy wet 
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes 
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette 
Trill ass misses, fuck her with a ? 
A$AP tat cause thats what a nigga rep 
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt 
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Izabelle Marone 
When Jay-Z out, tryin to take me out 
When these magazines try to play me out 
All my ex-girls tryin to fade me out 
But the internet was finished so its crazy how 
[Hook] x2 
[Verse 2: ] 
Okay wait, now hold up, lemme switch that flow up 
For her to come over and you just try to control her 
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up 
Now Im smokin more blunts and Im sippin til Im throwed up 
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up 
Get throwed til I throw up, but Im pimpin like Im supposed to 
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her 
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller 
She hate a rap nigga walkin with his nose up 
She date a rap nigga walkin with his toes up 
Take your bitch, close-up 
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster 
I did it again for my coach uh, went past the ?, traded it in for a Rover 
Just to get a nigga chauffeured, driver pull over, tippin and dickin these hoes 
Im slippin from feelin this sober, window is rolled up 
This purple pistol on my shoulder, undress and I sex and I hold her 
Caressin her breast with my head on her chest Im a loner
