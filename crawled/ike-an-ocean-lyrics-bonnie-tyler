Ocean...ocean... 
In the darkness of nowhere 
There's nothing at all 
And I feel like I've been here too long 
Shadows and teardrops fading away 
And my heart is crying for love 
Far from those moments 
When my eyes were still closed 
And my heartbeat was longing for more 
Way over mountains, higher than high 
I could feel the breeze from below 
Like an ocean... 
Like an ocean... 
Now tell me your secrets 
Come closer and whisper 
I feel like I've seen you before 
There's no more illusions 
No more escapes 
Cause I'm tired of asking for more 
Seems like a lifetime fading away 
And I'm lost in an ocean of love 
I'm reaching and holding onto my dreams 
Cause I'm not alone anymore 
Like an ocean... 
Way over mountains higher than high 
Like an ocean... 
Way over mountains higher than high 
Like an ocean... 
Way over mountains higher than high 
Like an ocean... 
Way over mountains higher than high 
Spoken: 
Far from those moments 
When my eyes were still closed 
Way over mountains 
Higher than high 
I could feel the breeze from below 
It's like an ocean, ocean...heeeyehhh 
Like an ocean... 
Way over mountains higher than high 
Like an ocean... 
Way over mountains higher than high 
Like an ocean... 
Way over mountains higher than high 
Like an ocean... 
Way over mountains higher than high 
Repeat & fade
