Sitting by a lonely Kansas road 
A car goes rushing by 
At the rate of one an hour Want a lift into the nearest town 
And judging by the sky 
We're heading for a shower Ooh, ooh, ooh... 
I'm a half a million miles from home Hey there, man 
Don't step upon the gas 
There's room enough inside 
And I'm very tired of walking I don't wanna do you any harm 
I just wanna get a ride 
And I'm very good at talking Ooh, ooh, ooh... 
I'm a half a million miles from home Now the telegraph begins to hum 
There's a message on the wire 
An electric conversation Well, ain't that life 
I'm saying to myself 
There's an awful lot of words 
But there's no communication Ooh, ooh, ooh... 
I'm a half a million miles from home Ooh, ooh, ooh... 
I'm a half a million miles from home Ooh, ooh, ooh... 
I'm a half a million miles from home
