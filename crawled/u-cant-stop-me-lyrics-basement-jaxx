I got sixteen second and I don't want to stop 
I got no time for the present living on a spinning top 
I got Satan on the TV I got God in a frame 
I say 'Hello' for a second then you won't see me again 
I am happy I am sad I can be most anything 
I'm a scary mother I'm the future on a spring 
I got sixteen seconds and I don't want to stop Can't stop me 
Can't stop me 
Can't stop me 
You can't stop me 
You can't stop me 
You can't stop me I got sixteen seconds and I don't want to stop 
I got no time for the present living on a spinning top 
I got a fast food store selling poison, selling rocks 
Spaghetti junction in my head I'm living in the after shock 
I am happy I am sad I can be most anything 
I'm a scary mother I'm the future on a spring 
I got sixteen seconds and I don't want to stop 
I got no time for the present living on a spinning top Can't stop me 
Can't stop me 
Can't stop me 
You can't stop me 
You can't stop me 
You can't stop me
