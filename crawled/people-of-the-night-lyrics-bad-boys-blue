The faces wear a frown. 
In the heaviness of sounds. 
Seven days a week. 
To the steady disco beat. 
Moving and grooving. Don't you know? 
They want to let their feelings go. The people of the night, they want to make it right. 
The stars are shining bright. 
For the people of the night. 
They're living in the life, in the disco heated light. 
They hustle and they party to the brightest city life. 
Oh, it's alright. Oh, in the night. 
Oh, it's alright. In the Night. 
They're living in the life, in the disco heated light. 
They hustle and they party to the brightest city life. There's something going on. 
And you can come along. 
They're parking all the cars, 
Around the disco place and bars. 
Moving and grooving, don't you know? 
They want to let their feelings go.
