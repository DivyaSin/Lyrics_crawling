In paradiscos 
We get bored of breaking windows 
Turning beggars into heroes 
Bodies moving innuendos 
In paradiscos 
Looking for only pleasure 
A little pain, take a measure 
When you're a flame that'll burn forever 
And forever I'll burn an effigy out of the past 
Then our clothes catch fire as we dance 
And I wonder how long it would last 
Walking through a room full of broken glass In paradiscos 
We'll make a million out of zeroes 
Split an apple with an arrow 
Play the violin like Nero 
In paradiscos 
Into the eye of a needle 
You can fly like a mosquito 
And turn into a million different people 
In paradiscos I'll burn an effigy out of the past 
Then our clothes catch fire as we dance 
And I wonder how long it can last 
Walking through the room full of broken glass
