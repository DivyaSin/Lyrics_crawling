She's made of shadows 
That live at night 
Ooooh I dream of things No one would dare 
Last night she came to me for a second time 
Through the walls, suspended in the air! (She's) a new kind of lover 
She makes love like no other 
She came to me from a long time ago 
(She's) a new kind of lover 
She makes love like no other I don't want to know that she's a ghost 
She knows my secrets 
When we're alone 
She plays them out While I'm asleep 
Last night she woke me up with a touch so cold 
Can it be she's playing me for keeps I don't wanna know 
Please don't let me know
