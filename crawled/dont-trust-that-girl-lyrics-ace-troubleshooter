You know that kind of girl that makes your heart beat all fast? 
You know that kind of love that you know will last? 
I knew that kind of girl, I knew that kind of love 
But then she broke it off when I was so sure of her Don't trust that girl, she's up to no good 
She'll mess with you like no one should 
Don't trust that girl, she's up to no good 
She'll mess with you like no one should Empty promises thrown into the wind 
Mirage vanishes, never to see again 
Hey fellas, be you ware, don't wanna end up like me 
Another victim of her stupid female schemes Don't trust that girl, she's up to no good 
She'll mess with you like no one should 
Don't trust that girl, she's up to no good 
She'll mess with you like no one should So now, the time moves on with feelings come and gone 
Christ is the one constant I can lean on 
And so, who I'm left here feeling like a schmuck 
With one thought on my mind, "She's no good Don't trust that girl, she's up to no good 
She'll mess with you like no one should 
Don't trust that girl, she's up to no good 
She'll mess with you like no one should
