You tell me of a place you like to go 
You say it will reach out and seize the sorrow 
And we always mean to act on what we say 
So come on, oh darling now hurry hurry let's go We're all we need 
Oh darling 
We're all we need 
Ooh darling 
Hey we're all we need 
Ooh darling 
Hey, we're all we need 
Ooh darling I told you of a place that I had been 
It was dark and I was supremely alone 
No matter now if the compass fails again 
'Cause in your love, I built a home We're all we need 
Oh darling 
yeah we're all we need 
Ooh darling 
We're all we need 
Oh darling

Oh darling hey, we're all we need

Oh darling

Ooh darling

Oh darling

Ooh darling Most certainly I'm where I'm supposed to be 
In a molten sun, with you I am free 
Today our hearts won first prize 
'Cause we're wise with the feeling 
Yeah we're all we need
