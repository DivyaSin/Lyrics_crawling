We left the party early, we had somewhere else to be 
We parked the car on a dark side street 
The car was better than any bar or hotel suit 
We agreed, sweet Dominique 
And you opened like a flower in the heat 
Your beauty on my eyes, like a masterpiece 
Never has skin tasted so sweet 
As for you and me, sweet Dominique 
And you said: 
"Oh, I didn't know that we could go so many kisses deep" 
We were face to face and lips to lips and heat to heat 
And you said: 
"Oh, I didn't know that we could go so many kisses deep" 
Sweet Dominique And our temperature was rising to our cheeks 
Our clothes began to wrinkle like bed sheets 
And if love was a mountain, you took me to its peaks 
So to speak, sweet Dominique 
And you said: 
"Oh, I didn't know that we could go so many kisses deep" 
We were face to face and lips to lips and heat to heat 
And you said: 
"Oh, I didn't know that we could go so many kisses deep" 
Sweet Dominique And I said: 
"Me, I didn't know that we could go so many kisses deep" 
We were face to face, eye to eye, skin to skin, heart to heart 
Love to love, soul to soul, and heat to heat 
And you said: 
"Oh, I didn't know that we could go so many kisses deep" 
We were face to face and lips to lips, heat to heat 
And you said: 
"Oh, I didn't know 
Oh, I didn't know 
Oh, I didn't know that we could go..." 
Sweet Dominique
