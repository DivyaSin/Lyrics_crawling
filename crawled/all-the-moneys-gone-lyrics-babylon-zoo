Riding into town 
On the wave of a crowd 
Your Majesty, 
They call him the Leopard Prince Word is going around 
There's a Groover in town 
Your eminence 
Calling out the Leopard Prince. I, I've been missing 
All the love you have to share 
It's my premonition 
Now it's plain to see 
That you were meant for me. Loving isn't physical. All the money's gone 
But I feel satisfied for once 
And my friends they play dead 
What a crazy world. Shooting up the town 
He's a fool on the prowl 
Your trajesty, 
They call him the Leopard Prince. People all around 
Grab a piece of his crown 
Humility 
Unveiling of the Leopard Prince. I should have listened 
To the words you have to say 
It's my premonition 
That now it's plain to see 
That you were meant for me. Loving isn't physical. All the money's gone 
But I feel satisfied for once 
And my friends they play dead 
What a crazy world The money's gone The money's gone
