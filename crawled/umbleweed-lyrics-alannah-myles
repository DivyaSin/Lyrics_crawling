Just a stray little Gypsy boy, 
Trying on the highway for size 
A cowboy kid cracking 105 
Crossing the New Mexico line I believe we got a live one here 
No inhibitions no fear Hey you wanna play your hand 
Or are you just playing for the girls in the grandstand 
Don't you wanna roll them bones 
Are you a tumbleweed or a rolling stone Tag along with my little vagabond 
As long as you got something to burn 
We'll slide on over to old Antone's 
There's a little game I think you should learn There's a big shot of the owner hanging over the bar 
Shaking hands with some rock and roll star Hey you wanna play your hand 
Or are you just playing for the girls in the grandstand 
Don't you wanna roll them bones 
Are you a tumbleweed or a rolling stone Well I'm glad I let you find me boy 
I been waiting for you 
Won't you be my brand new pride and joy 
I've been savin' up all my good luck until tonight On a roll he was on top of the world 
Till he laid it all on seven and nine 
Lost his shirt and his keys to the highway 
Looks like I'll be driving tonight Ten to one we'll take the long way home 
We've got ignition, so let's go Hey you wanna play your hand 
Or are you just playing for the girls in the grandstand 
Don't you wanna roll them bones 
Are you a tumbleweed or a rolling stone
