Got a picture of you sittin' in the kitchen 
Without a stitch on 
Beautiful and natural as can be 
Later in the gloaming hours 
In the garden, painting flowers 
All the boys they flock to you 
Wanna do more than talk to you 
Right now 
Dontcha wanna be Anna Leeeeeeeee 
Anna Leeeeeeeee Maybe it was love and peace and 
Living in the sweetest season 
Wonderland, the sweetheart of the sun Now we want to celebrate her, 
All of us who came in later 
Quiet power, simple grace 
No man can put you in your place 
Right now 
We all wanna be
