Look around and cry aloud 
Seems so much is happening but I have found 
When you awake the sky will shine 
Even on a cloudy day Want to be where I can see 
Oh, so much is happening to you and me 
Oh, will it end, will day turn black? Will we ever see things right? 
Oh, and how can we make it through the night? I'm like a train that's jumping the track 
Caught up in the slide and I'll never come back 
I turn around and look for a way 
Nothing that I can do, nothing that I can say What a life I was living before 
Hard to see if you can't find a door 
Seen the turning, know it's burning me 
To be with you I'm like a train that's jumping the track 
Caught up in the slide and I'll never come back 
I turn around and look for a way 
Nothing that I can do, nothing that I can say I'm like a train that's jumping the track 
Caught up in the slide and I'll never come back 
I turn around and look for a way 
Nothing that I can do, nothing that I can say I'm like a train that's jumping the track 
Caught up in the slide and I'll never come back 
I turn around and look for a way 
Nothing that I can do, nothing that I can say I'm like a train that's jumping the track 
Caught up in the slide and I'll never come back 
I turn around and look for a way
