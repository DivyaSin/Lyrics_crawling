Can you feel the speed? 
There's no speed 
A stable course no destination 
Can you change, can I change? 
Can you breathe? 
Let your words be our detonator [Chorus] 
Let's fall, let's fly 
Our hopes our guns 
Let's change the orbit of the sun 
It's either rise or demise 
I won't fade out 
I won't let these clouds moor in your eyes 
And as we're holding hands 
Stand up, pull the trigger 
As universe falls apart 
Don't fall into dementia 
We're changing course 
We break the chains of inertia A slow decay 
In this eternal dance 
Are we the victims or the guilty ones? 
Faces talking the rotten words 
Is it cruel fate or the path you chose? An age of numbness 
We're deaf and blind 
Fed off delusions 
Prisoners of our minds 
You think you 're moving 
But you 're standing still 
Don't blame the gravity 
When you have wings Can you touch the sky? 
There 's no sky 
Faded blue a vague concept 
Can you make a step? 
Can you breathe? 
Let our words be a detonator [Chorus] We break the chains of inertia 
We break the chains of inertia
