I don't care what shirt you wear 
And I don't want you to know my show? 
You make me feel so nice 
Get off your horse and kiss me twice 
You taught me how to ride at night, 
And quite alright... My big city smile, won't last that long? 
You gonna need a while, to cut my tongue 
But instead we try, we say goodby You are so cute, crystal cowboy cute 
You are so neat, so street so sweet 
You are a gun and I better run 
And I say goodby (say good by)...
