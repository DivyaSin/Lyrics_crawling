Baby, please stop messin' 'round 
You're messin' 'round all the time 
Baby, please stop messin' 'round 
You're messin' 'round all the time 
You don't stop messin' 'round 
You'll be somebody's baby instead of mine, oh You're rockin' the baby to my face 
It's cherry red 
You rock me so hard, babe 
I fallin' right out of bed I said, stop messin' 'round 
You're messin' 'round all the time, wooh 
You don't stop messin' 'round 
You'll be somebody's baby instead of mine, oh You're rockin' the baby to my face 
It's cherry red 
You rock me it so hard, babe 
I fallin' right out of bed
