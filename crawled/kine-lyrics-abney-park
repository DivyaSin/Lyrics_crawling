Bring a line of the people 
Bring down, scoop 'em up. 
Take the life from the people, 
Go down, and move up. This is were I reveal myself, 
Were I show that I'm not fine. 
Can't follow the cattle people, 
Not one of the Kine. This is were I reveal myself, 
Were I show that I'm not fine. 
Can't follow the cattle people, 
Not one of the Kine. This is were I redeam myself, 
Were I show that I'm not blind. 
Can't follow your party's people, 
Not one of your kind. Still I pray, that I'll escape one day. No food, for the soul, no friends, no goal 
No food, for the soul, no friends, no goal. 
No food, for the soul, no friends, no goal 
No food, for the soul, no friends, no goal. Here's your cube 
Here's your stall, 
Here's your phone, 
On the wall. Bring a line of the people 
Take their life, take it all.
