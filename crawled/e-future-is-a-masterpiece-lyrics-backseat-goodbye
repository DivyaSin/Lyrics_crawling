Fuck love, I'm gonna keep my day job 
Celebrate the life that I've already got 
With a bottle of something 
That'll make this day less relevant Fuck life, I'm gonna put up a fight 
From what I hear the trend is that we're all gonna die 
So if I'm gonna fuck it up 
Then I might as well fuck it up right Everybody knows how 
(Everybody knows how) 
Tomorrow's such a letdown 
(Tomorrow's such a letdown) 
We wake up wondering 
Just to do it all over again But no one wants to admit 
(But no one wants to admit) 
Actually kinda like it 
(Actually kinda like it) 
End up with another reason 
Not to give up just yet Fuck life, I'm gonna put up a fight 
From what I hear the trend is that we're all gonna die 
So if I'm gonna fuck it up 
Then I might as well fuck it up right You can't go to hell if it isn't real 
But if it is I'm sure I'll see you there 
We can talk about how surprised we are it even exists You said you have to go, I don't, don't really know 
Why you tend to give up 
There's so much more if only you'd look 
C'mon
