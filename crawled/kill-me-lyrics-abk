(Verse 1) 
You better kill me or you die, 
47 Bullets fillin the sky, 
When Anybody Killa ride, ain't no stoppin' me, 
Bulletproof preventin' you from poppin' me, 
Unless your targets on my face, don't think to call yo'self a G', 
Cause me and my heater dont like no set trippin' hoes buggin' hard in my warzone, 
Crack ya' dome to the skull. 
Blame it on the alcohol, mix it with the Tylenol. 
And peel ya' body off the wall. (Chorus) 
You betta kill me or you die, 
I was put here to kill people, 
but that's the reason that I'm alive. 
You betta kill me or you die, 
I was put here to kill people, 
but that's the reason that I'm alive. (Verse 2) 
Bitch, I'll kill you for your necklace, 
and drag yo' ass behind my ride around the hood, and say "I'm just being senseless". 
And flash the brights on the cops like "Fuck Ya'll!". 
Keep your bitches on your toes, better duck ya'll, 
Three bullets enter into the automobile, 
Now ones coughing blood and the other hugs the steering wheel, 
Now I'm peelin' out down the alleyway, 
ABK is a killa and the killas dont play. (Chorus) (Verse 3) 
Say I'm a dead man. Just ask my homie Blaze, 
Cause we've been chokin' motherfuckers since the old days, 
And there's something about chokin' a motherfucker out that makes you wanna scream and shout, 
and rip his motherfuckin' soul out. 
Stab you in the shower with a Matchete blade, 
watch the blood trickle down like black cherry kool aid. 
Cause' I dont want you livin'. And plus it's Killa High, 
So, if you steppin', better kill me or you fuckin' die! (Chorus)
