There's a story people tell 
of a special place in hell ... 
A place so horrific, it's .... 
just terrific for spammers Where they can toil among their own 
Reap what they have sown. 
With slimeballs, slackers, scoundrels, hackers, and scammers. Where they're forced to work 
at the speed of berserk 
While hearing the devils taunts. To their colleagues in hell, 
they're sentenced to sell 
Crap ... that nobody wants. Chorus To hell with spammers 
And to all of their buddies as well 
Let's tell the spammers 
No more talking - now It's time to yell We should put up a clamor 
throw 'em all in the slammer. 
And after that ... 
they can all go to hell Verse 2 
They'll steal your Passwords in a flash 
Your contacts and your cash 
Their selfish cheating has us all 
deleting and deleting ... And deleting And then some bastard sends 
A virus to all your friends 
It's a sad fact of living 
The gift that keeps giving And giving. Aww, It all makes me curse, 
but what's really the worst, 
gets me snippy, snarky and snorting. First my focus is blown 
By the sound of the phone 
Then I'm spammed by a damned recording. Chorus 
I say to hell with spammers 
Don't let 'em poison the well 
We gotta quell them spammers 
We gotta ring their closing bell We should put up a clamor 
throw 'em all in the slammer. 
And after that... 
they can all rot in hell
