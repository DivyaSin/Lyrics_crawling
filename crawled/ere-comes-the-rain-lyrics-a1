Theres a chill in the air 
Looks like the winter is returning 
You know, I have to stay 
Until I find a way to get through this Nothing ventured 
Nothing gained 
Now theres no healin' 
Without some kind of pain Hey baby, things have got to change Here comes the rain 
No need to hide 
I know the sun shines 
On the other side Oh, let the storm roll over me 
Just tear these walls once and for all 
And set me free 
Here comes the rain I left it all to chance 
Maybe the odds were all against me 
Now its outta my hands 
But I will see it through if you let me Nothing ventured 
Nothing gained 
Theres no healin' 
Without some kind of pain Can you tell me baby? 
We cant go on this way Here comes the rain 
No need to hide 
I know the sun shines 
On the other side Oh, let the storm roll over me 
Just tear these walls once and for all 
And set me free 
Here comes the rain Were the truth behind the lie 
All the dreams we left to die 
Were just rivers runnin' dry Here comes the rain 
No need to hide 
I know the sun shines 
On the other side Oh, let the storm roll over me 
Just tear these walls once and for all 
And set me free 
Here comes the rain No need to hide 
I know the sun shines 
On the other side Oh, let the storm roll over me 
Just tear these walls once and for all 
And set me free 
Here comes the rain
