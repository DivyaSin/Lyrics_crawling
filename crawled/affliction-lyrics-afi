All wrapped in untold lies 
New heights in genocide 
Flawless, I am flawless All my friends and I 
Toast health and suicide 
[Incomprehensible] c'mon 
Were you holding hands when my palms bled? Oh I will be all right 
Just use me 
Just use me 
The future's bright without me 
Spend some time, walking the line World is unified 
Ennui, and I divide 
Flawless, I am flawless 
Red days and burning might 
Bleed til the faceless die 
[Incomprehensible] 
Were you holding hands when my wrists bled? Oh I will be all right 
Just use me 
Just use me 
The future's bright without me 
Spend some time walking the line 
Spend some time walking the line So stay sweetly numb 
Remain lifeless, love 
So stay sweetly numb 
Maintain lifeless love 
Stay sweetly numb 
Remain lifeless, love Oh I will be all right 
Just use me 
Just use me 
The future's bright without me 
Spend some time walking the line 
Spend some time walking the line [Incomprehensible] 
Walking on it!
