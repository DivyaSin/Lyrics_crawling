Back of the boat was painted wrecking-ball 
There was country music playing but he don't like it all 
And red fire poppin' on the rained-down woody 
There was whiskey bottle-spilling and a lake, it was made of salt Well, look out back, there was a note on the door it saying 
"Everybody listen, we will be the next Omaha" Well, if you find yourself falling apart 
Well, I am sure I could steer 
The great salt lake 
Falling apart 
Well, I am sure I could steer 
The great salt lake Your old man was but a wishing machine 
It's time that you could spin 
Now that he is getting old 
When Billy Lorett had found a watering hole 
It's a place to lay south or the heads of coyote Now, if you find yourself falling apart 
Well I am sure I could steer 
The great salt lake Follow me home 
We want more 
Follow me home 
We all want more 
If ever beat down 
We know who we are 
They know who we are 
If ever beat down 
We know who we are 
They all know we want more
