(Raoul) 
Miss Giry, he's not mephistopheles you know 
When it comes down to it, he's just another circus freak 
I'm not afraid of him 
(Phantom) 
Not afraid of me you say? 
Stay back, or I'll kill you, I promise (Raoul) 
Insolent boy (Phantom) 
You think you own more of a soul than I do? 
She is my wife (Raoul) 
Your music may speak to her 
But her heart will always follow me 
(Phantom) 
You think so? 
You really think so? 
Follow you? 
With all your... "charms" 
Look at you, deep in debt 
Stinking drunk, pitiful 
Shall we two, make a bet? 
Devil take the hindmost (Raoul) 
Look at you, foul as sin 
Hideous, horrible 
Call the stakes, deal me in 
Devil take the hindmost (Phantom) 
Our Christine shall choose tonight 
(Let her choose) 
Is she yours or mine? 
(Draw the line) If she sings, you lose tonight 
(I won't lose) 
You leave from here 
(Fine) 
Disappear 
(Fine) (Raoul) 
And if she won't, if I win 
(All your debt's wiped away) 
Very well, let's begin 
Devil take the hindmost You think you have the odds 
(Our old game) 
You think you're in control 
(It's been changed) You think you've fixed the dice 
(Every throw) 
Well, I will gladly roll 
(Riskier) I'll bet against the house 
(All the rules) 
I'll even double down 
(Rearranged) 
(Fate has redesigned most) 
Fortune's on my side I won her long ago 
(Cut the deck) 
I won her from you then 
(Let us play) I beat you even now 
(You and I ) 
I'll win her back again 
(Once again) (In the end) 
And when the game is done 
Either way (Together) 
Devil take the hindmost Now Christine shall choose at last 
Is she yours or mine? 
We've a son, our bond's secure 
Are you sure? 
What? 
Are you so sure? What do you mean? 
Such a child, strange to see, talented, musical 
Huh? 
Is he more you or me? 
Which one do you find most? 
You lie 
(Yet you doubt) 
No woman could 
(Doubt your wife) 
Or ever would 
(Doubt your son) 
Love such a man 
(Everything) 
You're insane 
(Doubt your life) 
Now we play, for your life (Phantom) 
(So now I play for my life) 
Devil take the hindmost 
Deal the cards 
(I call your bluff) 
Let them fall 
(The game is on) Choose your hand 
(And we will see) 
Try your best 
(Who wins out) He who wins 
(Once and for all) 
Wins it all 
Devil take the hindmost She walks, you leave together (Phantom) 
Pockets full, debts paid 
She sings, you leave alone 
Devil take the hindmost Dear God (Raoul) 
What have I done? 
I could lose her forever 
My Christine!
