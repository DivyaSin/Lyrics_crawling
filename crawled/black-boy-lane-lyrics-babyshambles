aint going back to black boy lane, 
No I aint going back to black boy lane, 
There must be some other way, 
Because I aint going back to black boy lane, 
Never again... Do you think you can help? 
Can't you make me a call? 
We're so near to town, 
I can't get nothing at all 
Today, are you dancing today? 15 Track-suits coming up my lane, 
15 Track-suits coming up my lane, .................., 
There's the men; the ones you must lay, 
In which you must lay down and die, Oh as opposed to strutting all day, 
Strutting all night, 
Strutting on 'brown,' 
Strutting on 'white,' All day, 
Are you dancing today? Ah there's a bullet there with my name, 
So I aint going back to black boy lane, 
Never, never again, What about the fella you knew from sometime before, 
In the house by the park with a cage on the door, 
You phone and you say, are you dancing today? 
Are we dancing today?
