Don't wanna be a loser, gonna win 
'Cuz winnin' really is the only thing 
Get out of the way we're comin' in 
If you wanna fight just step inside the ring 
Does anybody wanna take a swing? 
It's gotta be all or nothin' 
Oh, we're gonna be the champions 
Yeah, we're goin' all the way, we're gonna win, win We're gonna win

And then we're gonna get a few more 
Maybe another one just to be sure 
We'll make you look just like an amateur 
Until the final whistle it's a war 
And then we're gonna pick you off the floor 
We wanna hear the crowd really roar 
Yeah, we're comin' in we're gonna win, win

Don't wanna be a loser, gonna win 
'Cuz winnin' really is the only thing 
Get out of the way we're comin' in 
If you wanna fight just step inside the ring 
Does anybody wanna take a swing? 
It's gotta be all or nothin' 
Oh, we're gonna be the champions 
Yeah, we're goin' all the way, we're gonna win, win
