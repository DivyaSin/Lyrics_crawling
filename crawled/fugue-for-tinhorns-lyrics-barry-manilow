I got the horse right here, his name is Paul Revere 
And here's a guy who says if the weather's clear 
Can do, can do, this guy says the horse can do 
If he says the horse can do can do, can do I'm picking Valentine Cause on the morning line 
The guy has got him figured at 5 to 9 
Has chance, has chance, this guy says the horse has chance 
If he says the horse has chance has chance, has chance No way for Paul Revere I'll bite, I hear his foot's all right 
Of course it all depends if it rained last night 
I know it's Valentine, the morning works look fine 
Besides the jockey's brother's a friend of mine Needs race, needs race 
This guy says the horse needs brakes 
He says that the horse needs brakes 
Needs race brakes, needs brakes Hey wait a minute fellows, 
Have you considered this? 
Well, anyway, it's my turn to sing 
So shut up, really? But look at Epitaph, he wins it by a half 
According to this here in the Telegraph 
Big threat, big threat, this guy calls the horse big threat 
If he calls the horse big threat, big threat, big threat I'll tell you Paul Revere, now this is no bum steer 
It's from a handicapper that's real sincere 
I go for Valentine 'cause on the morning line 
The guy has got him figured 5 to 9 So make it Epitaph, he wins it by a half 
According to this here in the Telegraph 
Paul Revere, Valentine, Epitaph 
I got the horse right here
