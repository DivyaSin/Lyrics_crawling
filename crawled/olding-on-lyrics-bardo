Ohh yeah 
I'm sitting here by myself 
But I don't want to feel this way 
I've been missing, I've been missing your love 
There's never been nobody so good 
Your so special to me 
I'm not losing, I'm not losing your love 
I always thought that I could do my thing 
But I didn't know what your love could bring [Chorus] 
Since you came along 
Baby I've been holding on 
Since you came along 
Baby I've been holding on I'm gonna call you every day 
Until I've got you by my side 
'Cause I've been missing, I've been missing your love 
I'll never say goodbye no no 
I'm never gonna do you no wrong 
I'm not losing, I'm not losing your love 
I always thought no one for me 
But I didn't know how good your love could be [Chorus] Your standing by my side when things go wrong 
You hold me in where I belong 
I've never been down since you came my way 
'Cause every time you smile 
Baby you make my day [Chorus]
