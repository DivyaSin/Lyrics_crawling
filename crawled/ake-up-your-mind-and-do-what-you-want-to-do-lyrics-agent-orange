You know you don't have time to sit around 
Waiting for the perfect chance to come your way 
And you'll never find the answers to the questions you ask 
By listening to what other people say You've got to let originality be your inspiration 
You know plagiarism is a crime 
(Dexter!) 
Even if it turns out to be a miserable disaster 
You will live to try another time that's why I say Make up your mind and do what you want to do Well you've got to be joking, if you say your thoughts 
Have fallen into someone else's hands 
And you've got to be crazy, if you think your life 
Is just a mess of threats and tough demands Well you just can't be that far away from what you want 
To think that nothing's gonna get you there 
'cause the truth is you were born with everything you need 
No, you don't have to be a billionaire all you have to do is Make up your mind and do what you want to do If you're gonna do it, do it right! 
In the end you're gonna see that it was worth your time 
The results are gonna make you smile 
There's really nothing to it, if you use your head 
And concentrate for just a little while All it takes is just a twist of your wild imagination 
New ideas will come tumbling out 
Can you feel the time slipping? 
Don't keep the world waiting 
Listen up, if you can hear me shout Make up your mind and do what you want to do
