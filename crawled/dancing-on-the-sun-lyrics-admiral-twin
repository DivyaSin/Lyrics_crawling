Have you never noticed 
That we're dancing, dancing, 
Dancing on the sun? 
That's why we're moving so fast 
It gets rather warm 
Seasons come and go 
But we keep dancing 
Provocative 
Oceans try to drown us 
But they all burn away 
And we never cease I can tango like a Spanish don 
Lightly do my feet trip 
'cross the flames 
And you are my love 
You are my tormentor 
Your hand presses mine 
And they melt into one Have you never noticed 
That we're dancing, dancing, 
Dancing on the sun? 
That's why we're moving so fast 
It gets rather warm 
Seasons come and go 
But we keep dancing 
Provocative 
Oceans try to drown us 
But they all burn away 
And we never cease I've been to the center of the earth 
I've been to the bottom of the sea 
And then there was you 
We met in Idaho 
You slapped my face 
And we took off from there Have you never noticed 
That we're dancing, dancing, 
Dancing on the sun? 
That's why we're moving so fast 
It gets rather warm 
Seasons come and go 
But we keep dancing 
Provocative 
Oceans try to drown us 
But they all burn away 
And we never cease Salamander 
Salamander 
I recall your breath in my ear 
I can feel your arms around me 
Stay there 
Please come near, I said 
Salamander 
Salamander 
I recall your breath in my ear 
I can feel your arms around me 
Stay there 
Please come near, I said Have you never noticed 
That we're dancing, dancing, 
Dancing on the sun? 
That's why we're moving so fast 
It gets rather warm 
Seasons come and go 
But we keep dancing 
Provocative 
Oceans try to drown us 
But they all burn away 
You know they all burn away
