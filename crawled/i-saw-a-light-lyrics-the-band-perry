Well I never felt nothing like I did tonight 
You had the face of a boy that I met in a dream one time 
Some heard it thunder and so did I 
I swear it happened when your eyes met mine Maybe it was just the way the wind blew 
Maybe it was God and his son too 
But in that moment I know that I knew that I, 
I found you I saw a light I, 
Heard a bell 
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt 
And suddenly you are standing here, mine all mine well 
I saw a light I, saw a light Well I still can't believe someone left you laying around 
Something precious like you should have already been found What if I'd stayed home and done nothing tonight 
What if you had looked left and I had looked right 
For once in our lives we were both on time and now 
I found you I saw a light I 
Heard a bell 
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt 
And suddenly you are standing here, 
Mine all mine well 
I saw a light I 
Saw Somebody told me 
When I was younger 
Chance is like lightning 
Love is like thunder 
So I walked right over 
Asked for your number 
'Cause somebody told me when I was younger I saw a light I 
Heard a bell 
You were the very best feeling, that I ever felt 
And suddenly you are standing here before my eyes 
The thunder in my heart it tells me, you are mine well 
I saw a light I 
Saw 
A light
