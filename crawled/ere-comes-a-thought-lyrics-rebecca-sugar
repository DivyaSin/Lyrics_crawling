[Garnet]: Take a moment to think of just, 
Flexibility love and trust, 
Take a moment to think of just, 
Flexibility love and trust Here comes a thought, 
That might alarm you, 
What someone said, 
And how it harmed you, Something you did, 
That failed to be charming, 
Things that you say, 
Are suddenly swarming, And oh, you're losing sight, 
You're losing touch, 
All these little things, 
Seem to matter so much, That might confuse you, 
That I might lose you, Take a moment, remind yourself to, 
Take a moment and find yourself, 
Take a moment to ask yourself if, 
This is how we fall apart, But it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not, 
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, 
You've got nothing, got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to fear, 
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, [Stevonnie]: Here comes a thought,

I've got nothing, got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to fear, 
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, And it was just a thought, just a thought, just a thought, just a thought, just a thought, 
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, 
We can watch, we can watch, we can watch, we can watch them go by, 
From here, from here, from here, [Stevonnie]: Take a moment to think of just,
