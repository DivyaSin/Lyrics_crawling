So I hopped on a train three in the afternoon 
I don't know when I'm coming back, 
But I hope that it's soon 
See, i never thought (never thought) 
That I'd have to leave your side (your side) It's only physically 
But you know that you will be on my mind 
Twenty-four hours at a time 
Cause in my eyes, you were mine (you were mine) No matter where you go, I won't be very far 
Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are 
Cause love has no distance baby 
Love, love has no distance baby 
No, not when it comes to you and me See, she wrote me a letter, said the weather wasn't better 
But she says that she was doing fine 
"i want to see you face to face", that's what she wrote to me that day 
And i knew that it was all a sign 
So i wrote back with this song, 
promise it won't be too long 
Wanna make up for all our lost time 
Cause in my eyes, you were mine (you were mine) No matter where you go, i won't be very far 
Cause in my head i'll be right there where you are 
Cause love has no distance baby 
Love, love has no distance baby 
No, not when it comes to you and me So i'm going through these boxes, my life's gone off track 
It's been three years, she hasn't written back 
But in my eyes, she's still mine 
And i know it sounds so stupid to be waiting this long 
But i'm still in love, and i know i'm not wrong 
Cause in my eyes, she was mine No matter where you go, i won't be very far 
Cause in my head i'll be right there where you are 
Cause love has no distance baby 
Love, love has no distance baby 
No, not when it comes to you and me No matter where you go, i won't be very far 
Cause in my head i'll be right there where you are 
Cause love is no distance baby 
Love, love has no distance baby, no 
Not when it comes to you and me
