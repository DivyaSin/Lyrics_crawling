Rest here a while, she said 
Don't go away just yet 
If you leave me all alone you won't know 
what I really meant to say just before you hit the road that 
though I tried to find a way, my words could not convey I'd say baby, baby don't you leave me here tonight alone 
I don't want you to go home 
I don't want to be alone 
Baby, maybe if I said you to that I'd turn out the light 
Would you come to life? Would you take that dive? So tell me to go and I'll stick around. We can both watch this ship go down 
Ask the right questions, I'll tell the right lies. 
Just don't leave me here tonight 
If you came back to me and sang fa la la la to me now it would be alright 
So, just tell me to go and I'll stick around 
Just don't leave me here tonight Alone. Waiting for you. Waiting by the phone 
Its clear to me you're not coming home. Where can you be? 
What? Out getting high late night? Just be by my side 
I can't let you deny. I won't let you try and hide Baby, baby don't you leave me here tonight alone 
I don't want you to go home 
I don't want to be alone 
Baby, maybe if I said you to that I'd turn out the light 
Would you come to life? Would you take that dive? 
And the mercury climbs. So tell me to go and I'll stick around. We can both watch this ship go down 
Ask the right questions, I'll tell the right lies. 
Just don't leave me here tonight 
If you came back to me and sang fa la la la to me now it would be alright 
So, just tell me to go and I'll stick around 
Just don't leave me here tonight So, just come back tonight and sing fa la la la just like this 
Fa la la la la. Baby, baby don't you leave me here tonight alone 
I don't want you to go home 
I don't want to be alone 
Baby, maybe if I said you to that I'd turn out the light 
Would you come to life? Would you take that dive? 
And the mercury climbs 
And the mercury climbs 
And the mercury climbs as I Descend
