The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout 
Down came the rain and washed the spider out 
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain 
And the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again Oh, look out, here he comes again The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout 
Down came the rain and washed the spider out 
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain 
And the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again I love that story
