I am stretched on your grave 
And I'll lie there forever 
If your hands were in mine 
I'd be sure we'd not sever 
My apple tree, my brightness, 
It's time we were together 
For I smell of the Earth 
And I'm worn by the weather. When my family thinks 
That I'm safely in my bed 
From morn until night 
I am stretched at your head 
Calling out to the air 
With tears both hot and wild 
For the loss of a girl 
I loved as a child. Do you remember the night 
The night when we were lost 
In the shade of the blackthorn 
And the chill of the frost? 
Oh, and thanks be to Jesus 
We did what was right 
And your maidenhead still 
Is your pillar of light. I am stretched on your grave 
And I'll lie there forever 
If your hands were in mine 
I'd be sure we'd not sever Oh, the priests and the friars 
They approach me in dread 
For I love you still 
My wife, and you're dead 
I still will be your shelter 
Through rain and through storm 
And with you in your cold grave 
I cannot sleep warm So I am stretched on your grave 
And I'll lie there forever 
If your hands were in mine 
I'd be sure we'd not sever 
My apple tree, my brightness, 
It's time we were together 
For I smell of the Earth 
And I'm worn by the weather. So I am stretched on your grave 
And I'll lie there forever 
If your hands were in mine 
I'd be sure we'd not sever
