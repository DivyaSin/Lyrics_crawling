And everything that mattered to me is now gone 
This feeling is nothing yet it feels so strong 
Now I've falling so fast i can't see the light 
I see the line start to blur between wrong and right 
I know it's all fake just a way to escape 
I can't even wait cuz it might be too late 
I know I did this to myself it's what I wanted to be 
Now take a closer look and tell me what you see Tell me what you see 
Tell me what you see 
Tell me what you see 
Tell me what you see 
Tell me what you see 
Tell me what you see 
Tell me what you see 
Tell me what you see
