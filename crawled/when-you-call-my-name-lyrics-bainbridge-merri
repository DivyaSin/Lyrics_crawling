I'm set adrift with a kiss 
In the ocean of your love 
You swim to me 
Your sos is loud and clear 
I've a lifeboat waiting here 
You swim to me 
Don't you worry now 
Angels will fall at your feet 
Mountains will slide into the sea 
All your stormy clouds will leave 
When you call my name 
I will be there 
When you need my light 
I will be there 
Through your darkest night 
When you call my name 
As day returns from the night 
We will sail into the light 
And we'll be happy 
On waves of blue seas of dreams 
Places we have never been 
and we'll be happy 
Don't you worry now 
Angels will fall at your feet 
Mountains will slide into the sea 
All your stormy clouds will leave 
When you call my name 
I will be there 
When you need my light 
I will be there 
Through your darkest night 
When you call my name 
And if you feel the world is getting to you 
Running through you 
And theres a load that's resting on 
Your shoulders 
And if you feel like there's no other way 
You can run 
Take my hand we'll sail into the sun
