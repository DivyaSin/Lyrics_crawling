I've seen you in the nightclub 
I've seen you dressed up right 
But your heart's not beating through your pale white skin 
That's how i know that you'll never win Ah, ah it's just a dead end 
And there ain't no turning back 
I took your place you were a king for a day 
But somehow you never learn I didn't ask for this, it's just the way things turn 
And it hurts to go down in flames 
Ah, ah it's just a dead end 
And there ain't no turning back You got eight balls baby as a mattres in your bed 
13 tattooed on the back of your head 
Where will you go when all the things you see are black 
You try to change
