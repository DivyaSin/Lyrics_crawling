That big river's still rollin' through Memphis 
And on Beale street they still play the blues 
The smokie's still wear their halos 
It's heaven on earth in the mornin' dew They still make Jack Daniels in Lynchburg 
On the Opry, Mr Acuff's still keen 
You can get the best biscuits and gravy 
And Loretta can still really sing But there's no love in Tennessee 
At least not the kind I really need 
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand 
But they can't help me get you back again There's no love in Tennessee 
I know it's a beautiful place to be 
But without you here with me 
There's no love in Tennessee Remember up on look out mountain 
Our future seemed so clear 
Too bad, Colorado came between us 
Now I'll lookin' out through these tears But I still love the magic of Dixie 
Whoever said it gets in your blood, was right 
There's still no place better than home sweet home 
But there's somethin' missin' tonight There's no love in Tennessee 
At least not the kind I really need 
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand 
But they can't help me get you back again There's no love in Tennessee 
I know it's a beautiful place to be 
But without you here with me 
There's no love in Tennessee There's no love in Tennessee 
At least not the kind I really need 
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand 
But they can't help me get you back again 
There's no love in Tennessee
