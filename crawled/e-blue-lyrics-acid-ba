Across your face 
I see what you are 
You wanna kill the sun 
Blot out the stars 
I know you you're nothing 
You're so small 
You're fuckin nothing 
Nothing at all The sun burns on 
It reminds me of you 
The slit wrists of the sky 
Bleeding into the blue We twist beneath forever 
Do you know what you've done? 
Ants in the afterbirth 
Slugs under the sun 
Yeah I could not wake the dead man dreaming yeah 
Acid body murdered at the late show oh yeah 
Mutate me and breed yourseIves a savior 
I could not kill the dead man screaming 
Eat my dead cock oh yeah (x2) I have fallen deep in love with the sky 
Fragments of a sunbeam glowing on kitchen knife yeah 
Leaves will fall as everything must follow 
Kill your idol come on jump into the void 
Eat my cold shit Everybody whispers were birds fall dead 
I smell the yellow sickness churning inside your head 
Wiping flecks of foam twisting with rabies 
Bloody we run thru fields of dead daisies How can I ever make you know what you've done? 
Ants in the afterbirth, slugs under the sun I have fallen deep in love with sky 
Fragments of a sunbeam glaring on a kitchen knife
