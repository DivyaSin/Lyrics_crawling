On the streets of this town 
There is no surrender 
They've got a number for every name 
Buildings and shopping malls 
Seem like a stage for pretenders 
They criticize the clothes you wear 
They try to make you feel like a stranger 
Cause you do things they wouldn't dare 
Who cares who's right and who's wrong 
Because we know where we belong The wild heart is calling us 
Out in the night 
A primitive love in your eyes 
And out on the wasteland of broken dreams Go you and I 
We're the restless ones (Oh) 
Oh yeah 
The restless ones 
Step outside of yourself 
And you'll see through the changes Leave your mark 
Let them know you came 
But don't lead the rest of your lives In plastic cages 
Cause you do things they wouldn't dare 
Who cares who's right and who's wrong 
Because we know where we belong 
The wild heart is calling us 
Out in the night A primitive love in your eyes 
And out on the wasteland of broken dreams 
Go you and I 
We're the restless ones 
(Oh) 
Oh yeah 
That's all we'll ever be 
Yeah (oh) 
You're the restless one 
You're just like me 
And sometimes I just walk the streets at night Wonder where I'm going 
Can't relate to nothing no more 
But listen you hear it call 
The wild heart is taking us 
Out in the night 
A primitive love in your eyes 
And sometimes I feel like a loaded gun Cause just like you 
I'm the restless one 
(Oh) 
Oh yeah That's all I'll ever be 
Oh you're the restless one 
(Oh) 
And baby you're just like me 
Oh 
(Oh) 
Oh yeah You're the restless one 
You're the restless one 
(Oh) 
And that's all we'll ever be
