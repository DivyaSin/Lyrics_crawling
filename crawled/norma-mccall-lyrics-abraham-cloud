It was just another regulation 
Saturday night at the Gas Station 
We were hangin' out 
And the lights were shinin' down 
They were better when the night went on Somebody said there was a party downtown 
So we hopped in a car and left very quick 
We got there and it was really goin' on, I know Lights and colors flashin' all around 
And I found someone there that I really liked 
She said, "hey" I said, "Hello" 
And then when seeped up into the mellow of another pretty evening We got back almost three years later 
And I can't really remember much at all Please I said why don't you call 
She said, "My name is Norma McCall" Call me Norma McCall 
Call me Norma McCall 
Won't you Call me Norma McCall 
So I can remember what we were doing that night Call me Norma McCall 
Won't you Call me Norma McCall 
Won't you Call me Norma McCall 
So I can remember what we were doing that felt so right Wish I had you here right now so I could remember everything again Call me Norma McCall, won't you Call me Norma McCall 
So I can remember what we were doing that night that felt so right 
Won't you Call me Norma McCall 
Call me Norma McCall
