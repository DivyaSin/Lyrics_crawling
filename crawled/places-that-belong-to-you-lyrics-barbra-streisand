Mornings, evenings 
Days that hurried past 
Dreams that should have lasted 
Moments, hours Slipping by as we 
Told each other secrets 
Somehow I'll never let go of the memories 
Something always seems to remind me Of how it was of what it was 
What it was 
All there was 
Laughter, love songs Footsteps that I hear 
Make me think you're near me 
Poems, pictures 
Letters never mailed Boats that never sailed 
Remember that even though we can't be together 
We're more for having loved one another 
We shared the sky We learned to fly 
Someday when someone else?s arms are around us 
When time has put some distance between us 
The years will kindly show How memories come and go 
They ebb and flow like the tides 
There are quiet places in my heart 
Ever since we've parted Gentle, tender 
Traces of a song 
Places that belong to you
