Lean against the night and laugh 
As I try to scale the wall 
Ignored futility fills the air 
You're only there to watch me fall 
Watch me fall, watch me If only pure sweetness was offered 
Why's this bitter taste left in my mouth? 
And if I could catch my breath 
Just to exhale, I'd know that I held it in too long From above comes a faint smile 
A new vantage, such a view 
Familiarity, now disowned 
Just sit and stare as I walk away 
Walk away, watch me If only pure sweetness was offered 
Why's this bitter taste left in my mouth? 
If I could catch my breath 
Just to exhale, I'd know that I held it in too long If only pure sweetness was offered 
Why's this bitter taste left in my mouth? 
If I could catch my breath 
Just to exhale, I'd know that I held it in too long If only pure sweetness was offered 
(The bitterness) 
Why's this bitter taste left in my mouth? 
(Pure sweetness) 
If I could catch my breath 
(My breath) 
Just to exhale, I'd know that I held it in too long
