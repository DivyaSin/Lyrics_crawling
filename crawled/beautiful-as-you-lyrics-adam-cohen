Some people fall in love 
I've just been round the edges 
I'm still not really sure 
About what it is or how to get it 
Is love by chance or by seduction 
All that I have are vague assumptions Of what love must be like 
What love must feel like 
Tell me what does it look like 
Is it as beautiful as you are I've never been in love 
Does that surprise you 
I find myself alone 
In times when I don't want to be alone 
It's not that I am scared of going too deep 
It's just that I'm no good at pretending 
Starting or ending 
Causually I'm imagining Of what love must be like 
What love must feel like 
Tell me what does it look like 
Is it as beautiful as you are
