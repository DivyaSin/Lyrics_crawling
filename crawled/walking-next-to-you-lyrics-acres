When I feel like I might fall 
Underneath the pressure of it all 
I think of you, 
and it's alright When it's dark beyond the door 
and shadows trace my fears across the floor 
I look at you, 
and I see the light Chorus: 
All the inspiration that I need 
is when I hear you calling out for me 
and I will walk the only road that's true 
when I'm walking next to you. When I feel I'm doing this all wrong 
and I jumble broken phrases in a song 
you know how to speak through me When I get tangled up in grief 
and the remedies I take 
never offer up relief 
I talk to you and I am free All the inspiration to pull me through 
is in the smallest hand I've ever held on to. 
And I will walk the only road that's true 
when I'm walking next to you. When I feel I can't go on 
and it seems a thousand years before the dawn 
I reach for you 
and you keep me holding on Chorus
