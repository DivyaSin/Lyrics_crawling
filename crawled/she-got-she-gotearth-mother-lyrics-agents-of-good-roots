She got something for everyone 
She got something sweet that makes me want to come over 
She's got something out and she's got something in 
She got something sick on down beneath her skin 
Was it right for her to freak and (frequently) let me in 
Was it right for her to turn my brass (grass / ass) to sin 
Ponies on the beach right back into her head 
One more drink and we slip back into her bead But does that mean that I can't slip into another trance 
And completely take a trip into your eyes and I will turn you onto 
Mother don't you know I'm a slave to that soul 
Mother don't you know I'm just a fool to be your slave 
Mother don't you know I've got to dance on that grave 
Mother don't you know I'm a slave to that soul Rubies on a ring all make your lips get wet 
So I rap a string of pearls on down around her neck 
Take it in your arms and you can feel her thrust (crush) 
A twisted psychophonic (???) love of vixen lust
