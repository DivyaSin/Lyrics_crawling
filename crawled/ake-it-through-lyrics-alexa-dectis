Every day we wake up 
And we know just what to do 
Every day we set out 
And dreams of living we pursue 
Like a bird up in the sky 
Flying higher than high (Chorus) 
We know this life will go on 
That things won't always be this wrong 
You realize how much life means to you 
You know you're gonna make it 
You know you're gonna make it through, oh Every day we wonder why 
Our broken wings won't fly 
Every time we let go 
It's because we lost control 
Like a train without its tracks 
Trying hard not to crash (Chorus) Every time we close our eyes 
It's heaven that we see 
Another life is lost 
Another soul goes free 
You've risen up above (Chorus) Gonna make it through, oh 
You're gonna make it through
