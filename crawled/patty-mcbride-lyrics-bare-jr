Precious Patty McBride had nothin' to hide 
Her magical songs just poured out from inside 
For one to see her is for one to love her 
And to go to ya'll's friends and say Whoa, She's a star and she shines 
Lord knows why, godlike and divine 
For we all want to love her 
And we all want to be near her 
As if you too could shine Lately her press has been a mess 
They tell of bad taxes, drug habits and wine 
Did you hear her own mother would not even love her 
Yet her fans write letters that say Oh, you're a star and you shine 
Lord knows why, godlike and divine 
For we all want to love you 
And we all want to be near you 
As if we too could shine Back in Tennessee her old boyfriend reads 
About her new lover toned and tanned and perfect teeth 
Well, that old boyfriends mother says Hey, how's Patty 
With shame he turns to say Oh momma, she's a star and she shines 
Lord knows why, godlike and divine 
For I wanted to love her 
And I wanted to be near her 
As if I too could shine
