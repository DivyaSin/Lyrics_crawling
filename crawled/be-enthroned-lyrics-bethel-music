We've come to join the song 
Sung long before our lives 
To raise our voice along 
Heaven and earth alike We've seen Your faithful hand 
Your mercy without end 
A King who bled and died 
A God who sacrificed Be enthroned upon the praises of 
A thousand generations 
You are worthy, Lord of all 
Unto You the slain and risen King 
We lift our voice with heaven 
Singing worthy, Lord of all All through this life we lead 
And on through eternity 
Our endless praise, We'll cry 
Jesus be glorified
