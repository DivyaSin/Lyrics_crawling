Aaliyah "Plucked Like a Rose (Unreleased Track)" lyrics And it's like everything I knew 
Was taken so fast from me 
Everything so dear and true 
Decided to up and leave 
Me holding you tight 
No the same without you by side 
Boy you took my family 
And left it to just me 
Takin the wrong road on a track 
And I now I can't go back (Chorus) 
Plucked like a rose 
And who knows (who knows) 
When my petals will return 
Ohhh Im 
Plucked like a rose 
And I don't know why 
You'd do this to me 
But I know I'm... 
(Plucked like a rose) Aint even gonna lie 
Boy you know we had some good times 
Got leavin at eleven 
Had me creepin in at a quarter to seven 
I guess thats all men 
And thats how life goes 
But baby I know 
There was a promise 
To be more than any man Id meet 
You lied to me.... 
Oooooh.... (repeat chorus) And of course I'm gonna smile again 
But won't forget the pain I'm in 
You'll be something in the past 
But I thought what we had would last 
Never enough words to say 
To explain why you couldnt stay 
So quick to leave 
Was it you? Was it me? 
Oh baby.... (repeat chorus till end)
