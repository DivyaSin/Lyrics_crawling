I didn't think this could happen to me 
I wanted the easy road 
I had my parade, but it started to rain 
And now it looks out of control Why do I feel like Your hiding? 
Oh remind me again I am loved 
I am Yours 
I have someone beside me, I can't deny 
I am loved Sometimes we go to sleep wishing that we could be different then who we are 
Chasing our dreams has taken its toll on me 
I tried just a little too hard And I, I keep beating myself up 
Oh remind me again I am loved 
I am Yours 
I have someone to find me 
Someone to guide me home I am loved 
I'm not alone 
I have someone beside me 
And I can't deny I am loved You're not far away (x3) (echo) Maybe you're driving out there on the highway 
Feels like you're out on your own 
Let me remind you God never left you 
He's right there wherever you go You are loved 
You're not alone 
You have someone to find you 
Someone to guide you home You are loved 
You're not alone 
Cause God is beside you 
And He won't deny you are loved Cause God is beside you 
And He won't deny you are loved
