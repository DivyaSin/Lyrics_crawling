I went to London 
And every afternoon I had a spot of tea 
But it was lonely there by myself, I and me 
Without love So I went to Paris 
The city of love, all by myself 
Hopin' to find somebody else 
But there's no love for me I've been around the world 
To find another girl 
But there's no love 
There's no life without you I went to Alaska 
But this time of year, it's too damn cold 
It's not the kind of place you can go 
Without love So I went to Cairo 
Athens and ended up in Rome 
But then I realized I was too far from home 
But there's no love for me I've been around the world 
To find another girl 
But there's no love 
There's no life without you I check my message [???] 
Hopin' you're missin' me today 
And I didn't hear 
And now I'm filled with misery and pain So I went to Sydney 
Down under is when [???] 
Wastin' all the foolish time I spend 
Without love So I sent you flowers 
Hopin' it was me you missed 
I was thinkin' 'bout the first time we kissed 
And if you still have love for me I've been around the world 
To find another girl 
But there's no love 
There's no life without you
