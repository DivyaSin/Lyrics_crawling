Truck stop of the border 
Deep down in Mexico 
Runnin' back to California 
With a fresh-cut, heavy load White line fever 
It's summer time again 
White line fever 
It's business time again Flying in to New York City 
Bringin' the kingpin peace of mind 
That all his pawns west of liberty 
Will be well fed this June, July White line fever 
It's summer time again 
White line fever 
It's business time again From Colombia 
Up through Mexico 
To Atlanta 
All up and down the east coast 
From Juarez over to LA 
Houston, Miami, we got it made White line fever 
It's summer time again 
White line fever 
It's business time again White line fever 
White line fever 
White line straight down my vein 
White line drivin' me insane 
White line fever 
Give it to me straight 
White line fever 
Hit me again 
White line fever 
I can't get enough 
White line fever 
I love that stuff
