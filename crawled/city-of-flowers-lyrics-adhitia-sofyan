Pack your bags we're leaving out of town 
Wear that big black scarf wrapped around your pretty face 
I'm not gonna stand here hopelessly while I see you cry Leave those mess we'll jump in to the car 
Roll the windows down get your senses back to you 
And put out that cigarette that thing will kill you slowly And yeah, it only takes two hours from here 
Yeah, when we get there we'll write our brand new story We're going to a place I know, where I was born 
The city of flowers been waiting so long 
Life too short you could've been shot 
Remember this time, leave all your troubles behind All your life you've waited for a time when that someone comes 
To get your feet back on the ground 
I'll be that someone to help just like in that Beatles song So here we go we're going to a place 
At the rainbows end to put some colors back on you 
Let me be the gold and I will put the shine on you And yeah we only have two exits to go 
Yeah when we get there the pages will start turning And all the lies you heard before keep coming back to you 
They linger on the places you've longing to forget 
Well I won't lie, it won't be easy 
Sometimes they're back knocking on your door 
Now you tell them that you don't live here anymore
