How pale is the sky that brings forth the rain 
As the changing of seasons prepares me again 
For the long bitter nights and the wild winter's day 
My heart has grown cold, my love stored away 
My heart has grown cold, my love stored away I've been to the mountain, left my tracks in the snow 
Where souls have been lost and the walking wounded go 
I've taken the pain no girl should endure 
Faith can move mountains; of that I am sure 
But faith can move mountains; of that I am sure Just get me through December 
A promise I'll remember 
Get me through December 
So I can start again No divine purpose brings freedom from sin 
And peace is a gift that must come from within 
I've looked for the love that will bring me to rest 
Feeding this hunger beating strong in my chest 
Feeding this hunger beating strong in my chest
