I'll be you friend 
Though I love you like my brother 
There'll never be another baby [Chorus] 
Sister, sister (you're like a brother to me) 
Sister, sister (we go back like family) 
Sister, sister (nigga I knew you ever since day one) 
Sister, sister (man me and you be having mad fun) Yo girls be acting like they my sister 
What the fuck 
You mess around and get your sister's ass 
Incest up 
Talking about you can't buy them like your brother and shit But we don't got the same father never suck on the same mother's tits 
She'll have coming to this 
Putting lego sticks 
On my dick 
'Cause you cumquat and shit [Chorus] We used to conversate and shit 
For a little bit 
You told me about the guys you hit 
You said I probably lied about the girls In the world that I said I done hit 
But I let it pass 
With a simple laugh 
'Cause it was the beginning So I stay smiling and grinning 
Even when you joke and said my wrinkled sweater reminded you of 
Fucking crushed linen (that shirt is wrinkled like crushed linen ha ha) 
Anyway ha ha ha ha ha Had to find that funny 
So I said yo bitch would you fuck me for money 
Na na na I ain't said that I ain't said that chill chill chill 
This is what I said Hey listen yo 
Every time I try to set it off 
You be like no 
Quick and call the kid up every time you broke Talking about some nigga played you out 
Slapped you in your mouth 
And if I see you you want me to react like pulling on 
Risking mafia as I watch some kid's blood spill Why you run around town talking about(yo nigga I get you killed) 
Girl don't get me wrong 
I'm not ducking and shit 
Before I make moves I got to fuck and shit Bust a nut and shit 
In your gut and shit 
Fuck you down 
Turn you around 
In your butt and shit [Chorus] This right here 
Is for everyone who got an artificial sister 
This is just being sung for 
This is just being sung for 
This is just being sung for I'll be your friend 
Though I love you like my brother 
I can never be your lover Yo this song right here is dedicated to 
All the girls who want to be some dude's sister 
So she can get all the privileges of being the dudes girl 
Without fucking that mother fucker 
Know what I'm saying [Chorus]
