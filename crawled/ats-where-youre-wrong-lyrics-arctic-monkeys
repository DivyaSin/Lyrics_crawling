A pussyfooting setting sun 
Make a wish that weighs a ton 
There are no handles for you to hold 
And no understanding where it goes Jealously in Technicolor 
Fear by name, love by numbers 
Street lamp amber, wanderlust 
Hide her in a blunderbus She looks as if she's blowing at kiss at me 
And suddenly the sky is a scissor 
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine 
Crushing up a bundle of love 
Don't take it so personally 
You're not the only one 
That time has got it in for honey 
That's where you're wrong All the old flames fastened on 
Make a wish that weighs a ton 
There are no handles that you can hold 
And no understanding where it goes She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me 
And suddenly the sky is a scissor 
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine 
Crushing up a bundle of love 
Don't take it so personally 
You're not the only one, 
That time has got it in for honey That's where you're wrong 
That's where you're wrong 
That's where you're wrong
