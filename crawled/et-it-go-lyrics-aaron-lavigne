I hold you close 
Tell you that you're mine 
Knowing you were mine once before 
Needless to say, you've left. You're on your way 
Far from this place you once loved I don't know you and you don't understand 
Where have we both gone these days? 
I guess its time for me to have to say the hardest thing I'll ever have to say to you I'm in love with your kindness 
I've said it once or twice 
It's hard to go down easy when we're both so damn nice 
It's a shitty situation and I know that you're concerned 
But, to find the best part of me 
I guess you'll never learn 
Talk of love. Talk of joy 
We had our fill. We had our fun 
Now the only thing that's filling up is this liquid in my lungs Let it go 
Let it go 
We've got to let it go 
Let it go 
Please, we've got to let it go I'm not one to talk around the truth 
I'm not one who doesn't say what he feels but 
Honestly, I can't remember who laid the ground rules for me and you 
Feeling my heart break in two 
Feeling my heart break with you Now, I loved you like a never loved before 
But, I think you loved me more 
You always had so much love 
I'm sorry for these words that I sow 
They're the only ones I know 
And the only way I know to say I don't know you and you don't understand 
Where have we both gone these days? 
I guess its time for me to have to say the hardest thing I'll ever have to say to you I'm in love with your kindness 
I've said it once or twice 
It's hard to go down easy when we're both so damn nice 
It's a shitty situation and I know that you're concerned 
But, to find the best part of me 
I guess you'll never learn 
Talk of love. Talk of joy 
We had our fill. We had our fun 
Now the only thing that's filling up is this liquid in my lungs Let it go 
Let it go 
We've got to let it go 
Let it go 
Please
