Yeah, hey, I've seen the Bad Lands 
I've held a whirlwind in my hand 
Slept in the center 
Whiskey has washed away the sand, yeah Gamblers who cheated and sheriffs who lied 
The last thing they saw from the death that they died 
Was my Smokin' 45, my smokin' 45 Ten thousand dollars, that's what I'm worth dead or alive 
Six loaded chambers, ten men rode up not one survived 
They got my name on the telegraph wire 
Dead men's faces and a gun that's for hire Gamblers who cheated and Sheriffs who lied 
The last thing they saw from the death that they died 
Was my smokin' 45, my smokin' 45, yeah I'm riding south to the Mexico line 
Posse behind me and they're making good time 
Men with vendetta's, who shouldn't have tried 
To reach for quick fame with a gun at their side Against my smokin' 45, my smokin' 45, my smokin' 45 
I'm talking about my smokin' 45 My smokin' 45, smokin' 45, smokin' 45 Gonna get you, can depend my friend 
Gonna get you, dead or alive 
My smokin', smokin', smokin' 45, yeah
