Why you hating? 
Why you hating? [Verse 1: AJ Tracey] 
Suttons estate thats where a man first grew 
All of my gs were on a mad one too 
Last brudda thought he got a seat at the crem 
Sorry my brudda you got a 0.2 
Everybody from the west 10 shots food 
You ain't the guy and you are not that dude 
My block come like gears of war 4 
And your block summit like angry birds 2 
Every time that I had beef I flew 
Blade in my palm it werent to chop food 
How you saying west is booky that's rude 
I'll chef man down on god for my crew 
Don't think cause you're in black you're cold 
Tracksuit or not you're due to get moved 
No laser on the world war magnum 
Lift up the ting and make it go boom 
Don't think cause you're in a gang your hard 
Some man are better off sitting at yard 
Catch man tryna do a sprint on the pitch 
Take mans shit of the field red card 
You man trap for [?] from that jezzy 
Us man trap to grab to go bezzy 
Your girl said she needs me on her birthday 
I wrapped her pum pum like hold this prezzie [Hook: Remy Banks] 
And I don't know why all these niggas is hating on me 
I'm just living in the moment I'm waiting to see 
I know I'm nice I can hold my own on any beat 
And I make music so my team and my family can eat [Hook: AJ Tracey] 
I don't know why all these bruddas just keep hating on me 
I'm just living in this moment I'm waiting to see 
I got this talent I can light up the whole of the beat 
And I'ma use it so my momma and bruddas can eat [Verse 2: Remy Banks] 
I'm tryna escape 
Niggas wanna weigh me down 
Sink me to the bottom of the lake 
I won't let them drown the kid nah 
I gotta escape 
Hate tryna catch up too 
But I'm way too ahead of that 
Got too much on my back to let it get through 
What you want from me? 
Doing my thing tryna live better 
Tryna rock the world that's real shit 
Make sure my team on and we earning cheddar 
Yeah we here world's fair in the spot, world's fair in the spot 
Queens got a lock, yeah queens got a lock 
I'm a different type of nigga now 
Seen some of the world different digits now 
More wisdom, better weed, better women 
All on my di-dick now 
Still ain't got my foot in the door 
This rap game is elevated I gotta level up 
Be on the top floor, they hating [Hook: AJ Tracey] 
I don't know why all these bruddas just keep hating on me 
I'm just living in this moment I'm waiting to see 
I got this talent I can light up the whole of the beat 
And I'ma use it so my momma and bruddas can eat [Hook: Remy Banks] 
And I don't know why all these niggas is hating on me 
I'm just living in the moment I'm waiting to see 
I know I'm nice I can hold my own on any beat 
And I make music so my team and my family can eat [Verse 3: Remy Banks] 
They hating cause they fear what they can't understand 
Momma told me nigga always be your own man 
Never cared to follow trends cause they come to an end 
Just keep it gully, stay yourself till you're gone with the wind [Verse 4: AJ Tracey] 
They hating cause they insecure and scared of change 
Mummy always told me spread the love and get the change 
Never copy other niggas never chase the strange 
Just keep it real and do your thing till you're down in the grave [Hook: Remy Banks] 
And I don't know why all these niggas is hating on me 
I'm just living in the moment I'm waiting to see 
I know I'm nice I can hold my own on any beat 
And I make music so my team and my family can eat [Outro: AJ Tracey] 
Why you hating? 
Why you hating? 
I'm tryna live in Calabasas with the baddest yat 
Diamonds dancing couple bitches with fattest of backs 
I'm on my grind and I be chasing the fattest of racks 
I keep my head down and stack I ain't looking to chat 
And if a opp is on my arse I'ma grip it and blast 
I'm the truth go tell them niggas the realest will last 
And if a opp is on my arse I'ma grip it and blast 
I'm the truth go tell them niggas the realest will last
