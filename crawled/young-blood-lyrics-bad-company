I saw her standing on the corner, 
(ooh ooh ooh) 
A yellow ribbon in her hair, 
(ooh ooh ooh) 
I couldn't keep myself from callin' , 
Looky there, 
Looky there, 
Looky there, 
Oh looky there! Young blood, 
Young blood, 
Young blood, 
I can't get you outta my mind. I took one look and I was flattered 
(ooh ooh ooh) 
I tried to walk along the lane 
(ooh ooh ooh) 
I couldn't keep myself from shouting, 
What's your name? 
What's your name? 
What's your name? 
Oh what's your name? Young blood, 
Young blood, 
Young blood, 
I can't get you outta my mind. What crazy step 
She looked so tept 
I had to follow her all the way home 
Then things went bad 
I met her dad 
He said 
You'd better leave my daughter alone I couldn't sleep that night for crying 
(ooh ooh ooh) 
I saw the rising of the sun 
(ooh ooh ooh) 
And all along my heart was sighing 
She's the one 
She's the one 
She's the one 
Oh she's the one Young blood 
Young blood 
Young blood 
I can't get you outta my mind Young blood 
Young blood 
Young blood 
I can't get you outta my mind Young blood 
Young blood 
Young blood 
I can't get you outta my mind
