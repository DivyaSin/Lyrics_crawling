Muscular legs stompin' out the boulevard 
Muscular face and lips about a mile large 
Pluckin' out a leaf from a tree as she passes by 
I touch greenery a lot when I walk, she's a lot like me LET'S MAKE LOVE

LET'S MAKE LOVE After a while, on a street called Vine 
There she is again, standin' in a check-out line 
She's buyin' my brand (and that's generic) 
With a store-bought tan (but I'm not allergic) 
Looks at me as if to say,"Love is just a beer away."

LET'S MAKE LOVE go to the window. We could buy a twelve-pack and take it to the laundro-mat 
But why waste all our precious cash 
Gettin' ourselves good'n'trashed ?
