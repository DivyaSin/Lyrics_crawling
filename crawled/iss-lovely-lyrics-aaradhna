[Chorus] 
Hey miss lovely hey miss lovely you better look the other way cus Ill take the pretty smile and Ill turn that pretty smile into a frown hes so faithful Im so grateful he belongs to me shes tried so many times but in the end she always finds that hes falled to much in love with me Im losing patience she will be facing me very soon cus if she dont stop somebody better call the cops cus Ill come swinging
