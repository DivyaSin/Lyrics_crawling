(The Sisters of Mercy) In a sea of faces, in a sea of doubt 
In this cruel place your voice above the maelstrom 
In the wake of this ship of fools I'm falling further down 
If you can see me, Marian, reach out and take me home [Chorus] 
I hear you calling Marian 
Across the water 
Across the wave 
I hear you calling Marian 
Can you hear me calling you to 
Save me, save me, save me from the grave Marian 
Marian There's a weight above me 
And the pressure is all too strong 
To breathe deep, breathe long and hard 
To take the water down and go to sleep 
To sink still further beneath the fatal wave 
Marian I think I'm drowning 
This sea is killing me [Chorus] Marian 
Marian 
Marian
