ON MY WAY TO YOU 
THERE WAS THIS GIRL IN ALBUQUERQUE 
I DON'T THINK SHE REALLY MEANT TO HURT ME 
BUT SHE DID 
SO WHAT DID I DO 
MOVED IN WITH A GIRL IN KNEW FROM COLLEGE 
IF LOVED WALKED AWAY I NEVER SAW IT 
BUT SHE DID 
A LOT OF LITTLE THINGS FELL THROUGH 
ON MY WAY TO YOU I HURT I WALKED 
I RAN I CRAWLED 
LET LOVE MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL 
I LOST SOME TIME 
SPUN THESE WHEELS OF MINE 
SEARCHIN' FOR THE TRUTH 
ON MY WAY TO YOU ON MY WAY TO YOU 
I ONLY MADE ONE RIGHT DECISION 
I LEARNED WHAT REAL LOVE IS AND ISN'T 
IN YOUR ARMS 
MY AIM WAS TRUE 
TRUE AND HONEST AS YOUR BLUE EYES 
THAT LED ME ALL THE WAY THAT ONE NIGHT 
TO YOUR HEART 
LOST MY WAY A TIME OR TWO 
ON MY WAY TO YOU CHORUS
