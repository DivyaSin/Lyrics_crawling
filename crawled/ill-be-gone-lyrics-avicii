I gave my world away 
A million rainy days 
Such a shame in a way 
And no one else that I Sacrificed everything 
A million broken dreams 
And I don't want to stay 
I did it anyway The sun don't rise 
The moon won't shine 
The stars fall out of the sky 
And I could feel your guided light 
All through the night 
All through your life I'll be gone for you know each other 
Long, long, gone 
Now the world is spinning, like the sun 
Now the day is burning 
I don't mind, spending some time, on my own
