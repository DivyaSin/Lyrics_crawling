Ah, healin' 
Tried to burn the fire inside 
Now it's knockin' at your door 
Say hello to karma 
Yet through so many lies I wade 
The truth in time will lay you down to rest 
All that stands before me 
Will turn dark and full of life 
Yeah, yeah 
You close your eyes 
Your nightmare sweats 
And life's a bitch 
Say hello my friend 
Steady life is on the end 
Blood will spell your game 
All that stands before me 
Will turn dark and full of life 
Yeah, yeah 
Lord I'm healin', oh 
All that stands before me 
Will turn dark and full of life 
Yeah, yeah 
Lord I'm healin' 
Yes, I'm healin' 
Lord I'm healin' 
Don't try to steal my soul 
Lord I'm healin' 
Everybody knows your name 
Everybody knows your name 
Yeah, karma, karma, karma, karma, karma 
Knockin' at your door
