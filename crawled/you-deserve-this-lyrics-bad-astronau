Short story from the one who wrote this 
And you're a stranger they know well 
You read their mind and left your life an open book 
Now you wanna die in some hotel 
You deserve this 
God damn, in some respect you've earned it 
Who wants to change this bogus world? 
Hey mom it's me or someone on our window sill 
Yell I ain't disturbing your quiet numb 
If something gets lost 
If something breaks, I'll be wide awake 
Not that this revelation's changing anyone at all 
And all of your new friends, they seem boundless 
And all of that money spends you flat 
I'm sure that something bad will come of this review 
Some past due like karma or revenge 
I deserve this
