words and music: Steven Rhodes 
Drivin in my car 
Drivin but I don't know where I'm goin but I know I'm going far 
Far away 
Far from the city of the lights down by the bay 
Gonna find me a better place 
I want to throw away this costume and take this mask off my face 
I've been livin a lie 
Livin but I don't know who I am and for what and for why 
Why'm I here 
Who knows why we're here and I sure don't but oh? 
Dear, I'll never be comin round here again 
This is my last song to you, I break all ties 
And when I leave things behind, I don't look back 
And I don't face the facts 
Now ahead 
I see a new city of lights and new, better, happier nights 
I see places 
Nothing that I fear and once again I say 
Chorus
