Well I made some mistakes and at least privately it takes 
And here's another one 
And I said "it would be okay" 
But that's a lie, man 
I mean, 
"Hey, we're all dying.. young" 
Now it's all reality.. but it's more like a terrifying dream 
And I'm serious 
It's either whiskey, or a bong, or a car crash or a bomb 
I'm serious 
It's the only thing I think 
When I wake up in my bed 
With my stomach churns 
As these pages turn 
Is the world's burnin' 
Or is it only in my head?? On a screen on a tv 
On a scene in front of me 
With all the white woods n the static 
And the static n screams 
This is war, this is death, this is really very bad 
On the winning side, the winning side, the winning side 
The winning side And I'm sick of the train 
Over Brooklyn in the rain 
All by myself 
When it finally occurs to me.. 
That all these people wanna be just some where.. else 
Like every day is just the last bit 
To argue with your boss over a coffee break 
Well it seems to me, I mean.. want more dignity 
Or I'm going to.. break 
Because the only thing I think 
When he walks out on the street 
He says the sky falls 
And you're duty calls man 
It takes some balls to be 
So I'll see On a screen on a tv 
On a scene in front of me 
With all the white woods n the static 
And the static n screams 
This is war, this in death. this is really very bad 
On the winning side, the winning side, 
The winning side, the winning side 
The right side, the right side 
Oh the shit you watch 
While your parents cry 
And it all falls away so quietly 
When you wake up to reality.. A Reality?? 
What's reality?? What's reality?? What's reality?? 
You Don't Fucking Break!! Well I got a brother in Iraq 
I got no way to get him back 
Like all those people in the sands, 
Buried in Afghanastan 
I got a child in a crib 
I got a father in a bed 
I got no pills 
I got no skittles 
I know I do what I did 
I just wondered every second 
As they wheel those bastards by 
Are we living?? 
Are we dreaming?? 
Are we winning?? 
Or were we dying 
In a cloud of dust 
In a mushroom burst 
In a series of deaths 
As the agents burst?? All alone in a hospital bed 
Wondering what we might of done instead.. 
With a lifetime.. 
A lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime 
A lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime 
A lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime 
With a good fucking attitude, 
Yeah we did our job 
But can you tell me exactly what was our job? 
Well I'm still stuck.. 
With this body of mine 
Well were you inside 
When a militant died?? 
I hope you choke!! 
I.. Own.. Your.. Life!!
