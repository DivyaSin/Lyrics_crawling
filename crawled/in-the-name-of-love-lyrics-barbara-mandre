Guess who called me yesterday apologized for goin' away 
And said I'm still the one he's dreamin' of 
And did he ever sound so low when he said I need you so 
He wants to come back home in the name of love Guess who said that he was wrong and even cried on the telephone 
Said he'd be as true as stars above 
Guess who said he would do right if I'd let him come home tonight 
He wants to come back home in the name of love Guess who's gonna let him come back to her life once more 
Guess you're right it's me and I'll be waitin' at the door 
No more sadness only smiles he'll be here in a little while 
Tonight he's comin' home in the name of love No more sadness only smiles, he'll be here in a little while 
Tonight he's comin' home in the name of love 
Tonight he's comin' home in the name of love 
Guess who called me yesterday apologized for goin' away 
But tonight he's comin' home in the name of love
