My father said to me 
When I was two years old 
That I could walk on my own 
And as the years went by 
He said don't ever stop 
Until you find your way home He said life is a journey 
Every step is a choice you make 
Sometimes you slip when you land 
And all we leave behind 
When everything's set and done 
Fades like a wave on the sand Live all you can, and understand 
If the world didn't suck, we would all fall off 
Whatever comes up, must always come down again 
If the world didn't suck, we would all fall off And when I fell in love 
He walked me down the isle 
And I could see in his eyes 
The love he'd given me 
Is what had set me free 
To let me follow my heart Life is a journey 
Every step is a choice you make 
Sometimes you stumble and fall 
Get up, be strong 
And set your feet on the road again 
Soon you'll be standing tall Live all you can, and understand 
If the world didn't suck, we would all fall off 
Whatever comes up, must always come down again 
If the world didn't suck, we would all fall off History repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself 
History repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself 
History repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself 
History repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself Do you get the way we're connected 
That we're all a link in the chain 
How the love we give to each other 
Echoes through our children again Gotta keep your feet on the ground but 
Through your mind and learn to accept that 
That we, that we, that we, that we, that we We live all we can, trying to understand 
If the world didn't suck, we would all fall off 
We give what we got 'cause we only get one shot 
If the world didn't suck, we would all fall off Whatever comes up, must always come down again 
(History repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself) 
If the world didn't suck, we would all fall off
