I'm always loving someone more than they love me 
Lord, I wish that just this once that's not how it would be 
I always try too hard when I find someone new 
God, I wish that just this once you'd need me more than I need you I danced to please my father just to win one glance 
Some sign of his approval 
I danced and danced and danced and danced 
I smiled to make my mother proud, I was her child 
To win some small affection 
I smiled and smiled and smiled and smiled 
My books and bikes I bartered to try and buy a friend 
Now I've grown this heart i own is the currency I spend and spend and spend And in the end I will give you everything I own 
Sure you never want me for myself alone 
Oh how I hate the way I am always trying to impress 
Lord, if I could love me more than I could love you less And if I could love you less I would not confuse you dancing dancing smiling smiling 
'Til of course I lose you
