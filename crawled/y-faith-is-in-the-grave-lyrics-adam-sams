What was that about loving my friends and loving my enemies too? 
What was that about giving to the poor and judging others kindly? 
What was that about forgiving the guy whos only ever hurt me? 
Something you said got buried deep in my shallow heart I never quite got it through my head 
That what I do has to back up what I say 
My faith is in the grave Its not what you believe that counts 
But only what you believe enough to do 
My mouth is an empty gun 
Let us speak with truth and action Would you lay down your life for your brother? 
Would you sell what you own and give it all away? 
Do you try to live out what you learn? 
Or do you just pick and choose what you want to ignore?
