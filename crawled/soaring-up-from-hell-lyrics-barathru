Ive bin waiting , to come up ! 
Posses the people by my demon thaughts ! 
And all this evil , that is in me ! 
Let it free , let it free demons come to me ! 
I am raising , from hell , I am walking my dear grave ! 
I am standing , on the hills , blood is raining let us take it all ! 
If i do , what you have tod me to , you well let me to the earth and i will fill it with hate ! I will posses everyone ! Let hell break through it will be fun ! Chourse : Plesure of seing people dying ! 
Plesure by bringing theme fear ! 
Plesure by seing theme suffer ! 
Demons flying in the air ! COME ! 
Plesure by seing , theme crying ! 
Plesure by seing theme lost by dispise ! HELL ! I am flying in the air , like satan and his evil friends ! 
I will haunt , for the flesh ! 
And the human bodies that i will posses ! 
This is my story ! Evil story ! How i made this filthy damn earth fell ! 
I was trapped , in time , now im back i am soaring up from hell !
