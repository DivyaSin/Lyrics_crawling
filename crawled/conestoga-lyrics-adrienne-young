Conestoga I have wandered through the hills of better days 
Broken my own heart with my cheatin ways 
So Ill try to make amends I will rectify 
All the time I spent more dead than alive Darlin hitch up the Conestoga 
Ride my gently to & fro 
I have searched many a lifetime 
All for what I do not know 
All for what I know Give me freedom like the flight of a ravens wing 
Lie down with the sun, rise and start to sing 
Lonesome doves will always find their way back home 
But theres seed to feed anywhere we roam I will take the reins when you need to sleep 
I will soothe your pain if your back grows weat 
But first these words you must speak 
I am ready to go, Im ready to go Darlin pack up the Conestoga 
Ride my gently sweet and low 
I have searched many a lifetime 
All for what I do not know 
All for what I know Ready to goready to go
