I wander, wandering all around 
This big place I live 
She was scared to go outside 
Where it once felt so nice to me Picked up a smoke, then you drag a little 
I wanna choke so you won't belittle 
Everyone knows that she'll do it over 
And over and over and over again You're pretty, won't you come play with me? 
This time I'll be nice 
You can't trust what I say to you 
I know they're all lies, do you? And if you ever had to 
I would be going strong 
What in the world was happening? 
Dear, can I be wrong?
