Trippin' out, Spinnin' around 
I'm underground, I fell down 
Yeah, I fell down I'm freakin' out, so where am I now? 
Upside down and I can't stop it now 
It can't stop me now, 
Ohhh I, 
I'll get by 
I, 
I'll survive 
When the world's crashin' down 
When I fall and hit the ground 
I will turn myself around 
Don't you try to stop me 
I, 
I won't cry I'll play the game, but I can't stay 
I've got my head on straight, and I'm not gonna change 
I'm not gonna change I'll win the race, keep up with the pace 
Today's the day, that I start to pray 
You can't get in my way 
No I, 
I'll get by 
I, 
I'll survive 
When the world's crashin' down 
When I fall and hit the ground 
I will turn myself around 
Don't you try to stop me 
I, 
I won't cry I found myself (Myself) in Wonderland 
Get back on (Back on) my feet (My feet) again (Again) 
Is this real? (Is this real?) 
Is it pretend? (Is it pretend?) 
I'll take (I'll take) a stand (A stand) until (Until) the end I, 
I'll get by 
I, 
I'll survive 
When the world's crashin' down 
When I fall and hit the ground 
I will turn myself around 
Don't you try to stop me! 
I, I won't cry I, 
I'll get by 
I, 
I'll survive 
When the world's crashin' down 
When I fall and hit the ground 
I will turn myself around 
Don't you try to stop me! 
I, and I won't cry
