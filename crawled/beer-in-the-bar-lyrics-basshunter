Im still smiling like a beer in a bar 
Im staring in the mirror while Im doing my hair 
Im putting on my clothes 
When I go down the stairs 
I open up my mini bar 
*and* make myself a drink 
Im not an alcoholic but I know what you think 
My mood is getting higher 
When its knocking on my door 
Its my party home, boys and a girl I want to score 
And I dont have a time to 
Take her for a ride 
We are going to a crazy college party tonight 
-From Mr.Basshunter to myspace, come on!- 
What if people just gave a damn, about if I made this music with computer programme 
I cant play the drums or guitar but Im still smiling like a beer in bar 
I know that this is a weird song but you can tell somebody if its right or wrong 
I just want to show what I can do 
So sit right back while Im talking to you 
-To all the on-line party people out there!- 
Arriving to the party 
Everyone is there 
We are going to have it awesome, I can feel it in the air 
Im going to the backyard and what do I see? 
All the girls are shaking with their ass in front of me 
Well this is not my cup of tea if you know what I mean 
What if people just gave a damn, about if I made this music with computer programme 
I cant play the drums or guitar but Im still smiling like a beer in a bar 
I know that this is a weird song but you can tell somebody if its right or wrong 
I just want to show what I can do 
So sit right back while Im talking to you 
-Alright mates, are you ready to a party??!!-
