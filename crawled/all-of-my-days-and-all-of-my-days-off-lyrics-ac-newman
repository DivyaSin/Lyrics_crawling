The sequins in your wake find their way, 'cause someone left the lights on 
And the idea is a powerful one 
The sun showers outside and I've found something in the swing here 
An idea whose time had come And now I give you my days, all my days (all my days) 
And now I give you my days, all my days (all my days) 
All my days, all my days It broke open the door, flipping chairs, tipping over tables 
Reminded why I love this one 
Go trip down the lane, take my name, the flashbulbs strobe eureka 
Like an idea whose time had come And now I give you my days, all my days 
All my days, all my days 
All my days, all of days 
All my days, all of days 
All my days, all of days 
All my days, all of days 
All my days, all of days 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) The sun showers outside and I've found something in the swing here 
An idea whose time had come 
Thunderbolts will strike where they may, like a drunken master 
Like an idea whose time had come And now I give you my days, all my days And all of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) 
All of my days off (all my days) All my days 
All my days 
All my days 
All my days 
All my days 
All my days 
All my days 
All my days 
All my days
