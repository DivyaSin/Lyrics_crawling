Everytime in balance 
Between light and darkness 
As a tighthrope walker 
With naked foot on a razor's edge 
I've though to lose the faith Am I alive, am I dead 
Something turns in my brain 
Is it the end or beginning 
I've lost my path While I found an answer 
A wall of questions 
Stood up on my way 
Then, an evening 
While I was doubtful 
Of my own life 
I dived into the light Is it a dream or reality 
Do I exist? 
Is it the end of beginning 
I've lost my soul
