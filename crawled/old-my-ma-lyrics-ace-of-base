[Chorus] 
I told my ma, about the town I love so well 
I told my ma, about the town I love 
My time will come, raising up my family 
I told my ma, about the town I love I'm leaving for an island, way down in the south 
Where the roads are curved and dusty with no names 
The people's so inviting, they're smiling everywhere 
With a tempo I can share [Chorus] I'd like to get together, where there's samba in the streets 
In a tropical favela to the beats 
In Santa Catarina, a hot summer night 
Are you ready, to ignite? [Chorus] I said 
Oh oh hungry eyes, hungry eyes 
My apprise, all for you 
Oh, hungry eyes 
Until the morning's arise [Chorus: x2]
