I've lived my life beside an ocean 
And every day I drown emotions with the tide 
And no one's ever asked me why 
Guess I'm silly to waste my time I reach and stretch too far to measure 
And I break myself to keep together all the time 
It's a struggle to be kind 
In a world that seems so blind Before I grow too old to seize the day 
Before I spread my wings and fly away 
I'd like to get to see my heart at play 
And see if love can't save the day 
What if it's the only way 
Can we save the day Aside from my faith there is no glory 
And aside from the truth there is no story anymore 
We're all soldiers in the war 
But tell me what are we fighting for Feels like we've been here forever 
As I break myself to keep together and apart 
From a way that eats my heart 
I don't know how it got so hard Before I grow too old to seize the day 
Before I spread my wings and fly away 
I'd like to get to feel my heart at play 
See if love can't save the day 
What if it's the only way 
Can we save the day?
