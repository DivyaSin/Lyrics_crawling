Strolling down the strip, we were straight strip tripping 
Tipping all the dealers we were straight gin sipping 
Go gamble, fuck hos, everybody knows everybody smokes dope 
You can smell on our clothes 
A little bit of indo a little bit of girls 
Because we were kind of curious what was under their skirts Oh, we're just fucking around 
They don't know we're just fucking around Split it, hit it, win it, stick around for a minute 
Throw another bill in it; though, you'll be broke without credit 
You will be glad that you did, 'cause you'll be fucked up and faded 
With a gold digger who's pretty and thinks that you're rich and witty Oh, we're just fucking around 
They don't know we're just fucking around I'd been stinking from drinking 
My boys are AWOL I'm thinking 
I needed a room for the weekend 
On to the hotel with the beacon 
I gave a tip to this chick it was a chip worth a grip but that was it 
A wink and a key and I went to my room 
Oh, not two, there were three different whores all for me 
What a time what a place they won't remember my face No one knows, oh, we're just fucking around 
They don't know we're just fucking around Soon afternoon came and I'd been up for two days 
I had played the same game with money and hos you know how it goes 
Our weekend had ended with all the hos we befriended 
But our egos had landed since we went home empty handed 
Come on and let's go, let's go hit the road for four hours home 
We'll go and get stoned and no one will know
