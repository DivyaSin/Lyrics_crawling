Been working so hard 
I'm punching my card 
Eight hours, for what? 
Oh, tell me what I got I've down this feeling 
That time's just holdin' me down 
I'll hit the ceiling 
Or else I'll tear up this town Tonight I gotta cut Loose, footloose 
Kick off your Sunday shoes 
Please, Louise 
Pull me off a my knees Jack, get back 
Come on before we crack 
Lose your blues 
Everybody cut footloose You're playing so cool 
Obeyin' every rule 
I'll dig a way down in your heart 
You're burnin', yearnin' for songs Somebody to tell you 
That life ain't a passin' you by 
I'm tryin' to tell you 
It will if you don't even try You can fly if you'd only cut Loose, footloose 
Kick off your Sunday shoes 
Ooh wee, Marie 
Shake it, shake it for me Whoa, Milo 
Come on, come on let's go 
Lose your blues 
Everybody cut footloose Cut footloose 
Cut footloose 
Cut footloose We got to turn me around 
And put your feet on the ground 
Now take a hold of the phone 
Whoa, I'm turnin' it loose Loose, footloose 
Kick off your Sunday shoes 
Please, Louise 
Pull me off a my knees Jack, get back 
Come on before we crack 
Lose your blues 
Everybody cut footloose Loose, footloose 
Kick off your Sunday shoes 
Please, Louise 
Pull me off a my knees Jack, get back 
Come on before we crack 
Lose your blues Everybody cut, everybody cut 
Everybody cut, everybody cut 
Everybody cut, everybody cut 
Everybody cut footloose
