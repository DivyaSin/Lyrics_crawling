Music's always inside my head 
Yes, all day long, till I go to bed 
I hear the wind through the trees 
The buzzing of the bees 
The rumble of the train 
The pitter-patter of the rain Can you hear it? 
I hear music everywhere (wowzer) 
Everybody, can you hear it? (sha-pop-pow) 
It's the sound that fills the air 
Yes, I hear music everywhere If you listen, you'll hear the sound 
The sound of music is all around 
I hear the birds sing a song 
In the daylight 
Then the frogs and the crickets 
Play the rhythm of the night Can you hear it? 
I hear music everywhere (wowzer) 
Everybody, can you hear it? (sha-pop-pow) 
It's the sound that fills the air 
Yes, I hear music everywhere The wind through the trees 
The buzzing of the bees 
The rumble of the train 
The pitter-patter of the rain Can you hear it? 
I hear music everywhere (wowzer) 
Everybody, can you hear it? (sha-pop-pow) 
It's the sound that fills the air 
Yes, I hear music everywhere
