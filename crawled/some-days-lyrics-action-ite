Take another picture off of my wall 
Take it all down and throw it all 
We've been building up for this so long 
Some days you can't prepare for I've been holding my tongue 
Holding back every word 
Everything we used to have is all gone 
Some days you can't prepare for Some days i feel the world moving slowly 
But it seems like i go nowhere 
And some days i think i'll never get through it 
But i know i will, some days Now i'm breaking my back 
Find a reason to end everything 
Forget whatever we had 
One day we could change anything And i don't if the sun will ever 
Come back out 
Whatever we were, 
The day changed everything Some days i feel the world moving slowly 
But it seems like nowhere to go 
And some days i feel i'll never get through it 
But i know i will, some days I can't believe the difference a day makes 
It hit like an earthquake 
I can't believe i put my heart out 
It rained like a storm One day can change everything Some days i feel the world moving slowly 
But it seems like i go nowhere 
And some days i feel like i'll never get through it 
But i know i will, some days 
Some day, some day, some days
