I'm lost for words this time 
I'll spend my life looking vainly 
So hard to find my place in this world 
This world If I could see a possibility 
If I could see (if I could see) you here with me 
I can't, can't wait, got lost in the forest So blind, oh so blind 
Even though there you are 
If I could see a possibility 
If I could see (if I could see) you here with me If I could see, it would be so 
If I could see, it would be so 
So complete 
You and Me
