Hey there yes it's me - That guy from TV 
Surely you have seen my daily show 
Don't be shy

For guys like me there's just one way to go

So look at me

Look at me 
Cause I'm almost famous 
And I'll do anything to make things go my way Hey now did I see you here last Sunday 
I'm the guy who brought you that mote 
Partied all night long 'til early Monday

Heading out for my fifteen minutes It's time to start the show
