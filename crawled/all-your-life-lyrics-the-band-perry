Would you walk to the edge of the ocean? 
Just to fill my jar with sand? 
Just in case I get the notion, 
To let it run through my hands. 
Let it run through my hands. I don't want the whole world, 
The sun, the moon and all their light. 
I just wanna be the only girl, 
You love all your life. 
You love all your life. Would you catch a couple thousand fireflies? 
Yeah, and put 'em in a lamp to light my world. 
All dressed up in a tux and bowtie. 
Hand Delivered to a lonely girl. 
To a lonely lonely girl I don't want the whole world, 
The sun, the moon and all their light. 
I just wanna be the only girl, 
You love all your life. 
You love all your life Lately I've been writing desperate love songs. 
I mostly sing them to the wall. 
You could be the center piece of my obsession 
If you would notice me, 
Yeah, ooh yeah Well I don't want the whole world, no 
The sun, the moon and all their light. 
I just wanna be the only girl, 
You love all your life. 
You love all your life You love all your life, life, yeah.
