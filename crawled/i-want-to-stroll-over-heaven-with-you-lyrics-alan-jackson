If I surveyed all the good things 
That come to me from above 
If I count all the blessings 
From the storehouse of love I'd simply ask for the favor 
Of him beyond mortal king 
And I'm sure 
That he'd grant it again I want to stroll over Heaven 
With you some glad day 
When all our troubles and heartaches 
Are vanished away Then we'll enjoy the beauty 
Where all things are new 
I want to stroll over Heaven 
With you So many places of beauty 
We long to see here below 
But time and treasures have kept us 
From making plans as you know But come the morning of the rapture 
Together we'll stand a new 
While I stroll over Heaven 
With you I want to stroll over Heaven 
With you some glad day 
When all our troubles and heartaches 
Are vanished away Then we'll enjoy the beauty 
Where all things are new 
I want to stroll over Heaven 
With you I want to stroll over Heaven 
With you
