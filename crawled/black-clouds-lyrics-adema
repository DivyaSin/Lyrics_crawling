No Here in the dark escaping this withering soul 
(My thoughts are growing cold) 
Here by my side is everything I've ever owned 
(I've got to go alone) And I don't mind at all 
(I've got to let you go) It's the black clouds over your head 
It's the monsters under your bed 
As tragic as this might seem 
We can't escape the bad things 
You know what that means No Here in the light, I'll drown in what I'll never be 
(They love to watch them crawl) 
But here I decide swallow the worst part of me 
(And then he breaks the fall) And I don't mind at all 
(I've got to let you go) It's the black clouds over your head 
It's the monsters under your bed 
As tragic is this might seem 
We can't escape the bad things 
You know what that means Something better change real soon 
I don't think I can wait for you 
Something that I have to do 
I swear that I will see this through 
Something better change real soon 
I swear that I will see this through It's the black clouds over your head 
It's the monsters under your bed 
As tragic as this might seem 
We can't escape the bad things 
You know what that means It's the black clouds over your head 
(Oh the black clouds) 
It's the monsters under your bed 
(No it's the monsters) As tragic as this might seem 
(I have a bad dream) 
We can't escape the bad things 
You know what that means You know what that means 
You know what that means 
You can't escape me 
You can't escape me
