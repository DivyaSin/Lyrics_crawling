Blacked eyes and blood red skies, 
It's colour that you lack. 
Your malignant life,a malignant knife, 
That feasts upon our backs. From the shoulder blades to rib cages, 
We've seen the other side. Let the heavens rain down from the sky. 
Let the nightmares come that stalk us in the night. 
The cancer spread throughout our bodies, 
Consuming everything in sight, 
Before we even knew it was alive. Yet we move on tonight,with open eyes, 
On broken legs and spines. 
We've been left for dead so many times 
With no luxury to die.
