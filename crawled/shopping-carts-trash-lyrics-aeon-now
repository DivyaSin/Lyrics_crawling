The leaves are on the wind tonight 
the city grinds and hums 
I cat tongued to pass through the glow 
of sodium lights on a concrete wall 
through the factories and railroad tracks 
through shopping carts and trash 
where bottles broke in fits of mirth 
where weeds spring forth from trampled earth my mouth is sewn my hands are bound 
my dreams are cased in stone 
my memory in charcoal draws a flower the wind is blowing through the trees 
casting leaves upon the night 
a train is passing through the yard 
pulsing light between its cars 
and from each box car's passing door 
a ghastly vision peers 
it sends a tremor through my skin 
for in each car I see again specter watching from beyond 
that's bound to ride like me 
reappearing in each passing car 
it's eyes sunk in like dying stars and wherefore has this vision come 
that none should see but me 
it's face like what my mirror shows 
displays my fate from choices chose 
fate not sealed not carved in stone 
still a different path it excludes 
choices yet to make with trains 
to ride or lay down on the main I feel a chill like shards of rime 
and light a cigarette 
I shudder because freedom found 
and maybe it's time to leave this town so puttin' out my cigarette 
I take my pack up from the ground 
in the wind that blows before a rain 
the fated one runs toward a train
