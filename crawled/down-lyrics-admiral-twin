My fate is now complete 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep 
she's crying in her sleep; 
in her dreams she hears the sound of marching feet. 
I'm laying in my bed 
thinking of the things I should've said 
the truth came out all wrong 
words are weak as breath; 
the chains of consequence are strong. 
Tell them that we all fall down 
down until our feet touch ground 
tell them that I love them so 
promise me you'll let them know. The door slams in my face 
love's gone without a trace 
the writing's on the wall 
tells the story of it all. You thought your life was your own to do what you would 
How could you do this to us? 
Did you remember us waiting here, unaware? 
How did you think this would end? My God, where are you now?
