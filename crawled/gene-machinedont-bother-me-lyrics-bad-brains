You wanna see me hang around 
Don't bother me 
You wanna know if I'll get down 
Can't you see (Gene Machine) 
Stick it in 
Shove it up 
Are they still humans? 
(Dream Machine) 
With brown eyes 
brown hair 
Created scientifically You wanna see me hang around 
Don't bother me 
You wanna know if i get down 
Oh can't you see 
Come on open up your eyes 
Truth is there to see 
There is to be in reality (Gene Machine) 
Are they issues? 
Dial-A-Gene...Buy-A-Gene 
Take a second look did one just pass by way?
