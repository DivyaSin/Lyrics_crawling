[Intro] 
Never gonna let you, never gonna let you die, die 
He said never gonna let you down no Can you hear Gods love calling out to everybody 
In the world who needs a life 
He said never gonna let you down oh no 
Pick up the cross take it up to the Lord 
And he'll give your life eternity 
Forgiven of the sins he see's 
Set your hearts and minds off free 
Never did anyone love you like God 
Keep up the faith and you'll grow high, high, high 
Never gonna let you die [Chorus] 
Lord 
Lord 
My life is in your hands 
With everything I stand 
Can you help me sing 
Lord 
Lord 
My life is in your hands 
With everything I stand Never gonna let you, Never gonna let you die, die 
Never gonna let you, Never gonna let you die, die 
He said never gonna let you down Lord Can you hear Gods love calling out to everybody 
In the world who needs a life 
He said never gonna let you down oh no 
Pick up the cross take it up to the Lord 
And he'll give your life eternity 
Forgiven of the sins he see's 
Set your hearts and minds off free 
Never did anyone love you like God 
Keep up the faith and you'll grow high, high, high 
Never gonna let you die [Chorus]
