Half mine, half mine 
Half of the times you were just half mine 
Hard times, hard times 
Yours and mine, the hardest times For all that it's worth 
You got both feet on the earth 
You got body and mind 
And you'd give them to me, if I give you mine Laugh lines, laugh lines 
Where do they hide when you're by my side 
Free time, all my free time 
Wanna spend mine, knowing those laugh lines
