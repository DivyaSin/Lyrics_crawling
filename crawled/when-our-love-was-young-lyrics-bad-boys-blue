In my fantasies 
I am going through the scenes 
Of the love we had 
Sweet emotions that we share 
What I see is forever you and me 
And I'm longing for the times 
When your heart was mine 
Remember when our love was young 
A burning flame all summer long 
I still hear those melodies 
And I feel the cooling breeze 
We have shared one world 
Hand in hand just for a while 
And on wings of love 
We've been flying up so high 
Until now. I can understand somehow 
What had torn our dream apart 
How you broke my heart 
Remember when our love was young 
A burning flame all summer long 
I still hear those melodies 
And I feel the cooling breeze 
Remember when our love was strong 
Two loving hearts beating like one 
What remains are memories 
And I feel the cooling breeze 
Remember when our love was young 
A burning flame all summer long 
I still hear those melodies 
And I feel the cooling breeze 
Remember when our love was strong 
Two loving hearts beating like one...
