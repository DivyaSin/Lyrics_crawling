WORK AND WORK ALL THE TIME 
JUST TO FUCKING STAY ALIVE 
BUT I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO STAY AHEAD 
BILL COLLECTORS ON MY ASS 
I NEVER HAVE ANY CASH 
SOMETIMES I THINK I'D BE BETTER OFF DEAD 
ALWAYS BROKE MY MONEY IS GONE 
SOMETHING IS ALWAYS GOING WRONG 
A HALF DECENT LIVING JUST A FUCKING DREAM 
LOCKED INTO A CLASSEST CAGE 
PUTS ME IN A FUCKING RAGE 
I GET SO FRUSTRATED I JUST WANT TO FUCKING SCREAM 
SLAVE AWAY - ALL MY LIFE 
WORK ALL DAY - NO END IN SIGHT 
FIRST IT STARTED OFF IN SCHOOL 
YOU'RE TREATED LIKE A FUCKING FOOL 
IT'S JUST A PART OF THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME 
THEN YOU GET A DEAD END JOB 
WORKINGWITH SOME OTHER SLOBS 
THAT'S WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE 
MR. BOSS MAN RAISES A GLASS 
FUCK THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS 
TRIES AND THINKS OF WAYS TO KEEP THE PEOPLE DOWN 
THERE'S MORE OF US CAN'T YOU SEE!!! 
IT'S THEM AGAINST YOU AND ME 
MAYBE LIFE WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY WEREN'T AROUND 
BURN THE RICH - TO THE GROUND 
WATCH IT ALL - COME CRASHING DOWN 
WORK-SLAVE-TOIL-DIG YOUR GRAVE.
