The gun to my head is made up of all the things you said about me 
The face in the dark makes me scream for you, and I close my eyes 
And I told you yesterday that this was goodbye The knife in your eyes have taken to many lives I run so I survive 
But where did u go, the reason you gave me none so leave my fucking life 
And I told you yesterday that this was goodbye So leave me alone, goodbye 
Leave me alone, tonight 
Leave me alone, I dont need u anymore Leave me alone, goodbye 
Leave me alone, tonight 
Leave me alone, I dont need u anymore The killer in you is hidden inside a face that smiles to hide her lies 
How broken u are how heartless indecent fuck I hate u even more 
And I told u yesterday that this was good bye So leave me alone, goodbye 
Leave me alone, tonight 
Leave me alone, I dont need u anymore Leave me alone, goodbye 
Leave me alone, tonight 
Leave me alone, I dont need u anymore So leave me alone, goodbye 
Leave me alone, tonight 
Leave me alone, I dont need u anymore Leave me alone, goodbye 
Leave me alone, tonight 
Leave me alone, I dont need u anymore Leave me alone, the gun in my hand is made up of all the things you said about me 
The face in the dark makes me scream for you, and I close my eyes 
The killer in you is hidden inside a face that smiles to hide her lies 
How broken u are how heartless indecent fuck I hate u even more
