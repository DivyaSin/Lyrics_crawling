Yes,I feel the end,the end is close, 
The same thing happened eons ago, 
To know exactly you have to read up some more, 
Everyday technology speeds up some more 
As is above,so is below, 
Some feel the heat, Yeah, some feel the cold, 
We are the souls, Yes, We have been chose, 
Some roll with angels and demons and ghosts, 
Buth Shhhh!Hold up Bob,don't go there, 
You know that they watching,they all see and stare,but, 
They can't stop me I'm already there, 
And ya'll ain't seen sh*t but you're already scared, 
I'm gone!!! High like fructose fructose, 
You wanna know the truth,really? 
You don't You don't,It will blow you out your mind like a UFO,UFO 
I'm basically a resident of Pluto Pluto,You know, 
But you'll probably be the same one hating, 
Saying every rapper is in the Freemasons, 
While the cops giving out free mace to your face,now how does that taste? 
I'm outta my mind,these videos telling ya'll lies,bro, 
Telling yall we holding evil hand signs bro, 
Last time i checked that from the East side bro, 
So do your research and make your own mind up, 
Cuz us musicians have influence on this mic,but, 
They don't like that so they conquer and divide, Double H, N, D 
Hip-Hop never dies,so shoot all you want 
But we fly,because you know, 
No one man should have all that power, 
Obviously cuz there's only one power, 
But nevermind ya'll keep worshiping towers, 
While the clock keeps handing yall hours, 
But pucker up because the truth gets sour, 
More sour than the sour diesel i devour 
Gimme bout an hour,I give ya 50 vowels, 
When i brainstorm it's like a shower, 
So pull out your towels,and don't let them play you, 
Do your own thing, fu*k what they do, 
And if you're good at something make sure they pay you,and if not then take a Thank You! 
Whether they praise you or whether they hate you, 
It's ll about the attention that they pay you, 
Ya'll on that grape drink,try this grape juice, 
Shout outs to Grand Hustle,we got that grape fruit, 
And yes it's evident we're better than the rest of these competitors, 
Really there ain't no one that's ahead of us, 
Yeah i bust these verses of ecc. ecc,cos they watching ya'll like the federals... 
Ouuuuughh 
Kadoish, Kadoish, Kadoish 
Adonai 
'Tsebayoth 
It's B.o.B and im out 
Peeeaaace
