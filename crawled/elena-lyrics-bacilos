Even when I think she is hiding from me 
Even when it's so hard for me to brake the ice 
I can see there's something in her eyes 
Something missing in her smile 
Even when she's hiding from me 
I'm gonna find the way x3 
To her, Elena, don't worry 
Someone will help you to forget 
Don't you worry Elena 
No, Elena 
You have to have that all inside your heart 
And I'll help you find it 
I'll help you find it x3 
Matching perfectly the weather 
She wears gray and black as winter 
Showing very little care 
For all those who'd die for her 
Bearing gray as past as winter 
But I'm gonna find the way
