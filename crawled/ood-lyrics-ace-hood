Haha, shit 
'Cause I'm in the mood baby 
I'm in the mood nigga 
Don't give me a reason 
Don't give me a reason 
Shit I'm in the mood to count up the loot, blessings 
Jump out the coup, the fuck is the roof? Flexing 
I'm with the crew, you ain't making moves than exit 
I'm in the mood to call up your boo to sex it 
'Cause I'm in the mood 
'Cause I'm in the mood 
'Cause I'm in the mood 
'Cause I'm in the mood Bought a car with a horse, got a young nigga whipping 
I just pull up at the light, shitting on your Honda Civic 
I got racks in my pocket, dead fresh catch a body 
That potato on a shawty, count that money for a hobby 
I just pull up to the deala, big shit Godzilla 
Young nigga, chinchilla, all ice like it's winter 
Hit the mall, blow a check 
On the gram, gotta flex 
Ain't no love for my ex, oh Lord boy you blessed 
See I'm in the mood to fuck up your mood, I'm covered in juice 
I just brought a crib with too many rooms, it came with a pool 
I know what you're thinking, got rid of my neighbors had too many rules 
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, we never gon' lose 
I'm gonna get everything a nigga pray for 
Fuck me and call me daddy ain't that what you came for? 
I'm in the mood, I'm like fuck it put twenty chains on 
Go hit the club, brought the bottles lets see the light show I'm in the mood to count up the loot, blessings 
Jump out the coup, the fuck is the roof? Flexing 
I'm with the crew, you ain't making moves than exit 
I'm in the mood to call up your boo to sex it 
'Cause I'm in the mood 
'Cause I'm in the mood 
'Cause I'm in the mood 
'Cause I'm in the mood Middle finger in the air, that's my motherfucking mood 
Twenty twenty with the vision, I got panoramic views 
In my cup, got that screw 
Phantom ghost, peek-a-boo 
Niggas sleep, let them snooze 
Ace Hood got the juice 
I'm the motherfucking man, twenty bands 'fore I walk through 
I just brought a foreign, paid for it like a boss do 
Nigga in the mood, keep it cool, goons crazy 
Walk in the club with them Haitians 
The fragrance, amazing 
I just might cop me a crib and I don't even live in that bitch 
I might just cop me a whip and I won't even drive that little shit 
I might just charge every hoe that I encounter for dick 
Then pull up on my old teacher who said I won't be shit, bitch I'm in the mood to count up the loot, blessings 
Jump out the coup, the fuck is the roof? Flexing 
I'm with the crew, you ain't making moves than exit 
I'm in the mood to call up your boo to sex it 
'Cause I'm in the mood 
'Cause I'm in the mood 
'Cause I'm in the mood 
'Cause I'm in the mood I'm in the mood to count up the loot, blessings 
Jump out the coup, the fuck is the roof? Flexing 
I'm with the crew, you ain't making moves than exit 
I'm in the mood to call up your boo to sex it 
'Cause I'm in the mood
