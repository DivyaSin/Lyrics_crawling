Don't go 
Don't leave me here, in this state of apathy 
For all that once was or might have been 
Once I felt the warmth of your lips 
Now I'm standing all alone while you'll be with someone else 
You'll see 
As I'm regretful now, you shall be, too 
For all that once was or might have been 
Once I felt the warmth of your lips 
Now I'm standing all alone while you'll be with someone else 
I stand here all alone 
I know you'll be with someone else
