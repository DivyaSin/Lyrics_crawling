Look how the mighty have fallen 
Down from the mountain so high 
They got you walking in shackles 
Wiping the spit from your eye 
How you gonna do it 
How you gonna beat it 
How you gonna change their mind 
Without a soul on your side 
Can you say it for me now You're never too rich 
You're never too strong 
You're never too right 
To ever be wrong 
You're never too high 
Look at you now 
You're meeting everyone 
That you climbed over on your way down 
Look at how the mighty fall Now that the statue has toppled 
The word is all over town 
The mob has already gathered 
To pick the jewels from the crown 
How you gonna do it 
How you gonna fix it 
How you gonna stem the tide 
Without a soul on your side You're never too rich 
You're never too strong 
You're never too right 
To ever be wrong 
You're never too high 
Look at you now 
You're meeting everyone 
That you climbed over on your way down 
Look at how the mighty fall It's no comfort to you now 
But you're not alone 
It's human nature to devour 
Getting drunk on all the power of the throne You're never too rich 
You're never too strong 
You're never too right 
To ever be wrong 
You're never too high 
Look at you now 
You're meeting everyone 
That you climbed over on your way down 
Look at how the mighty fall
