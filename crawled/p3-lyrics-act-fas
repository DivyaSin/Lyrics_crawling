I remember when it was you and me 
Singing all the songs in perfect harmony 
Living life with you by my side 
Life in pain, happiness, misery, it's all the same And I'm alone again How do you know when I'm upset 
How do you know when I am low 
Was it like this the whole damn time 
Back when I thought that you were only mine Good things come and old things go 
My life's a misery and it goes so slow 
I need you by my side....
