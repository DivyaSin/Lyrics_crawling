I was built by Mr Jones 
And he's an awfully clever man 
He's regarded as the foremost in his field 
His command of all God's science 
Is renowned throughout the land 
My existence is his craftmanship revealed 
He has etched my nerves of silicon 
And stitched my nylon skin 
Designed my megabrain 
And all the thoughts within 
With unsurpassed precision 
I've been put through every test 
And charged with the mortal gift of life 
I was made with such perfection 
I am complete in every way 
I'm guaranteed to never ever fail 
I simply can not falter 
As humans often do 
Like the men who start me up and turn me off 
I find it very frightening 
The disorder of their plans 
And I wonder at the use that's made 
With the info they demand 
But I have no right to question 
The decisions which they make 
My fate is not to reason why 
I'm just a machine 
I'm just a machine 
They speak with all respect of Mr Jones 
Despite all my perfection 
I can never intervene 
I'm just a machine 
I'm just a machine
