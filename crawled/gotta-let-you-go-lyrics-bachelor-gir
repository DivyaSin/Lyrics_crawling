It's a sad day 
But some good will come of it I guess 
And maybe it'll be for the best 
As you walk away I know 
I gotta let you go It's not easy 
Watching something you cherish fade 
But it's the only choice that I can make 
You want to be somewhere else I know 
I gotta let you go Oh 
I gotta let you go 
Oh 
I gotta let you go It's OK 
There's really nothing you can say 
I don't hate you that it's gone this way 
Some things just ain't meant to be 
(So) I gotta let you go I still can't figure why 
joy can erase in the blink of an eye 
You no longer need me 
just when I let you belong in my life We had something but whatever it was has gone 
And I gotta let you go 
So don't stay here when you want to move on 
I gotta let you go
