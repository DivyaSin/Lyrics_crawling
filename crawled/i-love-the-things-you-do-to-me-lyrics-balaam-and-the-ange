There's a train in your mind on the wrong line 
Running down the tracks of time 
For so long 
All the things that you do to get so high 
You drink the sea and smoke the sky 
But no more 
To hide the pain inside 
I love the things you do to me 
I love the things you say to me 
But I know I can't help you now 
There's a place and you go there without me 
It covers you in mystery 
For so long 
There's a look in your eyes heroine 
I can't believe the state you're in 
Anymore 
Despite the pain inside 
I love the things you do to me 
I love the things you say to me 
But I know I can't help you now
