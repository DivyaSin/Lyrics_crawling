Every day I get up from off the floor 
I keep on coming back for more and more 
So many times I get it in the face 
I keep on running ' til my dying day Rain on the roadway, thunder in the sky 
The light of day disappears from sight As the road opens up in front of my eyes 
These wheels are burning up the miles 
As the road opens up in front of my eyes 
The only limitation is in my mind I drive awake my eyes are on full beam 
The wind is screaming into my slipstream 
Something keeps pulling me back from sleep 
Whatever it is I want to see These wheels are burning up the road tonight 
The fuel is pumping into my mind As the road opens up in front of my eyes 
These wheels are burning up the miles 
As the road opens up in front of my eyes 
The only limitation is in my mind I'll be there when it all comes down 
I'll be there 
I'll be there when it all comes down 
I'll be there 
When it all comes down Come on, come on As the road opens up in front of my eyes 
These wheels are burning up the miles 
As the road opens up in front of my eyes 
The only limitation is in my mind The Road Fuel pumping gasoline in my mind 
From the engine to my body 
This wheels on fire The Road As the road opens up in front of my eyes 
The only limitation is in my mind The Road
