My love has gone away 
Packed up her bags and then boarded that plane 
And I guess that the time I figured you'd wait 
Teary face, leaky breath, a bitter taste Tripped out for 600 years 
Who would have thought I'd make it last year? 
In a way it makes sense that I died and reappeared 
As that fly you've been swatting for years Calm down and make him a drink 
Pretty small town and the gossip repeats 
She took off her clothes and sat on the bed next to me My heart is pumping my blood, your hearts not beating at all 
In a way it makes sense that it isn't, it just never was Right now, a sinful exchange 
Once done, unspeakable shame 
And I should've known where I took the blame 
The sweat and the shame fireless flame Please god don't take him too 
Take me, a replicant fool 
Lost a gear and now I hardly move 
He's a kid, I'm a fool Please son, where is your faith? 
Take off your bushels set fire to your pain 
You will heal like a cut, let it scar let it scab, let it stain In a while I promise you'll see 
You're alive, not the blemish or burns that you keep on your feet 
I am a towel that is soaked to the core, heavier now than it's gotten before 
And something inside of me needs more and more, sooner than later never no more Sooner than later, never no more
