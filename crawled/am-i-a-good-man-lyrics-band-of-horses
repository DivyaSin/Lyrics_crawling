Oh Am I a good man? 
Am I a fool, am I a fool? 
Am I weak? 
Somebody tell me 
Or am I just playing it cool 
I have a woman 
And I know shes no good 
Still hold my head up high tryin' to do the things a good man should 
Does it make me a good man? 
Am I good man? 
Am I a fool, am I a fool? 
Am I weak? 
Somebody tell me 
Or am I just playin' it cool 
Shes has made, well, my whole life a mess 
Still on the words staying by for love so she can always have the very best 
Does that make me a good man? 
Am I a good man? 
Am I a fool am'I a fool? 
Am I weak? 
Somebody tell me 
Or am I just playin' it cool 
The best of her love she gives to someone else 
Still before I hurt the little girl I would rather hurt myself 
Does it make me a good man? 
Am I a good man? 
Am I a fool, am I a fool? 
Am I weak? 
Somebody tell me 
Or am I just playin' it cool 
She has made my whole life a mess 
But still I work day and night for her so she can always have the very best 
Does that make me a good man? 
Am I a good man? 
Am I a fool, am I a fool? 
Am I weak? 
Somebody tell me 
Or am I just playin' it cool 
Does that make me a good man? 
Am I a good man?
