Life handed me lemons 
I jump back in the public eye and squirted lemon juice in it 
By now you just wish I'd fucking die but I electrify 
Get electrocuted, executed by an executioner of my flow 
Too quick for the human eye to detect zooming by 
Guess who, what's happening guys? 
They told me to shit, I fell off that pot 
Hopped right back up on that crapper and I 
Said "fuck it" with a capital I 
Look who's back to antagonize 
You don't like it? You can eat shit, fuck off little fagot and die 
You right back like a maggot on my dick grabbing at my shit, 
Better get to the back of the line 
You wanna get your shot at me what kinda crap is that 
Battle, what kind of rapper 
Would I be before I let another rapper think he's hot 
I'll bury my face in his stinky twat and go ala la la la 
Girl my head space is limited, ain't even room in the back of my mind 
That's why I ain't thinking about you, 
I don't got time and I told you a thousand times 
So how can I find the time to put an alkaline battery 
In Royce's back and at the same time put Juice in mine? 
Goddamnit Slaughterhouse is signed Slaughterhouse! I'm a menace villain, my pen is sitting spilling, my lyrics killing 
Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceiling 
The niggas willing to give the listeners the sickest feeling 
Like mixing some Benadryl and penicillin 
Then I'm filling the clip with a written 
Can you picture my pistol drilling? 
A million women and children when I'm illing 
But it isn't real, it's a rap 
On the real, it's a wrap 
How could you possibly stop the Apocalypse 
When I'm atomic bombing the populous 
Shock the metropolis hostile as a kid 
Popping the Glock at his moms and his pops 
Then he hops in his drop with his iPod rocking the Slaughterish 
Documentation and lyrics I write with confidence 
Write like a columnist slash novelist 
I'm in this game to demolish, establish my dominance 
Over prominent rappers you popping shit till you opposite 
I can spit ominous so spit politics now 
I'm Haile Selassie, Gandhi, and Pac of this hip hop genre, 
Bitch! Slaughterhouse! Lyrically I'm a cocaine Altoid 
Ability told brain it's a no brain bout boy 
Physically I'm literally a cocaine cowboy 
Wait wait, did I just go almost four bars 
Without talking about my big dick? 
The other day me and your thick bitch had a great day and we ate cake 
And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost 
Cause she couldn't handle my shit, wait I sweared 
Irony of Ryan is I am bipolar 
While I'm rhyming standing beside a big old white bear 
Neither one of us fight fair, 
You are literally looking at Woody and Wesley in a movie 
With a white boy ain't got to jump no where 'cause I'm here 
Nigga I'm on fire yeah and I'm every bitch's dream 
One, two I'm coming for you, I'm a big old (big old) nightmare! 
Nigga this the slaughter stepping up 
I'll pretty much slap your ass and tell you to shut the fuck up 
After that I'll slap your ass again 
And tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up 
And that's how you body a fucking beat Slaughterhouse! I should be the one that goes slow 
Get a stopwatch, clock my flow 
Hit the button on top watch the drug drop 
O O dot dot O, Yaowa 
When I drop I go outer space 
Blackout like Darth Vader's face 
Placed in a molten shower 
Say something and get them proper 
Mama poppa pouring out vodka 
Mama Mia, 'em' pass me the seeds 
It's a disease that's in the Slaughterhouse casa 
Better jet boy go home, better yet boy G four chrome, 
Better jet boy, Mark Sanchez, Santanio Holmes 
I'm not just any old homeboy 
Sitting in a lab picking up a pad 
I be spitting bad, I'ma get you mad with this gift I have 
Lord duck suffering succotash when the trigger blast 
I'ma put your beak on your fitted hat 
Where the liquor at? Sip of yak 
That bitch and a vicious track I'ma get into that 
Sly Pro tools to boast Joe smooth I coast to the West 
Like we're tired of living at 
New York here's a piggyback ride to the motherland 
Hold on brother man, on the other hand get down 
I'm gutter fam, gun butt you with the Eagle handle Cunningham 
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna beef 
I don't want a piece, I want it all baby boy 
I don't wanna eat, I wanna feast up you rough piece of shit 
You done weak, I'm the one, capiche? Slaughterhouse! Insane what they call us 
How you married to the game 
But you probably shouldn't have came to the altar 
Every bar like propane for the sawed-off, used ya hand to forge you 
Eminem, Mr. Porter, slaughter my cinnamon's imminent torture 
All of you feminine marauders, that's women at war 
Men will assault you, time is a bastard symbol of sorter? 
Kidnap your trembling daughter, at least a quarter 
I'm administering supporters, got an aura more like Sodom and Gomorrah 
Normally something's wrong with me 
Claiming a quantity of the porn I see on the pause to me 
When I fix the game they'll think shit came with a warranty 
How the fuck are they gonna stop when I was born to be 
Corner me, shit belong to me, two choices, you can get along with me 
Or sit your fagot ass right there in dormancy 
Wait, all you missing is heels to be Ru Paul 
Ain't nobody that's real ever knew y'all 
Second to none and I'm dealing with Marshall 
This time I never come down, deal with the blue balls 
You ain't gotta fear me but you'll respect me 
Niggas who never met me threaten me, want to Gillete me 
Coming off soft, I got some machetes 
Swinging spaghetti like it's heavy some said he deserve an ESPY 
In a Chevy like Andretti, put the Dezzy where his chest be Slaughterhouse!
