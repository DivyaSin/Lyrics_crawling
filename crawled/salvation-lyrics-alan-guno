The darkness falls upon my soul 
As all my dreams slip away from my hands 
Time is relentless in its toll 
Im left exposed for the sinner I am But Ill fall on my knees to stop the pain 
To repent, confess my shame 
As the dawn calls with a voice to heal me Salvation comes when I am lost 
Salvation comes to pay my cost 
A ransom for a lowly life yet 
It lifts my wings to set me free 
Its spirit roars so Ill believe 
Salvation comes for me From these omens I cant hide 
The endless nights spent afraid and awake 
My anguish sleeping at my side 
As fear enslaves every breath that I take But let the world, all creation drag me down 
Let disaster keep me bound 
Grace is rising like the sun to find me Salvation comes when I am lost 
Salvation comes to pay my cost 
A ransom for a lowly life yet 
It lifts my wings to set me free 
Its spirit roars so Ill believe 
Salvation comes for me Behold His Face 
And bless the Hand that holds back the darkest nights 
Dont fear Behold His Grace 
The Lord will rise 
Feel the mercy of His Light Salvation comes when I am lost 
Salvation comes to pay my cost 
A ransom for a lowly life yet 
It lifts my wings to set me free 
Its spirit roars so Ill believe Salvation comes when I am lost 
Salvation comes to pay my cost 
The ransom for a lowly life 
It lifts my wings to set me free 
Its spirit roars so Ill believe 
Salvation comes for me It comes for me
