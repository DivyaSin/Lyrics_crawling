Is that what you call life 
asking for tourble and longing for strife 
you're chasing me 
the rumour's rife Your intention's all too clear 
Calling me up and calling me dear 
and filling me 
with dread and fear I can't deny it's true that love is blind 
If you can't see that it's all in the mind 
Just leave me be I'm not the loving kind 
It's plain to see I'm not the loving kind You know you won't succed 
In winning cocks with chicken feed 
The sing are there 
for you to read Your efferts are effete 
the stakes too high for easy meat 
why don't you just 
amidt defeat I can't deny it's true that love is blind 
If you can't see that it's all in the mind 
Just leave me be I'm not the loving kind 
It's plain to see I'm not the loving kind
