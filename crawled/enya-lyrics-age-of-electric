Enya, In your language is there a word for anger 
Or is it in your temple where you hide? 
Enya, In your temple you flowers bloom like fire 
But now your colours faded and you're cold 
Hide in your inner circle, Strength ain't muscle 
Whatever makes it better, Hold onto your pride 
In time your faith will wither, Fucked up and gone 
Hurt won't live forever 
Enya, In your garden all of your angels gather 
Taking you into hiding, Under their wings 
Enya, In your saviour can you find hope for future 
Where all fears and angers won't cloud your way 
Enya, In your shelter, Is there a fire for comfort 
Burning your inhibitions away
