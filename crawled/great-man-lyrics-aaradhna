I've let you down (let you down) 
Too many times (times times times times) 
It breaks my heart (heart) 
Cause when I look in your eyes I see the scars (I see the scars) 
I hate myself every time I think about all the times I made you cry (made you cry) 
And you deserve so much better 
I don't know 
But I just can't let you go Hurt you never 
I won't do it again 
I swear (I swear) 
Hurt you never 
I won't do it again 
I swear (I swear) Got a good man (got a good man) 
Better than good, he's great 
Got a great man (got a great man) 
And I don't wanna take that shit for granted Got a good man (got a good man) 
Better than good, he's great 
Got a great man (got a great man) 
And I don't wanna take that shit for granted I know you try (know you try) 
To forget the past and let it slide 
It's my fault, my bad 
But I know in my heart 
It'll be alright 
I just can't handle the thought of losing you 
I would rather, I'd rather die 
So don't you leave, I'll make it better for you and me 
Forever happily Hurt you never 
I won't do it again 
I swear 
Hurt you 
I would never 
Ever do it again
