She walks the line into her deathbed rings 
I say she's all alone begging for forgiveness 
I won't teach her to lie or make a plan 
That clairvoyant stare and grin 
God won't forgive me for this I know Tragedy unfolds tonight as you sever my skin apart 
Take this sadness and close your eyes, love Hey, call the angels 
This razor blade was meant for me 
Hey, call the angels 
We'll mutilate insanity She cuts a vein although it's much too dull 
I say she's all alone fighting for redemption 
I know a little pain, a little lust 
I lose myself at night to feel the rush of tearing my skin apart 
Now take this sadness and close your eyes, love Hey, call the angels 
This razor blade was meant for me 
Hey, call the angels 
We'll mutilate insanity Go deeper, I feel it 
I see your ghost appear 
Go deeper, I see it 
I feel your ghost appear 
I will say goodbye tonight, we'll sleep forever Hold on, hold on tonight, love 
We'll sleep forever 
Hold on, hold on tonight, love 
We'll sleep forever 
Hold on, hold on tonight, love 
Close your eyes Hey, call the angels 
This razor blade was meant for me 
Hey, call the angels 
We'll mutilate insanity Hey, call the angels 
This razor blade was meant for me 
Hey, call the angels 
We'll mutilate insanity
