You close the door in front of me, I wait patiently outside 
And as the minutes tick away I feel my anger rise 
And who's the object of my rage, and who's not being fair? 
Is it you for your indifference or me for just standing there? 'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light 
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night 
Sometimes it's hard to understand, when they say that pride's a sin 
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in Well I didn't make the grade today and I'm not the only one 
But my heart, it won't stop hurting and feeling all alone 
Maybe we'll trade places in some not so distant year 
I'll hear your voice calling out, and I'll cover up my ears 'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light 
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night 
Sometimes it's hard to understand, when they say that pride's a sin 
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in
