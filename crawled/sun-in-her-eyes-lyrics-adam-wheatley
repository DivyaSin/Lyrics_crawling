She has led me to the end of myself 
She has taken me right back to the start 
All I've needed I have found 
Since I took her hand and crossed my heart She doesn't care about the stars and the moon 
She's got the sun in her eyes She keeps her secrets behind her smile 
But she's learning how to let me in 
And I am letting go of reputation 
I'm learning how to let her win She doesn't care about the stars and the moon 
She's got the sun in her eyes 
Burns like a candle in the darkest room 
And I love to see her shine We have traveled a million miles 
But we're still learning how to begin 
And I would give up all I have 
To keep her with me to the end She doesn't care about the stars and the moon 
She's got the sun in her eyes 
She burns like a candle in the darkest room 
And I love to see her shine 
I'd do anything to see her shine I want to see her shine 
I want to see her shine 
I want to see her shine
