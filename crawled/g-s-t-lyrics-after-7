And I know that I'll convince you to be mine I'm gonna love ya, love ya so sweet 
There is never a time you won't be sexually pleased

Won't you stay, stay with me another night 
And if I give you good sex tonight, can we make 
Make good love forever for all time (hook) So baby lets get it on 
Undress that body come close to me

See how much and how long, I can groove you darlin' 
Keep you warm I see a lonely tear in your eye and

Won't let you leave me I'll make it right 
Cause I know just how to do ya and I'll change your mind [Hook]
