Everyday I wake up 
Full of wonder 
One more chance 
At a promising day 
And I always say 
What a wonderful life I see trees of green 
Red roses too 
I see them bloom 
For me and you 
And I think to myself 
And I think to myself 
What a wonderful world 
Oh a wonderful world And I see skies of blue 
And clouds of white 
The blessed day 
And the dark sacred night 
And I think to myself 
Oh, what a wonderful world The colors of the rainbow 
So pretty in the sky 
Are also on the faces 
Of people going by 
I see friends shaking hands 
Saying "How do you do?" 
They're really saying 
"I love you" I hear babies crying 
I watch them grow 
They'll learn much more 
Than I'll ever know 
And I think to myself 
And I think to myself 
What a wonderful world 
What a wonderful world The colors of the rainbow 
So pretty in the sky 
Are also on the faces 
Of people going by 
I see friends shaking hands 
Saying "How do you do?" 
They're really saying 
"I love you" I hear babies crying 
I watch them grow 
They'll learn much more 
Than I'll ever know 
And I think to myself 
What a wonderful world 
Yes I think to myself 
What a wonderful world Oh yeah
