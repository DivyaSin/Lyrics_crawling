Too, too many 
Theres so, so many 
Theres too, too many 
Too many of us Everyones hoping to be the one spun 
Straw into gold and outshine the sun Its fools gold glowing, nothing is growing 
Nothing is flowing from these taps 
Its fools gold glowing, nothing is flowing 
Were just seagulls pulling at scraps Leave, gotta leave today 
Get far away from, far from, far from the madding crowd 
Its turning gray now, gotta leave today now 
For the, for the black clouds No longer hoping to be the one 
Spun straw into gold and outshine the sun Its fools gold glowing, nothing is growing 
Nothing is flowing from these taps 
Its fools gold glowing, nothing is flowing 
Were just seagulls pulling at scraps Dont need golden fleece 
Just give me some peace 
Gonna learn to see whats in front of me 
I wanna give, I wanna give not take 
Everything seems so fake Maybe its just too loud 
Maybe I am just too proud 
Trying to get far, far from the madding crowd 
Cant seem to catch a break 
Everything seems so fake 
Everything seems so fake And everyones hoping to be the one 
Spun straw into gold and outshine the sun Its fools gold glowing, nothing is growing, nothing is flowing 
Its fools gold glowing, nothing is growing 
Nothing is flowing from these taps 
Its fools gold glowing, nothing is growing 
Were just seagulls pulling at scraps Too, too, too, so, so, so 
Too, too, too many 
Theres too, too, too, so, so, so 
Too, too, too, too many, theres too many
