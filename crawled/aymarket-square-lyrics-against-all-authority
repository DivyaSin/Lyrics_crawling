No one's gonna hold them down today 
They're ready to fight for their rights 
On May 3rd, 1886 
Chicago burned with the fire they lit 
The workers were on strike cause money's tight 
The pigs were out and looking for a fight 
They opened fire into the crowd 
A worker was hit and he went down 
No one's gonna hold them down 
No! They're gonna burn this fuckin' town 
August spies denounced capitalism 
But he urged no violence 
He was addressing a crowd of workers 
The pigs ordered him silenced 
A bomb was thrown and the silence wailed 
A pig laid dead and 8 were jailed 
That day the system failed 
You know it never fails 
If you think you can crush these ideas 
That are gaining ground more each day 
If death is the penalty for proclaiming truth 
Then I'll proudly and defiantly pay 
Four men were sentenced to death 
To set an example to all the rest 
Who would dare to stand and protest 
The injustices we all detest
