Listen up Little girls gather 'round 
Let me tell you all about my day 
I got blown around 
By a big bad wolf's gaze As I took a little trip to town 
Took the merry-go-round again 
At first I was sippin' the tea 
Then I was sittin' on the coast of Spain Hey, then, then I was all confused 
No, I didn't know where I was 
Might as well be a fairytale 
So I picked I would be in Oz Then, then I was pullin' the tricks 
I was puttin' them on the rock 
I said, "Oh, my God, we're gettin' raw 
It's time to turn it up" You're shady 
Don't wanna live another day with you, day with you 
So shady 
Can't even think about seein' you, 'bout seein' you He's a mystery to me 
But I'll get you on your knees, knees 
He's a mystery to the street 
Oh, with a hand clap we're gonna get into the beat He's a mystery to me 
But I'll get you on your knees, knees 
He's a mystery to the street 
Oh, with a hand clap we're gonna get into the beat H-h-here we go now 
H-h-here we go now 
Zip, a, dee, doo, dah, ah, zip, a, dee, day 
Oh, my, my what a wonderful way, hey Talk about gettin' down and out 
Everything in your program canceled out 
I know you're questionin' and figurin' out 
But do you wanna play pain or the twist and shout? Everybody gonna rock n' roll 
We're pullin' like a mad lever, out of control Everything that you said was no, no 
And everything that we did was so, so 
And everywhere we went we'd roll 
And do you wanna play Twister or maybe Polo? Think it over like a game of chess 
If you wanna win the test, gotta beat the best 
What you gonna do when we do the limbo 
Now what you gonna say when I switch the tempo? You're shady 
Don't wanna live another day with you, day with you 
So shady 
Can't even think about seein' you, 'bout seein' you He's a mystery to me 
But I'll get you on your knees, knees 
He's a mystery to the street 
Oh, with a hand clap we're gonna get into the beat He's a mystery to me 
But I'll get you on your knees, knees 
He's a mystery to the street 
Oh, with a hand clap we're gonna get into the beat We're gonna show you how 
This is the jump off, we wanna see you jump, oh 
Time for the night, jump off, wanna see you jump, oh Mmm, we gonna show you how 
This is the jump off 
Gonna show you now, this is the jump off 
We wanna see you jump, oh He's a mystery to me 
But I'll get you on your knees, knees 
He's a mystery to the street 
Oh, with a hand clap we're gonna get into the beat He's a mystery to me 
But I'll get you on your knees, knees 
He's a mystery to the street 
Oh, with a hand clap we're gonna get into the beat
