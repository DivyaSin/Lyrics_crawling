On the first of May 
Toads grow fat on stolen Hosts In little boxes crucified 
Bled and divined When all the girls Suckle beasts within their arms 
Pact-bound familiars Spill their guts on secrets spied On Midsummer's night 
All true love is undisguised In philtres foul by lasses cowled 
Brewed and derived Some fat of an unbaptized babe A finger of a corpse 
Dug up from the grave Dating with Witchraft And come the Fall 
When the fires light the night 
Summer's love grown old and sad 
Will die away On Samhain's eve 
Blood of swine will wash them clean 
From the memories good and bad 
The spells of May And for those still in dream 
Summer's green eternally 
Stolen away by the Sidhe 
Noone knows they've ever been A tongue of a snake Ground mummy's powder 
The head of a dog 
Piss and snot Dating with Witchcraft
