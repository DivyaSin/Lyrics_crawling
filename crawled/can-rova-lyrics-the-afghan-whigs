Start the car 
Check the mirror 
Shut the door 
Slot the gear 
We leave tonight 
Ain't nothin' but the stripes 
Ain't nothin' but the stripes See the light 
Be the night 
Feel the road 
River rise, synchronize 
Bleed some more 
We leave tonight If I'm uncivilized, child 
That's okay 
You're gonna see me light a fire 
On my days 
But you don't see me 
You don't see me 
You don't see me 
I can't see you 
Anymore If all in vain, I call your name 
As tho the end was near 
A slow decay 
A sad refrain 
And then I disappear 
We leave tonight 
Ain't nothin' but the stripes
