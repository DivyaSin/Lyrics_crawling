many times i forgot, I'd simply wait for my lot 
angelic i thought you to be so much for what you think of me 
smile as you really frown, then grin as you look around 
flip-flopped it all upside down 
you may not be lost but i'm still not found it's so easy to forget what we had 
it's so easy but so sad, sad 
it's so easy to wave goodbye 
so easy but don't cry it's not as simple as i thought 
time for me to pay what i brought 
never really could make it last 
you looked better as we passed 
lie as you swear the truth 
and laugh as you try to prove 
can't stop your hypocrisy 
you may be blind but i still can't see it's so easy to forget what we had 
it's so easy but so sad, sad 
it's so easy to wave goodbye 
so easy but don't cry feel the time slip away 
don't have another day i'm tired of the battles fought 
stepped down from ideas i thought 
never wanted another enemy 
you're a jacked up fantasy 
spin as you're standing still 
then fall to the ground astounded 
tip-toed all around your speech 
you still might fall but i still won't reach. it's so easy to forget what we had 
it's so easy but so sad, sad 
it's so easy to wave goodbye 
so easy but don't cry
