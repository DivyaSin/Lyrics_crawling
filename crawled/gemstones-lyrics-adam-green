Gemstones cracking, cause we're just too strong 
Drum-sized yearning 'cause the pressure's gone 
Supervised love, crucified stuvs 
Simmering red in the sex farm clubs 
There's an exit to this desert 
Dangling freely from the shingles in the snow 
She's a show off, Xanax Zoloft 
Blank faced footprints of the zebras in the glen Cavemen humping in the sterling space pod 
Drumstick pumpkin in the Starbucks courtyard 
Gigolos dance, stepping on toes 
Benedryl nights in the okay holes There's an exit to this desert 
Dangling freely from the shingles in the snow 
She's a show off, Xanax Zoloft 
Blank faced footprints of the zebras in the glen Let's break into the labyrinth of lies 
Let's dive off the end of his eyes 
Hollywood hills, peppermint pills 
I can still taste the grime that you stuffed in my gills
