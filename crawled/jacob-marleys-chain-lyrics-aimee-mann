Well, today a friend told me this sorry tale as he stood there trembling and turning pale he said each day's harder to get on the scale sort of like jacob marley's chain. 
But it's not like life's such a veil of tears it's just full of thoughts that act as souvenirs for those tiny blunders made in yesteryears that comprise jacob marley's chain. 
Well, I had a little metaphor to state my case it encompassed the condition of the human race but to my dismay, it left without a trace except for the sound of jacob marley's chain. 
Now there is no story left to tell so I think I'd rather just go on to hell where there's a snowball's chance that the personnel might help to carry jacob marley's chain.
