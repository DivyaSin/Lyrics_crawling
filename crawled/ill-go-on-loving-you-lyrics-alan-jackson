When I look into your soft green eyes 
When I see your delicate body revealed to me 
As you slip off your dress 
I'm reminded that what I feel for you 
Will remain strong and true 
Long after the pleasures of the flesh [Chorus] 
And I'll go on loving you 
I'll go on loving you 
I'll go on loving you And be it the wind 
Or the rain 
Or the moon up in the sky 
The spin of the earth 
Or the changes in the tide 
I don't know what brought us together 
What strange forces of nature conspired 
To construct the present 
From the past [Chorus] When I look into your soft green eyes 
When I see your delicate body revealed me 
As you slip off your dress 
I'm reminded that what I feel for you 
Will remain strong and true 
Long after the pleasures of the flesh [Chorus]
