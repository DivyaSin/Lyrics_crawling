Go as a luxury pass on to the middle class 
Why are poor paying pounds for the broken glass 
And as we point our fingers we turn our backs 
We can't accept each other and that's a matter of fact 
And doctor who do you shoot 
Youths or one boy 
Ever since the day you've seen the rich get you 
Children you won't need to get a part of it 
Broke away from the grape and this all started it 
So you won't stay or take a drug at all 
'cause you know you're so susceptible 
They turn and get you, now you're full of hate 
You can't accept it, now you're in an irate state This is wrecks-n-effects and I shake up their flex 
They got techs break their necks 
And their building their reps 
Who the boos 
Who to choose how they wearin' the shoes 
In army I enlist and takin' a piss 
Certain things I have seen 
So I'm lookin' to grieve 
Powers usually runnin' 
They're buyin' the buildings 
And then they sell 
At least a bell and they're breakin' 'em down 
My life to the rocks 
Livin' in a shoebox 
Social security 
They like the poor in me 
Bring out the whore in me 
Then knock the door on me 
Cheap tricks don't like chicks 
And I'm rubbin' their hips 
Who the boos 
Who to choose how they wearin' the shoes It was a long time ago and started to grow 
Forest fire earned and sent me afrocentric negroes 
So I juxtapose 
This goes out to those 
Who turned up their nose a long time ago 
Now I flex upon a rhythm cushion tempo 
I flex upon a rhythm cushion tempo 
So open your mind 
If you feel you could go 
Clean out your ears well 
While I clear my throat 
The vital ingredient, the antidote 
Willy wee flex like some other one It's a feelin' that I get sometimes 
When I'm lyin' in my bed sometimes 
Black cloud in my head sometimes 
Intoxicating my mind, my mind 
It's not that I wanna die 
Baby just that I wanna fly 
But this feelin' that I get sometimes 
I could sever all ties, all ties Hate the color of my skin sometimes 
Hates to see what I see sometimes 
So how can I ever win my time 
I was sold on the other side 'cause a wasted life is no such thing 
There's no such thing as a wasted life 
'cause life is death and death is life 
And these here thoughts are not a crime 
One day is forever, forever is a day 
It's so fucking easy to throw it all away
