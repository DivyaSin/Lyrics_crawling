Fourteen hours a day, fourteen days in two weeks 
A fortnight out to sea, I'm far from home, alright by me 
Off the coast of Japan, then the Ivory Keys 
I put my back into my distancing, the distant seas I'll sail away, I'll sail away, forever and forever 
Hoist the jig, skip the rope, do whatever you do 
To get me into the blue 
Alright by me Hey mamasita, ain't it great? 
Ain't it wonderful? 
Hey mamasita, ain't it great 
When you're worlds away? Getting further away, putting distance between 
Myself and all the shelves of smarmy, charmy human creeps 
Interruptions are gone, lost in a reverie 
Nothing but wind, waves and inspiration for my peeps I'll sail away, I'll sail away, forever and forever 
Hoist the jig, skip the rope, do whatever you do 
To get me into the blue 
Alright by me Hey mamasita, ain't it great? 
Ain't it wonderful? 
Hey mamasita, ain't it great 
When you're worlds away? Now, I am guided by the stars 
And by the red sun 
I go where I want, for good or ill 
Please, winds blow whither you will 
Whither you will, whither you will Hey mamasita, ain't it great? 
Ain't it wonderful? 
Hey mamasita, ain't it great 
When you're worlds away? Hey mamasita, ain't it great? 
Ain't it wonderful? 
Hey mamasita, ain't it great 
When you're worlds away? When you're worlds away, the things are great 
When you're worlds away, the things are great 
When you're worlds away, the things are great
