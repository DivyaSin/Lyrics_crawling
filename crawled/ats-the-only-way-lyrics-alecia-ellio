I could stay here in this moment 
Let tomorrow go 
You could ask me if I love you 
If I dance around the truth with you 
It would only be a lie 
'Cause all I really want to do 
Is love you 'till the day I die [Chorus:] 
Whole heartedly 
Every part of me 
All or nothig, nothin' else would do 
Touching heart and soul 
Never letting go 
Baby that's the only way 
To love you I'm gonna give you honesty 
That's what you deserve 
A promise to believe in 
You can count on every word 
Faithful and forgiving 
That's how I want to be 
It's gonna be so easy 
'Cause baby that's the way you love me [Chorus] Touching heart and soul 
Never letting go 
Baby that's the only way [Chorus] To love you [Repeat]
