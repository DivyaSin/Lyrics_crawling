It's slowly turning inside out 
It's breaking down from here 
This makes me want to scream and shout 
Can't wait to disappear Inside/Holding on, Holding out, Holding in everything 
I feel like I'll lose my mind 
I'm standing beside myself 
Wake up you're wasting your life 
Don't wave goodbye You're working your way outside in 
You swear that you can steer 
You play the game but not to win 
Only leave to reappear Inside/Holding on, Holding out, Holding in everything 
I feel like I'll lose my mind 
I'm standing beside myself 
Wake up you're wasting your life 
Don't wave goodbye Break down 
I'll dedicate myself to changing this time 
We could suffer all in style 
Break out 
I'm tired of all this rehabilitation 
Let's go make it all worth while And I am holding this inside 
Sometimes I'm not sure I could try 
It just feels safer if I hide 
I don't waste time by asking why 
Maybe I could change some day 
I got nothing much now to say 
I can't stop shaking and my body's aching 
I'm so close to breaking down this time Inside/Holding on, Holding out, Holding in everything 
I feel like I'll lose my mind 
I'm standing beside myself 
Wake up you're wasting your life 
Don't wave goodbye Break down 
I'll dedicate myself to changing this time 
We could suffer all in style 
Break out 
I'm tired of all this rehabilitation 
Let's go make it all worth while Must have some reason to smile
