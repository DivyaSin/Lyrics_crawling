Verse 1: So I made it rain like reindeer, 
Slidin' down the North Pole, 
She gettin' coal, 
She took Alaska Airlines and pissed my name in the snow. (UH-HUH) I'm from the grizzly bear trap man, 
This shit's real, I'm not actin', 
I see Russia from my cabin, 
Mustache got ya speechless, Charlie Chaplin. CHORUS: Alaska Vacation, 
Everybody in the room is Chevy Chasin', 
Guestlist thin ice, no glacier, 
Sorry, there's no room, Mrs. Palin. Gotta catch em all, Deadliest Catch. 
Sniffin snow with eskihoes, just for the halibut, (UH-HUH) 
Gold rush in my mouth, no counterfeit,(UH-HUH) 
Sled dogs got faded, ended up in Vegas. Verse 2: First team pick, from the Last Frontier, AH! 
Dropping Jagerbombs like North Korea, 
Northern Light's dragon: nickname The Mushu, 
Snapchats & Tattoos, 
Let's get weird in my igloo. She sweatin', 
She got it, 
I'mattel from the molly pocket. 
Took a magic mushroom, 
And she bouncin' on my head, 
So I call her Mario Chalmbers. Fear and Poaching, 
Clubbin' with seals till I hit the floor, 
Ass Quake magnitude, 
Made me think it was 64. CHORUS: Alaska Vacation, 
Everybody in the room is Chevy Chasin', 
Guestlist thin ice, no glacier, 
Sorry, there's no room, Mrs. Palin. Gotta catch em all, Deadliest Catch. 
Sniffin snow with eskihoes, just for the halibut, (UH-HUH) 
Gold rush in my mouth, no counterfeit,(UH-HUH) 
Sled dogs got faded, ended up in Vegas. Verse 3: Mr. Popper take my AK from my cold dead hands, 
Imma ship you back to Canada with Piers Morgan, 
Danny D, please stop mean muggin' at my penguin, 
You say you're cool, I'm minus one hundred & fifty then. Pigs showed up cause the room was full, 
Broke it up quick like an icicle, 
Snatch that Green Incredible, 
Stole a few beers, Amber Alert! Alarm goin' off, it's time to go, 
Race against time, Balto 
On the rink, Mighty D, 
So I give her that duck, Flyin' V.
