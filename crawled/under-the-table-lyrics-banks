It already started 
I tried to stop it but I already know 
You are something I should do without, but I won't 
I'm under the table 
Just keep wishing I'll come out but I don't 
You are something I should do without, but I won't Please tell me that this could be easy 
I'm tired of waiting for permission to love 
Heartbreak is your game, but I'm learning 
My heart could be yours, won't you make it your home? I'm already falling 
I couldn't help it, didn't think of the risks 
I got a problem, problem when I look in your eyes 
You're mine and you know it 
I'd still do it even if we were cursed 
Won't you be my problem, it's okay with me if it hurts Please tell me that this could be easy 
I'm tired of waiting for permission to love 
Heartbreak is your game, but I'm learning 
My heart could be yours, won't you make it your home? Please tell me that this could be easy
