Coldest water breaks over my soul 
Let this heart just beat like your own 'Cause you're never far away, baby 
Even when you're far away, hmm I promise You're always on mind (always in my mind) 
It's like I'm with you all the time 
You showed me what it was to feel love 
And you took me far above the rest Coldest water breaks over my soul 
Let this heart just beat like your own Because you're never far away, baby 
Even when you're far away, hmmm I promise 
Because you're never far away, baby 
Even when you're far away, I promise No I'm never leaving, no matter the reason 
You keep believing in our love, we'll only keep it 
You give me the strength to hold on You're always on mind 
It's like I'm with you all the time 
You showed me what it is to feel love 
And you took me far above the rest
