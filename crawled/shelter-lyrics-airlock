Calling me, calling me 
Back to the air that I want breathe (?) 
Drawing me, drawing me 
Back to the ground, that I once stood upon Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls 
Deep calls to deep in this place 
All of your waves and your breakers sweep over me 
The rain that beats down like a drum Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls 
Deep calls to deep in this place 
All of your waves and your breakers sweep over me 
The rain that beats down like a drum Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls 
Deep calls to deep in this place 
All of your waves and your breakers sweep over me 
The rain that beats down like a drum 
The rain that beats down like a drum 
Drum drum drum drum drum ....
