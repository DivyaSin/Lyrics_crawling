Regret 
Betray 
Turn your back 
Walk away 
Forget me 
Betray 
And now you're filled with shame 
We shared our lives 
Our friendship stains 
What's left for us? 
A life's worth of pain 
Regret 
Tattooed on your fingertips 
You'll never escape this 
Regret 
The weight upon your fingertips 
Everything is meaningless 
You set yourself up for one more day 
A day of suffering alone in shame.
