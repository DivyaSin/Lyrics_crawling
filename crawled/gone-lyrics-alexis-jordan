Fighting getting less interesting 
(Know that) phase when it just sound a bit boring 
(Know that) still gone but yeah I'm still locked in 
(Know that ) my feelings, you can't visit them Ya face confused, I got my mind made up 
Got me being more cautiously blind Oh 
I don't need your love, don't need that kind of love 
Oh 
I don't need your love, don't need that kind of love 
I'm already gone, I'm already gone 
Boy, you keep knocking, knocking and nobody's home 
I'm already gone, I'm already gone 
Ain't no more waiting, waiting, I had to move on 
I'm already gone, I'm already gone 
I'm already gone, I'm already gone 
Ain't no more waiting, waiting, I had to move on We wasting more time than we spend 
(Know that) That pressure building up within 
(Know that) Now it's too late to make amends 
(Know that) No need to wonder where I've been So pick your face up off the ground 
Boy don't make a sound 
You must be out of your mind if you think I'mma stick around Oh 
I don't need your love, don't need that kind of love 
Oh 
I don't need your love, don't need that kind of love 
I'm already gone, I'm already gone 
Boy, you keep knocking, knocking and nobody's home 
I'm already gone, I'm already gone 
Ain't no more waiting, waiting, I had to move on 
I'm already gone, I'm already gone 
I'm already gone, I'm already gone 
Ain't no more waiting, waiting, I had to move
