Can we work this out 
I don't want to close the door 
Before the sun goes down 
We can't let this go to far 
I'll do anything 
To meet you anywhere you are 
Cause it doesn't matter anymore 
Who was right or wrong 
If we could only find the words we lost 
Before what we have is gone Say it now, I hope we find a way 
To say it now, don't be afraid 
To say it now, everything we're keeping inside 
Don't wait just let your heart speak 
Don't waste another heart beat 
Cause we'll never know 
Until we let it out, let it out 
Say it say it now 
Say it say it now My heart is wearing thin 
I don't want to fight a war 
That no ones going to win 
All this time we've grown apart 
Looking for an end 
If I'm the one that's holding on 
Holding back 
Here's how we begin Say it now, I hope we find a way 
To say it now, don't be afraid 
To say it now, everything we're keeping inside 
Don't wait just let your heart speak 
Don't waste another heart beat 
Cause we'll never know 
Until we let it out, let it out 
Say it say it now 
Say it say it now I hope we leave it all behind 
No more getting lost between the lines Can we work this out 
I don't want to close the door 
Before the sun goes down Say it now, I hope we find a way 
To say it now, don't be afraid 
To say it now, everything we're keeping inside 
Don't wait just let your heart speak 
Don't waste another heart beat 
Cause we'll never know 
Until we let it out, let it out 
Say it say it now 
Say it say it now Cause we'll never know 
Until we let it out, let it out 
Say it say it now
