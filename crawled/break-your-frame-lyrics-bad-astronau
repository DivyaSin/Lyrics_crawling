it's safe to be lonesome in your time 
it's safe to lose your find 
but you're too sick to call or cry 
'cause you're hating all the fakin' 
the kind of hate that evil just embraces 
and I've given up on people right now 
I've givien up on anger, so I've given up on you. 
you know it's true, you're gonna lose 
it really doesn't matter who you choose 
break your frame, break your frame 
there's no one left to blame 
break your frame, break your frame 
there's no one left to blame 
and you're hating well I might break your heart 
in time you fall apart 
and I was sad when I heard the news 
I heard you fell apart 
break your frame, break your frame 
there's no one left to blame 
break your frame, break your frame 
there's no one left to blame
