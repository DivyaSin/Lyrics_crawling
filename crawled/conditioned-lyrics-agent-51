I could use a little help 
Getting back my guts 
These past two years have run me down 
To the ground 
When I got the nerve just to break it all 
Wide open 
Seems the further I go, the farther back I get 
Can't you see we're 
Conditioned - To believe a "truth". 
Connection - To perceive it's you 
Domination - Weakened to the point where I'm dead. 
Tranquilize my insides 
Till I just up and turn to meat 
Surely you and your friends 
Could have a feast 
Take a trip to yesterday 
'Cause today the sun ain't shinin' 
Wish I had more than nothin' to believe in. 
They I don't need no one 
I don't need no one 
I don't need no one 
I don't need no one 
Can't you see we're conditioned
