Somewhere out there in the smoky air 
Where the night is neon blue 
Surrounded by strangers 
She don't know the dangers 
One drink could lead to two 
And if she fails, it's all my fault 
For doin' a good woman wrong 
I can't be far behind her 
Oh Lord, help me find her 
Before my angel is gone Looking for my blue angel 
The same one that flew from my arms last night 
If you see my blue angel 
Tell her that Heaven without her 
Feels like Hell tonight Last night when she left I told myself 
That she wouldn't go too far 
Now I'm not sure how long her tears could last 
In a stranger's arms 
She's wounded I know and feeling so low 
She could fall at any time 
I don't know what I would do 
If I were to lose that precious angel of mine Looking for my blue angel 
The same one that flew from my arms last night 
If you see my blue angel 
Tell her that Heaven without her 
Feels like Hell tonight
