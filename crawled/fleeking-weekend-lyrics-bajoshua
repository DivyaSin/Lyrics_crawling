The Morning Sap From Dew 
A Closet Full Of Cluttered Shoes 
I Put My Trust In You 
To Meet Me Half Past Dark And Blue A Dangerous Risk No Clues 
Communication Sun And Moon 
On A Corner Rondevu 
Fleeked Up Two Pairs Of Running Shoes On A Saturday You Could Have Wound Up Anywhere 
At Some Club Somewhere Last Call The Dark The Blue 
But You're With Me I'm With You Running Shoes That's So Cool You're Mother Heals In Wars 
She Worries About Your Stupid Car 
You Fear The Worst To Come 
We Pass A Bum In Camouflage By Making Light Of Things 
I Savor My Accomplished Dream 
We Intertwine Our Hands 
I Chant To Make Her Princess Gleam (x's 8) 
It's Ok It's Alright We're Going To Win It's Not Our Fight On A Saturday You Could Have Wound Up Anywhere 
At Some Club Somewhere Last Call The Dark The Blue 
But You're With Me I'm With You 
Running Shoes That's So Cool
