THE WISDOM OF A FOOL 
WRITERS ROY ALFRED, ABNER SILVER If you're lucky enough 
To have someone who loves you 
Then be glad that you got 
Someone who loves you 
Cold lips that were warm 
Can grow cool 
Listen to the wisdom of a fool 
When you take his poor heart 
And you do something to it 
And you think to yourself 
Why did I do it 
You may find that the 
World can be cruel 
Listen to the wisdom of a fool 
Now I had a love 
Just the same as you 
And I was a fool 
Not to see 
But you still have time to say 
Your love him 
I'm afraid it's too late for me 
So, go back to the arms 
That you know will be waiting 
Hold him close in your arms 
And be glad that he's waiting 
You'll be happy 
Believe me, if you'll 
Only listen to the wisdom of a fool 
Only listen to the wisdom of a fool
