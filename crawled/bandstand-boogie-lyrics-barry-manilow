We're goin' hoppin', we're goin' hoppin' today 
Where things are poppin' the Philadelphia way 
We're gonna drop in on all the music they play 
On the bandstand (bandstand) We're goin' swingin', we're gonna swing in the crowd 
And we'll be clingin' and floatin' high as a cloud 
The phones are ringin', my mom and dad are so proud 
I'm on bandstand (bandstand) And I'll jump and hey, I may even show 'em my handstand 
Because I'm on, because I'm on the American bandstand 
When we dance real slow I'll show all the guys in the grandstand 
What a swinger I am, I am on American bandstand We're goin' hoppin', we're goin' hoppin' today 
Where things are poppin' the Philadelphia way 
We're gonna drop in on all the music they play 
On the bandstand (bandstand) Bandstand, bandstand, bandstand 
Bandstand, bandstand, bandstand Hey I'm makin' my mark, gee, this joint is jumpin' 
They made such a fuss just to see us arrive 
Hey it's Mr.Dick Clark, what a place you've got here 
Swell spot, the music's hot here, best in the east 
Give it at least a seventy five Now for all you Joe's, here goes my American handstand 
Because I'm on, because I'm on the American bandstand 
As we dance real slow, I'm showin' the guys on the grandstand 
That I like my girl but I love American bandstand The singers' croonin', he ain't the greatest but gee 
My baby's swoonin' in front of all of TV 
So if you tune in, you'll see my baby and me 
On the bandstand (bandstand) And now we're hoppin' and we'll be hoppin' all day 
Where things are poppin' the Philadelphia way 
And you can drop in on all the music they play 
On the bandstand And we'll rock and roll and stroll on American 
Lindy hop and slop, it's American 
Tune in, I'm on, turn on, I'm in, I'm on 
Today, bandstand
