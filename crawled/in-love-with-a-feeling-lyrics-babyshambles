They would if they could, but they can't 
So if they talk like they could 
Are you going to heed a word they say 
All I'm trying to say was I'm in love with a feeling 
I know that it shows 
Yes I'm in love with a feeling 
And I don't care who knows There's a very odd man over there 
I don't mean to alarm you 
He's by the stairs 
No I don't mean to alarm you He's swimming around all over town 
Meaning, no feeling 
Are you going to heed a word they say 
No, all I try to say was I'm in love with a feeling 
I know that it shows 
I'm in love with a feeling 
And I don't care who knows There's a very odd man over there 
I don't mean to alarm you 
Hes by the stairs 
I don't meant to alarm you I'm still waiting for you to show me fire 
Oh how's your fever 
Like an open book 
Oh you can read me Oh la la la la la They would if they could, but they can't 
So if they talk like they could 
Are you going to listen to a word they say 
All I'm trying to to say was I'm in love with a feeling 
I know that it shows 
I'm in love with a feeling 
And I don't care who knows Because of his hob knob 
Oh la la, I think love was a dirty word 
Love all the time 
Only in a friendly way 
Not too friendly, not too friendly
