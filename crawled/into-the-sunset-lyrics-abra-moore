There was a boy 
He was a young boy 
He took his shirt off in the rain 
And he started to sway He'd reached for the raindrops 
That fell through the air 
He didn't seem to have a care 
In the whole wide world And everyone he touched would turn to gold 
And every time he loved his heart would explode 
Then one day he climbed so high to touch the sky 
And it carried him away And everyone he touched would turn to gold 
And every time he loved his heart would explode 
Then one day he climbed so high to touch the sky 
It carried him away There was a boy 
He was a young boy 
He took his shirt off in the rain 
He was funny that way One, two, three, four
