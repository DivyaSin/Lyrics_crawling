Well you can differentiate with the best of them 
Yeah you can sure find your dx and dy 
Wontcha let me scootch on over to the desk next to you 
And I'll show you some things on my TI Now don't think I'm being a square 
But I think I want us to be a nerdy pair Well you can sure arrive at some decent sig figs 
That we learned in Chemistry 
Yeah you can be my tutor and we'll get a little gooder 
We gotta lotta potential energy Now please don't think I'm being obtuse 
But I think I like the look of your hypotenuse Nerd Girl, I get goofy over you 
Nerd Girl, yeah I'll be a nerd for you, too The way you build a whizzer just knocks me on my gizzard 
I'll bet L'Hopital never felt like this 
Please don't make me apply torque to twist your arm 
I would even do word problems for a kiss Now don't think I'm being a square 
But I neven wanna letcha outta my hair How many moles of affection till I win this election? 
I would even run the Hearing Curve twice 
I need to integrate you as a part of my life 
Yeah I got plans for us in Nerd Paradise Now please don't think I'm being obtuse 
But I think I like the look of your hypotenuse
