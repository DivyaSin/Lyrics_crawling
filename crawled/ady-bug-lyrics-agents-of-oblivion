lady bug, lady bug, lady bug 
kisses the bones pushing thru 
everybody here seems to be in their head but me 
twitching, twistin 
beyond alone 
spiritless and out of context 
ultra-violet beam 
everybody's eyes seem to ooze from their faces 
the sun sets in reverse 
the devil's gonna dream when he gets home of the ants upon the bones 
germs on public telephones 
lady bug, lady bug 
kisses the bones pushing thru 
swaying with this wicked city 
twisting and turning with you 
everybodys eyes seem to ooze from their faces 
the sun sets in reverse 
lady bug, lady bug 
kisses the bones pushing thru 
swaying with this wicked city 
twisting and turning with you 
the devils gonna dream when he gets home of the ants upon the bones 
germs on public telephones 
lady bug, lady bug, lady bug 
kisses the bones pushing thru
