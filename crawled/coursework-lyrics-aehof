The pressure increases, 
Never ceases. 
Theres no word for the pain I feel, 
It's so unreal. There is only one thing that can do this to me, 
I'm sure you see. 
The impossibilities mount, 
The size I cannot count. It can only be coursework! 
It's sending me berserk! 
It can only be coursework! 
It's taken me to the point of overwork! I have two essays due in tomorrow, 
And no-one's work to borrow. 
My heart's filled with sorrow, 
As I look towards tomorrow. I have an oral again, 
It's such a pain, 
Everything's in vain, 
I'm doing one again. It can only be coursework! 
It's sending me berserk! 
It can only be coursework! 
It's taken me to the point of overwork!
