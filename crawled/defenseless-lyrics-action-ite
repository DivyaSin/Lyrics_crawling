Picture your heart breaking, like a thousand times before 
Picture your hands shaking, you can't take it anymore 
Picture your arms stretched out, trying to hold on 
And then then a hand reaches to save you from it all I've never been a fighter, no 
I've always seemed to hold my own 
So i'm not gonna try and fight this feeling anymore 
When the walls hit the ground 
Build 'em up tho watch them fall 
You can take what is left 
But the truth is that your love leaves me 
Defenseless, defenseless, defenseless 
Left me defenseless, defenseless, defenseless Picture your heart mending, 
For the first time you feel whole 
Picture you fears ending 
As you start to take control I've never been a fighter, no 
I've always seemed to hold my own 
So i'm not gonna try and fight this feeling anymore 
When the walls hit the ground 
Build 'em up to watch them fall down 
You can take what is left 
But the truth is that your love leaves me 
Defenseless, defenseless, defenseless 
Left me defenseless, defenseless, defenseless And i will let down my guard 
Just to know who you are 
So i'm not gonna try and fight this feeling anymore Defenseless, defenseless, defenseless 
I am defenseless, defenseless, defenseless When the walls hit the ground 
Build 'em up to watch them fall 
You can take what is left 
And forget about the rest 
'Cause i will let down my guard 
Just to know who you are 
Defenseless, defenseless, defenseless
