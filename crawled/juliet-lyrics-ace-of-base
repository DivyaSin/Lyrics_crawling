Juliet 
A girl you never should have met 
Oh, Juliet 
She acted like shes never seen your face before 
Its not funny honey when you try 
and shes not even willing to learn 
Its not funny honey when youre only after money 
Could you ever try to earn? [Chorus] 
So, Howzat! 
Whats up a bright and clear new summer day 
Well, Howzat! 
Wake up and breath the air and sail away 
So, Howzat! 
Whats up now, dont you worry night and day 
Always remember, dont you remember me? Yeah Juliet, 
how could she ever you forget 
Oh, Juliet 
She acted like shes never seen your face before 
Its not funny honey when you try 
and shes not even willing to learn 
Its not funny honey when youre on your own 
And the pages never turn [Chorus] Never meant to hurt you 
But thats just the way it went 
Its not my intention 
pretending to be Heaven Saint 
Juliet, whats up a bright and clear new summer day [Chorus] Juliet
