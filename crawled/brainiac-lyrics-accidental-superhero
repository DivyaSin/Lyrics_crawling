i saw the light as it shone 
you grabbed my soul as it moaned 
we were standing alone we left well enough alone but it 
turned around and followed us home 
there was nothing easy to say i need a change 
i want something new 
take me the same way 
i took you i saw the light as it shone 
you grabbed my soul as it moaned 
it was never something 
i wanted to throw away 
then the wheeze from the 
serpent drivers grabbed a hold 
through the different guises 
drying out, weeping eyes 
of sanity i need a change 
i want something new 
take me the same way 
i took you i need a change 
i want something new 
take me the same way 
i took you i would've got away with it 
if it wasn't for you 
meddling kids
