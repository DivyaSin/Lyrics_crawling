When you wake up each morning 
And you feel like calling 
I'll be there for you 
When the road seems uncertain 
And you can't stop the hurtin' 
I'll be there for you When there's no one beside you 
I'll be there to guide you 
Catch you each time you fall 
When the stars won't shine anymore 
I'll be there When the world is unkind 
And your dreams, they need more time 
I'll be there for you 
If the rules, they keep breakin' 
And the future is fadin' 
I'll be there for you The rainbow will land 
In the palm of your hand 
Don't ever let it go 
When the stars won't shine anymore 
I'll be there Who knows where we'll go 
What will tomorrow bring? 
When we have each other 
Just hold on tight 
We can take to the skies, 
And fly I'll be there for you I'll be there for you The rainbow will land 
In the palm of your hand 
Don't ever let it go 
When the stars won't shine anymore 
I'll be there The rainbow will land 
In the palm of your hand 
Don't ever let it go 
When the stars won't shine anymore 
I'll be there 
I'll be there
