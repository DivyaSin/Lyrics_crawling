Birds do it, bees do it 
Even educated fleas do it 
Let's do it, let's fall in love 
In Spain, the best upper sets do it 
Lithuanians and let's do it 
Let's do it, let's fall in love The dutch in old Amsterdam do it 
Not to mention the Finns 
Folks in Siam do it 
Think of Siamese twins Some Argentine, without means, do it 
People say, in Boston, even beans do it 
Let's do it, let's fall in love Romantic sponges, they say, do it 
Oysters, down in oyster bay, do it 
Let's do it, let's fall in love Cold cape cod clams, against their wish, do it 
Even lazy jellyfish do it 
Let's do it, let's fall in love Electric eels, I might add, do it 
Though it shocks 'em, I know. 
Why ask if shad do it 
Waiter, bring me shad roe. In shallow shoals, English soles do it 
Goldfish, in the privacy of bowls, do it 
Let's do it, let's fall in love
