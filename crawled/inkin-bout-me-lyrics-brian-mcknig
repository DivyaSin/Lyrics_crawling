Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah Today is your wedding day and that's a beautiful thing 
No use in me going into the way things used to be 
How I cared for you, you cared for me and that wasn't that long ago 
But I can't help but smile as you walk down the aisle 
'Cause there's one thing I know, hey-hey Every time you close your eyes at night 
You know inside your heart that something ain't right 
And things are not the way that you wish they could be 
Even though you're with him, I know you're thinkin' 'bout me 
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me, yeah I know you think it's easier to lie to yourself 
Even got yourself believing you're better off with somebody else 
So you sacrifice for security 
'Cause your impatient self didn't run away from me 
And you settle for the first thing through the door 
When you know what you want is me Every time you close your eyes at night 
You know inside your heart that something ain't right 
And things are not the way that you wish they could be 
Even though you're with him, I know you're thinkin' 'bout me 
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me, yeah I know he thinks you're crying 'cause it's the happiest you've ever known 
But girl you'd just be lying 'cause what he doesn't know 
You're strong for me, you belong to me 
And here's the one last chance for you to go 'Cause every time you close your eyes at night 
You know inside your heart that something ain't right 
And things are not the way that you wish they could be 
Even though you're with him, I know you're thinkin' 'bout me It may not be tomorrow but there will come a day 
But when you realize, I hope it's not too late 
'Cause things won't be the way that you wish they could be 
Even though you're with him, I know you're thinkin' 'bout me I know you're thinkin' 'bout me 
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me 
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me Yeah, yeah, yeah
