I ASKED YOU TO SIT WITH ME 
FOR THE SUN RISE 
I SAID IT'S QUITE A THING TO SEE 
BUT YOU TURNED TO ME AND SAID 
NO THANK YOU I'D RATHER WATCH THE T.V. 
WHAT'S AH MATTER WITH YOU 
YOU'RE GOING NO WHERE 
WHAT'S AH MATTER WITH YOU 
WHY DON'T YOU CARE 
WHAT'S AH MATTER WITH YOU 
AFRAID OF A STARE 
WHAT'S AH MATTER WITH YOU 
REALIZE LIFE'S NOT FAIR 
I ASKED YOU TO TAKE A DAY OFF 
WORK AND SPEND IT WITH ME 
BUT YOU TURNED TO ME AND SAID 
NO THANK YOU 
I'VE NO TIME AND LIFE'S NOT FREE
