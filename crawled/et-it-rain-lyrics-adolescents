Nothing original 
The sin I wear 
Unholy wound 
This open tear 
All of god's children 
Would truly understand 
The midnight flight 
The crimson sand Let it rain 
Wash it all away 
Let it rain 
Let it rain Thorns of Christ 
No peace on earth 
Lord of flies 
King of dirt 
The search for tomorrow 
Lies in these eyes of fire 
A test of faith 
Will transpire The road to peace lay at your door 
The road to peace and nothing more
