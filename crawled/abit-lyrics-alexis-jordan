Your love is a habit 
Take my body, you can have it 
Reach for me, baby, grab me 
Take my body, you can have it Your love is a habit 
Take my body, you can have it

Take my body, you can have it Love me like I'm gone out of style 
Touch me like the jewel of the Nile 
Run for me like a blue flame 
Take me higher and higher 
And higher and higher, baby I got the world inside of my palm 
But it's nothing without your love 
Riches and fame got to reach so old 
But it's nothing without your love Money, but it's nothing without your love 
Cars, but it's nothing without your love
