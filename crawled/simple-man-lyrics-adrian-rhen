I can feel the west wind blow 
I can see the raindrops falling 
count the clouds up in the sky 
or sitting down to watch the fire die I can hear the railroad call 
once each hour all night long 
I can feel the lonely nights 
multiply when you're not in sight don't want these circles anymore 
I know it's you that I adore 
there's nothing that I can find 
and I say just one more time I'm just a man a simple man 
who doesn't want to say goodbye 
I'll hold on tight cause this feels right 
I can feel your love tonight I can put on fancy clothes 
grab my wine and drink it slow 
or I could take you for a ride 
on the ferris wheel if you'd like can't run these circles anymore 
I know it's you that I adore 
there's nowhere else I'd spend my time 
and I say just one more time I'm just a man a simple man 
who doesn't want to say goodbye 
I'll hold on tight cause this feels right 
I can feel your love tonight And I can't believe there is another way 
for this to end for us 
listen close to the words I have to say 
and come with me tonight if all you need is the moonlight 
steal it will I from the night 
if other lovers took the stars 
I'll win your love with my guitar and I I'm just a man a simple man 
who doesn't want to say goodbye 
I'll hold on tight cause this feels right 
I can feel your love tonight I can be the man who finds 
all the things that make you smile 
I can be the one to tries 
to use this song to make you cry
