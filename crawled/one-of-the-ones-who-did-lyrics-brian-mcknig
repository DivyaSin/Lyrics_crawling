For every little girl and every little boy 
Whose mother and father is across the waters 
Fighting the war that they know nothing about 
We pray for You tonight, God help us, listen We're running outta time, can't waste it, can't waste it 
Have you seen the news today? 
War is on the uprise, who said it was to be this way? 
Lord, I know that millions won't make it, yes, Lord 
This life's all I have to live and I'll gladly give it 
To be one of the one's who did, thank You Ever since creation, we've been counting down the time 
From then to now and we will see, nations fighting nations 
I hide the world inside my heart then I read about 
Man inventing weapons of mass destruction to tear us all apart 
But like the rising of the sun 
We're waiting for You to come and take us away 
Those of us who believe in You, believe me when I say We're running outta time, can't waste it 
Have you seen it, have you seen the news today? Guess what? 
War is on the uprise, who said it was to be this way? 
Lord, I know that millions won't make it, but I'm so glad Jesus 
This life's all I have to live and I'll gladly give it 
To be one of the one's who did I'm gonna hang on to You, Lord 
I'm gonna stay strong for You Lord, yeah 
I'm gonna keep holding on, gonna keep holding on 
To Your unchanging hand, Lord You know the plan 
That You have for me, it's not my will 
But Your way, and I'm gonna follow that way, Lord Oh Lordy, with a made-up mind, I'm willing to go on through 
I'm not gonna worry about what my friends might say 
Or my friends might do, hey 
I'm gonna follow You, Lord, I'm gonna follow You, Lord If I let it all go, if my momma, if my momma don't go 
If my sista don't go, if my brotha don't go 
I'm going, I'm going through, Lord 
If my preacher don't go, said I'm going 
Oh Lordy, oh Lordy, oh Lordy 
I surrender all with a made-up mind 
I'm going through, oh, care So Father, we pray right now that You hear our cries 
For peace, for restoration, give us hope right now 
Without You we can't make it, we've tried and we're sorry 
But we look to the hills, from it cometh our help 
'Cause we know our help comes from You We're gonna hold on, I said we're gonna hold on to You 
We're not gonna let go this time, Father 
We're gonna trust and have faith, the size of a mustard seed 
Bless your name, Father, You're worthy, You're worthy, thank You
