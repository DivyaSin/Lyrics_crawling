Screaming just for mercy 
I am no monster man 
Knowing makes you guilty 
Not free of any faults I see a hot, hot fighting 
On controversial sides 
To call my mercy killer 
'cause I did it right For love I gave you fading life 
For love I had to give you up I am no monster man - mercy or crime 
Dead or alive dead or alive 
I am no monster man - mercy or crime Facing all the trouble 
I still remember our nights 
And we're swearing both to free us 
When life is only pain For love I had to give you up I am no monster man - mercy or crime 
Dead or alive dead or alive 
I am no monster man - mercy or crime 
Dead or alive dead or alive 
Monster man 
I am no monster man - mercy or crime 
Dead or alive dead or alive 
I am no monster man - mercy or crime 
I am no monster man
