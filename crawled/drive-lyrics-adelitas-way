Life can be black and white 
We need a little colour 
That's what I'm searching for It's like I'm driving blind 
I need a little summer 
I need to feel the world The touch 
The taste 
I'm feeling all my senses going, 
off the way, that you do 
I'm off the flame 
I finally got the messages in love 
He's in love It's like I'm burning alive 
You are the fuel in my fire, tonight 
I'm burning alive 
I've got a ticket to ride, tonight Drive, Drive, Drive 
(Lets just drive) 
Drive, Drive, Drive 
(Lets just drive) 
Drive, Drive, Drive 
(Lets just drive) 
Drive, Drive, Drive 
(Lets just drive) Her body lights the streets 
Sometimes her beauty's blinding 
I let her take my soul The touch 
The taste 
I'm feeling all my senses going, 
off the way, that you do 
I'm off the flame 
I finally got the messages in love 
He's in love It's like I'm burning alive 
You are the fuel in my fire, tonight. 
I'm burning alive 
I've got a ticket to ride, tonight. Drive, Drive, Drive 
(Lets just drive) 
Drive, Drive, Drive 
(Lets just drive) 
Drive, Drive, Drive 
(Lets just drive) 
Drive, Drive, Drive

I'm seeing colour

Yeah! It's like I'm burning alive 
You are the fuel in my fire, tonight 
I'm burning alive (i'm burning alive) 
I've got a ticket to ride, tonight
