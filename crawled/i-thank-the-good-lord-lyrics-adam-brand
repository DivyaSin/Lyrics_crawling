I thank the good Lord 
For sending you 
I believe in miracles 
Yeah now I do 
And I can't help but thinking 
Someone upstairs made a big blue 
But I gotta thank him 
For sending you I can still remember the first night we met 
My mouth it wasn't working 
Neither was my head 
It must be intervention or it must be divine 
Could be kindness week 
Or it could be the wine Now I pray that you will say yes tonight 
'Cause I'm gonna ask if you will be mine
