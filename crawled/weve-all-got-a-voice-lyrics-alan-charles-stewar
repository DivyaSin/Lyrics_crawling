CHORUS 
hey there come and hear what we say 
and we hope you don't mind if we put it this way 
'cos we've all got a voice at the end of the day 
if you want to see what we mean 
come and hear what we say he asked for a million dollars 
then he asked for a million more 
he said if I don't get what I want 
I'm going to walk right out that door 
so we gathered around his mahogany desk 
and wished him a fond farewell 
six months have passed and we're doing pretty well 
six months gone and we're doing rather well they talk of how to counter insurgence 
with a strategy that's clear 
but do they spend five minutes on our city's streets 
broken glass and cans of beer 
there's no human rights around midnight 
when our people hide in fear 
if you can do one thing then get me out of here 
if you can't do nothing then get me out of here CHORUS 
hey people etc we believed in copenhagen 
kyoto cape town and cancun 
on a mission against emission 
they were too weak to see it through 
so do we turn and head for the uplands 
and mourn for the coral reef 
it's hard to accept that all this should come to grief 
and hard to deny that they have betrayed our belief CHORUS 
hey man etc there's a pub up on the corner 
where we used to raise a jar 
they had jazz on Sunday mornings 
with snacks up on the bar 
but now the landlord he looks like a dangerous dog 
with an earing through his nose 
he's got the cranial tatoo but there's something about his clothes 
he's got a problem with his clothes CHORUS BRIDGE step change sea change 
loose change spare change 
any change at all 
are we going to get ready 
or do we take the fall she stands at a first floor window 
a baby in her arms 
(she knows that) one more day on that desperate estate 
will only bring her serious harm 
she's been vandalised she's been brutalised 
she's been driven to her knees 
but with one small step perhaps they can be free 
just one small step and then they can be free CHORUS 
hey sister etc (then CHORUS repeat ad lib out)
