I can tell when you lie 
It's so obvious 
The wink of a mannequins eye 
Some say it's written inside 
Inside all of us 
Everybody learns how to lie I know we had it before 
But it went away 
Where in the world did it go 
I'm happy here on my own 
And thats fine with you 
You were never steady or slow Every time the phone rings, I run 
Every time George sings here comes the sun 
Every time I feel like it's all been done 
That's okay, that's alright I'm alive I wonder where are you now 
Are you happy still 
Happier than when you were mine 
I know it don't seem like much 
But I owe you that 
A piece of me is your piece of mind
