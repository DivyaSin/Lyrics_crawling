you busted up my pride with a hard shot 
I'm bleeding from my eyes still you wont stop 
my hands did the best they could 
but not enough 
so talk down to me again 
remind me how pathetic I am 
and how perfect you were 
disappointment offends 
and I could really use a friend 
but your not listening I cried my eyes out 
begging for you to reach down 
still you watched me drown 
its never good enough for you 
I'm not enough for anyone 
I'm not enough for anyone don't let the direction of your finger blame me 
I'll break it off and shove it back through your teeth 
so now its pointed it you 
if I could have anything 
now what would it be 
I'd make sure that I owe you nothing 
then I'd spit in your face 
laugh and walk away 
and I'd never look back once it all be said and done
