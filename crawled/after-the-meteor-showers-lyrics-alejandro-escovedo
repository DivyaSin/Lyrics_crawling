She was pretty as a starlet 
Take a photo please 
Her skin was soft white luminescence 
Like a candle in the wild wind You can blame the stars 
You can blame the wind 
You can blame the meteor showers 
Or the original sin Her mind was deep and sharp like poison 
And like poison I drank it up 
Her lips were red hot like fire 
Like fire in a pewter cup You can blame the stars 
You can blame the wind 
You can blame the meteor showers 
Or the original sin She was pretty as a starlet 
Take a photo please 
Her skin was hot white luminescence 
Like a candle in the vicious wind You can blame the stars 
You can blame the wind 
You can blame the meteor showers 
Or the original sin
