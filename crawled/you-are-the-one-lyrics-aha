You are the one 
Who has done me in 
Guess you knew from the start 
I call again, but there's no one in 
Don't know where, 
With whom you've been 
But I do love you 
Anyway you want me too You are the one 
Now the state I'm in! 
Catching you was so hard 
I fought for you, 
Did you let me win!? 
You don't even care, 
You don't care where I've been 
But I do love you 
Anyway you want me too I've done all I can do 
All the letters I've sent through 
Put my life in the palms of your hand 
Maybe now you can see 
That it's got to be me 
But if you leave me 
I'll understand, yeah 
If you leave me, 
I'll understand You are the one 
Who has done me in 
Guess you knew from the start 
I call your friends, 
But there's no one in 
Catching you is so hard
