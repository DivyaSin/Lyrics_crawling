I been around on this journey 
And I'm learnin', the world keeps turnin' 
You gotta face the fight, just to live the dream 
Who would've believed, that what I've achieved 
Tourin' the globe, and all those fond memories 
Who would've guessed it would be like that Through it all, who's been there for me 
Took care of me, even shed a tear for me 
You're the one who kept it real 
So, in return, this is how I feel [Chorus] 
Do you mind where I came from? 
And I have to tell you in this song 
Without you, where would I be? 
(Come on, hear me out now) 
No word of where this road may lead me 
Hometown boy, with his face on T.V. 
It's plain to see 
That without you, there'd be no me It's a dream that I've come so far 
The ups and downs were there 
But I've worked so hard 
Many people don't know the life I live 
Always on the road, always plannin' a show 
Gettin' down to business, in the studio 
I can face the day 'cause the love you give Through it all when the day is done 
The night's begun, you're still my number one 
You're the one who kept it real 
So, in return, this is how I feel [Chorus] One shout to my family 
'Cause when things get hard they understand me 
Two shouts to my boys at home 
Although I'm not there, you know you're not alone 
Three shouts to my label 
'Cause without them I would not be able 
To make the fourth shout-out 
The ones I think about 
The masterpiece to the master plan 
That's you, the fans [Chorus: x2]
