I'm sittin' in my chair watchin' the TV 
It's not even on, but there is plenty for me to see 
I just lit some crazy ass shit 
That my friend overnight-mailed me I'm fuckin' wasted 
It's the best shit I ever tasted 
I think they fuckin' laced it 
'Cause I'm so damn lambasted Oh my friend over so packed him a pipe 
I told him he better go easy on this shit 
But he didn't believe the hype He sparked three bowls just to show he could take it 
Two minutes late he was playin' backgammon naked He's fuckin' wasted 
It's the best shit he ever tasted 
He's lost in fuckin' space-ed 
'Cause he's so wicked wicked wasted Oh I spent the last two hours iding under my bed 
'Cause I looked in the garbage can and I think I saw my Uncle Louie's head I'm fuckin' wasted Well my friend blew a hit into my pet bird's face 
The bird laughed hysterically and started to moon walk all over the place 
He tripped over the toaster wire and fell on his beak 
He looked at the two of us and he started to speak I'm fuckin' wasted 
It's the best shit I ever tasted 
My brain's been erased-ed 
Well fuckin' fried Now I'm sittin' in the bathtub wantin' somthing to eat 
I wanted a pizza- the bird said 'uh, pepperoni would be sweet' 
Delivery guy showed up four hours later, handed me his shoe 
I said, 'We ordered pizza buddy, what the hell's up with you?' I'm fuckin' wasted 
It's the best shit I ever fuckin' tasted 
Oh fuckin' shit I'm way too baked
