dead girl 
there will never be another one that dreams like you 
dead girl 
there will never be another one that screams like you 
when death sleeps, it dreams of you 
delilah played the dead girl at the freak show 
she smiles like a ghost 
like zombies eatin dust in mexico 
when death sleeps, it dreams of you 
she asked if it would hurt 
i smiled and said no 
the lie ran down my chin like embryo 
she smiles like corpse 
like zombies eatin dust in omaha 
when death sleeps, it dreams of you 
when death sleeps, it dreams of you 
dead girl 
there will never be another one to look in your eyes 
dead girl 
there will never be another one that bleeds like you 
i been drying in a dead age 
i been reeking of the new plague 
the sound of the ocean is dead 
its just the echo of the blood in your head 
sister, burn the temple 
and stand beneath the moon 
the sound of the ocean is dead 
its just the echo of the blood in your head 
the sound of the ocean is dead 
its just the echo of the blood in your head
