I'm the dandy highwayman who you're too scared to mention 
I spend my cash on looking flash and grabbing your attention 
The devil take your stereo and your record collection! (oh-oh) 
The way you look you'll qualify for next year's old age pension! Stand and deliver your money or your life! 
Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife! I'm the dandy highwayman so sick of easy fashion 
The clumsy boots, peek-a-boo roots that people think so dashing 
So what's the point of robbery when nothing is worth taking? (oh oh) 
It's kind of tough to tell a scruff the big mistake he's making Stand and deliver your money or your life! 
Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife! And even though you fool your soul 
Your conscience will be mine 
All mine We're the dandy highwaymen so tired of excuses 
Of deep meaning philosophies where only showbiz loses 
We're the dandy highwaymen and here's our invitation (oh oh) 
"Throw your safety overboard and join our insect nation" Stand and deliver your money or your life! 
Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife! And even though you fool your soul 
Your conscience will be mine 
All mine Qua qua da diddley qua qua da diddley 
Qua qua da diddley qua qua da diddley Stand and deliver your money or your life! 
Stand and deliver your money or your life! 
(repeat)
