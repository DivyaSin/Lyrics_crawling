(Hook) 
Something out this world, nothing like the rest 
Born to play the game, fuckin with the best 
It's a kid with a grown man rep to protect 
So I'm still waitin for some hoe layin left in distress (Verse) 
I'm coming for your neck, hey I ain't indirect 
Payin debt, pay respect, now I'm comin to collect 
They regret what they said, that's when I become a threat 
Make a bet that the next time you need to come correct 
This the type of music, make it fuckin flex 
Start the gangsta movie, throwin up the set 
All the pretty bitches feelin on they breasts 
And the government cutting all the checks, everybody stressed (Hook) 
Something out this world, nothing like the rest 
Born to play the game, fuckin with the best 
It's a kid with a grown man rep to protect 
So I'm still waitin for some hoe layin left in distress (Verse) 
If knowledge is power 
And power is knowledge 
And then you divide and conquer 
I devoured and conquered 
The youth is my environment 
Inspire us responsibly 
But they'd rather drop it like it's hot 
That wobbly-wobbly 
If you ever thought of robbin me my mom with m probably 
I believe it's highway robbery, the fuck out the driver seat 
Honestly part of the problem, you deprivin your privacy 
This is private property, you part of the poverty 
You false just like the prophecy 
That's part of the policy 
Obviously just bring technology, democracy's mockery 
My doc made a hypothesis, he said that I'm obsolete 
The power of the god in me, no tellin what I'ma be (Hook) 
Something out this world, nothing like the rest 
Born to play the game, fuckin with the best 
It's a kid with a grown man rep to protect 
So I'm still waitin for some hoe layin left in distress (Bridge) 
Never ever, never ever, never do it 
Just never knew 
Just be as a kid 
Never ever, never do it, never me (Hook) 
Something out this world, nothing like the rest 
Born to play the game, fuckin with the best 
It's a kid with a grown man rep to protect 
So I'm still waitin for some hoe layin left in distress
