WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT HAPPINESS ? Tore up the letter 
You sent me from Paris 
And went outside Glad you feel better 
Now you found happiness deep inside Took your advice and went into therapy but WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT HAPPINESS ANYWAY ? 
WHAT'S SO FUN ABOUT FALLING IN LOVE ? 
YOU LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR 
THAT ONE DAY It'll DISAPPEAR 
OR SPEND YOUR LIFE JUST TRYIN' TO BE HAPPY. Feeling ambitious 
I washed up the dishes 
And made some lunch Mixed up the mayo 
With fresh avocado and lettuce Each little bite reminded me of you, but WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT HAPPINESS ANYWAY ? 
WHAT'S SO FUN ABOUT FALLING IN LOVE ? 
YOU LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR
