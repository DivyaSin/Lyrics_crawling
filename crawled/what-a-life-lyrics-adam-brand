hat A Life On the higher side of 30 goin' on his second wife 
They got 4 kids in between 'em livin down by the riverside 
Oh what a life 
He don't get no paid vacations 
But the weekends get him right 
He puts the boat out on the lake every Sunday 
Till the sun goes down at night 
Oh what a life Oh what a life 
Oh what a life 
He makes no demands 
And there's no need to apologise 
It's hard to worry about rain when you're walkin' on the sunnyside 
You're either doin' what you have to 
Or you're doin' what you like 
You're either doin' what you have to or doin' what you like 
Oh what a life Well he sets up in the corner 
With an old Fender guitar 
And he plays 9 till 2 for 50 bucks and tips in a jar 
Oh what a life 
Singing songs he wrote or that he halfway knows 
Every Friday and Saturday night he's the star of his own show 
Oh what a life
