Born the middle son 
Of a farmer 
And a small town 
Southern man 
Like his daddy's 
Daddy before him 
Brought up 
Workin' on the land 
Fell in love 
With a small town woman 
And they married up 
And settled down 
Natural way of life 
If you're lucky 
For a small town 
Southern man First there came 
Four pretty daughters 
For this small town 
Southern man 
Then a few years 
Later came another 
A boy, he wasn't planned 
Seven people 
Living all together 
In a house built 
With his own hands 
Little words with love 
And understanding 
From a small town 
Southern man And he bowed 
His head to Jesus 
And he stood 
For Uncle Sam 
And he only loved 
One woman 
He was always proud 
Of what he had 
He said 
His greatest contribution 
Is the ones 
You leave behind 
Raised on the ways 
And gentle kindness 
Of a small town 
Southern man 
Raised on the ways 
And gentle kindness 
Of a small town 
Southern man Callous hands 
Told the story 
For this small town 
Southern man 
He gave it all 
To keep it all together 
And keep his family 
On his land 
Like his daddy 
Years wore out his body 
Made it hard 
Just to walk 
And stand You can break the back 
But you can't break 
The spirit 
Of a small town 
Southern man And he bowed 
His head to Jesus 
And he stood 
For Uncle Sam 
And he only loved 
One woman 
He was always proud 
Of what he had 
He said 
His greatest contribution 
Is the ones 
You leave behind 
Raised on the ways 
And gentle kindness 
Of a small town 
Southern man 
Raised on the ways 
And gentle kindness 
Of a small town 
Southern man Finally death 
Came callin' 
For this small town 
Southern man 
He said it's alright 
'Cause I see angels 
And they got me 
By the hand 
Don't you cry 
And don't you worry 
I'm blessed 
And I know I am 
'Cause God 
Has a place in heaven 
For a small town 
Southern man And he bowed 
His head to Jesus 
And he stood 
For Uncle Sam 
And he only loved 
One woman 
He was always proud 
Of what he had 
He said 
His greatest contribution 
Is the ones 
You leave behind 
Raised on the ways 
And gentle kindness 
Of a small town 
Southern man 
Raised on the ways 
And gentle kindness 
Of a small town
