And when the moon enrapts the streams 
And trembles on the fen 
A thousand years have flown it seems 
Since then 
For if today I part the veil 
And see what time portended 
I feel that long ago the tale 
Was ended Little I knew in youth's enchantment 
That it is alike absurd 
Or to lean against a shadow 
Or believe a woman's word 
For if today I part the veil 
And see what time portended 
I feel that long ago the tale 
Was ended Though she once betrayed 
Though empty words spoken 
I wished she'd have stayed 
Remain with a heart that's broken For I no longer am confined 
In that sweet country's spell 
I have left you far behind 
Farewell
