We are the pushing, pulling 
We are breaking the distance 
If there's still sometime in our thoughts 
We walk away, and back again 
Under the night sky, the twilight 
We find ourselves 
Here again 
Breaking out of standstill 
We are the drifters from the shore 
We are colors in the landslide 
We are the burdens? off the floor 
Pushing, pulling 
We are breaking the distance 
Under the night sky, twilight 
We walk away, and back again 
breaking out of standstill 
We are the drifters from the shore 
We are colors in the landslide 
We are the burdens? off the floor.
