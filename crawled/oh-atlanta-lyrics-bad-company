Same old place, same Old City, What can I do, I'm falling in love, 
I'm just an old hound dog, Roaming around, oh lord, 
I got all this and heaven above, Oh, Atlanta, hear me calling, I'm coming back to you one fine day, No need to worry, there ain't no hurry, 'Cause I'm, on my way back to Georgia, On my way 
back to Georgia. I get a feeling when I remember, All the crazy days and 
crazy nights, Country music playing, You must have heard 
them saying, They're going to whip it up, And light up the lights Oh, Atlanta, hear me calling, I'm coming back to you one fine day 
No need to worry, there ain't no hurry, 'Cause I'm, on my way back to Georgia, On my way back to Georgia. Same old place, it's the same old city, What can I do, 
I'm falling in love, I'm just an old hound dog, Roaming around, 
oh lord, I got all this and heaven above Oh, Atlanta, hear me calling, 
I'm coming back to you one 
fine day, 
No need to worry, there ain't no hurry, 
'Cause I'm, well, Atlanta hear me calling, 
I'm coming back to you one fine 
day, 
No need to worry, no need to hurry, 'Cause I'm, on my way back to Georgia, 
On my way back to Georgia, 
On my way back to Georgia, 
On my way back to Georgia, 
On my way back to Georgia, 
On my way, on my way, 
n my way back to Georgia, 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, 
Georgia on my mind, 
On my way back to Georgia
