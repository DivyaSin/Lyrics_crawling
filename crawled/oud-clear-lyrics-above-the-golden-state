Im not afraid to hear the silence 
Im not afraid when Im alone 
And Ive seen a symphony of sunsets 
Ooh, but I wanna know You as Im known 
I can hear You loud and clear Youre the song inside my head 
The melody I cant forget 
Louder than the world Im in 
Youre the song Ive always heard 
The instrument of grace throughout the universe 
Louder than the world Im in Im not afraid to look in darkness 
Im not afraid to lose control 
I love how You orchestrate the sunrise from the starlight 
Give me a song to call my own 
I can hear You Youre the song inside my head 
The melody I cant forget 
Louder than the world Im in 
Youre the song Ive always heard 
The instrument of grace throughout the universe 
Louder than the world Im in Life is an offering 
Inside of this heartbeat 
Today is a new song Every verse is a new thought 
And every breath is a chorus 
My life is ascending, my life is ascending Youre the song inside my head 
The melody I cant forget 
Louder than the world Im in 
Youre the song Ive always heard 
The instrument of grace across a fallen world Youre the song inside my head 
The melody, Your grace throughout the universe 
Louder than the world Im in Louder than the world Im in 
Louder than the world Im in
