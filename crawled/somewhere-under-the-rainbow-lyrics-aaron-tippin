This street that we live on 
Anit no yellow brick road 
And this pay check, that I bring home 
Sure aint no port of gold 
When people dream they don't wish they wake-up 
They don't know we got more then enough 
Somewhere under the rainbow 
Watchin the late show and livin on love 
Dancin slow to the radio, yeah holdin on 
Somewhere uder the rainbow 
Some folks send there whole life, dreamin bout the other side 
Well there anit this far, that old blue birds fly 
But I'll take forever, were the skys aren't always blue 
Cause when I'm in your arms, I know dreams come true 
Somewhere under the rainbow, watchin the late show 
Livein on love, and dancin slow to the radio 
Just holdin on, somewhere under the rainbow 
Somewhere under the rainbow, yes watchin the late show 
And livin on love, and dancin slow to the radio 
Yeah holden on, somewhere under the rainbow
