I'm the host of remorse in a town of revenge 
I can try to heal everyone for them 
I can write it in blood and send it to you 
remember to remind you with my worst 
but I was always civilized sad advance 
to reserve in atrophy so I find solace 
in resending my regrets and time 
will move on to the next waiting 
station closer to the target 
I missed but I was only missing something 
sense to believe in something strong 
faith in some reward as time is 
wasting all of us deformed I left 
her in may the fifth of dismay but 
i'm going to keep my trophy
