Well the big bodacious beauties down on Plum Grove Rd 
Give out greetings of generous salutations. 
And along comes Succulent Sam and the Champagne Man 
And they say "Do you know the way to Gloryland". 
So they go on down to the local bar 
Where choir boys sing their praises tonight 
And Succulent Sam grabs both ladies hands and says 
"Would you like to get intimate tonight". 
Well now the aging primadonnas down on bartenders row 
Are dressed with signs of perfection. 
And they pop a pill as a sign of good will 
And the boys see it as a prescription to fill 
And the local Raggedy Ann and Andy 
They are dancing under smoked fill lights 
Oh, he tries to cop a peek, as he kiss's her cheek 
And says "Would you like to get intimate tonight". 
Well now, Succulent Sam and the Champagne Man 
Got dumped for some boys from Waukegan. 
And the aging primadonna's lay a hand upon their breast 
And they pray to the good Lord to restore a lost commandment 
And the big bodacious beauties they are rumbling now 
With the choir Boys in the loft land of life. 
And Succulent Sam fends off the Champagne Man. 
And says "You ain't getting intimate tonight"
