So who do we have here - On a Sunday morning? 
I can even see your fear -Mister Holier-than-thou 
You open your lips to pray - Give you one last warning 
If I turn your bread to stone, tell me - Who will save you now? Lead us not into temptation 
Taste it, be inspired 
Take what you desire Preacher, Preacher 
You sexy creature 
The things I'll teach ya 
When you are mine Preacher, Preacher 
The truth will eat ya 
So let me reach ya 
And I'll blow your mind Hands raised to the sky - Beggin' for salvation 
But you'll be achin' for fire when you're on your knees 
Turn you into what you hate - Heaven's condemnation 
Seduction or submission - It's all the same to me Drink the wine of pain or passion 
Take my judgment in 
Choke on all your sins Preacher, Preacher 
You sexy creature 
The things I'll teach ya 
When you are mine Preacher, Preacher 
The truth will eat ya 
So let me reach ya 
And I'll blow your mind Preacher, Preacher 
You sexy creature 
The things I'll teach ya 
When you are mine Preacher, Preacher 
The truth will eat ya 
So let me reach ya 
And I'll blow your mind Now your victim comes for vengeance 
I will wield the sword 
Thrust it with a roar Preacher, Preacher 
You sexy creature 
The things I'll teach ya 
When you are mine Preacher, Preacher 
The truth will eat ya 
So let me reach ya 
And I'll blow your mind Preacher, Preacher 
You sexy creature 
The things I'll teach ya 
When you are mine Preacher, Preacher 
The truth will eat ya 
So let me reach ya 
I'll blow your mind Preacher, Preacher 
Can I teach ya? 
Preacher, Preacher
