I'll be with you in apple blossom time 
I'll be with you to change your name to mine 
One day in May, I'll come and say 
Happy the bride that the sun shines on today What a wonderful wedding there will be 
What a wonderful day for you and me 
Church bells will chime 
You will be mine in apple blossom time I'll be with you, when? In apple blossom time 
Then what will you do? 
Then, I'll be with you to change your name to mine 
When will that be? One day maybe in May 
Then what will you do? 
I'll come and say to you dear 
Happy surprise that the sun shines on today
