Hunter of tears, relative to pain 
half of this world is dark with the stain 
the stain of unknowing the dead flowe buds, 
on smiling lips is innocent blood 
the corpse of your god can only rot 
and grow cold now promise 
you'll kill me before I get old 
I heard you on the telephone moaning 
my doom a cold woman will kill me in a darkened room 
the chain-saw smile of the mortician shines 
I still got all my fingers 
but somewhere I lost my mind 
I can smell abortion on you I can see thru 
I take the gun out of my mouth and point it at you
