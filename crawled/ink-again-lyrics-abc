Better call and collect 
Treat me with respect 
If you think our love is pedigree Push a button... disconnect 
Dial again... redirect 
You're wrong... you know it isn't me Totally misguided 
Babe you're misadvised 
Don't even try to fight it 
Your promises are lies Did you think our love was sacred 
Well it's much too over-rated 
Think again... you're wrong 
Better look what heaven sent me 
Think again... you're wrong Don't need a horoscope 
Don't need a telescpe 
To see the way you cheat on me Think I'd give up hope 
Hanging by a rope 
If I though you'd never set me free Totally misguided 
Think our love is strong 
Think I'd get excited 
I think you got it wrong Did you think our love was sacred 
Well it's much too over-rated 
Think again... you're wrong 
And our love's a precious memory 
Better look what heaven sent me 
Think again... you're wrong I'll admit to being confused 
And I'm used to being used 
Think again... you're wrong 
So wrong... so wrong... so wrong... 
Think again... think again... think! Think again... think! 
Think again... think! Love to believe you - love you and leave 
You're wrong... so wrong 
Hate to deceive you - love you then leave 
You're wrong... so wrong 
No secret sneak preview - don't need to see 
You're wrong... so so wrong
