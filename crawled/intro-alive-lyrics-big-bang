All around me just feel me 
New York to Cali now feel me 
We gettin' this like this no miss we hits 
Like a cannon ball get my drift, oh Yeah, yeah, oh child I love that sound 
Make me wanna get up throw my head so wild 
It's so damn physical GD got you busy now 
See me gettin' (Crazy) Benjis by the millies now I hit'em with some more style (Deadly) 
You know I'll blow down every single brick in a showdown 
(In only the first round) 'Cause that's how it goes down 
T-O-P this ain't the last of me It's steady takin' over me Just can't stop movin' my feet And I don't wanna stop baby I'm fine I hope y'all ready for this 'cause yo we got that Big Bang 
Just get up throw up your fist and yo follow when sing 
La la la Number one
