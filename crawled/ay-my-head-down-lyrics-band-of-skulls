Was I asleep did you save me from disaster 
Wake up and tell me I'm just imagining 
Thought I would brave it cause I don't wanna live in doubt Dreamt of escape but I'm nowhere near the feeling 
Fell from a high but I never hit the ground 
Can't hold the weight of your words heavy on my mind So I'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run, 
Keep it away from my soul, I'm not holding it all 
I'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run, 
All that we know will get old, and with you I'll unfold 
I'm gonna lay my head down Open your hand I know your heart line's the deepest 
You will replace it a new love you will find 
Say all you like but I'll make it better on my own So I'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run, 
Keep it away from my soul, I'm not holding it all 
I'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run, 
All that we know will get old, and with you I'll unfold 
I'm gonna lay my head down So I'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run, 
Keep it away from my soul, I'm not holding it all 
I'm gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run, 
All that we know will get old, and with you I'll unfold 
I'm gonna lay my head down
