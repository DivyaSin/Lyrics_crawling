I was dreaming of your love 
I was lost in your arms embrace 
Our bodies collide together 
Whoa, this ultimate betrayal The heart will not resign 
What could be said, what could be done? 
I hold out hope 
For your reciprocation Like an animal 
These thoughts have gone beyond my control 
For pleasure 
Maybe just amusement This overwhelming urge 
Towards you I feign disinterest 
While I covet the attention 
While I crave your affection Ravenous with lust 
Jackal in heat, spit dripping 
This mechanical impulse 
Knows not loyalty or mercy Like an animal 
These thoughts have gone beyond my control 
For pleasure 
Maybe just amusement Like an animal 
These thoughts have gone beyond my control 
For pleasure 
Maybe just amusement
