Standing on the bridge 
waiting for the sun to rise 
I get the feeling that I'm never gonna get my mind 
back and I don't mind my feet are on the ceiling 
and my big fat juicy heart is bleeding. Blood's a runnin like the Nile, 
down the hall 
you start to cry and drop the knife 
as I begin to crawl 
towards the piano 
you're still standing in the door 
tell me I'm dying baby, Yeah, I know. Now you look like an angel with the mercy of love. 
To pure to be from below to wicked to be from above. You come over 
so I can feel your heartbeat inside your chest 
give me a kiss that tastes (like) cheap 
wine and cigarettes. 
And the red blood's still spreading everywhere, it's in your pretty little hands and it's in your black hair. Things go black 
and then we're in a place so serene, 
swimming in a deep blue canyon mountain stream. Out of the water sitting looking in each other's eyes 
your rusty wet lips and brown skin look so nice. Then a feeling, a vision, 
I never had before like I was you & you were me 
and we were sitting on heavens floor. And I still see it baby, 
even though the time, 
it takes, is weighing on me Hey hey, mama hey hey Standing on the bridge
