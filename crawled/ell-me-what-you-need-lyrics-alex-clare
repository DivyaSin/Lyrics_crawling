[Verse 1] 
Tell me what you need 
From the signs I can not read 
Something's wrong 
How can we move on? 
You're not a heartbreaker 
But you're making my world quake 
You earthshaker [Pre-Chorus 1] 
Gotta dig deep 
Cause your mind is crazy and I can't sleep 
Can not sleep 
[Chorus 1] 
Open your mouth, I can't read your mind 
Speak to me, give me a sign 
Won't you just, won't you just... 
Open your mouth, I can't read your mind 
I can't read your mind [Verse 2] 
You used to talk all the time 
Share your thoughts, ten to the dime 
Something's changed 
Now you're acting strange 
I know that you care 
When I speak, just sit and stare [Pre-Chorus 2] 
I gotta dig deep 
Cause your mind's running wild and, and I can't sleep 
Can not sleep [Chorus 2] 
Open your mouth, I can't read your mind 
No, you don't have to walk away 
Said you never would 
I never hear a word you say 
Don't speak when you should 
Speak to me, tell me what you need 
Won't you just... 
Open your mouth, I can't read your mind 
I can't read your mind [Bridge] 
And I sleep, oh 
I can read your mind 
And I sleep [Chorus 2] 
Open your mouth, I can't read your mind 
No, you don't have to walk away 
Said you never would 
I never hear a word you say 
Don't speak when you should 
Speak to me, tell me what you need 
Won't you just... 
Open your mouth, I can't read your mind 
I can't read your mind
