Outside in ruthless city canyons 
Rivers of people oveflow Gunshots in the skyway valley madness 
Ricochet as my mind starts to implode Oh no, no Help me 
Help me 
I'm trapped in a Prison without prison bars Help me 
Help me 
I'm trapped in a Prison without Prison bars Everyday someone's trying to sell me something 
Through coloured images flashing on my t.v. screen 
But my mind is stripped there's no reaction 
I don't get what they're saying to me no more 
No more Help me 
Help me 
I'm trapped in a prison without Prison bars Help me 
Help me 
I'm trapped in a prison without prison bars (Help me, help me) Searchlights overhead staring down on me 
I've got a mountain of trouble to release 
One day the hunter will be the hunted 
Got my back up against the wall 
Trapped in a prison without bars Trapped in a prison without 
Prison bars 
Trapped in a prison without 
Prison bars Help me 
Help me 
I'm trapped in a prison without prison bars Help me 
Help me 
I'm trapped in a prison without prison bars (Help me)
