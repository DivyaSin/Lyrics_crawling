I went outside 
To take a walk 
So I could relive memories 
I thought that you would lend a hand But you were never ever there 
It's all in your mind 
You do what you want to do 
Your promises are all played out You've got your wish 
You've worn me down 
I've treated you the best I could 
I realize that I don't need you I lost my way 
When you left home 
I thought that you could change your life 
What did I do Why do you lie 
You've walked back in 
My hands are tied 
It's all in your mind You do what you want to do 
Your promises are all played out 
You've got your wish 
You've worn me down I've treated you the best I could 
I realize that I don't need you 
It's all in your mind 
You do what you want to me It's all in your mind 
You do what you want, to me 
I'm tired 
I'm so damn angry with you You're not gonna change 
I see who you really are 
Your promises are all played out 
You've got your wish You've worn me down 
I've treated you the best I could 
I realize that I don't need you 
Your promises Your promises 
Your promises 
They're all played out 
You're so played out You're so played out 
You're so played out 
They're all played out
