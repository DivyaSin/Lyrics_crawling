Hmm, hmm 
Hmm, hmm I wanted the music to play on forever 
Have I stayed too long at the fair? 
I wanted the clown to be constantly clever 
Have I stayed too long at the fair? 
I bought me blue ribbons to tie up my hair 
But I couldn't find anybody to care 
The merry-go-round is beginning to slow now 
Have I stayed too long at the fair? 
The music has stopped and the children must go now 
Have I stayed too long at the fair? Oh, mother dear, I know you're very proud 
Your little girl and kingdom is so far above the crowd 
No, daddy dear 
You never could have known 
That I would be successful, yet so very much alone 
I wanted to live in a carnival city 
With laughter and love everywhere 
I wanted my friends to be thrilling and witty 
I wanted somebody to care 
I found my blue ribbons all shiny and new 
But now I discover them no longer blue 
The merry-go-round is beginning to taunt me 
Have I stayed too long at the fair? 
There is nothing to win 
And there's no one to want me 
Have I stayed too long at the fair?
