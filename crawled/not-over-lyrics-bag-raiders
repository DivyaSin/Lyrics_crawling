Cut like a picture from a paper safely tucked away 
Well thats how my heart is for you 
You keep yours guarded like a palace hiding all its jewels 
Thats just how hard it is for you 
You found somebody yeah ok well I found somebody too 
No need to put on such a show 
If we should fight it out Im sure we'll take it to the other 
No one should ever have to know Its not over til its over 
Oh no but we'll try 
To make it right for just one night 
We tried Its seemed a good idea the first time that we had each other 
Why don't we just leave it at that 
I know that nothing lasts forever this could change any minute 
And we might never change it back 
We keep on running til tomorrow closer to the future 
Sometimes it seems so far away 
I stared at pictures from a faded to a weaker image 
You're pushing on Im pushing play Its not over til its over 
Oh no but we'll try 
To make it right for just one night 
We tried
