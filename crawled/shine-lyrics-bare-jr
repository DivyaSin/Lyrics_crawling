I forget dreams and lies 
I try and I try 
Think you should know 
Just what I like 
You should by now, somehow, 
Be living without 
I would rather shine in your eyes 
Hold me up, I'm coming down 
Headfirst for the ground 
Running right by my side, 
Till the end 
I would rather shine 
I would rather shine in your eyes 
I would rather shine 
I would rather shine in your eyes 
As you walk with me on this one way track 
All that you give, I won't give back 
So much of myself I hide from me 
I want to be all that you say you see in me 
I would rather shine 
I would rather shine 
I would rather shine in your eyes 
I would rather shine 
I would rather shine 
I would rather shine in your eyes
