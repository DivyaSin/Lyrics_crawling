(Before the Rollie) 
Before the Rollie, before the fame (Before the fame) 
Before the money, before the game (Before the game) 
Before them bitches 
Before they ever knew my name 
Before the Rollie, before the Rollie 
Them times was hard, I'm chasin' money 
Before the Rollie, before the Rollie 
The same circle, the same homies My same niggas, no new friends 
Since day one, nigga no loose ends 
Just a young nigga, outchea erry day 
I'mma get it by any means 
That was just my mind frame 
Before the Gucci and Louis 
Before the Rollie dog I won't do it 
They ain't never fuck with me when I was broke 
You ain't gonna stunt with me when I do it 
Talk is cheap gotta put in that work 
Remember them days I was ridin' in the merk 
No A/C cause the shit don't work 
Plus no radio to make shit worse 
I'da come a long way and they know it, 
Fuck where you at its about where you goin' 
Can't sit around and wait for no money 
Hell no naw nigga can't do it 
Boy I did this shit for my niggas 
Since day one I been a go getter 
Now my money right and these hoes on me 
Ho well go figure (Hoodnation) Before the Rollie, before the fame (Before the fame) 
Before the money, before the game (Before the game)

Them times was hard, I'm chasin' money 
Before the Rollie, before the Rollie 
The same circle, the same homies Ain't never had shit but my dream 
Ain't never sell no work to them fiends 
Ain't never snitchin' and tell on my dogs 
Wakin' up every day for that cream 
Nigga I was down and out in that field 
So stressed out because of them deals 
Ain't no kinda hope in my city 
Most my homies dead or in jail 
Every night I toss and I turn 
Feelin' like the Devil all on my back 
Still I'm praying times get better 
Had a few thoughts sell in that pack 
Boy my mom gon' cuss me out, 
Runnin' her blood pressure so high 
When that money comin' in slow 
It'll be a couple homies that rot 
I'm that same nigga from out of Deerfield 
Ain't shit changed except a rap deal 
Gotta live nigga actin' funny, 
Now I know how niggas in the trap feel 
Y'all rather me broke than be fucked up 
And my same hood and those same chucks 
I look back today throw prayers up 
Now I never forget where I came from Before the Rollie, before the fame (Before the fame) 
Before the money, before the game (Before the game)

Them times was hard, I'm chasin' money 
Before the Rollie, before the Rollie 
The same circle, the same homies Before the Rollie man it was cuffs 
Hard times man shit was tough 
I was told don't trust niggas 
Be the main ones to come and hit you up 
Still ridin' round like I ain't rich as fuck 
Young niggas we clippin' up 
Before the Rollie hoes fronted on me 
Now I pull up on em like bitch whats up? 
Young niggas ballin' 
Fuck niggas hatin' 
Before I had a Rollie 
I ain't have no patience 
A nigga ran up on me, 
Bitch ass situations 
We cap'n gown you pussy niggas ain't talkin' graduation 
See there was something 'bout that Rollie when it touched my wrist 
Something 'bout that Rollie when I fucked your bitch 
'Cause it caught her eye and she sucked my dick 
She told you lies and you trust that bitch 
Like hol' up, y'all niggas hatin' on me 
When all these bad bitches waitin' on me 
And all that shit y'all prayed on me, 
I still kill niggas like shame on me whoa Before the Rollie, before the fame (Before the fame)
