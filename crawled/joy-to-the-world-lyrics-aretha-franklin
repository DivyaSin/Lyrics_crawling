Joy, joy 
Joy to the world, the Lord has come 
Let earth receive her king 
Let every heart prepare him room 
And heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing 
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing Joy to the world, the Savior reigns 
Let men their songs employ 
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains 
Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy 
Repeat, the sounding joy He rules the world with truth and grace 
And makes the nations prove 
The glories of his righteousness 
And wonders of his love, and wonders of his love 
And wonders, wonders, of his love, wonders Joy to you and me, joy to people, joy to you and me 
And wonders, wonders, of his love
