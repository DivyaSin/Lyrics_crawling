[Adina intro] 
How did it go down? 
How did you touch her? [Ee-De] 
sitin' there drinking that hipnotic, (yeah) 
screaming what have I done to you, I should of knew your girl cheef for beefin' 
she made some points to tell you every thing I do now 
you don't want to hear me out (hear me out) 
you all drunk and and wanna get loud (oh yeah) 
that night I was in that same condition when it all went down [chorus] 
did you love her? 
No 
Did you fu*k her?

thought it would be cool 
but it don't work like that 
boy you got me mad enough to kill you 
got me heated and right now I'm not feelin' you

since you said that hinny had you trippin' 
let the door hit you where she kissed you
