Within these walls 
Within these walls is pain and strife 
Within these walls it's yours tonight 
Within these walls you'll sacrifice 
Within these walls We're prowling to and fro 
Prowling to and fro 
Prowling to and fro 
With nowhere else to go We need a lamb to slaughter 
On the center stage 
Inside this house tonight 
We'll please the gods of rage 
From the center stage 
With our sacrifice With our sacrifice Within these walls 
We don't look the same 
Within these walls 
We all feel pain 
We're all in this game 
Make no mistake There comes a time to stand and fight 
Or turn and walk away 
The simple choice 
Between wrong and right 
To kill or pray 
Blood's been spilled all over the step 
When you choose to lie 
When the bleeding heart 
In your traditions ran dry Dreams are broken on the boulevard 
Outside this house of blues 
By misery makers, undertakers 
Movers, shakers, liars, fakers 
Dreams are broken on the boulevard Within these walls
