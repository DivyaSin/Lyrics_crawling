Sunday morning 
Time to say goodbye 
But I'll be home real soon Though I'm leaving 
Girl, don't start to cry 
I'll be thinking of you 
Yeah It's a lonely ride on the midnight train 
I'm counting down the days till I'm home again How can I sing when my words have run dry 
How can I smile with the tear in my eye 
Summer's so lost when it's raining in June 
That's how it feels 
When I'm missing you Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Baby, oh, oh Now time ain't healing 
Another week gone by 
Girl, it feels like a year I've been calling 
Every day and night 
How I wish you were here 
Oh yeah It's a lonely ride on the midnight train 
I'm counting down the days till I'm home again How can I sing when my words have run dry (how can I smile) 
How can I smile with the tear in my eye (tear in my eye) 
Summer's so lost when it's raining in June 
That's how it feels (that's how it feels) 
When I'm missing you I never met a girl who was so damn sweet 
Can't wait to see her again, oh 
I never had a love that was so complete 
And you that I'll be dreaming till then 
Ooh my baby I said that tell me now baby 
How can I sing when my words have run dry (how can I smile) 
How can I smile with the tear in my eye (tear in my eye) 
Summer's so lost when it's raining in June 
That's how it feels (that's how it feels) 
When I'm missing you Oh yeah baby 
How can I smile 
So missing you 
Summer's so lost when it's raining in June 
That's how it feels (that's how it feels) 
When I'm missing you
