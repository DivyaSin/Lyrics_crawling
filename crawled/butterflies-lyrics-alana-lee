From the early days 
I saw your face boy 
You told me a lie 
I knew you were shy 
This is what we do 
You don't have to be ashamed 
Cause we're holding hands walking in the hallways You give me butterflies deep inside 
You give me butterflies 
I don't know where to run, run, run, run from you So I gotta say, you give me butterflies deep inside 
You give me butterflies 
I don't know what to do, do, do without you 
Boy, you give me butterflies 
I get lost sometimes when you act like a fool 
You ignore my words and I can't get over you 
This is what we do everyday 
I'm in my room on the phone with you 
All night long You give me butterflies deep inside 
You give me butterflies 
I don't know where to run, run, run, run from you So I gotta say, you give me butterflies deep inside 
You give me butterflies 
I don't know what to do, do, do without you 
Boy, you give me butterflies You give me butterflies deep inside 
You give me butterflies 
I don't know where to run, run, run, run from you So I gotta say, you give me butterflies deep inside 
You give me butterflies 
I don't know what to do, do, do without you 
Boy, you give me butterflies
