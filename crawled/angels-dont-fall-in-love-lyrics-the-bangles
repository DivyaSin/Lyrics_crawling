I saw you today 
She's lovely you're such a heavenly pair 
You hope and you pray 
Someday she'll take you all the way there. You should know better, darling (you should know) 
When push comes to shove 
Angels don't fall in love. You stand at the gate (and there you wait) 
Hoping to gain admission 
How long are you willing to wait (and wait and wait) 
She won't give permission tonight. You should know better, darling (you should know) 
When push comes to shove 
Angels don't fall in love, no no no. You've got your higher aims 
Got your ambitions 
You think you're spiritual 
And on some mission. Well, I can see it 
When I look in your eyes 
When you think of love 
You think of compromise. It's no big disgrace 
There's no loss of grace 
The trouble is there's always 
Someone there to take your place. And the trouble is 
You don't believe that it's true 
When the sun goes down 
There's something left for you. The trouble is 
I see you missing so much (trouble is) 
While you're knocking on all the wrong doors (trouble is) 
Looking for some angel's touch (trouble is). You think she's (trouble is) 
Everything you're dreaming of (trouble is) 
The trouble is (trouble is) 
Those angels never fall in love (trouble is). (Trouble is...trouble is) 
(Trouble is...trouble is).
