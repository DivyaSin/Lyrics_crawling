Say what you do! Snappin' of a finger make a dog wag it's tail 
A whistle from her voice make a train jump it's rail 
Take her to the racetrack 
Show her face 
A horse in years will come in first place! She's into something 
She's into something 
She's into something 
You should be into something too! Well you laughed at her about a week ago 
Now she's met a man with a whole lot of dough and oh yeah he's rich! 
I seen the money! 
And all she had to was to call the man "Honey" She's into something 
She's into something 
She's into something 
You should be into something too! She rides around town 
On her wheel 
Oh yeah you might say she got herself a stone-cold deal 
One thing the girl 
She don't have to do 
Is worry 'bout no money when the payment's due! She's into something 
She's into something 
She's into something man you should be into something too!
