Standing at your doorway 
My stomach all tangled n tight 
Have it your way 
Oh God, where are you tonight?? 
'Cuz I don't know what I'm doing here 
Or where to begin 
So take a deep breath 
But darling, don't let me in A Thousand times we've said 
"I'm sorry it's over again" 
I can't live like this 
Or feel like this in my own skin 
It all seems so degrading 
And like mourning such sin 
And faith, just like a child 
Oh darling, don't let me in And we laughed just like children 
In waiting, in sheets on your bed 
Why we secretly pray 
Like we're mourning the dead 
And you tell me you're so weary 
I know 
'Cuz I'm weary too 
But hold back a tear 
But darling, what are we to do (instrumental to outro) And the wine, and the rain 
And the feel of your skin..Again 
I'm swimming, I'm flying, I'm dying 
This face, this fear 
Stay with me, oh stay with me my dear 
This hand 
This glow 
It's only thing that I love There's losing 
There's losing 
There's losing 
There's losing 
There's losing 
There's losing love
