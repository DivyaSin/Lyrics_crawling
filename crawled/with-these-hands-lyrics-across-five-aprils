I want everything.You don't mean a thing to me.I won't just turn the other cheek.And when you pray to be set free it won't matter.It doesn't matter.I can't wait for the day you'll look to me and say it's over now.How sweet that day will be when you say to me,it's over now.I won't believe one single thing your lying lips will say to me.I hate every thing that you say to me.You're the one who killed it all.Sleep safely...sleep safely...sleep safely...sleep safely.I can't wait for the day you look to me and say it's over now.How sweet that day will be when you say to me,it's over now.Cause I built this with my 2 hands.Cause I built this with my 2 hands,you never understood that,with my own 2 hands.Please...steal me away from everything I know,can we be (can we be)the only things that matter to you now.I can't wait for the day,you look to me and say its over now.
