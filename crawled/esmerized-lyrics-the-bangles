The moment you came into view 
Everything went out of focus cept for you 
From ordinary to sublime 
And all the world went in and out of time Lost in the reverie 
Taken by surprise 
You had me so completely mesmerized Only a fool would come between 
A man and something sacred and serene 
Im the first one to admit 
That Im a fool and not ashamed of it Caught by the daring look 
Of longing in your eyes 
You got me so completely mesmerized Its only here for a night 
Its only true 
If you believe its alright 
Its alright its alright 
Its only us for the night 
Me and you 
And I believe its alright 
Its alright 
Its alright The morning comes with no regret 
And I believe the proper etiquette 
Kiss me in silence slip away 
When day becomes the night becomes the day I would have walked away 
Behaving otherwise 
But you had me so completely mesmerized Its only here for the night 
Its only true 
If you believe its alright 
Its alright, its alright 
Its only us for the night 
Me and you 
And I believe its alright 
Its alright
