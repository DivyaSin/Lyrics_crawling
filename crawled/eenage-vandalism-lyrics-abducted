i gotta can of spray paint 
and i just wrote your name in 
six foot high letters on city hall 
why don't you see? 
cause i keep standing here 
waiting for you to say something 
and i keep standing here 
waiting for you to say something 
and i keep standing here 
waiting for you to do something 
but you stand so far away 
so far away you'll never see me 
so what the f*ck should i do 
should i draw blood to make you notice me 
i just beat up a nazi 
skinheat at your feet and 
you didn't even look at me 
why dont you see?
