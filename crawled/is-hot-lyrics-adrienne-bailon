Verse 1: I do me all own my own, baby please believe it 
Young, fly, flashy 
Switch my wardrobe every season 
No he wanna holla, make it hard to find a reason 
Cause I know I'm hot and I know you see it 
Give me a break, shoot me the game, tell me ya name 
I'm not like the rest 
She might be hot, but we not the same 
I ain't got it for cheap 
I'm like the sun, dry up the rain 
If you get it from me, that means I gave it to you Chorus: Cause when ya this hot you ain't gotta do nothing, but mmm mmm 
This hot you ain't gotta say nothing, but mmm mmm

If you get it from me, that means I gave it to you Chorus: Cause when ya this hot you ain't gotta do nothing, but mmm mmm 
This hot you ain't gotta say nothing, but mmm mmm
