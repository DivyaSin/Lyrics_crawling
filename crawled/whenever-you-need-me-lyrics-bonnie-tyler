Producer for bonnie: david yorath Can't wait until I'm in your arms 
Your kiss sets me on fire 
I've never felt so alive 
Come on and take me higher 
I don't know what it is that makes 
Me feel the way I do Bridge: 
But - you're the one that's always been on my mind 
And I'll be there when you want me to Chorus: 
Whenever you need me, I'll come running 
Whenever you want me, only I will be there 
Whenever you need me, for the good times and bad 
Anytime, anywhere, I don't care I will be there I'm the one you're with tonight 
This love will never die 
Just one touch drives me insane 
It makes me want to cry 
I'm feeling hot inside and I can't 
Control the way I feel Bridge 2: 
But - I keep you up whenever you are feeling down 
And I hope you'll always want me around Chorus 2: 
Whenever you need me, to be your lover 
Whenever you want me, just one call I'll be there 
Whenever you need me, I'll be the best you've ever had 
Any time, any where, I don't care I will be there Whatever you want me to 
Whenever you (repeat) Double chorus & ad libs Whenever you need me, I'll come running 
Whenever you want me, only I will be there 
Whenever you need me, for the good times and bad 
Anytime, anywhere, I don't care I will be there Whenever you need me, I'll come running 
Whenever you want me, only I will be there 
Whenever you need me, for the good times and bad 
Anytime, anywhere, I don't care I will be there
