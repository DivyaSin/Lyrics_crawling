utter abomination. 
manipulate the circumstance to gain a stranglehold to your pathetic existence. 
you dont...you arent...take every opportunity to stop you dead in your tracks, 
crush and smash every purpose you had into the ground. your going down. 
piss on and extinguish your oxygen-stealing life. 
ill be the stomach-block in your life. you arent shit to me. [pete benumb]
