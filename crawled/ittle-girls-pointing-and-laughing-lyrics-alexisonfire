(We can't) 
I still can 
(Stop now) 
Remember what you did. 
Your eyes filled 
(We've got) 
Discomfort 
(To slow down) 
Bare foot in a public washroom. Spill on me your nostalgia 
And cataracts 
That fell 
Behind self-conscious eyes. Warm water made 
(Please just give me back my heart) 
This hurt so good 
(Well it's been too long) 
Through ivory rain 
(And I will burn no more) 
And cutthroat soap box derby racers (Oh God. Hurt so fucking good. Little girls pointing. Pointing. Pointing and laughing.)
