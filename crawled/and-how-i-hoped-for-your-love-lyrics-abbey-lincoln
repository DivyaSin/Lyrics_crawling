And I thought that life 
Would be so cold 
I thought I'd need someone to hold 
Like in the stories I was told 
And then we met 
I can't forget 
How we laughed 
And then 
Suddenly the end 
I hoped 
Hoped for your love 
For your love 
For your love 
How I hoped 
For your love 
For your love 
For your love
