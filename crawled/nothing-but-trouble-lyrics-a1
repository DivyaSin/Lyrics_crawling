Let me tell you about this girl 
That once was mine 
Once upon a time 
She's nothing but trouble Up 'til now, I was a man of common sense 
Funny how I just give up on my defense 
But she's one of a kind 
Just a girl that could easily twist your mind 
But right now it feels so fine [Chorus] 
She's nothing but trouble, trouble's her name 
She's driving me crazy, it's kind of insane 
I'm searching for a reason to let her go 
'Cause somewhere inside of me I know 
She's nothing but trouble Everyone says I'm playing a game with fire 
It's too late, I'll just get 
Caught up in my desire 
'Cause she's one of a kind 
Just a girl that could easily twist your mind 
But right now it feels so fine [Chorus] When I look in her eyes 
It's just hard to take anyone's advice 
But somewhere, I realize [Chorus]
