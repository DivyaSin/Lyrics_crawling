Cultivate your hunger, before you idealize 
Motivate your anger, to make them all realize 
Climbing the mountain, never coming down 
Break into the contents, never falling down My knee is still shaking, like I was twelve 
Sneakin' out the classroom, by the back door 
A man railed at me twice though 
But I didn't care 
Waiting is wasting, for people like me Don't try to look so wise 
Don't cry 'cause you're so right 
Don't dry with fakes or fears 
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end Don't try to look so wise 
Don't cry 'cause you're so right 
Don't dry with fakes or fears 
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end You say, dreams are dreams 
I ain't gonna play the fool anymore 
You say, 'cause I still got my soul 
Take your time baby 
Your blood needs slowin' down 
Breach your soul to reach yourself before you gloom 
Reflection of fear make shadow of nothing 
Shadow of nothing 
You still are blind if you see winding road 
'Cause there's always straight way to the point you see Don't try to look so wise 
Don't cry 'cause you're so right 
Don't dry with fakes or fears 
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end Don't try to look so wise 
Don't cry 'cause you're so right 
Don't dry with fakes or fears 
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end Don't try to look so wise 
Don't cry 'cause you're so right 
Don't dry with fakes or fears 
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end 'Cause you will hate yourself in the end 
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end 
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
