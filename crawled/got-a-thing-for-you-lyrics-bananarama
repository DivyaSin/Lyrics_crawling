You, you make me come alive 
Each time I close my eyes 
You take up all my time 
My every thoughts of you (bridge) 
Tell me why 
I got a thing for you, a thing for you 
Do you mind if I get with you, get with you, baby (chorus) 
I got I got a thing for you, my baby 
Tell me can I get with you now baby 
I just can't live without you I got I got a thing for you, my baby 
Tell me can I get with you now baby 
I just can't live without you Feel your body close to mine 
Each time I close my eyes 
I feel so good tonight 
You make me want to cry (bridge) (chorus) No, no matter what I do 
I cannot help myself 
I cannot stop from falling 
No, no matter what I do 
You're my everything 
I just can't live without you (chorus x 2) publishing : Copyright Control 2001
