I took a bit of your love and held it deep inside 
In calculating the reasons, you keep me SATISFIED 
It's up to you for some love, around I'll make some time 
I think I'm losing consciousness, I think I'm LOSING MY MIND 
For you 
Into the middle of all we had, be strong on me 
We cannot fall tonight, no 
Even when I'm gone away, you're one and all 
Seen his thoughts 
When you'll be strong, when I'll go 
Oh no, this feels a mess, you got me paralyzed, baby 
I'm tired of being alone, you will never see me again, no 
Unless you're really alone 
The beat goes on and on 
ON AND ON 
The beat goes on 
We're haunted by the sight 
Boom, boom, broken heart 
Ghost of a lover gone 
I don't wanna be a part 
Girl, I don't wanna sing that song 
The beat goes on and on, forever 
ON AND ON 
The beat comes back around 
Boom, boom, got that start 
Guys of another call 
Oh, you don't wanna be alone 
Girl, dancing in the night 
I still believe I can never make it alone 
Even when you can't deceive me 
I know that we always fall 
Because after all ?? 
Oh, no, this feels a mess 
You got me paralyzed, baby 
You will never see me again, baby 
Unless you need me alone 
No, no, you will never be alone
