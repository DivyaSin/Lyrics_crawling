All he ever wanted was to skip across the water Tick tock the clock is getting faster Vicariously 
Lives through the dusty 
Pebbles while thrusting 
Them onto the pond 
So very trusting 
Betting the calm is strong 
And won't let them drown 
He's got to swallow his pride 
He followed horrible advice 
And hollowed his account 
With a roll of the dice twice 
Now the market's a rollercoaster ride 
He's back to the beginning 
With no retirement in sight Tick tock the clock is getting faster 
Can't sit back 
And watch the world move backwards 
He's got to be moving forwards 
He's got to be moving faster Today he's older 
Tomorrow he's older than today 
He's got to get bolder before he's older 
And throws his life away 
Those damn revelations 
Running around his head 
Increasing frustration 
And motivation 
Look he's scared to death 
He's got to do something today 
Before the terrorists start attacking 
Before foreign policy instigates another Iraqi 
With a suitcase who wants to blow himself up for Allah 
Better to die chasing a dream than regret not trying at all Tick tock the clock is getting faster 
Can't sit back 
And watch the world move backwards 
He's got to be moving forwards 
He's got to be moving faster Passes time to forget time is passing him by 
Tick tock the clock is getting faster 
Can't sit back 
And watch the world move backwards 
He's got to be moving forwards 
He's got to be moving faster 
Tick tock the clock is getting faster
