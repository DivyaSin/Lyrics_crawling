We're going on a jungle adventure 
To see what we can see 
There's a lion and a tiger 
And a great big monkey, swingin' on the branch of a tree 
It looks like a chimpanzee Oh, here in the jungle you can hear the lions roar 
Rhinoceros and tigers and so much more 
Hear the snakes hissing in the grass below 
See the silly monkeys putting round the show The jungle is the place to go We're going on a jungle adventure 
To see what we can see 
There's a great big elephant takin' a bath 
Getting clean as he can be 
I hope he doesn't step on me Oh, here in the jungle you can hear the lions roar 
Rhinoceros and tigers and so much more 
Hear the snakes hissing in the grass below 
See the silly monkeys putting round the show The jungle is the place to go 
The jungle is the place to go 
The jungle is the place to go
