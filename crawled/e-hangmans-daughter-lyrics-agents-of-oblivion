woman and child like a feather fall from the sky 
so dark ..so dark in the moonlight naked we worship the night sky... no man can hold what the darkness can sow 
gonna leave and ugly skull when u go tongues like horns violently born and new...soul 
the soft dead awake alive in love 
hard for the hangmans daughter
