Hey mama, eh mama, eh mama, hey 
Hey mama, eh mama, eh mama, hey 
Body 
Awake my body. You can't turn your cheek, 
When you're falling asleep, 
And you're cold, 
Awake my body. They took me to the station, 
Dropped me on my knees 
Ask me my vocation, 
I'll tell you if you please. I trained my toes in typing, 
Specializing in concrete, 
A day you won't believe just happened, 
I heard a voice that came to me, 
It said "my body, my toes, 
My heart, my skin, my nose, 
My organs for you to play" I believe believer will lead to healer 
Yes, now we have all our faith, 
Come on, take me.. 
All the way. Hey mama, eh mama, eh mama, hey 
Hey mama, eh mama, eh mama, hey 
Body 
Awake my body Don't hide my eyes, 
I wanna see. 
Don't hide my ears, 
I wanna hear. 
Don't hide my tongue, 
From anyone, 
I wanna tell, heaven and hell. 
I won't hide my heart, 
It won't break apart. 
I know they'll be sharing, 
They'll be sharing all the way (all the way) Awake now 
Body awake now 
Awake now 
Body awake 
Awake now 
Body awake now 
Ah see them caring 
See them sharing 
All the way, all the way Hey mama, eh mama, eh mama, hey 
Hey mama, eh mama, eh mama, hey 
Body 
Awake my body You can't turn your cheek 
When you're falling asleep, 
And you're cold. 
Awake my body. Behold, 
All the way.
