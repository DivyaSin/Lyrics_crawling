When dark of night makes way for the early sun to rise 
It's piece of mind that only love can bring 
And with the golden sunlight drifting through the morning skies 
Your tender touch makes me know that love is a gentle thing 
Love is a gentle thing and love can keep you safe and warm 
A newborn baby nestled in its mother's arms 
Love is a gentle thing and like winter's very first snow falling 
And love can be a shelter in a storm The times when I'm uncertain and get restless in my mind 
I'm left alone without a song to sing 
But when you come to me at night and pull me to your side 
Without a word you tell me that love is a gentle thing 
Love is a gentle thing 
Love is a gentle thing
