words and music: Justin Moore 
Everyday I come by to see your shining face 
If you knew how I feel inside you'd have to be amazed 
For just one chance to be with you I'd give my world my away 
But for the lack of courage and the lack of hope all I can do is say 
Chorus: 
Ohhhhhhh 
I just sit back here in silence 
All the while my heart is dyin' 
Ohhhhhhh 
I'll never take a chance with her 
For Better or For Worse 
I try to hide my feeling and hope that you don't see 
That being around you with the feelings I have is just killing me 
I wish I could tell you how I feel, but I'm afraid of what you'll say 
So instead I keep my heart inside me, I can't make dumb mistakes 
Chorus 
My time to share my heart with her is quickly running short 
And when our eyes meet I tell myself I can wait no more 
But I just can't tell her how I feel for the fear of getting hurt 
She doesn't feel the same for me, and I know it will never work 
Repeat 1st verse 
Chorus (2x)
