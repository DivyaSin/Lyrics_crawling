Why is the whole frickin' world against me? 
And why does it seem that I can't even turn around 
Without someone finding disapproval of me? 
Well I say screw it 
I'm so golly gee sick and tired of buying into their lies 
When all they do is parade around with fear, discomfort, and pain in their eyes And I feel it again, yeah I feel it again
