Stupid, stupid 
Nananana 
Nananana You tell stories 
That aren't going anywhere 
Toast pops 
You scream 
Some how always unprepared 
Heard the doorbell 
I say it was on TV 
That won't stop you 
Calling out into the empty street You left the keys inside (so you) 
Got locked out in the rain (but you) 
But you know I'm always here (let you) 
To let you in and say You're stupid stupid 
You're stupid stupid 
You're stupid stupid 
And I love you Last week I did not remember our anniversary 
You said that must be cos' I'm a Sagittarius 
You don't (I don't) 
Make time (make time) 
For me (for you) 
This is such a shock 
It's strange how you missed that 
When you read both of our horoscopes You wouldn't eat that pie 
It looked like it had eyes 
Next time you go without I'll shout You're stupid stupid 
You're stupid stupid 
You're stupid stupid 
And I love you And when you've heard this song 
I know just what you'll say I'm stupid stupid 
I'm stupid stupid 
I'm stupid stupid 
And you love me We're stupid stupid 
We're stupid stupid 
We're stupid stupid 
And you love me 
And I love you
