[verse 1] 
the last kiss we shared, tasted like a wine 
sweet and bitter like, our memories 
and i long for you to, come right back to me 
tomorrow the time will be the same as today 
nothing goes on in my heart except your memories 
where will you be, and who will you think of...! [chorus] 
you were always gonna be my love 
and you should know 
even if i fall in love with somebody else 
i'll remember to love you taught me how 
you were always gonna be the one 
and for now, i'll still be singing this love song 
for... somebody like you 
my first love... [verse 2] 
time after time, baby i tried to forget our life together 
but the memories are so so hard to let go 
tomorrow the time will be the same as today 
trying to hold back the tears when thinking of you 
all i want is to be with you once more...! [chorus 2] 
you will always be inside my heart 
and you should know 
that i wish that i could ever let you go 
i know that i love you that your heart do 
now and forever still the one 
and for now, i'll still be singing this love song 
for... somebody like you 
my first love...
