I gonna crawl upon the shore 
Roll in the mud and the clay 
Like the swallows of San Juan 
I'm gonna get back some day A thousand steps to the water 
A thousand steps you must take 
There's a thousand worlds on a head of a pin 
A thousand rules to break Next time you see me 
I'm going to smile for the camera 
Like some wild man from Pompeii 
Take my word 
Go down to the sea 
It's breaking bigger 
Than anything any of us have ever seen I gonna crawl upon the shore 
Roll in the mud and the clay 
Like the swallows of San Juan 
I'm gonna get back some day Had a blonde tv special 
And an English half Stef 
I lost some boats in a deal 
But some day, some day 
I'll get 'em back Next time you see me 
I'm going to smile for the camera 
Like some wild man from Pompeii 
Take my word 
Go down to the sea 
It's breaking bigger 
Than anything any of us have ever seen I gonna crawl upon the shore 
Roll in the mud and the clay 
Like the swallows of San Juan 
I'm gonna get back, get back some day 
I'm gonna get back some day 
Get back some day 
Gonna get back some day 
Yeah, some day 
Gonna get back some day 
Get back 
Get back some day
