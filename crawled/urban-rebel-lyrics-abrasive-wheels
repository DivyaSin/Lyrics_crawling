Walk tall, walk proud 
Walk the way that you choose 
The rebels must think 
Or rebels can only lose We're right to speak the truth 
We're right to speak our minds 
We're right we're question proof You want to destroy we want to create 
Don't want us to think, just want us to hate Urban rebel 
We don't need no guns 
We don't need no knives 
And we don't need no one to tell us 
How to live our lives We're right to speak the truth 
We're right to speak our minds 
We're right we're question proof 
You want to destroy we want to create 
Don't want us to think just want us to hate Urban rebel 
The people who judge you are the ones with no brains 
A world of restrictions, all the people are the same
