Sun comes up in the morning 
Moon comes up in the night 
I come up when you call my name 
'Cause you got the sugar, baby 
You got the spice 
Come let's dance in the moonlight 
'Til to dark fades into the sun 
Half of the world's still sleepin' 
While the other half's on the run. [Chorus] 
I said hi-de-hi 
I said hi-de-ho 
We all be slaves to the rhythm 
And that's just the way it goes 
I said hi-de-hi (hi-de-hi) 
I said hi-de-ho (hi-de-ho) 
We all be slave to the rhythm 
And that's just the way it goes The road goes forever 
And there ain't no easy way out 
We get knocked down 
We get back up 
'Cause the world keeps a-spinnin' around 
We all work hard for the money, 
Buying the American dream 
We're dyin' just tryin' to break even 
We're just slaves to the big machine [Chorus] We all dance to the beat of a different drum 
Slave to the rhythm, slave to the rhythm 
We gotta keep on dancin' 'til the morning comes 
Slave to the rhythm, slave to the rhythm 
Yeah we dance to the beat of a different drum 
Slave to the rhythm, slave to the rhythm 
Just keep your mojo workin' 'til the dance is done 
Slave to the rhythm, slave to the rhythm Dance to the rhythm (dance to the rhythm) 
Rock to the rhythm (rock to the rhythm) 
Talk to the rhythm (talk to the rhythm) 
Dance to the rhythm (dance to the rhythm) 
I said rock to the rhythm (rock to the rhythm) 
Talk to the rhythm (talk to the rhythm) 
Rock to the rhythm (rock to the rhythm) 
Talk to the rhythm (talk to the rhythm) [Chorus]
