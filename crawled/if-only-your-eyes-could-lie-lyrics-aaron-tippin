Girl I can tell that you're thinking of leaving 
But it'll hurt me so much you don't want me to know 
You've done all you can to hide what you're feeling 
Oh, but one part of you, it let's your feelings show Oh, your fingertips tell me you'll stay 
And your warm red lips say you won't go away 
And your lovin' arms make me think you're still mine 
Whoa girl, if only your eyes could lie So I say what's wrong and darlin' you just say it's nothin' 
I can almost believe it hun when I hold you like this 
But I know in my heart that there's no tomorrow 
So just for tonight hun I'll pretend that there is Oh, your fingertips tell me you'll stay 
And your warm red lips say you won't go away 
And your lovin' arms make me think you're still mine 
Whoa girl, if only your eyes could lie
