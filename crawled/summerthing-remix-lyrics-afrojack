La, la-la-la-la-la 
La, la-la-la-la-la I don't wanna write this love song 
I, I'm fighting this urge 
But you make me say ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Damn, 'cause I, I can't find the words 
I don't wanna write this love song 
Just wanna dance all night till it hurts 
But you make me say ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Damn, 'cause I, I can't find the words Ooh, you stole my heart we had a summerthing 
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing But you made me fall in the winter 
Bloom in the spring 
From June 'till December 
It was you and me 
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing 
That it was just a summerthing! This, this ain't no love song, it's just a little ditty, baby 
I just wanna go uh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Damn, 'cause you, you're so pretty baby 
This, this ain't no love song, just wanna watch you dance, sexy baby 
I just wanna go ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Damn, that's if you, if you let me baby Ooh, you stole my heart, we had a summerthing 
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing But you made me fall in the winter 
Bloom in the spring 
From June 'till December 
It was you and me 
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing 
That it was a summerthing I will always remember the summer, the summerthing 
Oh, you'll always remember the summer, the summerthing 
I will always remember the summer, the summerthing 
Oh, you'll always remember the summer, the summerthing You stole my heart, we had a summerthing 
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing But you made me fall in the winter 
Bloom in the spring 
From June 'till December 
It was you and me 
And I told my heart it was just a summerthing 
That it was a summerthing
