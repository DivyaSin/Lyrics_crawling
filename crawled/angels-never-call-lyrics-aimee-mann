Notes: ok - instead of trying to worry about the differences between 
G-->gsus, g-->c/g, and g-->am7/g I'm just calling it glick. 
The notes in the lick are (in order) g d g b c-c c b with 
The fifth and sixth tied. the second chord "fits" with any 
Of the three except that there isn't an "a" in it per se, 
But there does seem to be an "e".	on the other hand it does 
Have the same "tone" as a c/g would have. so I'm punting! :-) *** intro:
