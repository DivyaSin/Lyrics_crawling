Faces mistaken 
Roads that you've taking, are winding 
Sand in your shoes 
As you kick off those blues you've been sinking You said that's all you want 
You sure that's all you need from me? 
You said that's all you want 
You sure that's all you need from me? Is it all you need? Morning to midnight 
Everything's alright, tomorrow 
Eye's shine like diamonds so break off those bindings that hold you back You said that's all you want 
You sure that's all you need from me? 
You said that's all you want 
You sure that's all you need from me? Is it all you need? These revelations keep coming down 
Coming down on me 
Your destination means everything 
Everything to me You said that's all you want 
You sure that's all you need from me? 
You said that's all you want 
You sure that's all you need from me? Is it all you need? 
Is it all you need? 
Is it all you need? 
Is it all you need? 
Is it all you need?
