Abel Miller verse We don't have no time to waste 
We're gonna do this my way, 
Im gonna give you just what youve been waiting for 
Make you wet, girl when it rains it pours 
We're having sex, but girl don't fall in love Chorus: Girl your sex is the best just know that i am not enough 
I aint even in love with you, 
Just having sex girl i can't get enough 
I aint even in love with you Baby don't fall in love (fall in love) 2x R.A.E. verse Dang girl you're lookin fine, 
lets spend a night together imma take you from behind 
But don't do nothing stupid, like fallin in love 
Cuz its just one night, imma take u then go 
But i don't want a relation, i just came to f*ck 
Let's go to a room i just wanna live it up 
Imma take you then i go home 
then i don't wanna see you no more 
i aint even in love with you Abel miller 
Baby don't fall in love (fall in love) 4x 
Im gonna give you just what youve been waiting for 
Make you wet, girl when it rains it pours 
We're having sex, but girl don't fall in love 2x 
Baby don't fall in love (fall in love) 2x
