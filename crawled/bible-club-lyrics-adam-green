She's my baby, she's my love 
Pixie Queen of Bible Club 
Seen her round the fountain sipping cokes 
Crafting brand new Polish jokes 
And I can't explain why my accent changed 
I guess there's still some hope to score some dope 
She needs to be changed inside 
She's my waitress, she's the boss 
Lips and teeth of scented cloths 
Pencil in the dentist, clean the crops 
Have you seen my soda pop? 
There was a Polish priest 
Who thought that he could please me 
He got me so whacked down, I nearly lost my house 
'Cause nobody needs me, yeah
