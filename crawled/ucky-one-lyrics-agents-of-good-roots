Lyrics: winn 
Music: winn Lyrics: I'm looking through the window 
Looking around 
For memories bound 
In a scrapbook I'm trying to remember 
What was the date 
When fate hit the stake 
And was burned down (chorus): 
But let me tell you you're the lucky one 
You're the only one 
Good God you're the lucky one 
You're the only one 
But oh, my eyes can't see 
What's come over me I'm flipping through the scriptures 
Thinking I'm wise 
It's all a disguise 
Or illusion I'm bitching 'bout my staircase 
It's twisted in knots 
It climbs and it stops 
And I'm nowhere (chorus) (chorus) 
What's come over me 
What's come over me
