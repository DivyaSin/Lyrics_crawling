If you choose me over him 
I'll make you proud, I'll make you grin 
I'll write a poem about your smile 
I'll buy you hats cause I dig your style 
I'll tell all my buddies how good you kiss 
While I'm away only you I'll miss 
I'll share my records and stay really clean 
I'll never fuss nor be mean 
In front of all your friends, I'll kiss your ass 
I'll leave behind my violent past 
If you choose me, if you choose me 
Why won't you choose me over him 
If you choose me over him, I'll make you proud 
On me you can depend 
To be nice to your momma, take your daddy fishin' 
I'll make you biscuits then clean the kitchen 
There will be credit cards for all your desires 
We can walk in the park 
And hold hands for hours 
I'll rub your feet I'll scratch your back 
I'll brush your hair and then comb it back 
We'll find that old boyfriend who treated you bad 
You can cuss him out while I kick his ass 
I'll wash your clothes, I'll pay the bills 
You can paint the bedroom anyway you feel 
I'll quit cussin' and lose 10 pounds 
I'll swear you're skinny when you get round
