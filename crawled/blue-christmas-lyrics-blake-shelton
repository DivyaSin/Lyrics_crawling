I'll have a blue Christmas without you 
I'll be so blue thinking about you 
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree 
Won't by the same dear if you're not here with me And when those blue snowflakes start falling (blue, blue) 
That's when those blue memories start calling (blue, blue) 
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white 
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas 
(Blue, blue) think I'm felling better already (blue, blue) You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white 
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
