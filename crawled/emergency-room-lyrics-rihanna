Ey Rihanna: 
I was picking up your clothes in the closet (closet) 
I was about to throw your jeans in the washer (washer) 
'Til I saw a piece of paper saying Tasha (Tasha) 
I gotta say I found this a bit shockin (shockin) 
It's on receipts here to tell you went shoppin (you dont say shopping teice) 
You bought some Nike shoes 
But why you buying stockings? Boy how could you lie to me 
Thought you would die for me 
I'm not acceptin another apology After 3 years, Ima let it go 
I ain't standin around crying no more 
Got your bags packed sitting by the door 
Ima leave your heart broken on the floor You're gonna be in the emergency room 
I'm standing by your bed 
and so tempted to pull out your I.V 
You're gonna be in the emergency room 
I'm fighting with myself 
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me 
You're gonna be in the emergency room 
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now 
Let me see you try to live without me 
Now where's your heartbeat 
Flat line on the EKG well, I was home late at night watching TV 
Got a call from my girl saying "RiRi 
Saw your man in the club 
i thought he was out of town doing business 
said that he'd be back in three weeks?" 
And now I'm mad 
Sitting in the kitchen gettin sad 
Looking at your pictures Boy, How could you lie to me 
Thought you would die for me 
I'm not acceptin another apology After 3 years, Ima let it go 
cant standing around crying no more 
Got your bags packed sitting by the door 
Ima leave your heart broken on the floor You're gonna be in the emergency room 
I'm standing by your bed 
and so tempted to pull out your I.V 
You're gonna be in the emergency room 
I'm fighting with myself 
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me 
You're gonna be in the emergency room 
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now 
Let me see you try to live without me 
Now where's your heartbeat 
Flatline on the EKG Akon: 
I did you wrong, girl 
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone, girl (I did) 
But we been in this relationship too long, girl 
For you to be listenin to your silly home girls 
Better go on, girl 
Now baby think about it (think about it) 
Everything we do they gonna read about it (read about it) 
Put it on a radio and TV outlet 
Do you want to see your picture in that paper 
You know them haters 
You hear that 808 
The drum, that's my heart beat 
I'm going numb, I said Rihanna, I'm feeling stressed 
I'm going under cardiac arrest Rihanna: 
You're gonna be in the emergency room 
I'm standing by your bed 
and so tempted to pull out your IV 
You're gonna be in the emergency room 
I'm fighting with myself 
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me 
You're gonna be in the emergency room 
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now 
Let me see you try to live without me 
Now where's your heart beat
