Stoplights, breakdown, we cry, last try 
Worlds collide, time to decide 
Where you want to go in this great big world 
Where you want to go in this great big world Stuck here too long in this sad song 
Lost on a street, everyone has 
Vanished and you're all alone 
But you don't know where to go 
Yeah you're all alone 
And you want to go home [Chorus] 
Run just as fast as you can 
Run, 'til you reach the end 
Where the fallen finally land 
And your world starts over again 
Run Next page, new day, finding my way 
Stumble upon the strength to move on 
I am not alone in this great big world 
And you are not alone in this great big world [Chorus] Run now don't you look back 
Run towards the light straight ahead 
Where the lost souls make a beautiful sound 
And new life is finally found 
Run Your free, free falling 
A new beginning 
This is our time [Chorus] Run now don't you look back 
Run towards the light straight ahead 
Where the lost souls make a beautiful sound 
And new life is finally found 
Run
