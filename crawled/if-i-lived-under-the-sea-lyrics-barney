If I lived under the sea, sea, sea 
I think it would be neat as it could be, be, be 
I could visit all the fish, anytime I wish 
If I lived under the sea I could ride on the tail of a great big whale 
Wow! That would be great 
I could count the legs on an octopus 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8! If I lived under the sea, sea, sea 
I think it would be neat as it could be, be, be 
I could visit all the fish, anytime I wish 
If I lived under the sea I could visit all the fish, anytime I wish 
If I lived under, if I lived under, if I lived under the sea
