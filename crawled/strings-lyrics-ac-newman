I'm the star of a book you wrote before your career was illustrious 
Though only renters and college kids skimmed through 
Skipped through to the end to see if you got help from someone there up on high 
Who may have heard the beacon's faint cry 
"I could do things for you, I can do things for you" All the reasons I always dreamed of school 
I just dropped out and left them there 
It was always the fabulous stain on my reputation for opening doors 
And selling arts and crafts from the floor 
Lately I know this much no more, we've been waiting for you 
We've been waiting for you All done kidding, done restating 
Some teen beat fears of the bright lights fading 
You learn to wean yourself off of it Did some orphan's lament get heard one night, pinball through moons and time 
Wind through some harmless darkness, bounce off stars 
And knock into some warm waiting arms? 
Or was it just some time served, some proof 
Until we learned some obvious truth? 
That we'd been waiting for you 
We've been waiting for you All done kidding, done restating 
Some teen beat fears of the bright lights fading 
You learn to wean yourself off of it We've been waiting for you
