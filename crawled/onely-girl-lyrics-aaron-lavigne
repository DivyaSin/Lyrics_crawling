Hey, lonely girl. Are you sick of this as I am? 
Hey, lonely girl. When are you coming back down? 
I can only wander now. And, this wandering's done me in. 
So, I wonder? Lonely girl, When are you coming home again? I don't understand why you're leaving this way 
After all that we've done and all that you'd say 
'cause you were there 
right in front of me 
every step of the way 
And, I've come to believe that the air that you breathe as you're burning up time 
Is burning me blind 
It's burning me until I find scars 
I can't make a sound so I'll try to find words that say Hey Hey, Hey 
Hey Hey, Hey 
Lonely girl 
Anyway, its worn out tonight 
Anyway, its worn out tonight Love, love, love , love, love, love, love 
Love, love, love , love, love, love, love I wanted you then 
I needed you then 
I loved you then 
I love you now 
Are you hearing me? 
Or should I slow down? 
I can't find the words so I'll just make a sound and say Hey Hey, Hey 
Hey Hey, Hey 
Hey Hey, Hey 
Lonely girl
