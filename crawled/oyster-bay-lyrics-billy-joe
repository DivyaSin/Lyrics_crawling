From my room, I see the blue Pacific Ocean 
Yes my hotel has me right beside the shore 
Well today it's San Francisco and tomorrow it's L.A. 
And I feel as though I've been this way before 
Well my woman helps my feet to keep on walkin' 
But my manager he stands right outside the door 
Yes there's an up 'n' comin' superstar & he's gettin' rave revues 
But there ain't no time for fishin' anymore I never thought that things would go this far 
I never thought that life would be this way 
I never thought I'd be a superstar 
Oh Jesus Christ I wish that I was back in Oyster Bay 
takin' it easy...Oh yeah... But there's lots of friendly folks that say "good morning" 
But somehow you know I don't believe their smiles 
I could be New York City bound where I could be among my friends 
But the roller back home it seems a million miles 
I can see the lights of Hollywood below me 
But somehow they just don't move me like they should 
I know it's hard to understand but I would be a fisherman 
If I only had the chance, you know I would I never thought that things would go this far 
I never thought that I'd be here today 
I never thought I'd be a superstar 
Oh and Jesus Christ I wish that I was back in Oyster Bay 
takin' it easy...Oh yeah...
