She packed her bags and left 
She tries to make it out West 
And now she's on her own 
It's getting harder to breathe and she needs to believe 
When she's out there she's not alone When everything falls back down 
That's where you'll find me 
You know that i've been waiting for you 
When everything falls back down 
That's when you'll know that you will never be alone 
You know that i've been waiting for you She finally gets to sleep, 
But all she really dreams is of a place to restart 
She's scared , but oh so brave, 
'Cause she's so far away, but she'll never be too far And i said, hey when you go, take it slow 
Take a breath and don't forget 
The place that you call home 
'Cause i'll be here waiting 
And time may take its toll 
But while you're out there, you gotta know When everything falls back down 
That's where you'll find me 
You know that i've been waiting for you 
When everything falls back down 
That's when you'll know that you will never be alone And these are the words you heard 
The one's that may have saved your life tonight 
When everything is falling down around you 
And i'll surround you; i know you'll shine When everything falls back down 
When everything keeps falling right back When everything falls back down 
That's where you'll find me 
You know that i've been waiting for you 
When everything falls back down 
That's when you'll know that you will never be alone You know that i've been waiting for you
