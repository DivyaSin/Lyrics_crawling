Their whispers become like cries 
Tears fall from blinded eyes 
Ninety-nine have burned as embers 
Ninety-nine have lost their lives 
Tired arms now fight for life 
Amidst the crashing waves they're drowning Will you love me until mornings light? 
And I'll tell you what it's like to die tonight 
It's too late to cry Now she sees her face and screams 
It was once so beautiful, now kissed by flames 
And showered with glass so beautiful 
Yet so cruel, the way love tends to be 
Her beauty so cruel, the way love tends to be 
Her beauty so cruel, the way love tends to be Will you love me until mornings light? 
And I'll tell you what it's like to die 
Will you love me until mornings light? 
And I'll tell you what it's like to die
