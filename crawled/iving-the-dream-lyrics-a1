Where have you been all of my life 
Where have you come from 
Is this your first time too 
It's like I've known you 
(In some other lifetime) 
In some other lifetime 
We're part of the great plan (ooh baby, baby) 
Like two stars that shine I stood here watchin', 
While it only ever happened to friends 
Now I don't have to pretend I can't believe we're living the dream 
We're diggin' that scene 
We finally made it through the fire 
Something 'bout you blows me away 
Like night over day 
We kissing the loneliness goodbye, yeah 
True love, true love, baby could this be 
True love, true love, baby, yeah I've been waiting (I've been waiting) 
All of my life (come on) 
Anticipating (yeah) 
With every dream every night 
Destiny's a moment 
We all share in time 
Love is the message 
I know (I know) I know I've got mine. I stood here watchin' 
While it only ever happened to friends 
Now I don't have to pretend I can't believe we're living the dream 
We're diggin' that scene 
We finally made it through the fire 
Something 'bout you blows me away 
Like night over day 
We kissing the loneliness goodbye, yeah (ooh) True love, true love, baby could this be, yeah 
True love, true love, baby happenin' to me 
(true love, true love, could this to me, yeah) 
true love, true love, baby happenin' to me I can't believe we're living the dream 
We're diggin' that scene 
We finally made it through the fire 
Something 'bout you blows me away 
Like night over day 
We kissing the loneliness goodbye, yeah True love, true love, baby could this be 
True love, true love baby happenin to me (true love, true love) 
True love, true love, baby could this be, yeah True love, true love, finally happenin' to me
