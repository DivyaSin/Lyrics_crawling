Don't tell me you're a stepping stone 
'Cus I'll step all over you, and won't mean it 
Don't tell me I'm not capable 
'Cus I'll prove that I am if it kills me 
Don't try to hold me in your hand 
'Cus living things move, and I surely will 
You've got your friends and I've got mine 
And wouldn't you know, they were right 
I won't tell you that your beautiful 
'Cus you'll think I want sex, and don't mean it 
I won't tell you that I want to spend the rest of my life with you.... again 
I won't quote the four agreements though you'd get f*cking centered if you'd read it 
I won't think of you the way I do 
Don't tell me.... 
Take me away from the other you 
The one I thought I never knew 
I'm not the man you'd thought I'd be 
I'm ready for another me 
I've gone away from other days 
I've weighed my change and changed my ways 
Been crazed and turned for turns of phrase 
And now I'm left with you 
Why can't I love just that 
Instead of all the loves that leave my bed? 
And all the lives I've never led 
Looks like there's still another blank page to fill 
Until I've had my fill of you 
So thanks for the tips on carpet 
And thanks for your taste in shoes 
If we could learn to love those little lessons 
There'd be a little less to lose 
But if you find another love whose going to hold you like me 
And have these little talks until a quarter to three 
And wait until you're ready for intimacy 
Don't tell me 
Don't tell me
