I was born by the river 
In a little tent 
And just like the river 
I've been running ever since It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I know a change gonna come 
Oh! Yes it will It's been too hard living 
But I'm afraid to die 
Cause I don't know 
What's up there beyond the sky It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I know a change gonna come 
Oh! Yes it will When I go to my brother, my brother, my brother 
And I say, "Brother, help me please" 
But the winds up knockin' me 
Right down on my, on the knees And there been time that I thought 
I couldn't last for long 
But Know I think 
I'm able to carry on It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I know a change gonna come 
Oh! Yes it will It's been a long 
It's been a long, long time coming 
Well, I know, I know, I know change gonna come 
Oh! Yes it will
