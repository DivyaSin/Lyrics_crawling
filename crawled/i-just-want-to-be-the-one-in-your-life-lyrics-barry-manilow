Some people shoot for the stars 
Dream upon dream 
They long to go far Chasing their rainbow so high 
Wish upon wish 
They'll reach for the sky But I got one little dream 
And baby, that's all I want 
Girl it's up to you 
You can make my dreams come true I just wanna be the one in your life 
For ever, for always 
I just wanna be the one in your life 
For ever, for always I don't need cheers from the crowd 
To make me feel big 
To make me feel proud Darlin' just a little touch of your hand 
Is all that I need 
To feel like a man And I keep hoping each day 
I won't dream my life away 
Girl, you hold the key 
To make my dream a reality I just wanna be the one in your life 
For ever, for always 
I just wanna be the one in your life 
For ever, for always I just wanna be the one in your life 
For ever, for always 
I just wanna be the one in your life 
For ever, for always
