It's one year together 
And I loved you right from the start 
There's nothing that's better 
And nothing to keep us apart 
Now I wanna tell you 
How special your love is to me 
Cause this is our night 
Gonna make it just right 
And show you how love's gonna be Chorus: 
I'll take care of you 
When you want me to 
And do the things you want to do 
If you stay with me 
I'll give constantly all the lovin' you wanted from me This is my promise to you, 
From my heart and my soul this is true 
Bring you happiness 
Give you all the rest 
Spend all my time on you 
This is my promise to you, 
Darling nothing will ever hurt you 
Cause your happiness is my happiness 
I'll always, forever be true 
This is my promise to you Oh, yes, I remember 
There were days when nothing seemed right 
I needed somebody 
Needed someone to share my life (share my life) 
But I never dreamed about a lady like you loving me(lady like you loving me) 
But now everyday, I thank God as I pray 
For sending my angel to me
