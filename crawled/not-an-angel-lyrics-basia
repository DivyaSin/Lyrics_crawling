I'm not an angel 
You know me better, not an angel 
You rule my world, you rule my world 
Now take me to heaven Forgive my open talk 
But our love is not taboo 
It was a dream before 
With you I feel the earth move Take me high, make me smile 
Get to know my other side 
I kept the best for you 
Teach me now, show me how Baby you might be surprised 
I'll be good to you 
I'm grown up I'm not shy 
I have waited long enough
