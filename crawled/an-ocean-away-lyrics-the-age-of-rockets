The days count me down 
Hit's close to home now and I don't 
So I'll pause like it sunk in 
But I don't listen, I never listen It'd break your heart were 
I killed by a tidal wave 
An ocean away torn apart by the coral 
Trying to breathe This hope to grow old is a joke now 
And it gets funnier every time I tell it 
So here we are now broken school boys 
In love with a girl who is no more alive than I
