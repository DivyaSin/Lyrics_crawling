Would you like to come cloud watching with me? 
We can while away the afternoon 
Just to step out of time is all we need 
Looking out for the other rule Cos theres no place 
Id rather be 
Theres no one 
Id rather see Would you like to come cloud watching with me? 
We can watch the world roll on by 
Dreaming up all the endless possibilities 
Staring into the open sky Cos theres no place 
Id rather be 
And theres no one 
Id rather see 
Watch the blues get blown away Would you like to come cloud watching with me? 
We dont have to talk at all 
If we lie on our backs in the green green grass 
I guarantee theres no way to fall Cos theres no place 
Id rather be 
And theres no one 
Id rather see 
And together watch the blues get blown away 
Cos there are so many clouds in the sky today Yeah 
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah...
