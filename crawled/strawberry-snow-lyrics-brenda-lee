Sleep with your spoon in your pillow 
Don't be the witch that bends the Willow 
No matter how old you grow 
Morning may bring, Strawberry Snow Little boys and girls make raindrops turn to Lemon 
Then, little boys and girls turn into men and women 
Those that are happy are those that still know 
That morning may bring, Strawberry Snow Smile though your heart has no reason 
Drink everyday that's the season 
Ask little children, they know 
Morning may bring, Stawberry Snow (Music)
