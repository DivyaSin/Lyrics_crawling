Intro: 
Ahh, wooh C'mon man, I love you but I don't like you right now Verse 1: 
Now listen I heard your complaints, I heard you on the phone you riffing, 
You say you pain, You say you feel something missing 
Well get on the plane, Go find another love to visit 
This ship has sailed, You might as well keep your fucking distance Myspace is my space, stop sending pictures 
I love the way you looking at blew off f*** what is this 
I can't take it no more, alright baby it's wrong 
I can't fake it no more, my heart is already gone Degrees of separation, and your my Kevin Bacon 
But asalamalakum I'm tired of the confrontation 
I'm tired of the constant hating, It's half empty for you 
I'm like ???? I think the ???? I wish the ??? came with it's ???? out of ???? 
I stop calling yo ass and now your ass is naked 
And now our ass is caking 
It's like I'm always waiting on yo ass to change but my ass never had the patience Chorus: 
Babe (Listen) 
I love you 
But I love you more 
If we wasn't together 
X2 Verse 2: 
Girl, all this caution is making me nauseas 
Girl, you built a wall protecting the target 
Why, nobodies trying to attack 
We were fine in fact, it was all in your mind your past Got you, thinking all the time you gonna get it got 
But just knowing the real I gave it my best shot 
I did what I could, even when I couldn't 
I look all up in my proof tryna find your pudding, But it's the opposite, this shit was obvious 
I saw the sewer, we was living in metropolis 
And I was super man and you was stupid... Damn! 
I think she feel in love with my suit again Wanted me to save her from the hooligans 
I'm in the hoop again, she's in the coupe again 
We getting cool again, but check the loop again 
She's looking through my phone like nah uh who your friend Chorus: 
Babe (Listen) 
I love you 
But I love you more 
If we wasn't together 
X2 Verse 3: 
Baby girl I ain't seen you in a couple days 
And its cool we said we'd give each other space 
And it's true sometimes we on the other ??? 
My bad it's your fault, all in each others face, never with enough to say We screaming through the intercom 
Then the stairs, then the hall, then we get it on 
And we blind cause we can't see who we sh***ing on 
First you call the cops, then you call me ???, then we get involved And I ain't seen you all day, 
Uh, I feel like your my favorite heartache 
Uh, I mean like your my greatest long day 
Uh, I mean like I don't know where were going but this is what the song say And it's gonna take more than praying, nah mean 
It's gonna take a little motivating, nah mean 
Cause these feelings that I'm cultivating, it's not me 
And uh it's not you, and uh it's not us So what what what but what I gotta say is 
But what what what I gotta say is 
But what what what what what what what what what 
But what I gotta tell you Chorus: 
Babe (Listen) 
I love you 
But I love you more 
If we wasn't together
