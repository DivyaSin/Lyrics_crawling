So what's the price fortune and fame? 
Friendship going down the drain 
What becomes of those you meet 
Stepping stones beneath your feet You've got to reach the highest peak 
Ambition isn't for the weak 
Determined so you are inside 
But who are those you push aside? People, people, people Something just won't let you stop 
Till you make it to the top 
When you're there you'll soon forget 
All the kindness you once met So don't forget as you grow older 
Keep on looking over your shoulder 
Bitterness is all you'll find 
Don't tread on those you leave behind People, people, people
