Flower girls play lover 
Grave games in the courtyard 
I heard her 
Screaming like a radio 
Mary Lou left marks on you 
She just screams at the walls 
The kite string pops I'm swallowed whole by the sky 
We smoke the bones of baby dolls 
Techno liquid screaming meat 
Heavens cold beneath my feet 
Cyber love the anti-man 
We make love because we can 
Virgins play whore the bayous blue 
Barefoot (and bloody) eatin' mushroom stew 
Work = pay, pay = freedom 
Fuck them all cause we don't need 'em 
Everything's gone dry 
Like bottle glass scraping cross the pavement
