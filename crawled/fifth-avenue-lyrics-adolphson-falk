A promised phone call home to 
A Minnesota mining town 
From a tired hungry kid 
Whom the Greyhound just let down 
On the January snow in his canvas tennis shoes 
The kid just took his first walk 
down the great Fifth Avenue 
With a guitar on his shoulder 
And a pocket full of songs 
He's here to make his debut 
He's here to right some wrongs 
But he's a bit short on references 
His future's hanging loose 
Just another midnight cowboy 
on the great Fifth Avenue 
And in some noisy uptown night club 
Or in a Bleeker Street cafe 
With sweaty hands and shaky knees 
He takes the stage 
It ain't no friendly city 
If you haven't got the bread 
Cause those who have ain't sharing 
With those who wish they had 
Sleeping out in subways 
Keeping warm on cheap booze 
Living with the high and mighty 
On the great Fifth Avenue 
And in some noisy uptown night club 
Or in a Bleeker Street cafe 
With sweaty hands and shaky knees 
He takes the stage 
In a well guarded beach-house 
On the California shore 
A man lives with his loneliness 
And the songs he writes no more 
Not real sure where he came from 
And no place to go to 
Just some hazy memories 
Of the great Fifth Avenue 
[The Swedish version is more or less a description of the Fifth Avenue - the 
chorus can be translated as "I take a taxi from Harlem / down to the 
Washington Square / five miles reflecting / a whole world".]
