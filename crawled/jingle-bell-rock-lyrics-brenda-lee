Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock 
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring 
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun 
Now the jingle hop has begun Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock 
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time 
Dancin' and prancin' in jingle bell square 
In the frosty air What a bright time, it's the right time 
To rock the night away 
Jingle bell time is a swell time 
To go glidin' in a one horse sleigh Giddy up, jingle horse pick up your feet 
Jingle around the clock 
Mix and mingle in a jinglin' beat 
That's the jingle bell rock Jing, jing, jingle bell, jingle bell rock 
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time 
Dancin' and prancin' in jingle bell square 
In the frosty air What a bright time, it's the right time 
We're gonna rock the night away 
Jingle bell time it's a swell time 
To go glidin' in a one horse sleigh, hey Giddy up, jingle horse pick up your feet 
Jingle around the clock 
Mix and mingle in a jinglin' beat 
That's the jingle bell, that's the jingle bell 
That's the jingle bell rock
