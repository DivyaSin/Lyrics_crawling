Three chords and six strings 
They're screaming how they're gonna change things 
They're young, they're strong and proud 
We turn it up cause we like it loud Three chords and six strings 
They're screaming how they're gonna change things 
They're young, they're strong and proud 
We turn it up cause we like it loud They're young but the lines have been drawn 
And they're still gonna be here when you're gone 
And years from now when your clique has moved on 
They'll still be in the basement till the break of dawn Sweating blood into every single song 
And still feeling like they don't belong And it'll be here for the down and out 
And every generation that needs to shout 
About injustice or 
Just how we need to shut this fucker down Shut it down 
Shut it down 
You just can't shut this motherfucker down You can slag it when you leave and spite it 
You can't shut this fucker down 
It still burns with the fire that once ignited you 
You can't shut this fucker down Shut this fucker down 
Shut it down 
Shut it down 
You just can't shut this fucker down They're young but you were there too 
Don't think they're posing just because they never knew 
The songs or the scene, it was there before you 
And it's way more important than your hair and tattoos Take what you need and leave when you're through 
And keep your mouth shut when you do And it'll be here for the down and out 
And every generation that needs to shout 
About injustice or 
Just how we need to shut this fucker down Shut it down 
Shut it down 
You just can't shut this motherfucker down You can slag it when you leave and spite it 
You can't shut this fucker down 
It still burns with the fire that once ignited you 
You can't shut this fucker down Shut this fucker down 
Shut it down 
Shut it down 
You just can't shut this fucker down Three chords and six strings 
They're screaming how they're gonna change things 
They're young, they're strong and proud 
We turn it up cause we like it loud Three chords and six strings 
They're screaming how they're gonna change things 
They're young, they're strong and proud 
We turn it up cause we like it loud Shut it down 
Shut it down 
You just can't shut this motherfucker down You can slag it when you leave and spite it 
You can't shut this fucker down 
It still burns with the fire that once ignited you 
You can't shut this fucker down Shut this fucker down 
Shut it down 
Shut it down 
You just can't shut this fucker down
