Bucket full of tears 
Baby know I'm here 
I'm here waiting Close your precious eyes 
And just realize 
I'm still fighting For you to be with me 
Sit under this tree 
And we can watch the sun rise 
We can watch the sunrise Wake up feel the air that I'm breathin' 
I can't explain this feeling that I'm feelin' 
I won't go another day without you I know it feels like no one's around 
But baby you're wrong Just get rid of that fear 
Promise that I'm here 
I'll never be gone So baby come with me 
We can fly away 
And we can watch the stars shine And baby you can be my love Wake up feel the air that I'm breathin' 
I can't explain this feeling that I'm feelin' 
I won't go another day without you (Without you) 
Hold on, I promise it gets brighter 
And when it rains, I'll hold you even tighter 
I won't go another day without you (Without you) And this is me tonight 
No more games and no more lies 
And I know it's right 
'Cause of the way you look into my eyes 
And when I hold you tight, 
The worries disappear, I'm glad you're in my life Wake up feel the air that I'm breathin' 
I can't explain this feeling that I'm feelin' 
I won't go another day without you (Without you) 
Hold on, I promise it gets brighter 
And when it rains, I'll hold you even tighter 
I won't go another day without you (Without you) And I won't I won't go another day 
Without you
