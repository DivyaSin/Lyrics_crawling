Oh, I've been looking for a girl 
Who wanted something more than make-up and dresses 
She wouldn't care about hair styles, nail files 
It just might take a while But I've got all the time to wait 
I'm not afraid of being alone for awhile 
'Cause I don't need no alibis, pretty lies 
I have no need for compromise I want you, believe me 
I need you, deceive me 
I'm fading, don't leave me 
I'm begging, don't let me down 
Don't let me down, don't let me down Then I saw you in the street 
And I just knew I had to make your acquaintance 
Something like an old friend, start to end 
I could feel my heart start to mend Last night I dreamt that I had drowned 
Beneath the water on the floor of the ocean 
As I lay among the shells and sand 
Your hand pulled me up to dry land I want you, believe me 
I need you, deceive me 
I'm fading, don't leave me 
I'm begging, don't let me down 
Don't let me down, don't let me down 
Don't let me down It?s almost funny when you're all alone for too long 
You start to feeling that there's something that you've done wrong 
When you find the one in all the worlds corrected 
You never plan it out it?s when you least expect it 
Now you're protected, even respected I want you, believe me 
I need you, deceive me 
I'm fading, don't leave me 
I'm begging, don't let me down 
Don't let me down, don't let me down 
Don't let me down
