Prettiest one never talked to me 
Bought her a coke and Jim Bean 
Sting of bourbon on her lips 
Big tab and twenty dollar tip 
She put her hand on my thigh 
So I grabbed my wallet and opened wide She didn't like me but she loved my money 
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny 
She wanted friends and I wanted honey 
She didn't like me but she loved my money I asked her if I could take her home 
Nervous my expense account had grown 
She put her bosom to my face 
Hope my money didn't go to waste 
A man can only spend so much 
Getting played by a woman's touch She didn't like me but she loved my money 
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny 
She wanted friends and I wanted honey 
She didn't like me but she loved my money I guess I ain't no big bank hank 
All my bread wound up in the tank 
So I go to bed with her on my mind 
And I'm flat broke one more time A man can only spend so much 
Getting played by a woman's touch 
But tomorrow night I'll try again 
I try to be more than just her friend She didn't like me but she loved my money 
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny 
She wanted friends and I wanted honey 
She didn't like me but she loved my money She didn't like me but she loved my money
