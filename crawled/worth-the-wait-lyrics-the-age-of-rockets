I'm waiting for the dinosaurs to return 
and ravage the traffic of morning commute 
and sink in comfort of despair and I hope it's worth the wait 
and I hope it's worth the wait I'm waiting for the ocean floor to appear 
and long after smiles give way to the teeth 
we float 'til we're lost and done and I hope it's worth the wait 
and I hope it's worth the wait I'm waiting for your plane to pour and oceans between us will bend in relief 
tonight it seems you go and I hope it's worth the wait 
and I hope it's worth the wait
