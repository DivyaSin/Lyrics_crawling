Ohhh, another one gone 
Another one lost alone and along the way 
To the place I stay 
It's been a few years been a few months been a couple weeks three days 
But who the fucks counting anyways? 
Who the fucks seeing better days than the fucking hideaways 
It don't matter cuz it's all just a faze 
Just another day just another way to make you say 
Fuck this drink a bottle to the bottom 
Funny how it never ever stops a problem 
And you wake to a bad headache 
And a bitch looking like she could jump and cause an earthquake 
Never mind I'm off my track, it's me and tac showing you where numb is at 
It's right here, it's no pain, no smiles, no fear 
No love, nothing more nothing here Chorus 
You see me cut so deep to try to find what might be hidden 
You watch me rip and tear to feel what's there what all is missing 
And now I leave cuz I found this place 
I'm not alone if I chose to stay 
I need to know that this aint a waste and 
We're never that far away Since day one I was never fucking like you 
They all criticize but never had a right to 
Then never knew what it did to me 
And now I see the flows of who I wanna be now 
I can fake my smile I can make em believe 
That I'm still a healthy person when I hide my disease 
I can make em think I'm like them 
I can make em think that I'm their friend 
But when you take your time will you look behind my eyes 
Can you see the truth or just the truth in lies 
I can't take it anymore I can't help myself 
Cuz when I take these pills then I'm someone else 
You can't do a damn thing cuz it's up to me 
Just let me be me so I can be free 
Will you let them take over will you try to run and hide 
Can you take off the mask from which your inside You see me cut so deep to try to find what might be hidden 
You watch me rip and tear to feel what's there what all is missing 
And now I leave cuz I found this place 
I'm not alone if I chose to stay 
I need to know that this aint a waste and 
We're never that far away Close your eyes I'll close mine 
Sometimes things get clear when you're blind 
Close your eyes I'll close mine 
Sometimes things get clear when you're blind 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Sometimes things get clear when you're blind 
Just close your eyes and I'll close mine 
I can see so clear when I'm blind 
Here I am on cloud nine 
Living a thin line but having a great time 
On top of the world with the other mother fuckers 
Thinking everybody love us and there's nothing up above us 
Here I am with all I can give 
Everything that was what will be and now is 
Take a step back and check how you live 
You don't love what you got then you don't got shit 
They say you don't know what you got till it's gone 
And you can't back down cuz you waited too long 
They know how you feel cuz you wear it on your sleeve 
And you don't want to stay but you know you can't leave 
So breathe take your time cuz you know how I feel 
With wounds that are just too deep to even heal 
Gotta close my eyes so I can finally see 
Everything I am and who I wanna be You see me cut so deep to try to find what might be hidden 
You watch me rip and tear to feel what's there what all is missing 
And now I leave cuz I found this place 
I'm not alone if I chose to stay 
I need to know that this aint a waste and 
We're never that far away
