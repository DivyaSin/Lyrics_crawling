Ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh 
Before you Before you, I was empty 
Nothing left, was just a shell 
Before you, loneliness was all I felt Didn't want to fall in love no more, 
Was so sad I, fell so many times I hit the floor, hurt so bad 
I didn't want no one to bring me down, was sick and tired 
Then you came to lift me off the ground, and you take me higher [Chorus] 
We rise, we rise in love 
You and I, keep rising 
We rise, we rise in love 
Higher, we're flying 
Our love will rise Rescued me from all the pain I felt, before I met you 
Dried my eyes and made me smile again, you helped me get through 
Now I know what loves supposed to be, it's like you're flying 
Now I know the love I've found is real, cause it keeps on rising [Chorus] [Bridge] 
We're so high and we keep rising 
We keep climbing, higher and higher 
And we keep soaring, we keep growing, we keep loving 
Our love is flying We rise, we rise 
You and I (keep rising) [Chorus] Our love will rise [Chorus]
