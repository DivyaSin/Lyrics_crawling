Three day funk 
Remember the times, sunshine in our eyes 
We were caught up in the summer shade 
Those were the days, like a gentle sleeping baby 
We would watch the ocean wash the sun away Livin' free was so easy, honey, honey 
Those sunny days can never fade away 
`Round and `round and `round time passes by so fast 
Hey, hey, hey The memory's all I know 
And they're long gone for me 
Her memory's holding on 
But they're long gone for me Sippin' my wine under the moonshine blanket 
With my baby rollin' under the stars 
Terrible lies we would tell one another, oh yeah 
Hey, hey, hey Livin' free was so easy, honey, honey 
Those sunny days can never fade away 
`Round and `round and `round time passes by so fast 
Hey, hey, hey The memory's all I know 
And they're long gone for me 
Her memory's holding on 
And they're long gone for me, yeah (Solo) The memory's all I know 
And they're long gone for me 
Her memory's holding on 
But they're long gone for me The memory's all I know 
And they're long gone for me 
Her memory's holding on 
But they're long gone for me 
Yeah, yeah (all they're long gone) Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hoo Livin' free, livin' free, livin free my baby, now alright 
I need a woman 
Woman, oh woman, oh woman, oh woman 
Aaaahh, haaaa
