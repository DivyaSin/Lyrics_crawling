Soft light, total silence 
So tired to take the table near the door 
The table near the door 
Sat back on the fire Only as stable as I choose to show 
If I choose to show 
But where were you that night? 
When I was Well, I feel that this an explosion 
That nobody else could ever really know 
Well, I will follow you anywhere You say you don't believe in science 
You're always afraid of what you can't control 
I will follow you anywhere 
But where were you that night? 
When I was When I was calling for the answer 
That you probably shouldn't know 
Well, it feels like flames surrounding me here When you were calling with your question 
When all I needed was to know 
That it feels like flames surrounding me here Unkempt and over-caffeinated 
I walked the forty steps to the moon 
(Back to the moon) You say you don't believe in science 
You're always ashamed of what you're willing to lose 
But I will follow you anywhere 
But where were you that night? 
When I was When I was calling for the answer 
That you probably shouldn't know 
When it feels like flames surrounding me here When you were calling with your question 
When all I needed was to know 
When it feels like flames surrounding me here So this is it, so this is it 
So this is the silence 
So this is the silence we became 
It's never quite, it's never quite over 
It's never quite over in the silence When I was calling for the answer 
That you probably shouldn't know 
Well, it feels like flames surrounding me here When you were calling with your question 
When all I needed was to know 
Well, it feels like flames surrounding me here
