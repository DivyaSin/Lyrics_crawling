There's a zombification process going on, and it involves the man with the white collar telling you that when he's raping it's not really rape. It's just a very bad mistake and the man above will forgive him, and spare him the burden of having to speak on the stand. And mothers and fathers across this world turn a deaf ear and a blind eye, and keep sending their children to fucking sunday school. The man of the cloth will rape them. The church will keep it's mouth shut because what goes on between the stained glass windows is between the parties involved and their god above. Take this literally, the way the 12 year old had to take one of god's messengers hands on their sholders from behind. You'll never hear them admit this. You'll never hear an admission of guilt. There's a fucking problem with that cross. (It doesn't exist). And there's never a truth when a collection plate and the bible are involved.
