At daybreak I wait for You 
Crush softly, come 
With the brilliance and weight of Jupiter 
You weaken me as with wounds It's always enough to sound the deeps, Numinous 
By falling under 
It's always enough to run Your way, Numinous 
And I will follow At sundown I wait for You 
Speak softly, come 
Dying now with the way 
That Your voice and music are the same to me It's always enough to sound the deeps, Numinous 
By falling under 
It's always enough to run Your way, Numinous 
And I will follow One day's enough to know all fullness 
I'll run Your way, You will enlarge my heart 
Though You slay me, I will hope in You through all 
Forgive the best of what we do and are just God, forgive It's always enough to sound the deeps, Numinous 
By falling under 
It's always enough to run Your way, Numinous 
And I will follow
