Stand in the crowd with your biggest pose 
You hide it well but everybody knows you and 
We watch just how you go along 
Easily led into battle by the first song 
Stalking your prey , single out the weak 
And beat them down because you're incomplete 
What's in your mind when our eyes are yours 
We've seen your image and you're uniform before 
What are you trying to gain acceptance to? 
I know your eyes and that sure isn't you 
We lost another. Run for cover 
Cause the next to taste the street might be you 
So stop the show and turn on the house lights 
So everyone can see a pathetic man fight 
Because he feels he lesser, he acts like the aggressor to you 
I've see your face in every town 
I've see your face in every crowd 
Tell us why it is you have to prove 
Just how easily the others bruise 
So many of us and so few of you 
We know your motives and were watching you 
We wouldn't miss you of you were gone 
Someone would take your place at the beginning of the next song
