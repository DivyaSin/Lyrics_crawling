I got it in my mind to do something wrong 
I want to shed my skin I've been in it way too long 
And I feel just like a ghost 
With no-one to haunt Empty my broken head 
It's all filled up with what I can't recall 
Tear out my broken heart 
I want to feel the pain or nothing at all 
I was just looking for an easy way out How long will this take and do I have to wait? 
And when the jackets on should I plead insane? 
Doc how do you find the time 
For all the crazies in world? Patch up my broken life 
It's all banged up from one to many falls 
Seal up my vocals chords 
I don't want to speak from this lonely chair to the walls 
I was just looking for an easy way out 
I was just looking for an easy way out 
I was just looking for an easy way out And I feel just like a ghost 
With no-one to haunt Empty my broken head 
It's all filled up with what I can't recall 
Tear out my broken heart 
I want to feel the pain or nothing at all 
Seal up my vocals chords 
I don't want to speak from this lonely chair to the walls 
I was just looking for an easy way out 
I was just looking for an easy way out 
I was just looking for an easy way out
