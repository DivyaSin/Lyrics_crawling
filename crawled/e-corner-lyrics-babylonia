Born alone 
Poor creatures made of flesh and bones 
Unprotected 
Hope someone listens to their moans 
There are leaves in the sky at the mercy of the wind 
Unconsciousness 
Walk by my side, lead me through the night Something waits around the corner 
I don't want to discover 
What schemes around the corner 
I am trembling 
There's a state of disillusion 
An inner feeling of confusion 
Here comes the conclusion 
And I'm falling apart Carry on 
Try not to show how frightened we are 
On the run 
At the end it seems we haven't come so far 
There are clouds in the sky like thoughts inside my mind 
Disenchantment 
Through the veils of human uncertainty
