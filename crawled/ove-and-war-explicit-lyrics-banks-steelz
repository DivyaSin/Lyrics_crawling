You could've been mine but 
You could've been mine but 
You could've been mine but 
You putting me in line 
If all is fair in love and war 
If all is fair in love and war 
All is fair in love and war 
What are you keeping score for? Yo, ayo 
She fucked around and cut up my rhyme books to shreds 
She caught me fucking her friend in our bed 
I used to try to tell her stop talking to the fellas 
Come around with that short ass dress and short [?] 
Zigliani shit, D to the crib 
Balenciaga wrist, a gift from the kid 
But we stay beefin, boo with no broccoli 
Every time I come in the crib I'm in a hot seat 
Breaking all my watches, gold plate Versace 
You said you didn't mean that shit cause you was toxic 
Probably argue everyday as a hobby 
We used to be like Claire and Bill Cosby 
So what the hell, we held hands on the regular 
Writing "I love you" on napkins on the table, love 
Capiche, depends on the season 
Cause as soon as June July hit, we beastin' 
Not speaking, it increases 
Feel like my love had to depletion 
Then we get back together, that's decent 
But last week you keep my Benz and that's recent She's bitching, I'm bitching 
She's switching, I'm switching 
She's talking, I'm not listening 
I'm bitching about her in the kitchen 
If all is fair in love and war 
If all is fair in love and war 
All is fair in love and war 
What are you keeping score for? She's high maintainence, she lacks patience 
But for her love there's no replacement 
Face to face, waste to brace and men chase to taste it 
Most will get strung for the first engagement 
I met her on the downtown streets down east 
Now it seems she's always around me 
And our love has astounded me, bounded me 
There's no way I can break free 
A servant to her will, I'm emerging to her feel 
I pour my heart out and she let my love spill 
Out on the floor when love change to war 
Both tryna win, tryna claim galore 
Infatuation, walking fabrication 
Kept alive through imagination 
Opposite sides attract and collided 
The collision was a bad decision 
Two lovers trapped in one prison 
Tryna separate like nuclear fission
