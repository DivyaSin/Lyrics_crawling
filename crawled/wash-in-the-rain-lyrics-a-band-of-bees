I try and I fail 
Sometimes I even succeed 
If you look at my life 
I can't complain 
If you know what I mean 
And it is all the same 
When your holding out 
You can wash in the rain Wash in the rain, wash in the rain 
Wash in the rain, wash in the rain I got salt you got pepper 
Maybe we should get it together 
I dig a hole, you fill it up 
You're the second thing to knock me over 
Only to the waves at the edge of the water Wash in the waves, wash in the waves 
Wash in the waves, wash in the waves 
Wash in the waves I find it hard to forget 
All the effort in regret 
Put in one pot that's big enough 
It's bound to crack when it hits the rock 
That's 'cause your wicked and you wouldn't stop 
That's 'cause your wicked and you wouldn't stop You wouldn't stop 
You wouldn't stop 
You wouldn't stop
