LOST IN SLUMBER 
A THREAT TO NO ONE 
WEAK AND HUMBLED, IN MY DISGRACE 
SWEET DEPARTURE, IS WHAT I LONG FOR 
CARELESS MOMENTS, TO COMFORT ME DEAD PHILOSOPHY IF I OFFER YOU MY SOUL 
WILL YOU CARRY ME AWAY 
I CANNOT BE THE ONLY ONE 
TO BE DEHUMANIZED AGAIN 
LEFT BEHIND TOO DETERMINED 
TO BE FORGOTTEN 
NOTHING LEFT TO, ENRAPTURE ME 
HARD AND SILENT, SOFTLY BREAKING 
NO BELOVED, TO COMFORT ME DEAD PHILOSOPHY IF I OFFER YOU MY SOUL 
WILL YOU CARRY ME AWAY 
I CANNOT BE THE ONLY ONE 
TO BE DEHUMANIZED AGAIN 
LEFT BEHIND FEEL THE DETERMINATION BUILT INTO MY MIND YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND ME 
I'LL WIPE THE WORLD AWAY 
YOUR FACE IT WILL REMNIND ME 
JUST HOW MUCH I HAVE TO LEAVE
