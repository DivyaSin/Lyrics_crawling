I got a size two pair of boots 
I ain't ever gonna sell them and that's the truth 
They ain't for walking around this town on the ground 
Special kind of shoes the best I've found 
Well they're kinda small, there's a reason for that 
They go with a jacket and an itty bitty hat 
"Cause my boy's on his way and I can tell you for sure 
He'll be driving girls wild by the time he's four 
"Cause he'll rock like Elvis and sing like Jones 
Born to be wild and bad to the bone 
He'll have his mama's good looks, his daddy's keen eye 
There ain't a bull alive he won't be able to ride 
Well it happened like this without a word of a lie 
One night while I was singing a lullaby 
I had him in my name when I noticed that curl 
That's when I realized my boy was a girl 
Well she fits them boots, she looks real smart 
That sweet little girl has stolen my heart 
She's got her mama's good looks and you know 
What that means 
I'll be guarding the door 'til she's thirty-three
