Well, I may be wrong leaving it up to you 
But my love is strong, and that's what I'll do 
Well, you may be right working all night and day 
And I know, sometimes, I've got to get away 
Get away, oo-oo-way The walls are getting closer 
People trying to freeze my soul 
The times are getting harder, only wanna Rock 'N' Roll 
Too much sittin', thinkin' what we're gonna say 
And I know, sometimes, I've got to get away 
Get away, oo-oo-way I may be wrong, babe, leaving you this way 
I must be strong, babe, leaving you today Well come on, hey hey Get away, oo-oo-way I may be wrong, babe, leaving you this way
