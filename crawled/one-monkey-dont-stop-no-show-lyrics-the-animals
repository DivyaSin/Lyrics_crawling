You know I got a letter from a friend of mine 
In Newcastle upon a Tyne the other day 
He said to me, "Eric, I heard you've been havin' 
Some trouble down in the smoke with the girls" He said, "You wanna catch that flyin' Scotsman 
Back up here to Newcastle 
'Cause we've got enough females to go around up here 
And I can figure you can find yourself a little somethin'" "And because people around here 
Don't go away stealin' each others loved ones 
Away from one another 
Like they do down there in the smoke" He also said in the letter that, ah 
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne 
And I believed every word he said now 
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne One more thing he told me now 
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne 
He said to me, babe 
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne He said, alright, alright 
So I'm sayin' to you who are listenin' 
If you've been unlucky in love 
And you've lost somebody love And you hear a voice that comes to you 
In the middle of the night and says 
It says I want you to get on up 
Listen to me, I want you to get on up 
And find yourself another one If you're havin' breakfast one morning 
And out from behind the teapot a little voice says 
Listen, hey, I want you to get on up now 
If you're out in the mornin' on your job And a voice come to you on your job and says 
Get up, get up 
And you know it's not the foreman 
It's a little voice that says You wanna get up and walk [unverified], women 
Go on and find yourself somebody 
That's what you'd better do Because I'll tell you one thing 
There's one thing I found out 
One thing I found out 
Took me a long time to find it out Yeah, it took me a long time to find out 
But I think I got it now, oh, yeah 
One monkey don't stop no show 
Yes, it's true, baby One monkey don't stop no show 
Don't let one monkey stop up your show 
One monkey don't stop no show 
One monkey don't stop no show
