I'll be on my way, wait till you see the toys I bought 
You'll be on my mind, wait till it's time for me to go Can't wait to see those sleepy eyes 
They will refuse to end the day 
Can't wait to hear those mumbling goo 
Saying I got a lot to learn And I will see through it all now saying yeah yeah yeah 
I'll be all right singing yeah yeah yeah 
I see through it all now singing yeah yeah yeah 
Cause you'll be my greatest cure of all I'll be on my way, wait till I open up the door 
Now you stay on my mind, there's no time like coming home tonight
