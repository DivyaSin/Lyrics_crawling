(ralph covert - waterdog music / ascap) 
A bed and a chair 
An empty box on the stair 
A smile in the mirror 
As she picks up the phone 
A place of her own 
She calls me to say 
She moved in today 
If I'm doing nothing 
She's got somewhere to go 
A place of her own And home is more than a pillow on the floor 
It's more than four walls and a doorway 
It's your space to grow I drop by at eight 
With chinese food in a bag 
She says the walls need painting 
Then laughs and pulls me close 
A place of her own And home is more than a pillow on the floor 
It's more than four walls and a doorway 
It's your space to grow
