Come see my broken pleasure 
Come take away the cold 
Don't leave me staking ruthless 
We are damaged, take control Take control 
We are damaged, take control 
We are damaged, take control We became violence when we were young and our light 
We can't last through the fire 
Let things burn to survive 
Let things burn to survive 
We are damaged, take control We are damaged, take control 
We are damaged, take control
