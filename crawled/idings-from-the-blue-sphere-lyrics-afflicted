Probing... inward 
seeking new depths within myself 
an odyssey through my subconscious 
the deeper I venture the worse it will be 
I don't know if I want to see 
as I realize my view of society Their games of power infest the air 
lost in your own world, you don't want to know 
perpetual decline is breeding despair 
I questio myself, how far will it go? Go?? And life goes on under yellow sun 
as time goes by in star-filled space 
and ignorant children pace the earth 
all revealing in endless mirth A fragile eco-system 
in orbit around the star 
imbalance under way 
it has come too far The future is concealed by time 
and lurking around the next bend on our way 
yes, you speak and yes, you act 
but is your reason still intact? Errors, mistakes 
something we make 
trust in technology 
something we fake 
yeah! Our action past and present 
are closing in on us 
visions of our future 
a world that's choked in dust
