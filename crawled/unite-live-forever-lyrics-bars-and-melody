Yeah, Bars and Melody! I've been feeling kind of lonely without you now 
When you're not around 
When we unite together 
We shared the stars, the moon and the ocean 
There's no way I'm leaving here without you now (without you now) 
We only get one life 
So let's make it now before it's all over We're living life right now, no checking out 
Making our new sounds, so check it out 
You can't bring us down, now I doubt That you'll keep up 'cause we'll keep going! Tonight we're never letting go 
From London to Tokyo 
Tonight turn up the radio 
Sing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Tonight we're never letting go 
From London to Tokyo 
Tonight turn up the radio 
Sing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! We're gonna be alright 
Let's stick together! 
We're gonna be okay 
We'll live forever! Wait! I don't want this to end 
I don't want an enemy, all I want is a friend 
And in that time that you feel so low 
And there's nobody around and nowhere to go 
Blindness from the truth, we can stare at the sun 
You can't separate us (ah!) we will always be one 
Moulded and shaped, unbreakable state 
Skin that you believe, it's a beautiful day 
I wish that we could fly far away from it 
But I think I know a place to get away from this 
We can be strong as long as we stick together, 
Never letting go, we can live forever! Tonight we're never letting go 
From London to Tokyo 
Tonight turn up the radio 
Sing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Tonight we're never letting go 
From London to Tokyo 
Tonight turn up the radio 
Sing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! We're gonna be alright 
Let's stick together! 
We're gonna be okay 
We'll live forever! We're gonna be alright 
Let's stick together! 
We're gonna be okay 
We'll live forever! I ain't gonna ever, 
I ain't gonna ever, 
I ain't gonna let you down I ain't gonna leave, 
I ain't gonna leave, 
Always gonna be around, oh! I ain't gonna ever, 
I ain't gonna ever, 
I ain't gonna let you down Wake me up and bring me daylight, 
We are far from town (Oooh, we're gonna live forever) [x4] Tonight we're never letting go 
From London to Tokyo

Sing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
