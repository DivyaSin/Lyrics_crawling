A touch of poison seals my fate 
The dawn echoes the night with my glory...the sun himself honors me Once king of roses,now lord of gold 
The Gods themselves envy my hand 
Blessed with the gift of gilded touch 
Fate wields its knife to cut the thread I curse the day my dream became my descent suddenly I long for you,my only love In my perfection I have no want 
Yet eyes still glint with greed untold 
A folly as fatal as sin has now become the end of me I curse the day my dream became my descent suddenly I long for you,my only love Have I not earned this, this gift of beauty within? 
How selfish were the Gods to keep their riches from my rightful treasure? 
I truly have become one of them...my fatal flaw Oh yeah! I've got her hook,line, and sinker! 
Thanks to me, she's her own new necklace! now she's good as gold! I curse the day my dream became my descent suddenly I long for you,my only love... Cut the thread...
