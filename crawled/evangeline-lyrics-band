She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi 
Alone in the pale moonlight 
Waiting for a man, a riverboat gambler 
Said that he'd return tonight They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi 
Loving the whole night through 
'Til the riverboat gambler went off to make a killing 
And bring it on back to you Evangeline, Evangeline 
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen 
That pulled her man away Bayou Sam, from the south Lousianna 
Had gambling in his veins 
Evangeline, from the maritimes 
Was slowly going insane
