[Chorus] 
It's Christmas, give love 'till there's peace 
'Til there's more then enough 
It's Christmas, give love 
It's all about love 
Yea, yea, yea Today I saw a man on the street yea, yea 
He was cold, he was tired 
And there were no shoes on his feet yea, yea 
He said can you spare a dime 
It won't take you much time 
'Til I can get back up on my feet 
I look to heaven and pray 
Day after day 
I'm just trying to get something to eat [Chorus] And what about the woman 
Who walks the night alone 
With no place to sleep yea, yea 
And what about the child 
With a broken heart 
Through teary eyes that can't really see 
All they need is a hand 
Someone who understands 
To listen to the cry that they make 
Instead of walking on by 
Take a look into their eyes 
And help somebody find their way [Chorus] Just open your heart 
'Cause there's someone out there 
Who's needing you now A little love 
Is something that can't be replaced 
Put a smile on each face 
Some how, right now On this holiday 
I don't care what people say 
Put their weight upon my shoulders [Chorus] God so loved the world 
That he gave his only son 
Not just for me 
Not just for you 
For everyone
