It's out with the old and in with the new 
Goodbye clouds of gray, hello skies of blue 
A dip in the pool, a trip to the spa 
Endless days in my chaise 
The whole world according to moi Excuse me? 
Thank you Iced tea imported from England 
Lifeguards imported from Spain 
Towels imported from Turkey 
And turkey imported from Maine We're gonna relax and renew 
You go do I want fabulous, that is my simple request 
All things fabulous, bigger and better and best 
I need something inspiring to help me get along 
I need a little fabulous, is that so wrong? Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops 
Where is my pink Prada tote? 
I need my Tiffany hairband 
And then I can go for a float Summer like never before 
I want more She wants fabulous, that is her simple request 
All things fabulous, bigger and better and best 
She needs something inspiring to help her get along 
She needs a little fabulous, is that so wrong? Fabulous pool, fabulous splash 
Fabulous parties even fabulous trash 
Fabulous fashion, fabulous bling 
She's got to have fabulous everything Nothing to discuss 
Everything's got to be perfect for me She wants fabulous, that is her simple request 
All things fabulous, bigger and better and best 
She needs something inspiring to help her get along 
She needs a little fabulous, is that so wrong? This won't do, that's a bore 
That's insulting, I need more 
I need, I need, I need, I need, I need, I need 
I need fabulous Give me fabulous hair, fabulous style 
Fabulous eyes and that fabulous smile 
Oh, I like what I see, I like it a lot 
Is this absolutely fabulous? Absolutely not
