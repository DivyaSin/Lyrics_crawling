Well here I am again face down in my own pity 
I don't know who you are 
Or where I am 
You're clinching your teeth 
(And I won't care until I wake up again) 
I'm starting to see the change taking place in your eyes 
A grin left carefully clean and deceiving, clean and deceiving 
He'll never own his right to believing 
They're always pushing in the other direction 
He'll never own his right to believing 
They're always pushing in the other direction 
A family would ask for more 
But this what they get 
I am what they get 
Mistakes define my very being 
I am nothing more than a reflection of fathers 
Mistakes define my very being 
I am nothing more than a reflection of fathers 
All I hear is static 
Please God, come home 
I am dying 
And I am alone 
It's so hard to tell myself 
Myself, that I don't need you 
'Cause I can't breathe without you, without you in my lungs 
I'm starting to breathe just a little bit slower 
My lungs are reacting, collapsing to the weight of your hands 
How can I help myself if I don't know who in the hell I've become? 
I am not a martyr 
I am only in this for myself 
Will you just come home 
Or am I to drown in my pity 
Priests and saints will study me as an example of sin 
Priests and saints will study me as an example of sin 
It's damn miserable living life in a fucking lie 
But we chose our sides, but we chose our sides 
But we chose our sides, but we chose our sides 
Priests and saints will study me as an example of sin 
Study me
