If this gets me home then I'll be yours 
Last plane to leave, well, it's a backseat clause 
You never call since you found God 
I love you more 'cause it's a backseat clause I'm still running away with you 
I'm still running away with you You are the one that I have found 
A mystery that has come around 
All lonely souls must find a friend 
You are the means to a stop, start, end I'm still running away with you 
I'm still running away with you 
I'm still running away with you 
I'm still running away with you I'm still running away with you 
I'm still running away with you 
I'm still running away with you 
I'm still running away with you It's all the same 
It's all the same 
It's all the same
