Bird alone flying high 
Flying through a clouded sky 
Sending mournful soulful sounds 
Soaring over troubled grounds 
Bird alone with no mate 
Turning corners tempting fate 
Flying circles in the air 
Are you on your way somewhere 
Gliding soaring on the wind 
You're a sight of glory 
Flying way up there so high 
Wonder what's your story 
Bird alone flying low 
Over where the grasses grow 
Swingin' low then out of sight 
You'll be singing in the night
