Erase the facts 
The shit was flyin' outta the window 
I painted blue 
I paint the whole room When it's time to get in trouble 
We know just what to do The screen door swayin' 
Now baby, gimme something to live for 
I been a fool 
I been a fool No revelations in the water 
No tears into the booze In pains the floor 
The worried people shaking the whole house 
I I take it back 
I take it all back The regret that's got us sayin' 
The hound's upon the tracks And always in time 
I'm never looking over my shoulder 
I sing to you 
I sing it to you Keeping heads above the water and 
Feet into the shoes
