I wish I was your dog 'cause you treat him better 
You'd be proud to share me with 
Your mother, brother or your sister 
Give you hugs when you were sad 
Clean up my shit when I was bad 
I wish I was your dog 'cause you treat him better 
If you were me and I was you 
We would still have opposing views 
You would still lie and I would still cry 
If you were me and I was you 
La da de da, la da de da, la da de da, la da de da 
If we'd never met I'm willing to bet 
We'd both be better off being separate 
Not knowing my name, not placing the blame 
If we never met, I'm willing to bet 
La da de da, la da de da, la da de da, la da de da
