Love will always find the way 
Feelings are the hardest words to say 
Oh call me, call me 
Baby, always call your name I would never feel this way again 
Oh call me, call me 
There is love enough, enough for two 
There will never he another you How can you mend a broken heart 
Oh he said goodbye without a tear 
Through a million souls, a million fears 
That's no way to say goodbye [Chorus] 
Call me, call me 
Tell me what you feel 
My love never dies 
(My love never dies) 
Call me, call me 
Tell me what you feel 
You light up my life 
(You light up my life) 
Love don't ever die I'll he there if you want me 
I'm living with my memories 
Oh call me, call me 
From the bottom of your heart You Swore we'd never break apart 
Oh call me, call me 
Oh hold on tight and don't let go 
If you love me let me know I never had a love like ours 
Call me, call me 
Tell me what you feel 
My love never dies 
(My love never dies) Call me, call me 
Tell me what you feel 
You light up my life 
Oh I'm never gonna give you up Why did you break my lonely heart 
My world begins and ends with you 
If there's one thing that I know 
Babe, I'll never let you go If I sold my heart to you 
Call me, call me 
Tell me what you feel 
My love never dies Call me, call me 
Tell me what you feel 
You light up my life 
(You light up my life) [Repeat] Call me, call me 
Tell me what you feel 
My love never dies
