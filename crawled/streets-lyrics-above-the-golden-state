I lift my eyes to behold Your beauty 
And I can feel Your heavenly pull 
You meet my eyes, with Your love enfold me 
To rest upon, the gaze of my soul In front of me is the figure I long for 
And I will turn to see no one else 
But I'm consumed by Your grace and wonder 
I'm finding You as I lose myself 
I'm finding You as I lose I, I wanna gaze into Your eyes 
I wanna lose my soul in You, You 
When I stare into Your eyes 
I can see You looking back at me The definition of my faith is a wonder 
I'd rather look to You than know 
Lord, I believe and I feel You moving 
When I love with the love You've shown The distractions of this world have trapped me 
But I'm returning to the rest I've known 
As a bird flies away and wanders 
Returning to my heavenly home 
Returning to my heavenly I, I wanna gaze into Your eyes 
I wanna lose my soul in You, You 
When I stare into Your eyes 
I can see You looking back at me 
I can see You looking back at me I can see You looking back 
I, my eyes are on You 
I can see You looking 
I can see You looking back I, I wanna gaze into Your eyes 
I wanna lose my soul in You, You 
When I stare into Your eyes 
I can see You looking back 
When I stare into Your eyes 
I can see You looking back at me
