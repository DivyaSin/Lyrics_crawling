When the water won't draw 
When the water won't draw 
And the river runs dry 
And the river runs dry I been watching that crow 
I been watching that crow 
Wondering when he's gonna fly 
Wondering when he's gonna fly When the water won't draw 
When the water won't draw 
Little lover won't satisfy 
Little lover won't satisfy 
Little lover won't satisfy 
Little lover won't satisfy 
When the water won't draw 
And the river runs dry I went to market but I didn't come back 
Put my penny on the railroad track 
Train came creeping like a diamond-back 
Make me wanna holler like a mountain jack 
People can I get on... Little lover won't satisfy 
Little lover won't satisfy When the whistle gonna blow 
When the whistle gonna blow 
Tell me that my work is over 
Tell me that my work is done
