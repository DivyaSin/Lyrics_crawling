Calling out your name 
Heard a voice in the dark 
Temporary strenght 
Playing house in your heart So what, you hurt me 
Why did nobody change? 
Ritualising 
Memorising your face Love is the only reason left to live 
Hey-ay, yeah-ay, yeah-aaaay 
Love is the only lesson left to give 
Hey-ay, yeah-ay, youuuu How did I escape? 
Tunnel under the hate 
Part of me is gone 
Always crying on planes So what do I know? 
I can't say what I've seen 
Most people I know 
They will tell you the same Love is the only reason left to live 
Hey-ay, yeah-ay, yeah-aaaay 
Love is the only lesson left to give 
Hey-ay, yeah-ay, youuuu Love is the only reason left to live 
Hey-ay, yeah-ay, yeah-aaaay 
Love is the only lesson left to give 
Hey-ay, yeah-ay, youuuu
