I gotta let it out, Baby here's my confession 
My Hands are shakin' and it's close to obsession 
Poundin' in my chest been goin' 24/7 
You'd think the pain by now would make me learn my lesson [Bridge 1] 
But there's no way to win when I push you away 
Wanna do anything if you ask me to stay [Chorus] 
I'm so addicted, You're everything I want 
No complication, You know you had me from the jump 
I'm so addicted, Do what you wanna do 
I'm committed, Addicted to you It's cruel to call it love when it's lust and desire 
Feel like I can fly, then you cut down the wire 
Even though I know I'm sinkin' lower by the hour 
Can't change the fact that I'm a slave to your power [Bridge 2] [Chorus] You've given enough just to let me breathe 
You keep me alive just to watch me bleed 
I crawl down on my knees for you You've made damn sure that I won't forget 
You're loves a drug I could never quit 
All the things that you do, you do, you do [Bridge 1] [Chorus] I'm so addicted (I'm so addicted),you're everything I Need 
My Medication, You're the lie that I believe 
I'm so addicted, There's nothin' I can do (wanna do) 
I'm committed, Addicted to you Addicted, Committed, Addicted to you 
Addicted, Committed, Addicted to you 
Addicted, Committed, Addicted to you 
Addicted, Committed, Addicted to you
