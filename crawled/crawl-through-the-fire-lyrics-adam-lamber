get on the floor, souls to breathe 
get on the floor, souls to see fight the heat 
crawl to me fire, fire erupts 
fire, fire blowing up 
get on the floor, on your knees 
get on the floor, til they bleed crawl through the fire 
rescue and inspire 
crawl, make it through 
saving me, saving you i cant find you 
in the smoke 
the night is burning 
as we choke 
fire, fire erupts 
fire, fire blowing up 
get on the floor, on your knees 
get on the floor, til they bleed fight the heat
