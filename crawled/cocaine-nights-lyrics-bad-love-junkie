Cocaine nights 
Cocaine nights 
Under the neon lights 
Dreams turned to dust by a thin white line 
Cocaine eyes 
Cocaine lies 
She never cries 
But she never smiles anymore Just another small town daughter 
Out in L A with no script 
Wound up selling flowers and blow jobs 
To fund a fix 
As she waits on a lonely corner 
For the shadow man 
She can hear her mama crying 
As she breaks her heart again Cocaine nights 
Cocaine nights 
Under the neon lights 
Dreams turned to dust by a thin white line Salvation is a fairy tale 
When you sin just to stay alive 
But she finds hope in a heavenly glow 
Via rodeo drive Cocaine nights 
Cocaine nights 
Under the neon lights 
Dreams turned to dust by a thin white line Cocaine eyes 
Cocaine lies 
She never cries 
But she never smiles anymore
