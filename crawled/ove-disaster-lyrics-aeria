he said that i'm the only one locked inside his head. the sweetness of his kisses on me - are hers instead. end this false illusion, cause now i see he's changed. cause his cold love runs straight through the heart. is this the way it used to be? a love disaster? or is this the way it's meant to be? a love disaster. you're not the man to cherish her, so why does she stay? you'd just walk right out on her love....run away. and your cold love runs straight through the heart.
