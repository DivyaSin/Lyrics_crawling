Ray, as of today 
I can't say things will ever be the same 
And that could be a shame 
'Cause though I think I know 
Another lonely exile when I see one 
And you appear to be one 
Still 
I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found 
If you've got it to spare 
I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel 
'Cause I ought to be there 
And Ray, what can I say 
You don't know me and it's just wishful thinking 
To keep myself from sinking 
And hence, no evidence 
To support any theory I have handy 
That you could understand me 
And so 
I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found If you've got it to spare 
I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel 
'Cause I ought to be there 
('Cause you're as bad off as me) 
And Ray, can we repay 
Ourselves for days that we've 
lost through indecision 
With one of recognition 
If so, then here I go 
'Cause some things you know 
And some you just believe in 
And hope it comes out even 
I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found 
If you've got it to spare 
I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel 
'Cause I ought to be there 
I ought to be there 
I ought to be there
