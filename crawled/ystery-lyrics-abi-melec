The night is coming 
I don't want the simple things 
You are my mystery 
All this can't end tonight 
We're gonna leave the past behind The night is so dark 
But I can still see you 
I don't wanna lose you again 
Take my hand 
And make a night to remember The night is coming 
And you still here with me 
This could be forever 
All this can't end tonight 
We're gonna leave the past behind The night is so dark 
But I can still see you 
I don't wanna lose you again 
Take my hand 
And make a night to remember
