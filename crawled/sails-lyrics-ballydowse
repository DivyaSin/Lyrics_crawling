Like pirates off your shores of waste 
our kiss you can forget 
a newborn sense of smell and taste 
for things you've never met 
our nose no longer knows the heel of 
give it more and give it faster 
our pleasures still retain their feel for honor is their master 
three winds fill the sails of my sisters and my brothers 
grace from beyond, scorn from behind, 
and love for each other God of all gods father of each holy one 
God of all gods father of each lowly one 
God of all gods like a mother to the orphaned ones 
God of all gods wholly other to the broken half of me dim memory brings the shade of lesser days around me 
back before the waking, the time of my founding 
dark was the heart with but its own desires 
when a god will not be tamed, man will serve a liar 
from the shores i saw the sails of my 
sisters and my brothers 
left hehind the old life, born into another eighteen years upon these waves storm, salt, and pounding 
i wouldn't trade a minute of the seeing or the doubting 
alive i am in the teeth of faith, few answers i have found 
but the call that brings me back to life, to it i am bound 
three winds fill the sails of my sisters and my brothers 
grace from beyond, scorn from behind, 
and love for each other
