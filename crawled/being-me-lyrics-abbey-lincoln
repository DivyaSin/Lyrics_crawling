All along the way there were things to do 
Always some other someone I could be 
Other things to know, other ways to go 
To fly a spirit for the play to show 
It wasn't always easy learning to be me 
Sometimes my hitting hard would disagree 
Times I walked away other times I stay 
To see the glamour of my life the play 
Being me I dared to be myself alone 
Sometimes I love the things they said 
Some things were cold as stone it was lonely 
Sometimes, sometimes it was mood-felt lights were brilliant 
Sometimes, sometimes there was you being me, I laugh 
So many things have changed and yet somehow 
There were always be a stage, a song for me 
Hold the curtain open, It's time to take a bow Being me I laugh seeing now and then 
So many things have changed and get some out 
There will always be a stage, a song for me 
Hold the curtain open, It's time to take a bow
