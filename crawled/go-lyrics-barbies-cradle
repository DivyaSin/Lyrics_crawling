Go 
Love her with all your heart 
Go 
Leave me where I am Cause I'll be fine 
I'll take care of my self 
I will keep 
everything we shared Go 
To a higher plane 
Go 
Don't worry I'll stay sane The day we end 
The waiting starts 
But it's patient waiting 
waiting It's good 
It's good for the heart 
Food for the soul Go 
You can always return 
Go 
No bridges will be burned Cause I'm a friend 
As much as a lover 
This doesn't know an ending 
We'll keep each other in the heart 
and reunite our souls
