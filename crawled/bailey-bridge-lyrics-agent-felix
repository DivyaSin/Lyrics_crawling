i wrote this song 
for my now ex-girlfriend 
but she hadn't heard it yet 
so i changed all the words 
so that she'll never know what it said 
all those witty lines about her 
thrown away and gone 
but i'll still think about her 
everytime I sing this song the place we used to go 
when we wanted to be alone 
under bailey bridge 
but now its falling down and i'm still here 
holding on to this telephone for 45 minutes 
but you hung up a half an hour ago 
and that stupid busy signal 
is ringing in my head 
till a voice came over 
and it said please hang up the phone 
and try your call again 
maybe thats my sign 
to give it one last try do you remember 
when we were all about eachother 
walking hand in hand 
surrounded by a heart 
our names written in the sand 
and the sky that night was 
almost as beautiful as you but those days have come and gone 
and maybe we were wrong 
but its past and I won't dwell 
i'll take someone else
