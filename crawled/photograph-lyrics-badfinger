Well she's a brown-eyed lady and I couldn't give her an answer 
She took all I give her and all she ever wanted is more 
And I'd have to admit that I'm not just a born romancer 
Who'll taking it easy, feel like I did before [Chorus] 
Mean, mean Jemima 
Won't you come back, won't you come back home? 
Mean, mean Jemima 
Won't you come back, won't you come back home? I'm sitting here thinking of nothing but matches and candles 
She took all I give her and all she ever wanted is more 
And I'd have to admit she was too much for me to handle 
Who'll taking it easy, I'm feeling like I did before [Chorus] She's a brown-eyed lady and I couldn't give her an answer 
She took all I give her and all she ever wanted is more [Chorus] Won't you come back home? (come back) 
Won't you come back? (won't you come back?) 
Won't you come back home? (won't you come back?) 
Won't you come back? (come back) 
Won't you come back home? (come back) 
Won't you come on back? (come back) 
Won't you come back home? (Won't you come back?) 
Won't you come back? (Won't you come back?) 
Won't you come back home? (Won't you come back?).
