My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine softer than a sigh 
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean wider than the sky 
My love is brighter than the brightest star that shines every night above 
And there is nothing in this world that could ever change my love Something happened to my heart the day that I met you 
Something that I never felt before 
You are always on my mind no matter what I do 
And every day it seems I want you more 
My love is warmer Once I thought that love was meant for anyone else but me 
Once I thought you'd never come my way 
Now it only goes to show how wrong we all can be 
For now I have to tell you every day 
My love is warmer
