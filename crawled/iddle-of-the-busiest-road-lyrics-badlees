Dreamed a misfit came a calling 
Days at a time 
A malcontent from the look alike ball 
And she was mine 
She said, "take all preconceptions, 
Tie 'em if you have to with a bow 
Leave 'em proud and prominent 
In the middle of the busiest road" A stripper picked me up one night 
Down at the "hideaway jewel" 
She just wanted breakfast talk, 
She was working her way through school 
Talked about her boyfriend 
And her second full semester overload 
She said, "some days I feel like I've 
Been thrown in to the middle 
Of the busiest road" And I'm riding, only riding 
A wreck out on the interstate 
And I got out to look 
Flares, blood and cassette tapes, 
Broken glass by a trivia book 
Trooper said she never felt a thing 
As far as real trauma goes 
Two strangers hold a requiem in the middle 
Of the busiest road And I'm riding, only riding, yeah I'm riding 
I'm gonna start a talk show 
On a local am station 
One in danger of going dark 
And I'll pay 'em compensation 
Five thousand watts of power freeing 
Tales of happenstance untold 
Eventually I'll be toll free to 
The dwellers of the busiest road
