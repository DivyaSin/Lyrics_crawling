Looking 'round all I see, 
A painful world of agony, 
People suffer endlessly, 
All because of me! I'm the reason for their pain, 
I'm their one and only bane, 
Those I hold wish to be slain, 
They bow to my fearful reign! Onwards I am to ever roll, 
I'm the one who's in control, 
I am to consume their whole, 
Their live from them I stole! Taking them to their destiny, 
Their lives are wrapped up in me, 
My ears deaf to any plea, 
From me they cannot flee!
