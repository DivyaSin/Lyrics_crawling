Oh Oh Oh Everyone looking for something 
Anything they can believe in 
Without searching in their hearts oh Everyone wanna be loved by all 
before they catch you in the fall 
For they shelter you from the rain oh All the People 
Everyone with soul (?) 
Reach out to someone it's cold and lonely 
Cold and Lonely Oh oh All the people 
Everyone with soul (?) 
Reach out to someone it's cold and lonely 
Cold and Lonely Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
