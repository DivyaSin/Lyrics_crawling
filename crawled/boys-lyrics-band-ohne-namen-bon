Hey girls, have you ever thought about 
About all of those little doubts 
That keep comin' up in a boy's mind 
When you just smile, Cause baby, how should he know what you really feel 
If that look was fake or real, 
Or if he's the 5th or 6th guy 
To whom you smile Baby, think about the way that you treat a boy, 
Cause you shouldn't treat him like a toy, 
If you would like him to spend the night, 
Then baby, go and tell him right Refrain: 
Boys - 'cause now I'm talking about 
Boys - 'cause you don't know about 
Boys - with your love we are happy 
Boys - oh, I like being one of them 
Boys - cause now I'm talking about 
Boys - oh, the hyped up and psyched up 
Boys - always thinking about lovely. 
Boys And now I'm thinking that the time is right for a hot night, 
To make you hold me tight and make you feel right. 
And if there's something that you want that I got, 
You can have it all night, non-stop. I wanna treat you right and take you higher and higher, 
I wanna hold you tight and make you hot like fire, 
I wanna stay all night, I wanna quench your desire, 
Some I forgot? I think not! But girl now, hey, how should I know what you'd say 
If I'd ask you to play for a night and a day, 
Now would you say, hey babe, I'd like you to stay, 
Or would you say, no, no, no, no way. Girls, if you want us to stay, you gotta say so, 
And if you want us to leave, you gotta say no, 
Now, Is it friendship or the real deal? 
Girls, tell us what you want, what you need, what you feel! Refrain Hey girls, if you like a boy, then you know 
That it's alright to make a show 
You can play a little hard to get 
Just to make him sweat But baby, if you keep him waiting too long, 
Then one day, he might be gone, 
So just tell him what is right 
And what you like Baby, think about the way that you treat a boy, 
Cause you shouldn't treat him like a toy, 
If you would like him to spend the night, 
Then baby, go and tell him right Refrain
