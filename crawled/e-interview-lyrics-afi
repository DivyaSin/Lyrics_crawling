Forever waiting for disaster 
What David calls servant and master 
Will you play it too? As this displacement begs for water 
Swimming, bathing 
Drowning in sorrow Scream with me 
I crawl across this cracked expansion 
I'll be buried soon 
Beneath the sand with pure intentions 
Wanting something, someone to follow For a change I?ll refrain from hiding all of me from you 
(Here's my lullaby) 
Pray for rain, lose your name 
And watch all your dreams fall through 
(Hush now don't you cry) I swoon, upon my knees come crashing 
Will you bury me? 
Today, this small favor I am asking 
Hold me, you may drop me tomorrow For a change I?ll refrain from hiding all of me from you 
(Here's my lullaby) 
Pray for rain, lose your name 
And watch all your dreams fall through 
(Hush now don't you cry) For a change I?ll refrain from hiding all of me from you 
Pray for rain, lose your name 
And watch all your dreams fall through Here's my lullaby 
Hush now don't you cry Come down 
Come down cold with us 
With me I flee to Decemberunderground 
As you exhale I breathe in 
And sink into the water underground 
And I grow pale without you
