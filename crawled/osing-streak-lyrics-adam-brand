That tin pot town went and spat me out 
Onto that Eastern track 
My dad he gave me a month or two 
Before the city spat me back A flat bed truck picked me up 
And I crossed that great divide 
I had 3 good days 'til I spent my pay 
Now I'm on a downward slide Oh I'm on a losing streak 
Down a paddle I'm up the creek 
Mercy be, I'm on a losing streak The city don't place any worth 
On a small town rouse about 
I've never seen so many folks 
But so few who'll help you out
