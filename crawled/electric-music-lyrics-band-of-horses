Listen to the motor 
Getting round as we go 
One way or another 
Gonna make it back home Mountains to the water 
She was up to scenery 
Fug it on the other 
All it blind us on beans This it what it does 
Travel on the open road Get you on the double 
Make you right away 
This is what it loves 
To travel in the open road Now she's talking dirty I keep and read a bury have seen 
You don't have to worry, a secret been all me 
Keeping things in ocean baby keep on running from me 
Hysteric come to radio I'm picking up this beat Dear me old mama 
That don't mean for you to weed 
Back to you tomorrow 
Not don't you lose sleeve 
This is what it does travel in the open road 
Oho He's not thirty my visions keeping blurry to me 
Keep it in a hurry but the police are following me 
Keep it in..come and visit and free me 
I ain't..on the inner state Nashville in the sea He he, 
He he, 
He he eh 
Uhhh 
Keep the things in, and roll it for me 
Come to radio I'm pickin up the speed He he, he he, he he, he he
