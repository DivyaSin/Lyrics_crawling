Be merciful to me, O God 
For I am under attack 
My enemies slander me 
All day long 
In their pride theyre bringing me down 
All day long When I am afraid Ill trust in you 
In you, whose word I praise 
In you I trust; what could man do to me?I will not be afraid My enemies are plotting against me 
Eager to take my life 
They devise their schemes and mark my steps 
All day long 
They twist my words to bring me hurt 
All day long For you have delivered me from death 
And set my feet on solid ground 
So that I could walk before youIn your light
