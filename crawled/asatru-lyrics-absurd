We descended from beyond the stars 
When the birthing chases the forbidden rune 
We are rising from within 
Secret quarters 
We can finally enter the room of the disciplined 
We enlighten the biggest star to reach beyond the technische world 
We are taking the light to the able again 
And again to set you free 
Into the lands of Aldebaran 
Let the fighting entail 
We are serving the inside 
Of the craft below 
The eternal reign (train?) 
We are reaching the blood rune 
Of might! 
We conquered the ancients 
that are long gone 
What we politische created 
And why is no other fair of blood 
So beautiful and proud 
Bless the Gods! 
So greet the power 
Sacred blood 
We created these lines of length 
Power wind and werwolf 
We are your servants - your strength! 
When the will of my right hand war 
Crowned the east to gain the world 
Out of blood and glory and the sight of the sun 
Pagans I promise your world last eternally!
