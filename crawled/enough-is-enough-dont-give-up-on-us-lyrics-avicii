Feel like Ive been waiting so long for tonight; 
Cause I just cant get you out of my mind. 
Can you feel my heart beating so fast? 
Now youre hereno, theres no turning back. Oh, I think Im fallingcant hold on no more. 
Enough is enough, enough is enoughjust gotta let go. 
And as my grip unwinds, I feel your hand in mine. 
No, I never felt, never felt like this before. Come on babe, dont give up on us. 
Choose me and Ill show you love, 
Let me show you love, 
Let me show you love, 
Let me show you love. If you cry, Ill be there at your side; 
If you lost, Ill be there shining my light. 
Cause every touch lifts me up to the stars, 
Cause nothing could ever keep us apart. Oh, I think Im fallingcant hold on no more. 
Enough is enough, enough is enoughjust gotta let go. 
And as my grip unwinds, I feel your hand in mine. 
No, I never felt, never felt like this before. Come on babe, dont give up on us. 
Choose me and Ill show you love, 
Let me show you love, 
Let me show you love, 
Let me show you love.
