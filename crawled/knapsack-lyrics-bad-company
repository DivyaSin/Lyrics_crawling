I love to go a-wandering 
Along a mountain track 
And as I go, I love to sing 
With my knapsack on my back Val-de-ri, val-de-ra 
Val-de-ri, val-de-ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Val-de-ri, val-de-ra 
My knapsack on my back I love to go a-wandering 
Along a mountain track 
And as I go, I love to sing 
With my knapsack on my back Val-de-ri, val-de-ra 
Val-de-ri, val-de-ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Val-de-ri, val-de-ra 
With my knapsack on my back
