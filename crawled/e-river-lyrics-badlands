Just a young man in an old steel town 
I'm getting older now, it's time to look around 
My brother John loves his needle & spoon 
A cigarette hangs from his lip 
Everyone round thinks he's so bad 
He's really not that cool, no And I know the reasons why 
Deep inside he's not alive 
He was born by a river 
You know he'll die by the river now 
Cause deep inside my river's run dry So many times did mother swallow her pride 
Just to keep my old man's dreams alive 
And I know, and I know someday we're gonna move on outta here 
She says "Jesus, Lord, don't give me no bad thoughts and bury me here." And I know the reasons why, and I know the reasons why 
She was born by a river 
Her blood flows through the river now 
And deep inside my river's run dry 
She was born by a river 
Her blood flows through the river now 
Cause deep inside my river's run dry Oh, take hold my hand and pray 
Someday baby we're gonna find a way 
Oh, oh I know the reasons why 
Cause deep inside she lost her life 
Yeah, yeah, yeah She was born by a river 
Her blood flows through the river now 
Deep inside the river's run dry 
She was born by a river 
You know, we'll die by the river now 
Cause deep inside my river's run dry 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 
Ooh, yeah We're born by the river now 
You know, she'll die by the river now 
Yeah, yeah, huummm
