Sitting on the front porch 
Rain is pouring down 
News comes on the radio 
There's trouble all around That's the way it always been 
And the way it'll always be 
I thank the good Lord I've got you 
In times like these The rich keep getting richer 
The poor barely get by 
Farmer Johnson says it's either 
Too wet or too dry Jobs are scarce down at the factory 
I thank the good Lord I've got you 
In times like these In times like these 
When it's easy to get down 
You're my inspiration 
You're my solid ground In times like these 
Love will pull us through 
Baby, I know I can depend on you We can read about the latest 
In the fashion magazines 
But that don't change the fact 
That we got patches on our jeans Everybody's needing money 
Even the preachers preaching on TV 
I thank the good Lord I've got you 
In times like these In times like these 
When it's easy to get down 
You're my inspiration 
You're my solid ground In times like these 
Love will pull us through 
Baby, I know I can depend on you It costs you forty-five cents 
For a nickel candy bar 
And a dollar's worth of gas 
Won't even start your car Yeah, we got problems 
Here in the land of free 
But there's no place I'd rather be In times like these 
I thank the good Lord I've got you In times like these 
In times like these, baby 
(Baby) 
In times like these 
In times like these
