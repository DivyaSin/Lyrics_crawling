I know I could have you 
But only if you want me to 
You planted the seed in my mind 
It's growin' up big and strong in no time You really got it goin' on 
Sittin' in your bedroom 
Watchin the hair fallin' over your face. 
Baby you put my heart back in its place! And I'll tell you what, I'm ready now! 
You're doin' something for me do I do it for you~ Do you know what you want? 
Do you know what you want? 
Do you know what you want? 
'Cause baby I want you, yeah, I want you! We really started something here 
You're looking at me I'm looking at you 
And neither of us know what to do It's outta control, it's outta reach 
It's a mystery, its a crime 
Try to figure it out 
Is it love? 
I don't know, is it? But I'll tell you what I'm ready now
