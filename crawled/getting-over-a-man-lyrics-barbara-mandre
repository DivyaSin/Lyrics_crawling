(Morgan Ames - Clydene Jackson) I'm only human 
You look so good to me 
I want to love you 
But I'm not sure I can 
I'm gettin' over a man 
I'm bein' careful 
Just goin' easy 
And putting my life in to order 
I'm makin' new plans 
I'm gettin' over a man Don't bring me no flowers 
Don't call me back in an hour 
I'm not home 
I'm not ready for somebody new 
Not even you 
It's a little too soon 
I'm gettin' over a man You're so good lookin' 
You're really temptin' me 
It's been too long since somebody gave a damn 
Since I wanted a man 
I'm gettin' nervous 
I see you comin' 
And I ought to get up and grab you 
But please understand 
I'm gettin' over a man
