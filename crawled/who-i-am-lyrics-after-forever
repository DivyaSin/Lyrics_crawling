You hypnotize me 
I do not dare to look 
You mesmerize me 
Don't even dare to feel I want to have it just to prove, I can take control 
I want to have it just to show them, I won't be fooled 
I'll take it, I'll break it or force it just to let them know 
Who I am, who I am I should wait and think it over 
I don't want to push, that is not 
Who I am, who I am I'll softly touch this 
I'll fire up this flame 
I'll hold on gently 
It's time to lead the game I want to have it just to prove, I can take control 
I want to have it just to show them, I won't be fooled 
I'll take it, I'll break it or force it just to let them know 
Who I am, who I am I should wait and think it over 
I don't want to push, that's not 
Who I am, who I am I want to have it, I want to break it 
And take it, or force it just to let them know 
Who I am, who I am I should wait and think it over 
I don't want to push, oh, no, that's not 
Who I am, who I am
