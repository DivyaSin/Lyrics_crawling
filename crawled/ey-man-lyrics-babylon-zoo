Are we shadowboxing in the rain 
My girlfriend and me were sittin' on the pavement 
Oh my make-up's running down the drain 
I heard the news, i think it's big enough for two 
Angel, can you tell, i'd like to get to know you well *repeat All her friends are fake, hey that's no polution 
Are we verging on insanity, have you heard today 
Everybody's got a solution, I'm just shadowboxing in the rain

Angel, can you tell, I think I'd like to get to know you well All our friends are going insane, but there's no need to throw it away 
Don't throw it away
