Do you still say your prayers little darlin' 
Do you go to bed at night 
Prayin' that tomorrow, everything will be alright 
But tomorrow's fall in number 
In number one by one 
You wake up and you're dying 
You don't even know what from Well they shot you point blank 
You been shot in the back 
Baby point blank you been fooled this time 
Little girl that's a fact 
Right between the eyes, baby, point blank 
Right between the pretty lies that they tell 
Little girl you fell You grew up where young girls they grow up fast 
You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked 
But what they asked baby wasn't right 
You didn't have to live that life 
I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet 
These days you don't wait on Romeos 
You wait on that welfare check 
And on all the pretty things that you can't ever have 
And on all the promises That always end up point blank 
Shot between the eyes 
Oh, point blank 
Like little white lies you tell to ease the pain 
You're walkin' in the sights, girl of point blank 
And it's one false move and baby the lights go out Once I dreamed we were together again 
Baby you and me 
Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be 
We were standin' at the bar 
It was hard to hear 
The band was playin' loud and you were shoutin' somethin' in my ear 
You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four 
You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor 
You just stood there and held me, then you started dancin' slow 
And as I pulled you tighter I swore I'd never let you go Well I saw you last night down on the avenue 
Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you 
You were standin' in the doorway out of the rain 
You didn't answer when I called out your name 
You just turned, and then you looked away 
Like just another stranger waitin' to get blown away Point blank 
Right between the eyes 
Oh, point blank 
Right between the pretty lies you fell 
Point blank 
Shot straight through the heart Yeah point blank 
You've been twisted up 'til you've become just another part of it 
Point blank, you're walkin' in the sights 
Point blank 
Livin' one false move just one false move away 
Point blank 
They caught you in their sights 
Point blank 
Did you forget how to love 
Girl, did you forget how to fight 
Point blank 
They must have shot you in the head 
'Cause point blank 
Bang bang baby you're dead
