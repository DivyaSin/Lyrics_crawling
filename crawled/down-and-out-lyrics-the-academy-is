Out of the box, out of the kitchen. 
Out of the world she's grown so fearful of. 
I don't ever want to see you again. 
I don't ever want to see you again, my friend. 
This is the end. 
Out of the house, she grabs the keys, runs for the hills and doesn't leave a letter. 
That way the impact will be much better. 
Away from the man that she's grown so fearful of. 
I don't ever want to see you again. Why, oh why do you wear sunglasses in the home when the sun went out about an hour ago? 
Life should not be that way. Always up or down, never down and out. 
You dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak. 
Speak now or forever hold your peace in pieces. Now that I'm grown I've seen marriages fall to pieces. 
Now that I'm grown I've seen friendships fall to pieces. 
Weekend warriors, and our best friends. 
The writers weren't kidding about how all good things must end. 
Then again some things are far too good to go ahead and let go. Always up or down, never down and out. 
You dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak. 
Speak now or forever hold your peace. We won't forget Tony or Johnny. 
No matter how they miss us they still wish us the best on the road. 
Garrett took a plane to Paris, France. 
Now he's cooking up entrees for the pretty, pretty French girls. 
Bookends, Blue and Clarity, to The Wall and Grace. 
Darkside, Wish and a toast to the late Figure 8. Weekend warriors and our best friends. 
The writers weren't kidding about the good things will live in our hearts. Always up or down, never down and out. 
You dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak. 
Speak now or forever hold your peace in pieces.
