You say you dont believe in signs from up above 
And you laugh at the thought of putting your faith in stuff like love 
You never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain, you say 
You wanna believe but its just not worth the pain today But thats all fine if thats how you want it to be 
But if youre feeling alone and afraid and you cant breathe Believe in me, yeah 
Believe in me, yeah Believe in the way I look at you and stand beside you 
The way I speak the truth, Id never lie to you 
If youd just believe in the things that your eyes cant see 
Believe in me You come and you go and theres never no compromise, thats why 
The seconds and the minutes of your life go crawling by But thats all fine if thats how you want it to be 
But if youre feeling alone and afraid and you cant breathe Believe in me, yeah 
Believe in the way I look at you and stand beside you 
The way I speak the truth, Id never lie to you 
If youd just believe in the things that your eyes cant see 
Believe in me What ya gonna do when your ship is sinking? 
And youre crying out for help and just the seagulls listening 
In the dark of the night, in the middle of the fight 
When youre reaching out for something and theres nothing Believe in me, yeah 
Believe in the way I look at you and stand beside you 
The way I speak the truth, Id never lie to you 
If youd just believe in the things that your eyes cant see 
Believe in me
