I'd fly away from this place if I could lift all the weight, 
Tied tightly to these lazy limbs that you've been dragging slowly. 
I'd drift off through empty space, get lost inside of my brain, 
And wish away the list of things in life that you could erase. 
And if my mind would allow, I would remember how The sun only shines, half of the time, yes 
The sun only shines, half of the time, it's true. Right now I'd much rather sink and let the Earth's gravity, 
Pull everything you've ever known down with you through the floor. 
And from the floor through the pipes beneath my house, 
through the ground, 
Where you will be submerged in dirt and swallowed whole by the Earth. 
And I will dance with the roots, and they'd remind me how The sun only shines half of the time, yes 
The sun only shines half of the time, its true... its true.. The sun only shines half of the time, yes  The sun only shines, da da da da da da 
Half of the time, da da da da da 
The sun only shines, da da da da da da 
Half of the time, da da da da da da.
