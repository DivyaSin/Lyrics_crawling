Weird-lookin' people, they seem all right 
Nobody's drivin' tonight

Somebody tell me why, maybe tonight (Maybe tonight)

A picture disc, I think it fits 
Eight days a week, twenty-five hours a day 
We're Stereo Superstar (Superstars) Eight days a week, twenty-five hours a day 
We're Stereo Superstar (Superstars) 
Beautiful people, the seemed all right 
Nobody's drivin tonight 
Beautiful people (Beautiful people) 
All I wanted was their photograph 
A picture disc, one that fits 
Eight days a week, twenty-five hours a day 
We're Stereo Superstar (Superstars) Eight days a week, twenty-five hours a day
