Jessica suicide takes me for a ride 
I'm just a crazy one-armed man 
Strange world, dead girl 
Die each day or so you say it 
How much death can one man stand? 
How much death can one man stand? I might broadcast your dull eyes 
Breathless like you, I'm despised 
And understand I just can't 
Help but stand up to the old lies 
This time she'll do it 
Too late my bus is leaving 
But I don't care what you have planned 
I don't care what you have planned Jessica suicide, never even tried 
But I gave in to her demands 
Death threats, regrets 
Go ahead I heard all you've said 
Cause bitter always becomes bland 
Cause bitter always becomes bland 
Cause bitter always becomes bland 
Cause bitter always becomes bland 
So scared to characterize 
I've always known your cold eyes 
And now I fully realize 
I just can't take this deadly surprise 
This time she'll do it 
Too late my bus is leaving 
I don't care what she has planned 
I don't care what she has planned 
Running on: 
I don't care what you have planned for me
