Baby, I'm holding on dear 
This heart, it is a waxwork of echoes 
Warm my heart, set my hands on fire 
Hair on fire, dress on fire 
Oh I'm an angel, an angel on fire 
And I'm burning to escape the cold (Instrumental) Haunted, I'm swimming in the Dead Sea 
Try as I may to shine in the darkness 
Warm my heart, set my hands on fire 
Hair on fire, dress on fire 
Ooh I'm an angel, an angel on fire 
And I'm burning to escape the cold 
To escape the cold. (Instrumental)
