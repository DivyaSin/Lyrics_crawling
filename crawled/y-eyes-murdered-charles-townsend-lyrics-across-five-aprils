I don't look that familiar. 
No, I don't know you from anywhere. 
Would you care to just be straight with me? 
You just met me for the first time and that's fine. 
Why are you so afraid to speak your mind? 
Instead you speak the mind of everyone else. 
Just think what you could have said. 
If you had only thought for yourself. 
To bad you were force-fed feelings. 
And now you've blocked your own mind out of your head. 
If you ever want to think on your own, it's ok. 
Go ahead. 
Open hands that know not what to hold on to. 
Closed minds that hold off on what they know is true.
