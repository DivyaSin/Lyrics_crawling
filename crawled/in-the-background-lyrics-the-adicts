It's peaceful here 
No one to interfere 
With quiet observations 
Just watching and waiting 
And not getting involved 
With physical solutions 
That never get 
The problem solved 
In the background 
Out of the limelight 
Don't use a search light 
It's out of order 
Not being a part 
Of the scenic route 
An impartial art 
Of avoiding dispute
