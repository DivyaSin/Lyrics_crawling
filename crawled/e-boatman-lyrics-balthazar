Well it was yoyo, I suppose, 
I play like fashion comes and goes. 
I can't set my mind on you.

that they were just some kind of cover 
for the nights we used to share. 
I've seen this water a lot before, 
still I cross it once more. I shook the hand of the boatman 
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt 
the bridges I burnt 
the bridges I burnt by now I shook the hand of the boatman 
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt 
the bridges I burnt 
the bridges I burnt by now There are taking bets, 
living all around our bed, 
for I can't see my thoughts on you. 
And I reduced them to a scratch. 
You know, just some pre-fucked-up match 
for the nights we used to share. 
But I don't believe I care. I shook the hand of the boatman 
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt 
the bridges I burnt 
the bridges I burnt by now I shook the hand of the boatman 
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt 
the bridges I burnt 
the bridges I burnt by now I shook the hand of the boatman 
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt I shook the hand of the boatman 
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt
