I got some blood under my nails, I got some mud on my face 
My voice is shot I'm going grey, these muscles all ache Don't cry for me, I'm the life of the party 
I'm smiling most of the time 
I may be gritting my teeth, can't get back where we started 
These days I'm doing just fine God bless this mess, this mess is mine 
Won't pound my chest or criticize 
I must confess, I've lived, I've died 
God bless this mess, this mess is mine 
God bless this mess, this mess is mine I knew every buried body paid for each head stone 
I may have led the prayers in public but I cried alone Found God through sin but this ain't my confession 
I'll wait on judgement day 
It's lose or win, got no need for protection 
Stand up or out of my way God bless this mess, this mess is mine 
Won't pound my chest or criticize 
I must confess, I've lived, I've died 
God bless this mess, this mess is mine 
God bless this mess, this mess is mine The howling doom day dogs are snapping 
At your feet round here the 
Sky is cracked but won't 
Admit defeat 
And well it got your back and stood it 
At your side this treasure 
Chest of rags still keeps this 
Dream alive God bless this mess, this mess is mine 
Won't pound my chest or criticize 
I must confess, I've lived, I've died 
God bless this mess, this mess is mine 
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
