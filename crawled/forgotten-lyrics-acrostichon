"I am clean forgotten 
as a dead man out of mind 
I am become like a broken vessel for I have heard 
the blasphemy of the multitude 
ans fear is on every side 
while they conspire against me" drowning in a sea 
a sea of twisted shapes 
escaping from reality 
not knowing how to behave I find myself in the last fase 
prepare for neverending days 
beyond consious life 
I feel myself die
