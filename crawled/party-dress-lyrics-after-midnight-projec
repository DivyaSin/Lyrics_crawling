When misery dreams 
The city doesnt sleep 
She craves the perfect life. 
There is a party in a hearse 
And everybodys been dying 
To get in. Misery cant feel. 
Misery cries all day long. When you close your eyes 
Youll be good 
Dont cry 
You brought this on yourself 
Youre losing control 
Youve made a mess 
Take off your party dress. When misery cries 
The whole city lies 
Asleep on answered prayers 
Misery runs through the streets 
Like a ghost 
She hopes that shell infect. Misery cant sleep. 
Misery screams all night long. When you close your eyes 
Youll be good 
Dont cry 
You brought this on yourself 
Youre losing control 
Youve made a mess 
Take off your party dress. Misery cant feel 
Misery cries all day long. When you close your eyes 
Youll be good 
Dont cry 
You brought this on yourself 
Youre losing control 
Youve made a mess 
Take off your party dress. When you close your eyes 
Youll be good 
Dont cry 
You brought this on yourself 
Youre losing control 
Youve made a mess 
Take off your party dress. 
Party dress.
