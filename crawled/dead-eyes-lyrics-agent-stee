To execute, you made no compromise, men aren't pigs 
(Slaughtered) 
Infected with a plague or rendered with a scalpel by you 
You make the claim, it was just a job 
And killing's nothing more than sawing logs 
Wash your hands but blood leaves stains You don't deny, you say you've a creative side 
The passion born to an inquisitive mind 
Entered men alive and destroyed them from inside, it's true 
Extracted organs slowly one by one 
Your only goal to see the damage done (You) 
You slid the razor 
(You) 
The anti savior 
(You) 
The crucifier 
Babies bathed in fire No light shines from dead eyes 
It's odd how they match your own 
No justice for the murdered 
Shoveled lives like lumps of coal 
Your victims fed the furnace 
In the blackened pit that was your soul 
Soulless and dead eyed At the core you gained a thrill from the sickening stench 
The smell of terror as they 
(Marched to their death) 
Carry out your orders like a patriotic soldier and maim 
Rape and decapitate, my only wish is that you'd face their fate (You) 
You led the slaughter 
Mother, son and daughter 
(You) 
You drove the masses 
Bodies scorched to ashes No light shines from dead eyes 
It's odd how they match your own 
No justice for the murdered 
Shoveled lives like lumps of coal 
Your victims fed the furnace 
In the blackened pit that was your soul 
So soulless and dead eyed No light shines from dead eyes 
It's odd how they match your own 
So soulless and dead eyed
