CHORUS 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
Don't let the good times fade way. 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
'Cause you might need this heart one day. Oh what an ordinary day, when I learned that love's a liar, 
When you left, my heart unfold, and the wind blows cold. 
Was it love or borrowed time or just a game or in between? 
How can love that was so strong, how can this love go wrong? CHORUS 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
Don't let the good times fade way. 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
'Cause you're I need this time away. CHORUS 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
Don't let the good times fade way. 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
'Cause you might need this heart one day. You are the air I need to breathe. Every night and every day. 
And when you're not by my side, it feels like I'm gonna die. CHORUS 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
Don't let the good times fade way. 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
Cause you might need this heart one day. CHORUS 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
Don't let the good times fade way. 
Don't break the heart that loves you, 
Cause you might need this heart one day.
