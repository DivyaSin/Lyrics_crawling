All of these grateful looks 
All these grateful eyes 
All the furious stares these fretful sighs Promising everything 
To everyone 
We'll be back soon 
You're my favorite one And I'll keep it quiet 
I'll hold you dear 
The whispering fills the ear 
Tell me you'll stay 
We would have such fun 
And the lie, you don't need anyone And the screams, the wails, and the call 
The headiness of the fall 
Ten-thousand miles from where we began 
Falling asleep with a picture in hand 
It was all for a woman You say that you're grateful for the time alone 
Two years away and I don't miss home 
And someone asks you if, you ever think of her 
So you smile politely and you demur But then all at once your head starts to swim 
And you can feel her breath on your skin 
If I let you stay, the same spot today 
She's above you, below you in ways And you're shivering cold 
Like you're just ten years old 
And she's lying asleep in your bed 
And you're standing beside her 
The light from inside her 
Filling up the darkness in your head 
It was all, for a woman You've drowned in our teasing 
You've forgotten the reason 
The muse inspires the art 
You'd give anything for 
For her to say them once more 
The words you believed at the start Ten-thousand miles from where it began 
Falling asleep with her picture in hand 
And it was all, it was all 
For the look in her eyes 
Of the promise and the lie of a woman
