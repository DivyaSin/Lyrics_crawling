You aint alone, so why you lonely? 
there you go on the dark end of the street 
are you scared to tell somebody how you feel about 
somebody? are you scared what somebody's gon think? 
or... 
are you scared to wear your heart out on your sleeve? 
are you scared me? Cause i'm scared the bomb gonna take me away... 
oh, but i really don't know what i got to say... 
alright! 1-2-3, are you to scared to dance for me? 
bite the bullet or tug my sleeve? 
or are you scared out on your own two feet? We really aint that different, you and me. 
cause I'm scared the storm gonna take me away.. But i really don't know what i got to say... 
hold on....hold on... Cry, if you gonna cry 
come on, cry wit me. You ain't alone, 
just let me be your ticket home....
