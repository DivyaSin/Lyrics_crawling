He wants to hold the children up high 
When they come tearing through the ride 
To save you from falling 
To save them 
From falling He wants to bring a little bring a little honey 
To the saltiness of grief 
To come up from underneath, you used to say 
you would rescue me 
You yourself 
Lost at sea Save me and I'll save you 
Save me and I'll save you 
Make ways to get through 
Together 
Save me and I'll save you 
Save me and I'll save you 
Make ways to get through 
Together Save me and I'll save you 
Save me and I'll save you 
Make ways to get through 
Together
