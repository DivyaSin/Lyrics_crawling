You build me up, you build me up 
You build me up from the ground 
Only to knock me down 
Im not enough, never enough 
Never enough for you to want to stay 
Ill be the first one gone 
Be the first to say This nightmares only just beginning 
So best that we escape it while we can All of the time we wasted wallowed deep inside our realms 
Maybe weve just allowed ourselves to float away, drift astray You talked me into this 
My heart knew better and 
Listening to it is a safer bet 
I let you push me over Your tyranny, monocracy 
And my fatuity 
I never thought youd try 
To take me lying down 
Wont catch me crying now With one fist in a fighting stance 
Guess I should run while I still have a chance I dont know where we stand were never brave enough to say 
Maybe weve always faced it now we float away, drift astray You wont be the first to leave 
Just never had the heart to tell it to you straight 
So watch me break out babe 
Watch me fly away All of the time we wasted wallowed deep inside our realms 
Maybe weve just allowed ourselves to float away 
I dont know where we stand were never brave enough to say 
Maybe weve always faced it now we float away, drift astray 
Drift astray x3
