Innocence, hearts on our sleeves 
Two rebels bonded by dreams 
On the corner by the avenue 
Hanging out, nothing better to do Cheap wine, long summer nights 
Making out under the streetlights 
Feel the passion in the air of the city We were young 
Wild and free 
We were so young 
Wild and free Two teens unleashed on the scene 
A pair of sparks near seas of gasoline 
We're so lucky we got older to learn 
Don't play with fire, you're bound to get burned Fast times, long summer nights 
Making out under the streetlights 
Hear our heartbeats echo in the city We were young 
Wild and free 
We were so young 
Wild and free We were young 
Wild and free 
We were so young 
Wild and free
