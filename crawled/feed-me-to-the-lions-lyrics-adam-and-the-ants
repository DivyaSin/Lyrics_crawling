Too emotional am I? 
Too emotional am I? 
With a spirit soaring 
Ten miles high 
I sing loud words that make me cry 
Too emotional are we? 
Too emotional are we? 
Defying all security 
I mean to keep this fire in me 
Because you're feeding me 
To the lions 
You're feeding me 
To the lions 
Feeding me 
To the lions 
Too emotional are you? 
Too emotional are you? 
With just one heart 
To see you through 
A world where facts are so untrue
