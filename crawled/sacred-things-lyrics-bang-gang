Whatever others do 
We don't follow 
The smoke has settled in our eyes 
Again It's misty in our soul 
Clouds are heavy 
Let's crawl up the rain and float 
Away You and i 
Walk together side by side 
Doing all that we want 
And we get high, high You and i 
Walk together side by side 
Doing all that we want 
And we get high, high The dream of sacred pills 
Keep us going 
We're hypnotizing memories 
Afraid You and i 
Walk together side by side 
Doing all that we want 
And we get high, high You and i 
Walk together side by side 
Doing all that we want 
And we get high, high
