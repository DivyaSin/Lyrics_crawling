wonder how Agab can feel this much 
How Agab feel that something this big 
How it multiplies in my veins 
And in my blood and home 
It triggers itself in my thoughts Oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh 
I'd like to be your 
Beautiful hell 
Your beautiful hell 
I'd like to be your 
Beautiful hell 
Your beautiful hell
