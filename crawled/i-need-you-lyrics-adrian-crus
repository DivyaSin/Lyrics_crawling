I need you to know, 
You're something that I can't let go. 
I'm really trying to let this relationship grow. 
You're the only girl that I'm here for. 
I want you to know that you, 
Girl, will always be my boo. 
No matter what we have been through. 
You've been there for me, 
So it is only right that I'll be there for you. 
1995 
You brought to my life, 
Pretty girl caught my eye. 
Looking sharp as a knife. 
Every time that I hug you, 
I felt like hugging you more. 
Cause you gave me this feeling, 
I never felt before. 
First crush I ever had in my life, 
I knew we would be together. 
Cause the feeling that I felt just had to be right. 
Middle school, 
Me and you, 
Ended up going out. 
Those were the best days I had in my life. 
No doubt. 
Ready for the world. 
Let me love you that was our song. 
I remember thinking there ain't nothing that can go wrong. 
Boys and girls club, 
Chilling there everyday. 
Hanging out. 
Always loving it whenever we say, 
That we'd always have a special thing in every way. 
And when you called me I was always there, 
I'd never be late. 
Then we broke up and you told me you were moving away. 
It didn't matter cause I knew that I would see you one day. 
I need you to know, 
You're something that I can't let go. 
I'm really trying to let this relationship grow. 
You're the only girl that I'm here for. 
I want you to know that you, 
Girl, will always be my boo. 
No matter what we have been through. 
You've been there for me, 
So it is only right that I'll be there for you. 
We started drifting apart, 
Stop keeping in touch. 
I didn't know how your were, 
Cause we weren't talking that much. 
5 hours away, 
On the other side of the state. 
Was where you were, 
Living another life that was great. 
3 years passed by, 
Heard that you had a girl. 
Had a family. 
Feeling all the love in this world. 
I was happy for you, 
Glad you were doing so good. 
It's never the same since you move up out of the hood. 
Now you got a beautiful boy and a beautiful girl. 
Finally seeing the true meaning of life in this world. 
I just miss your pretty eyes shining brighter than pearls. 
You got a man and two kids, 
Let your love unfurl. 
I guess between you and me was pretending to be. 
Something that ain't gonna happen, 
So I'm letting you be. 
Even though I'm not your man, 
I'm still your friend. 
So get at me. 
Cause what means the most to me is seeing you happy. 
I need you to know, 
You're something that I can't let go. 
I'm really trying to let this relationship grow. 
You're the only girl that I'm here for. 
I want you to know that you, 
Girl, will always be my boo. 
No matter what we have been through. 
You've been there for me, 
So it is only right that I'll be there for you. 
It's been 10 years now since you been around. 
I gotta call letting me know that you were coming to town. 
And I heard you were single now, 
As far as I could tell. 
And I just got out of a relationship as well. 
You came down and we started talking, 
And just shooting the breeze. 
When I saw your face again, 
I just got weak in the knees. 
It was just something that I couldn't believe. 
The woman of my dreams 10 years later, 
Standing in front of me. 
I was loving and missing the sexy way we were kissing. 
They just ain't no addition, 
Baby a beautiful vision. 
I put my hands on your shoulder. 
You feel the same but were older. 
What I feel when I hold her, 
Something I'll never get over. 
It was great while it lasted, 
But now it's back to alone. 
9 months was wrong, 
Cause it's back to your home. 
Now it's time once again for me and you to say bye. 
Just know that you will always be that special girl in my life. 
I need you to know, 
You're something that I can't let go. 
I'm really trying to let this relationship grow. 
You're the only girl that I'm here for. 
I want you to know that you, 
Girl, will always be my boo. 
No matter what we have been through. 
You've been there for me, 
So it is only right that I'll be there for you.
