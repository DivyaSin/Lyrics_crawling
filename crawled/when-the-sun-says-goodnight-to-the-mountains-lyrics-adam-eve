Now 
when the sun says good-day to the mountains 
and the night says hello to the dawn I'm alone with my dreams on the hilltop I can still hear your voice though you're gone I hear 
from my door 
the love songs thru the wind it brings back sweet memories of you. Now 
when the sun says good-day to the mountains I'm alone dreaming only of you.
