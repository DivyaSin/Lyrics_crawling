My heartstrings cease to strain 
I've acquired a taste for poisoned lips 
Drank deep of this disease in me 
Adored with prying eyes 
Beneath a mask made of flesh and thorns Collected from the ones she'd loved before 
Collected from the ones she'd loved before 
Collected from the ones she'd loved before 
Collected from the ones she'd loved before My heartstrings cease to strain 
I've acquired a taste for poisoned lips 
Drank deep of this disease in me 
Adored with prying eyes 
Beneath a mask made of flesh and thorns Her eyes were opened wide 
She now could see forever 
Traced deep the marks she'd made 
With her razor Her eyes were opened wide 
She now could see forever 
Traced deep the marks she'd made 
With her razor The lines of suicide 
The lines of suicide 
The lines of suicide 
The lines of suicide
