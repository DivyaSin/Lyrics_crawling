Not afraid of the sounds you make 
Not afraid of the steps you take 
Told you the troubles are on its way Didn't I think you thought we were gone 
We were gone and on and on 
Didn't you say that we don't belong 
Don't Belong go on and on I told you the first time... 
Troubles on its way... We keep movin' 
I said...headlights last long 
We're all...ready while we can 
We're all...givin' what we feel this is real 
[2x] Didn't I think you thought we were wrong 
We were wrong and on and on 
Didn't I hear you singin' along 
All along and on and on I told you the troubles on its way... We keep movin' 
I said...headlights last long 
We're all...ready while we can 
We're all...givin' what we feel this is real 
[2x] This is real... Not afraid of the sounds you make 
Not afraid of the steps you take 
Told you the troubles on its way We keep movin' 
I said...headlights last long 
We're all...ready while we can 
We're all...givin' what we feel this is real 
[3x] We keep movin' 
Headlights last long 
Ready while we can 
Givin' what we feel this is real.
