Do you love me, I mean, really love me? 
If you dont, I'll just have to kill you. Trading 19 years for 19 minutes (following the trends). 
Clinging with empty fists your falling in it (this cycle never ends). 
Wanting to not want this yet living out tomorrows regret. 
Regretting to not forget the stuff that comes with it 
but you're feeling so special I bet. 
Why are you so proud that you took. 
Away this gift from the one she'll care for? 
How do you justify on giving up the one thing you had to lose. 
How would you rest if I how would you rest if I said I want to trade it all and be there for you. 
How would you rest if I testified on you. 
Don't give up, don't give in, hold on. 
Don't give up, don't give in, be strong. 
One last chance.
