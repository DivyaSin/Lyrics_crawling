Drop it I came here from the Philippines 
In the plane with some big big dreams 
I left everything I knew behind me 
Like my mom and my family 
People tell me that I ain't gonna make it 
I got a finger aimed at all of them haters 
In a minute you're gon' catch the vapors 
'Cause in a minute I'ma get my paper Someday I'm gonna get it right my life 
Someday I'm gonna figure it out maybe tonight 
'Cause I know I'ma get it right 
And I know I'ma get it right 
Someday whoa whoa 
One day whoa whoa 
Someday whoa whoa 
One day whoa whoa Someday you're wondering 
If you're really gonna make it (oh yeah) 
And sometimes you wanna know 
Is there anyone to save you (oh yeah) 
I know you've been down before 
Like underneath the ground (under the ground) 
Still got a little chance 
To turn it all around (turn it around) 
Soon your time will come 
So give it all you got (give it all you got) 
Don't stop believing 
So give it all you got 
(give it all you got-got-got- 
Got-got-got-got-got-got-got- 
Got-got-got-got-got-got)
