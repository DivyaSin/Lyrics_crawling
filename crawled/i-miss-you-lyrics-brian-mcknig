I can't remember why we fell apart, 
From something that was so meant to be. 
Forever was the promise in our hearts. 
Now more and more I wonder where you are. Do I ever cross your mind, anytime? 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? 
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime? 
I miss you. Still have your picture in a frame, 
Hear your footsteps down the hall. 
I swear I hear your voice, driving me insane. 
How I wish that you were the same. Do I ever cross your mind, anytime? 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? 
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime? 
I miss you. 
I miss you. 
I miss you. Loneliness and heartache. 
Crying myself to sleep. 
Wondering 'bout tomorrow, 
Won't you come back to me, 
Come back to me. Do I ever cross your mind, anytime? 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? 
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime? 
I miss you. 
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime? 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? 
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime? 
I miss you. I miss you
