Daylight breaks on the streets of my life 
Where no sun shines there bums refusal to die 
In the shadows of heartache my dreams come alive 
I've been searching for love to give meaning to life 
Oh no, you make me feel real 
Oh no, I've got you, you've got me 
And that's all we need 
A reason to believe Tonight my love will never die 
Tonight I will lay down my life 
Wherever we run wherever we go 
Tonight I will be yours and you will be mine In the morning light hope comes on the dawn 
A turning point after all these years In the strength borne of hardship 
I knew we'd make it through 
So throw back your head babe 
These dreams are coming true 
Oh no, there's blood sweat and tears now 
Oh no, I've found you, you've found me 
And that's all we need a reason to believe Tonight my love will never die 
Tonight I will lay down my life 
Wherever we run wherever we go 
Tonight I will be yours and you will be mine Tonight we'll go beyond these realms 
Of where the sun goes down We will be together 
There is permanence in change 
'Cause I found you you found me 
And now we've found a reason to believe Tonight our love will never die 
Tonight I will lay down my life 
Wherever we run wherever we go 
Tonight I will be yours and you will be mine 
You will be mine 
You will be mine 
You will be mine Daylight breaks on the streets of my life 
Where no sun shines there bums refusal to die
