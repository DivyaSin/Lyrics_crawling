Everytime I breath I think of 
Everytime I sleep I 
Fashion dies with no respect 
I never want to be like you 
My poison colours never clash 
With my shiny, shiny shoes 
oh! Who will buy my old chanels, 
Who will buy my fake furs, 
I can't live without my slacks. 
On the catwalk it's a gas 
oh! Your bright colours they cloud my vision, 
Designer shirts they call this fashion, 
Insane robots parade in tandem. 
Don't make me sick, let me see you. Paris green, Paris green Smile and say will you buy this, 
It's a world exclusive. 
To me the colours are the same 
And it's driving me insane. 
Oh! Who will buy my old chanels, 
Who will buy my fake furs, 
I can't live without my slacks. 
On the catwalk it's a gas. 
Oh! You're bright colours they cloud my vision, 
Designer shirts they call this fashion, 
Insane robots parade in tandem. 
Don't make me sick, let me see you Paris green, Paris green, 
Paris green, Paris green
