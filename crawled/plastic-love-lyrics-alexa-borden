Porcelin trees and cracking leaves. 
Frozen images. 
The winter sirens in the breeze. 
Hostile images. 
Your fingers tangled in my hair. 
Frozen Images. 
Your bitter-sweetness in the air. 
Hostile images. 
Hostile Images. So long my restless love. 
My arm has given up. 
I dreamt of a perfect love. 
Plastic's not enough. 
You don't know. Beads of snow like wrecking balls 
Frozen images. 
The streams of clouds tumbling far. 
Hostile images. 
A swan song deafening the wind. 
Frozen images. 
Embrace the howl of the end. 
Hostile images. So long my restless love. 
My arm has given up. 
I dreamt of a perfect love. 
Plastic's not enough. 
You don't know. 
You don't know.
