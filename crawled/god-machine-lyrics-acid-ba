Strapped into the chair the needle now descends 
As they lick their cracking lips their twitching never ends 
Blood beneath their fingernails, swallow all my pain 
Dirty needles break the skin now suck hard as I drain 
Sunken eye, a twisted spine a whiter shade of pale 
Rockabilly man come to pound the coffin nails 
Inject my stomach full of cockroach eggs 
Their machine is coming carried on a million legs 
Walking in the sleep of reason 
Winter is the forever season 
Lick thy mother's bleeding lips 
>From this glass of hate we sip 
Fuck the glass we pump the keg 
Kill conception at the egg 
Her chin is wet with someone's hate 
Love, disfigure, amputate 
Can you remember how it felt to be alive? 
Your god machine is cold and dead your eyes they cannot cry 
Fuck your deities of dying love 
We have shot them down from the skies above 
Screaming convulsing my eyes are bleeding 
Be silent now and take your beating 
I wonder how long you would live 
With a bullet in your gut 
I wonder how much shit you'd talk 
If your throat was cut 
I wonder that you'd sound like begging me 
To let you breathe 
I wonder how much pain it would take 
To make you all believe
