I get up early in the morning 
And rush to catch a plane 
I'm going to live inside my suitcase 
Back on the road again Big stage and bright lights 
Try to relax before the show 
So glad to be here tonight 
That I just can't wait to go, I gotta go Welcome home 
Welcome home 
Welcome home 
It feels good I'm going to save up all of my money 
Just to see if I could 
Try to brighten my appearance 
With clothes from Hollywood We're climbing up the music ladder 
The girls won't leave us alone 
But it really doesn't matter 
If we're nothing back home, back home Welcome home 
Welcome home 
Welcome home 
It feels good Welcome home 
Welcome home 
Welcome home 
It feels good So glad we left the praire city 
And now we're living on the coast 
We went and got ourselves a manager 
We all think he's the most Silver 'vette with gold wheels 
We see him cruise around town 
No, he's never really up 
No, he's never really down down, he's just mojo Welcome home 
Said welcome home baby 
Ah, welcome home 
It feels good Welcome home 
So good to drive in your own car with your old lady 
Said welcome home 
Welcome home 
So good to see you again 
Welcome home baby 
So good to sleep in your own bed 
Ooh whoo, feels good
