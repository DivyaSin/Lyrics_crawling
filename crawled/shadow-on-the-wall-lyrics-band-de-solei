You'd think after all this time 
I'd finally have my life together 
What's wrong with staying home 
And talking to that shadow on the wall 
I'm not the type that can stay home 
And pay attention to these feelings 
Sometimes just to be sure you're still alive 
You for to keep on moving on and on and on But if the music pays 
I'll never be too far away 
If the music plays I'll never be too far away 
Because I'm still running, I'm still running 
I'm still running away Sometimes I get so restless, 
I get so wound up and I get so bored 
I go out looking for some sign of life 
For trouble to take on But I don't have all night 
Come on make your move 
But don't get too comfortable 
Hand be down my walking shoes And if the music plays 
I'll never be too far away because 
I'm still running 
I'm still running 
I'm still running away A little taste of this a little drop of that 
And I'll be doing fine 
Anything that I can do, anything that I can find 
To keep me off my mind 
And I'm still running
