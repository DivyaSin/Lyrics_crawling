My friends it's not what you were famous for 
But now the whole world's watching you 
If we could help you then you know we would 
But we don't know just what to do 
Eye to eye our ways are not the same 
We never tried to understand 
But it could pass to each of us you name 
Then who's the one to take the blame Kiev, a candle with a flame 
You'll never be the same 
Our hearts go out to you 
And what you're going through 
They've thrown away your past 
Just like an empty glass 
Into the fire Someone wiser took the Steppe from you 
I'm sure with reason it was right 
But now it seems the whole world's blaming you 
And who's the one to put things right Kiev, a candle with a flame 
You'll never be the same 
Our hearts go out to you 
And what you're going through 
They've thrown away your past 
Just like an empty glass 
Into the fire
