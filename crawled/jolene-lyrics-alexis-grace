and eyes of emerald green 
your smile is like a breath of spring 
your voice is soft like summer rain

and he talks about you in his sleep 
and there is nothing I can do to keep 
from crying when he calls your name, jolene

well I can easily understand 
how you can easily take my man 
but you don't know what he means to me jolene 
well you could have your choice of men 
but I could never love again

and I had to had to have this talk with you 
my happiness depends on you 
and whatever you decide to do jolene

I'm begging of you please don't take my man 
jolene jolene jolene jolene
