My angel close your eyes 
I'll be your lover tonight 
Pitiful lullaby 
I'll be your lover tonight My own misery is taunting me 
The air stings my lungs 
I can barely see 
Wicked eyes surrounding me 
The trees are watching silently 
I could try to run 
But baby what's the point I may never know 
( I don't see the point) 
Why I let you go My body is aching 
( I'm loosing my mind ) 
There's nothing to hold on to My angel close your eyes 
I'll be your lover tonight I'm tired of trying 
( I'm sick of waiting ) 
If there's nothing that I can do Pitiful lullaby 
( to sing the tortured to sleep ) We could settle down 
And change the end 
Nothing but time 
Start over agin All the little things you do 
That make me fall in love with you 
Have lead me to this 
( a bittersweet abyss ) I may never know 
( A vexatious kiss ) 
Why I let you go My body is aching 
( I'm loosing my mind ) 
There's nothing to hold on to My angel close your eyes 
I'll be your lover tonight I'm tired of trying 
( I'm sick of waiting ) 
If there's nothing I can do Pitiful lullaby 
( to sing the tortured to sleep ) I will fallow you into the night 
( my darling eyes ) 
I would do 
Anything to be 
Lying with you 
As I watch you 
Dream I have been reborn! 
I have broken free! I'm free! I'm free! 
You can't deny me, do not defy me! 
I'm drunk on lust and sovereignty! 
Abandon all hope for beyond time I can stand! 
I have been reborn! 
Darling, tonight we say goodbye! 
Sing a touching lullaby and we'll watch the angels cry
