Well I caught my wife with another man 
And it cost me 99 on a prison farm 
In Georgia close to the Florida line 
Well I've been here for two long years 
I finally made the warden my friend 
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease 
Takin' care of ol' red now ol' red 
He's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen 
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail 
He's a four legged trackin' machine 
You can consider yourself mighty lucky 
To get past the gators in the quicksand fence 
But all these years that I've been here ain't nobody got past red And the warden sang 
Come on somebody why don't you run 
Ol' red's itchin' to have a little fun 
Get my lantern get my gun 
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes Well I payed off the guard 
And I sent out a letter to my cousin up in Tennessee 
And he brought down a blue tick hound she was pretty as she could be 
Well they pinned her up in the swamplands 
'Bout a mile just south of the gate 
Well I'd take ol' red for his evenin' runs 
I'd just drop him off and wait And the warden sang 
Come on somebody why don't you run 
Ol' red's itchin' to have a little fun 
Get my lantern get my gun 
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes Now ol' red got real used to seein' his lady every night 
So I kept him away for three or four days 
And waited 'til the time got right 
Well I made my run in the evenin' sun 
And I smiled when I heard let red out 
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee and ol' red was headed south And the warden sang 
Come on somebody why don't you run 
Ol' red's itchin' to have a little fun 
Get my lantern get my gun 
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes Now there's red haired blue ticks 
All in the south 
Love got me in here 
And love got me out
