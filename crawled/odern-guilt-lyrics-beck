Hey 
Hey 
Da da da da I feel uptight when I walk in the city 
I feel so cold when I'm at home 
Feels like everything's starting to hit me 
I lost bed ten minutes ago Modern guilt I'm staring at nothing 
Modern guilt I'm under lock and key 
It's not what I have changed, 
Turning into convention Don't know what I've done but I feel ashamed 
Standing outside the glass room sidewalk 
These people talk about impossible things 
And I'm falling down the conversations 
Another palm beats into you and Jill Modern guilt is all in our hands 
Modern guilt won't get me to bed 
Say what you will 
Smoking my cigarette 
Don't know what I've done but I feel afraid Da da da
