Should be two lit, should be four lit 
Pick me up before six

Hey put that phone down and mind your fucking business girl 
Hey put some money up in here, so independent girl 
But I'm just try'na put some diamonds in your pendant, get your titty fit 
Presidential suite some private jets outside the city shit 
One thing I can't stand is a petty hoe 
Can't keep your business to yourself, don't go to tell a fool 
About where you been and how much pussy you be selling for 
Don't wanna see her with a telescope, tell 'em go [Hook: B.o.B]

Young new comer cause the trap suit jump 
Made the play [?] count two hump 
All the girls in the hood love Bennihana 
All the niggas in my hood want more comma
