when i first saw you i knew i'd hate you 
everything you've done i'm not the only one 
i can't believe that you're still alive 
nothing going on behind your eyes 
lose the attitude drop the stare 
stop complaining i don't care 
just shut up & go away 
seeing your face f*cks up my day 
NOBODY WANTS YOU AROUND 
whenii first saw you i knew i'd hate you 
everything you've done i'm not the only one 
i'm sick of you saying that you're punk 
it don't matter how you spike your hair up 
lose the attitude drop the stare 
stop complaining i don't care 
just shut up & go away 
seeing your face f*cks up my day
