Dirty Little Pop Song 
DJ DJ on the floor 
Who's your slutty little whore 
My DJ, D-D-D-DJ 
Press the button, turn it up 
Boost it 'till it makes you hot 
My DJ, D-D-D-DJ I wanna buy what you're selling so let's cut to the chase 
Your a mind fucker baby and your pimp is the base 
The beat is so non-stop, it's the pulse of the night 
And it draws you in like a red street light 
And it draws you in like a red street light I'm just a dirty little pop song 
That keeps running through your brain 
And even though you know it's so wrong 
You're gonna love going insane I'm just a dirty little pop song 
That keeps running through your brain 
And even though you know it's so wrong 
You're gonna love going insane 
Oh oh oh oh oh I'm spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
I'm spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Oh oh oh oh oh Kill me slowly, do it right 
When you're on the floor tonight 
D-dancing, da-da-da-dancing 
Wind me up and break me down 
Twist me, turn me round and round 
D-D-D-DJ The first hit is on me 
So baby set yourself free 
'Cause you can let me go 
I'm on your radio 
This is the [?] 
Because I'm already in 
And though I'll blow your mind 
You wanna re-rewind 
And though I'll blow your mind 
You wanna re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-rewind I'm just a dirty little pop song 
That keeps running through your brain 
And even though you know it's so wrong 
You're gonna love going insane I'm just a dirty little pop song 
That keeps running through your brain 
And even though you know it's so wrong 
You're gonna love going insane 
Oh oh oh oh oh I'm spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
I'm spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Oh oh oh oh oh On the radio 
On the stereo 
In the video 
On the disco 
On the radio 
On the stereo 
In the video 
On the disco I'm just a dirty little pop song 
That keeps running through your brain 
And even though you know it's so wrong 
You're gonna love going insane 
Oh oh oh oh oh I'm spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
I'm spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Spinning in your head 
Oh oh oh oh oh
