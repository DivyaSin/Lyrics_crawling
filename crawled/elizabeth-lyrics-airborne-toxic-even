There's a distance in your eyes 
That's why a smile is always a surprise 
When you call and you talk to me 
I wonder which person you're going to be 
She said, all your songs are sad songs 
Why do you always have to see the worst of it 
Could you write me just one love song? 
Put my name somewhere in the middle of it 
It's not hard to write Elizabeth 
Just close your eyes boy and take your best guess 
Cause the truth is hard, isn't it? 
She said "I'll be listening in my favorite white dress" All these quite afternoons, 
She said, "I wonder if I've given up my love too soon" 
As her hair fell from her curls 
I said you're pretty uptight for a Mexican Girl 
She said, all your songs are sad songs 
Why do you always have to make me feel like shit? 
Could you write me just one love song? 
And put my name somewhere in the middle of it 
And if you call the song Elizabeth 
All my friends will know it's about me 
Cause the truth is hard, isn't it? 
Don't take too long, I just know you'll come back to me I said all these songs are love songs 
Just love at times can make you feel like shit 
So you write a string of words down 
It's better if there's some truth in it 
It's true I love you Elizabeth 
I love the way you move in that silly white dress 
Because the truth is hard to admit 
I've never known love 
This is just my best guess
