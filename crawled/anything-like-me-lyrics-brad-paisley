I remember sayin' I don't care either way 
Just as long as he or she is healthy I'm okay 
Then the doctor pointed to the corner of the screen 
And said "Ya see that thing right there, well you know what that means" And I started wondering who he was going to be 
And I thought heaven help us if he's anything like me 
He'll probably climb a tree to tall and ride his bike too fast 
End up every summer wearin' something in a cast 
He's gonna throw a ball and break some glass, in a window down the street 
He's gonna get in trouble, he's gonna get in fights 
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep 
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback, if he's anything like me I can see him right now, knees all skinned up 
With a magnifying glass tryin' to melt a Tonka truck 
Won't he be a sight with his football helmet on 
That'll be his first love til his first love comes along 
He'll get his heart broke by the time he's in his teens 
And heaven help him if he's anything like me He'll probably stay out too late and drive his car too fast 
Get a speeding ticket he'll pay for mowing grass 
He's gonna get caught skippin' class and be grounded for a week 
He's gonna get in trouble, we're gonna get in fights 
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep 
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback, if he's anything like me
