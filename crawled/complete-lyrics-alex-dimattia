I'm the son of a man's man's 
Son of a monster 
I'm the son of some strong hands 
That gave it all for me 
I'm the son of Italian traditions 
I'm the son of American dreams But when will I see 
What's missing inside of me 
And when will I finally be 
Complete I'm the son of your blond hair 
Son of warm blue eyes 
I'm the son of a love 
That simply refused to die 
I'm the son of relentless patience 
I'm the son of your selfless life But when will I see 
What's missing inside of me 
And when will I finally be 
Complete I'm the son of the city 
Where we 
Declared our independence 
Violently I'm the son of the 
Sacrifices made 
For the free 
By the Brave I'm the son of the year 
We lost the challenge 
I'm the son of the year 
Things went off balance 
I'm the son of hope 
The son of change 
I've become the son of so many things But when will I see 
What's missing inside of me 
And when will I finally be 
Complete
