A heavy rain is pouring down 
Upon the mourners gathered at your grave 
Heads bowed in deadly silence 
As the priest recites your eulogy Pounding nails into the lid of your coffin... 
Pound Casket slowly lowered into the ground 
Another body consigned to the grave 
Interned in your final resting place 
Launched into eternity Pounding nails into the lid of your coffin... 
Pound A bright light leads you to heaven 
Your soul cursed to eternal damnation Your spirit set free now wanders 
Your body buried rots in the ground
