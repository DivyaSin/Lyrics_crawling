(Won't you show me some, baby?) 
(I gotta get some, baby) 
(Won't you show me some, baby?) 
Show me some positivity 
Show me some positivity From where I stand, I see 
A world of possibilities 
So don't be going negative on me, baby 
Yeah Love is hard 
But that's alright 
Give it time 
It's worth the ride 
You know 
It's all in the way... [Chorus] 
You're lookin' at me 
I'm lookin' at you 
What more do want 
(Show me some positivity) 
It's all that I got 
It's leading me on 
Can't leave it alone 
(Show me some positivity) 
You're makin' it harder 
Than it has to be 
So won't you please show me (me) 
Some positivity (me) 
Some positivity? (Won't you show me some, baby? I gotta get some) 
Wish I could get into your mind 
So I could see if I'm inside 
'Cause I know that you're right here in mine, oh baby 
Oh, oh, oh The glass is half full, not empty 
Why do you think you won't get none? 
You know it's all in the way... [Chorus] [Bridge] 
Don't bring me down 
Wit' cha, baby, no 
I'm on a high up here 
And I don't want to let go 
So I'm gonna tell you one more time... (Won't you show me some, baby? 
I got me goin' crazy 
Oh baby, give it to me) Give it to me, baby [Chorus x 2] (I gotta get some, baby 
Won't you show me some, baby? 
I'm outta my mind, baby 
Oh baby, give it to me 
You got me goin' crazy, crazy, crazy 
Oh baby, give it to me 
Won't you show me some, baby? 
I gotta get some, baby 
You got me goin' crazy)
