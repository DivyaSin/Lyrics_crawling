God damn these roots and how they plunge 
Into this hard packed northern ground 
Beneath the frost line lies my love 
Where it is firmly held in place for now 
We've had miles of mountains 
Surrounding us all the way 
And now those same old mountains 
Do nothing but separate Can I plant myself here 
Right beside you 
I can't take my place 
Amongst these trees 
I'm sick of waiting for the wind to blow you back to me God damn that breeze that caught your wings 
The one that pulled you toward the sea 
The bird that left here no longer sings 
Well at least no not for me 
I couldn't stay grounded so I uprooted and walked away 
Through the miles of mountains 
I pushed through to you just to say
