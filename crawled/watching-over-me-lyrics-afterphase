Take away the ache within my heart. 
Rising gently. 
Bleed every moment we're apart. 
I miss you deeply. Far away, cannot see you from here. 
Want to say, the words I could have said if I was near. 
You are on the other side. I cannot go there, this door is closed to me. 
I hope you're feeling safe and you are peaceful, and watching over me. Makes me think, how it came to this. 
Sadness flowing. 
Breathe the last breath that takes your life. 
I want you to stay. Far away, cannot see you from here. 
Want to say, the words I could have said if I was near. 
You are on the other side. I cannot go there, this door is closed to me. 
I hope you're feeling safe and you are peaceful, and watching over me. Focus on all the positive you gave, 
To myself 
And everyone all around you felt the same. 
You left a hole here. Far away, cannot see you from here. 
Want to say, the words I could have said if I was near. 
You are on the other side. I cannot go there, this door is closed to me. 
I hope you're feeling safe and you are peaceful, and watching over me.
