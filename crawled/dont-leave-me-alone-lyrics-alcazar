Leave me alone 
Can't you see I can't stop crying 
I get down on my knees 
I'll be begging you please 
Don't leave me alone Leave me alone 
Don't leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Don't leave me alone Last night we were celebrating 
You played truth or dare 
I came out hallucinating 
And love was in the air We met down in club land 
We had an affair 
We danced in the spotlight 
The fire was there 
You said I'm the only 
Then walked out of town 
I beg you please don't turn around Leave me alone 
Can't you see I can't stop crying 
I get down on my knees 
I'll be begging you please 
Don't leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Can't you see I can't stop crying 
If you walk out that door 
I can't stand it no more 
Don't leave me alone Sitting through this courtroom drama 
Of who did what to who me 
Stand accused of cold seduction 
The cameras ready zoom You said there was more 
That your love was for real 
You said you'd come back 
For my heartache to heal 
I stand on a bridge 
And I'm ready to fly 
This time it's my last goodbye Leave me alone 
Can't you see I can't stop crying 
I get down on my knees 
I'll be begging you please 
Don't leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Can't you see I can't stop crying 
If you walk out that door 
I can't stand it no more 
Don't leave me alone Leave me alone 
Can't you see I can't stop crying 
I get down on my knees 
I'll be begging you please 
Don't leave me alone 
Leave me alone We met down in club land 
We had an affair 
We danced in the spotlight 
The fire was there 
You said I'm the only 
Then walked out of town 
I beg you please don't turn around You said there was more 
That your love was for real 
You said you'd come back 
For my heartache to heal 
I stand on a bridge 
And I'm ready to fly 
This time it's my last goodbye Leave me alone 
Can't you see I can't stop crying 
I get down on my knees 
I'll be begging you please 
Don't leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Can't you see I can't stop crying 
If you walk out that door 
I can't stand it no more 
Don't leave me alone
