We Speak 
Of only certain things 
And others we don't bring up 
At all 
Bottle it inside and cap it off 
I hold my breath I'm waiting for the fall 
Could you ask me to leave? 
Could I beg you to stay? 
Is the any in between? 
At all 
I hold my breath I'm waiting for 
You 
Waiting for you 
We speak 
Oh so cautiously 
Ever since the day it came through 
What's inside of me's inside of you 
I hold my breath I'm waiting for the truth 
Could I ask you to leave? 
Could you beg me to stay? 
Is there any other way? 
At all 
I hold my breath I'm waiting for 
You 
Waiting for you 
What else can I do? 
As my worst fears 
Come true 
We speak 
Far less frequently 
Ever since the day you had to choose 
But you couldn't keep the love without abuse 
I hold my breath I'm waiting for the bruise 
I couldn't ask you to leave 
You couldn't beg me to stay 
We watched it rip at the seams 
And drift away 
I Hold my breath I'm waiting for
