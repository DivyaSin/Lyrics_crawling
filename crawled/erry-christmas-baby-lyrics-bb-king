Merry Christmas baby, 
Baby you sure did treat me nice 
Merry, merry ,merry Christmas baby 
Baby you sure did treat me nice 
Gave me a dimond ring for Christmas 
And now I'm living in paradise. [Chorus] 
Oh! I'm feelin' mighty fine this morning, 
I got good music on the radio. 
Hey baby, I'm feeling mighty fine this morning 
I've got good music on my radio, 
I would love to hug and kiss you baby 
While your standing beneath the missletoe. Santa came down the chimney, 
About half past three, 
Left all of these presents that you, 
See down here before me. Merry, merry, merry, Christmas baby 
Oh! you sure been good to me, 
I haven't had a drink this eveining baby 
But I'm lit up like a Christmas tree.
