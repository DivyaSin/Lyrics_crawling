Use me like a punch bag 
I'm too much for a cage of monkeys 
Here they come from the hole 
In the back of my head 
Very carefully I stand 
And I'll say I'll call again 
Use me like a punch bag 
I'm too much for a cage of monkeys 
Here they come from the hole 
In the back of my head 
Very carefully I stand 
And I'll say I'll call again 
Use me like a punch bag 
Use me like a punch bag 
Use me like a punch bag 
Use me like a punch bag
