You are different 
Beauty's in the eye of the beholder, baby 
And to me you're different as night and day 
From all the rest There's not a lot of things that 
That can excite me, ignite me 
You're all that and then so Your lips, your smile, can I reminisce just for a while? 
Your eyes, your hair, everything I love, you got it right there 
Your soft tone when you speak 
Your sexiness down to your feet [Chorus] 
Baby, baby, baby 
I get off on you 
Baby, baby, baby 
I get off on you 
Do you get off on me? Your tenderness 
And gentle ways 
Love it when you sigh 
Make love to me And you're the one, my wildest dream 
Someone like you is all I need 
But many things that you posses 
Girl, your out front from all the rest [Chorus] First of all you're sensitive, very sensitive 
And I love that in a woman 
You love flowers, you're so cute, so precious to me 
Very precious to me Step, baby, step 
Yeah, you're there 
You're walk, your talk 
Have mercy, mercy on me Baby, baby, baby 
I get off on you 
Baby, baby, baby 
I get off on you Baby, baby, baby 
I get off on you 
Do you get off on me? Baby, baby, baby 
I get off on you 
I do, I do
