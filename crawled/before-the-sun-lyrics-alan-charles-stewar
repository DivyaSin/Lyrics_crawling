it's not what you imagine that's put furrows on my brow 
it's not who I am but what I am that counts 
I've got to do some thinking we've both said enough for now 
I don't know what's wrong but I sure don't know what's right CHORUS 
but to you I believe it's right to say 
that I'll be up up and on my way 
before the sun 
has overlooked your window sill you may say I'm a crusader with a cause that's undefined 
yet I must face another battle in this war 
I smile 'cause I'm no fighter then I turn and look behind 
but the past won't ever hold an open door CHORUS 2 
and to you there's one more thing to say 
that you must wait while I must fly away 
before the sun 
has overlooked your window sill BRIDGE 
they're telling tales in the highest quarters 
'bout faith and blood and glory 
just a little more oil on troubled waters 
it's the same old story footsteps in the darkness just before the light of dawn 
some lines I read still running round my mind 
'for I have promises to keep miles to go before I sleep' 
but who's to know the answers I will find CHORUS 3 
yes and there's so much more to say 
but we will wait 'cause I must fly away 
before the sun 
has overlooked your window sill lyrics and music 1969 and 2005 Alan Charles Stewart
