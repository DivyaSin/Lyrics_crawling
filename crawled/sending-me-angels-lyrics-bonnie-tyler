I walked down to the river 
Stood on the shore 
Seems like the devil's always 
Tryin' to get in my door 
Just when I thought 
I couldn't take anymore 
You come again, my friend 
He keeps sending me angels 
From up on high 
He keeps sending me angels 
Teach me to fly 
He keeps sending me angels 
Sweet and true 
He keeps sending me angels 
Just like you 
As I stand on this mountain 
Face to the wind 
Amazed by the number of times 
You go and sin 
The countless enemies 
That could've been friends 
Oh here he comes again [Chorus] 
He keeps sending me angels 
Here they come a flyin' 
He keeps sending me angels 
To keep me from cryin' 
(He keeps) Sending me angels So I'll never he blue 
He keeps sending me angels 
Just like you 
He keeps sending me angels 
From up on high 
He keeps sending me angels 
Teach me to fly 
He keeps sending me angels 
So I'll never be blue 
He keeps sending me angels 
lust like you 
Some say that it's comin' 
Say it's already here 
But love is among us 
Through the joy and the fear 
When I look in your eyes 
Everything is so clear 
My friend, here it comes again [Chorus] He keeps sending me angels 
From up on high 
He keeps sending me angels 
To teach me to fly 
He keeps sending me angels 
Sweet and true 
(He keeps) Sending me angels [Chorus] 
Sending me angels 
Here they come a flyin' 
Sending me angels 
Keep me from cryin' 
Sending me angels 
So I'll never be blue 
Sending me angels
