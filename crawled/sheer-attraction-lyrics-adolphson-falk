We're lying here just contemplating 
While the heavenly bodies are rotating 
Held in orbit by the powers of sheer attraction 
And in this universal vastness 
You and I still cling to this madness 
Kept together by the forces of sheer attraction 
Earth moves forever 
On its eternal course 
Your limbs entwined in mine 
Caught up in gravitational force 
Our beating hearts 
Swell our heated veins 
Unite two solar systems 
On one relentless flame 
You and I 
In the force of sheer attraction 
You and I 
And the forces of sheer attraction 
Your fingers - searching and drifting 
Arouse me with their dancing and shifting 
Awaken in me forces I cannot fathom 
And far above this place where we're lying 
Two great stars in space are colliding 
Brought together by forces of sheer attraction 
Earth moves forever 
On its eternal course 
Your limbs entwined in mine 
Caught up in gravitational force 
Our beating hearts 
Swell our heated veins 
Unite two solar systems 
On one relentless flame 
You and I 
In the force of sheer attraction 
You and I 
And the forces of sheer attraction
