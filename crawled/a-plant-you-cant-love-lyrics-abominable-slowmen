I tried to kill this here plant 
Tried to kill it, but I can't 
Every time it starts to wilt 
I cry down on its arid silt I ignored it for a month or five 
But that little ****er was still alive 
Carrying on like an aeroplane 
That's got a refueling thing One day I passed out for a year 
Guess I drank up too much beer 
Woke up when, well, wouldn't you don't know? 
That there plant bust through the window Reaching up with its branchy might 
Hunting down that golden light 
Cost me like four hundred dollars 
To fix that window
