Ooh, oh I've had sleepless nights 
Toss and turn, wake up burning 
For what you inspire So I'm gonna walk right down your street 
With a love that I can't hide 
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah 
I'll even sacrifice my pride 
Cause I want you... 
Ooh, oh how I wish you would be mine 
My pulse is weak, I'm blushing brighter 
Than a Valentine Cause I've been walking down your street 
With a love that I can't hide 
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah 
I'll even sacrifice my pride Cause I can't stop 
The way I feel 
So I keep walking on 
Cause I want you...
