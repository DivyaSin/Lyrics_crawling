Man he thought the world and just the law was just a lie Free me now 
Free me now 
Free me now Can't you hear the laughter of the devil in the night 
Sure there must be soldiers have no fairer place to fight Free me now 
Free me now 
Free me now Killing must be faster of the nation 
Can't you see the widows 
Without home and shedding tears Free me now 
Free me now 
Free me now
