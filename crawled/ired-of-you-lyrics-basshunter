Tired of you 
Tired of you Maybe you would like 
Maybe you would like 
Be something that you 
Don't want to be? 
Or maybe 
You want be like me? 
Well let me tell you 
That the only thing 
You will is a ghost You'll be like a party 
Without any host I think it's time 
That you relise 
That this is the end 
Because you got problem 
That you can't defend 
Now get rid 
Of your pointless life 
And the sidewalk too 
Becasue am soo fucking 
Tired of you, tired of you 
Tired of you You had the chance to prove 
That you're are not the person 
We thought that you are 
We, we, wrong 
You are the most 
Retarded person so far Tired of you 
Tired of you
