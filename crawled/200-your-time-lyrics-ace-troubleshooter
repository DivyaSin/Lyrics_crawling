It's two o'clock your time 
Midnight mine and I could die to have you here 
It's two o'clock your time 
Midnight mine and I could die to have you here Call you up, I'm fat away 
Wake you up, but it's okay 
You don't mind 
I'm not scared to say it now 
It's not fair and yet somehow 
We're doing fine It's two o'clock your time 
Midnight mine and I could die to have you here Watch the changing leaves again 
But I don't remember when 
We saw them fall 
When the snowflake covers blue 
I will come back home to you 
And watch them all It's two o'clock your time 
Midnight mine and I could die to have you here 
It's two o'clock your time 
Midnight mine and I could die to have you here Every time you're on my mind 
It just seems to unwind It's two o'clock your time 
Midnight mine and I could die to have you here 
It's two o'clock your time 
Midnight mine and I could die to have you here It's two o'clock your time 
It's two o'clock your time 
It's two o'clock your time
