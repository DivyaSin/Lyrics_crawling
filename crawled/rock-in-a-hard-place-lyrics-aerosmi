It was a take it or leave it kinda Saturday night 
I wish I could love you till the cows come home, make it right 
If it's a make believe I say it ain't, tell ya then 
Cause if it's a dream I'm in please wake me up and start again Ooo, close your eyes and what do you see 
Ooo, look over how you could do with your only belief She was a real tight manner 
Lies in over navver 
Hard core biloozy 
Late nine t'fiver 
Her second hand clothes 
Smiling like a Cheshire cat Said it was in and out and up and down the urchin moon 
Baby a certain situation on a sea I'm who 
Wasn't a ring around the roses pull a daisy chain 
Not with your head could tell me you ain't from there and back again Ooh close your eyes and what do you see 
Ooh another but how what they dud with your only believe in me She was a real tight manner 
Lies in off a laugher 
Hard core floozy 
Late nine to fiver 
Her second hand clothes 
Smilin' like a Cheshire Cat Give a good one, I want to be or not to be tonight 
Why should I hold her down in bed when you should ride me right? 
Why should you give it all you got, now mid's a make amends 
Boy you'll never mind your marker and drive the bends Ooh close your eyes and what do you see 
Ooh another but look what they do with your only believe in me She was a real tight manner 
Lies in off a laugher 
Hard core biloozy 
Late nine to fiver 
Her second hand clothes 
Smilin' like a Cheshire Cat A real time manner 
Lies in off a laugher 
Hard core floozy 
Late nine driver 
Smilin' like a Cheshire Cat
