Never been the kind of guy 
Who walks around ladders 
And I open up umbrellas when I'm inside 
Well, black cats that crossed my path, 
They never mattered 
But I've never had this much at stake 
Don't want to lose her by tempting fate So I'm gonna knock on wood 
Salt over my shoulder 
Do anything to keep her love 
Cause it feels so good 
Every time I hold her 
Like I always dreamed it would 
I think this could be forever 
The two of us together 
Knock on wood Well, it's been two weeks 
And everything is coming up aces 
But I've seen my luck come, 
And I've seen it go 
And for the first time in my life, 
I'm not hesitating 
I knew after just one dance, 
I wasn't leaving this up to chance I'm gonna knock on wood 
Salt over my shoulder 
Do anything to keep her love 
Cause it feels so good 
Every time I hold her 
Like I always dreamed it would 
I think this could be forever 
The two of us together 
Knock on wood, yeah Well, I've got my rabbit's foot 
Around my neck 
That old wishing well's 
Got half my paycheck 
Got a bag of four-leaf clovers 
Anything to be her lover Knock on wood 
Knock on wood I'm gonna knock on wood 
Salt over my shoulder 
Do anything to keep her love 
Cause it feels so good 
Every time I hold her 
Like I always dreamed it would 
I think this could be forever 
The two of us together 
I think this could be forever 
The two of us together 
Knock on wood Knock on wood
