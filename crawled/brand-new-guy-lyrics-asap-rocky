[Verse 1: Asap Rocky] 
I'm camo down to my boxers, gold teeth, a bathing ape 
It's animals in my projects like monkeys, orangutans 
Banana clip on that chopper, I hold heat, bangers bang 
(Let Chiquita speak) Let it keep the peace that Lil B, brrrangadang 
I don't care if you blue or you red flagging, head swinging, my pants sagging 
Hoes all on my band wagon, your bitch gagging, she jet lagging 
All my cuz niggas, what's crackin'? All my blood niggas, what's poppin'? 
I ain't set tripping, I just happen to know who click clacking, you mismatching 
Fuck swagger, you been jacking, fuck fly, I am fashion 
Tryna cop that Benz wagon, my bitch drive it and my friends crash it 
Niggas threat with the chit chattin', see a nigga don't shit happen 
I'm finna blow, and I'm Bin Laden, so talk money, pig latin (Suck my fuckin' dick bitch) 
[Hook] 
Brand new clip, brand new nine

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q] 
That 45 be the big toy 
Now which nigga want it with the fat boy? 
Clipped up like I'm paranoid 
Hot as hell nigga, Fitzroy 
Pull it off through the city like 
Seen that whole nigga like 
Hopped up on a nigga like murk 
Put that pussy nigga in a purse 
You wouldn't be the first covering the dirt 
Put him in the ground, he was down to earth 
Knacked up nigga, I been down since birth 
Backpack full of random work 
With two bad hoes I'll teach you how to jerk 
Teach you how to jerk 
Swaggin' in my J's 
Pop me a pill and throw that pussy a rave 
My prerogative ways 
Nappy chin hairs with the brand new fade 
Brand new nigga with the brand new V 
Sold that bitch out 
Should've made that ho bigger 
Killin careers make these cupcakes remember 
My objective is to serve your agenda 
Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender 
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga 
You quick with the gat and the dick in your mouth 
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house 
Twisting up weed 
I'm digging her out 
Just filling her out 
Do all that shit you be talking about 
While you gone? Shit, NetFlix on your couch 
What this popcorn about? 
Microwave oven while you out there cuffin' 
You over there lovin' 
That bitch be my stuffing, like 
Like we really be fucking

Fuck you think I rap for?
