Ok... 
This is a song that uh... 
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uh... 
Not too many Chanukah songs 
So uh... 
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to hear any Chanukah songs 
Here We Go... 
Put on your yarmulke 
Here comes Chanukah 
So much funukah 
To celebrate Chanukah 
Chanukah is the festival of lights 
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights 
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree 
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me 
David Lee Roth lights the menorah 
So do Kirk Douglas, James Caan and the late Dinah Shore-ah 
Guess who eats together and the CarDeli 
Bowser form Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli 
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Glodie Hawn's half too 
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew 
You don't need "Deck the Halls" or "Jingle Bell Rock" 
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spook- both Jewish 
Put on your yarmulke 
It's time for Chanukah 
The owner of the Seattle Supersonicahs 
Celebrates Chanukah 
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew 
But guess who is hall of famer Rod Carew- he converted 
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby 
Harrison Ford's and quarter Jewish- not to shabby 
Some people think that Ebenezer Scrooge is 
Well he's not but guess who is 
All three Stooges 
So many Jews are in showbiz 
Tom Cruise isn't but I heard his agent is 
Tell your friend Veronica 
It's time to celebrte Chanukah 
I hope I get a harmonicah 
On this lovely, lovely Chanukah 
So drink your gin and tonicah 
And smoke your marijuanikah 
If your really, really wannakah 
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah 
Happy Chanukah
