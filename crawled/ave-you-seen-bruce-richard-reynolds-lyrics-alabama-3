Have you seen Bruce Richard Reynolds? 
He's a man we'd like to find. 
They say the great train robbery, 
He was the mastermind. 
And his firm they pulled the greatest turn, 
The world has ever known. 
2 million quid was stolen, 
The firm split for parts unknown. (Chorus) 
Have you seen Bruce Richard Reynolds? 
He's a man we must detain. 
He's wanted for the robbery of the Glasgow/Euston train. 
Age 32, height six foot one, eyes gray, his hair is brown, 
Apprehend Bruce Richard Reynolds he is wanted by the crown. Well Reynolds and some people got together as a firm, 
While doin' bird in Wormwood Scrubs he heard about a turn. 
To rob a train, but it needed brains, so Reynolds scratched his head, 
"When I done my bird then rob that train," that's what he said. 
When Reynolds left his prison cell he started on his scheme, 
He contacted ol' Gordon G. and Charlie Wilson's team. 
They came to an arrangement and a partnership was made, 
By summer '63 the scene was set for Reynold's game. 
Yeah! On the night of August 8th you know the rig went like a dream, 
One-hundred and twenty mail-bags full of money was stolen by the team. 
But someone left his finger prints and the guys were soon on charge, 
But they only caught the muscle cause the brains were still at large. 
Yeah! On the grape-vine came to news, that Mister Reynolds made a vow, 
"Well no-one grassed on me," he said, "I can't desert them now." 
"The iron bars and prison walls, they do not bother me," 
"I robbed the mail, so I'll rob the jails and set my whole firm free." 
By August '64 ol' Charlie Wilson left his cell, 
By late in '65 Ron Biggs said 'adios' as well. Have you seen Bruce Richard Reynolds? 
He's a mastermind you know: 
Just walking through the walls of jails and letting his firm go!
