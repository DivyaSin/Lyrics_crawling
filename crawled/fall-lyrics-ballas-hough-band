You've been talkin' in your sleep 
Tellin' me all kinds of things 
Words you should never repeat 
Keep callin' Flyin' right out of the door, 
To the point where I gotta hear more 
I wanna settle the score, 
I'm fallin' When you touch me 
Everything feels like it's alright, 
Now I know to feel otherwise. 
And if you want me, 
You're gonna have to make a change, 
Before you're tangled up in your lies. Well I hope I catch you before I fall 
You tell me it's alright 
Don't play 
Oh, your eyes are tellin' me lies. You should go go, 
But I know know, 
That you won't won't Well, I can't take much more of this 
I can't believe all the signs that I missed, 
And all my friends would insist you were cheatin' It's been goin' on for awhile 
And the whole time I'm in denial, 
Convinced it wasn't your style 
to be creepin' around Livin lies sayin that you're with your girlfriends, 
Now I know you're with other guys. 
And if you want me, 
Well I'm afraid that you're too late, 
'Cause now you're tangled up in your lies. Well I hope I catch you before I fall 
You tell me it's alright, 
Don't play 
Oh, your eyes are tellin' me lies 
I hope I catch you before I fall 
You tell me it's alright. 
Don't play, 
Oh, your eyes are tellin' me lies Ohhhhhh! (Don't tell me lies)

But I know know, 
That you won't won't I hope I catch you before I fall 
You tell me it's alright 
Don't play (don't play) 
Oh, your eyes are tellin' me lies. I hope I catch you before I fall 
You tell me it's alright 
Don't play 
Oh, your eyes are tellin' me lies. You should go go, 
But I know know,
