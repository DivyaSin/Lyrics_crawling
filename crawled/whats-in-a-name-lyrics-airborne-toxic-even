There was nothing you could do but turn away 
They told the fathers to hide all the girls away 
It's just a name, a name, a name, a name, what's in a name? And you were sleeping by the time I found you there 
I said, "It's a shame we gotta cut off all that hair..." But it's alright, I just hope it's nothing bad 
You can call me if you're sad, I don't care what your father said We were running through the halls of the middle school 
Writing our names on the side of the public pool 
Like two ghosts in flight on a sleepless night, we were alive And you told me you were scared of suicide 
On the night that your best friend's brother died But it's alright, I just hope it's nothing bad 
You can call me if you're sad, I don't care what your father said I was lost in you dancing around in your living room 
And you said your mother's in the back on Valium 
And she sleeps so hard that you wonder if she's alive And so I parked my bike outside your house 
You said, "There's nothing you can do to make me come out!" 
Because your daddy said I was the worst one yet, but it was a lie, a lie, a lie, a lie 
Because I always loved the way you looked in that firing light 
Just dancing around in some old sweater of mine But it's alright, I just hope it's nothing bad 
Just promise me you won't get mad, I don't care what your father said This is not a game, it would be a crying shame 
Honestly, what's in a name? Tell me, what's in a name, a name, a name... Oh we were so young, we were so wrong. We were so wrong.
