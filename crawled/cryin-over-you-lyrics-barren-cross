It's been few days, since you left and said good-bye. 
It's the love you gave. 
It's got me craving inside, 
Oh how I miss you baby. 
Looking at the pictures in my hand, 
And wondering if I see you ever again, I'm crying oh 
Can't you see my heart is breaking? 
I'm crying oh 
Want to get my strength from up above, 
I'm crying oh 
My love she isn't taking 
I'm crying oh, 
Over you, It's been few nights that I spend my time at home, 
But some how I know, 
I'm not on this alone, 
Oh how I miss you baby. 
Looking at the pictures in my hand, 
Wondering if I see you ever again, I'm crying oh 
Can't you see my heart is breaking? 
I'm crying oh 
Want to get my strength from up above, 
I'm crying oh 
And my love she isn't taking 
I'm crying oh, 
Over you, Why don't you listen to me one's? 
There ain't no problem that we can't solve 
This is only for a season, 
We got to fight, 
We got to fight for our love, I'm crying oh 
Can't you see my heart is breaking? 
I'm crying oh 
Want to get my strength from up above 
I'm crying oh 
My love she isn't taking 
I'm crying over you.
