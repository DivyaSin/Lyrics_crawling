Is this love? 
Is this love? My thoughts keep drifting 
I can't keep my mind off you 
(Uh yeah) 
I stutter when I talk, stumble when I walk 
Is this what I should be feeling? 
Can't concentrate, can't hardly wait 
I wanna know, I wanna know Is this love what I've been waiting for? 
Is this love gonna happen tonight? Don't wanna waste no time if this ain't real 
Cause what I'm feeling is amazing 
Oh yeah 
Voted on a beautiful high 
On a high, on a high, on a high 
Wrapped up in you, I don't know what to do 
I wanna know, wanna know [Chorus] 
Is this love really what we're living for? 
Is this love gonna happen tonight? 
Uh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Is this love what I've been waiting for? 
Is this love the love of my life? I wanna feel the meaning of love, 
A message that's real, sent from above 
(Is this love?) 
Straight from the heart, 
(Is this love?) 
As real as the Sun 
(Is this love?) 
I'm waiting for love to come 
(Is this love?) 
(Is this love?) [Chorus]
