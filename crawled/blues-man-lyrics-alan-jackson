He's just a singer, a natural born guitar ringer 
Kind of a clinger to sad old songs 
He's not a walk-behinder, he's a new note finder 
But his name's a reminder 
Of a blues man that's already gone So he started drinkin', took some things that messed up his thinkin' 
He was sure sinkin' when she came along 
He was alone in the spot light, not too much left in sight 
She changed all that one night 
When she sang him this song Hey baby, I love you, Hey baby, I need you 
Hey baby, you ain't got to prove to me 
You're some kind of macho man 
You've wasted so much of your life 
Runnin' through the dark nights 
Let me shine a little love light 
Down on that blues man He got so sick from speedin', all the things they said he was needin' 
If he was to keep on pleasin' all of his fans 
He got cuffed on dirt roads, he got sued over no shows 
She came and took all that old load 
Down off that blues man, and he sang Hey baby, I love you too, Hey baby, I need you 
Hey baby, I do get tired of this travelin' band 
I'm over forty years old now, nights would be cold now 
If you hadn't stuck it out 
With this blues man He's over forty years old now, nights would be so cold now 
If she hadn't hung around 
With that blues man
