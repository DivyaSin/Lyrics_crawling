You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping 
You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping 
I've got your name on my credit card 
Now I go shopping shopping I know I was born with an expectation 
At rainbow's end, there's a pot of gold 
Who's gonna pay for my reservation 
For whom will I keep my love on hold You thought you could count on my devotion 
Thought you could play with my emotions 
I ain't gonna let things go your way 
You're still gonna hear me say You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping 
You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping 
I've got your name on my credit card 
Now I go shopping shopping You said, "I could trust your love forever" 
Seemed like a perfect to do 
You said that we'd always be together 
Then came the day when we were through I know that I put my love on offer 
When I saw the sunshine in your coffer 
It's time that you pay my promise back 
A sheer little shop attack You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping 
You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping 
I've got your name on my credit card 
Now I go shopping shopping I've got your name on my credit card 
I've got your name on my credit card 
I've got your name on my credit card You broke my heart 
A sheer little shop attack 
You broke my heart 
Shopping shopping You broke my heart 
A sheer little shop attack 
You broke my heart 
Shopping shopping You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping 
You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping You broke my heart 
And I go shopping shopping 
I've got your name on my credit card 
Now I go shopping shopping
