Man you had me fooled 
What I thought was me 
Was sorrow now 
You can see 
All them words (?) What you are 
Is a problem 
And you won't change me 
'Cause I'll never go 
No I never know Chocolate covered sheets 
(?) Well now I know I can 
Be save by you You and I 
Won't have to go 
And all my dreams 
Are part of you now 
They're a part of you now Please won't you go 
And set me down 
I'm not sure 
What goes on 
What goes on 
Yeah
