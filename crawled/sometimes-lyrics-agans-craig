Sometimes it's a shame 
Sometimes it's game 
Losin' sleep, trying to decide, who is to blame 
Sometimes it is me 
Sometimes it is not 
The one who does not deserve, all that he has got 
Sometimes you can run 
Sometimes you can hide 
But you can't get away from the feelings, buried deep inside 
Sometimes you can see 
Sometimes you can hear 
All that goes on around you, it seems perfectly clear 
Somebody might tell you 
Somebody might not 
Of a love that is growing, or of a love that now rots 
Somewhere beyond words 
Somewhere I can't tell 
It might be in heaven, it might be in hell..
