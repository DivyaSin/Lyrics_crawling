I've been most unwilling 
To see this turmoil of mine 
The thought of sitting with this 
Has me paralyzed With this prolonged exposure 
To near and averted eyes 
I think that I've been waiting 
Such mileage for empathizing Now I see the madness in me 
It's brought out in the presence of you 
Now I know the madness lives on 
When you're not in the room Though I'd love to blame you for all I wish 
I miss these moments of opportune 
You simply brought this madness to light 
And I should thank you Oh, thank you, much thanks for this birds eye view 
Oh, thank you for your most generous triggers It's been all too easy 
To cross my arms and roll my eyes 
The thought of dropping all arms 
Leaves me terrified And now I see the madness in me 
It's brought out in the presence of you 
Now I know the madness lives on 
When you're not in the room Though I'd love to blame you for all I wish 
I miss these moments of opportune 
You simply brought this madness to light 
And I should thank you Oh, thank you, much thanks for this birds eye view 
Oh, thank you for your most generous triggers It'd have to give up knowing 
And give up being right 
You inadvertent hero 
You angel in disguise Now I see the madness in me 
It's brought out in the presence of you 
And now I know the madness lives on 
When you're not in the room Though I'd love to blame you for all I wish 
I miss these moments of opportune 
You simply brought this madness to light 
And I should thank you Oh, thank you, much thanks for this birds eye view 
Oh, thank you for your most generous triggers
