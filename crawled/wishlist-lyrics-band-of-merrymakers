I wanna wake up in a snow globe 
Shake the silent out of your night 
Wanna dance around in my bathrobe 
Unwrap your love by the fire 
Even wonderlands of fun 
Are better with a loved one 
Don't mean a thing without you 
My wish list this xmas 
Is your lips on mine 
Cant help it I'm selfish 
But I'm all yours 
This Christmas night Fa la la la 
Your on my wish list! 
Fa la la la 
Your on my wish list! Can't wait for you to come over 
Wanna drift away in Yuletide 
I want cozy up on the sofa 
Let me be your naughty and nice 
A million of toys on the sleigh 
But I'd give em all away Cause it's no holiday without you 
My wish list this xmas 
Is your lips on mine oh 
Cant help it I'm selfish 
But I'm all yours 
This Christmas night Fa la la la 
Your on my wish list! 
Fa la la la 
Your on my wish list! It's all silver and gold 
Sweet chills in my bones
