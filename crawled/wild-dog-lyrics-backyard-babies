Did you get what you were looking for 
I think you're out of line 
Or did you find what you were hiding for 
It can't be dreams no more Bad dust and dangerous gals 
I'm gonna find my kisses in the moonlight 
Don't look for me when it's all too much 
'Cause I can do everything I want to do 
'Cause I'm like a dog without a bone 
I'm gonna move on like a rollin' stone 'Cause I'm a wild dog 
You know what I'm talkin' about 
Wild dog 
So bad wild dog 
And I'm coming over you 
Like a dog eat dog Did you find what you were looking for 
You must be out of your mind 
I didn't know what you were hiding for Bad dust and dangerous gals 
I'm gonna find my kisses in the moonlight 
Don't look for me when it's all too much 
'Cause I can do everything I want to do 
'Cause I'm like a dog without a bone 
I'm gonna move on like a rollin' stone 'Cause I'm a wild dog 
You know what I'm talkin' about 
Wild dog 
So bad wild dog 
And I'm coming over you 
Like a dog eat dog She looks so sweet 
She's just like a suicide 
I wanna taste you now 
Come on and do it, do it with me Like a dog without a bone 
I'm gonna fuckin' on like a rollin' stone 
'Cause I'm like a dog without your bone 
She said, dog eat dog eat Wild dog 
You know what I'm talkin' about 
Wild dog 
So bad wild dog 
And I'm coming over you Wild dog 
Wild dog 
Wild dog 
Wild dog God damn it I'm a wild
