Look like a lush. Talk like a tease 
The way you like it 
In front of your house, alone on the street 
You ask me to come inside 
Asleep through all our classes 
You hang me out to dry If this is a test 
I?m losing my shit 
Would it kill you to care 
As much as I did? 
If this is a test 
I'm wasting my breath 
You're a stranger I know well 
And not at all Heart on a hook thrown out to the sea 
Your basement busy 
Sitting in the dark, I turn the radio off for a 
Phone call you'll likely miss 
Wake me when it's over 
The last sound of goodbye Let's imagine the end before we even begin 
You said
