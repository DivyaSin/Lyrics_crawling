On a dark and dusty road 
The wind kicks up sleet and snow 
And Frank takes one more step away from home As the day began to dim 
A dark stranger approaches him 
"Can I cook you a meal, you look so thin" She said, "Beware of this filthy fen 
Danger lurks 'round every bend 
But we'll be safe once we reach my home" All she was was a witch in the rye 
Sucking life from the passers-by 
With a wink and a smile and sharpened teeth On your knees, between trees 
In the dark, on your knees 
In the dark, between trees 
Into the wild, into the wild 
My mouth won't make a sound because my face is on the ground In a dank and dimly lit room 
The witch brews up a tasty stew 
And Frank takes one more sip away from home Frank pulls from a flask of wine 
Unaware of the witch's design 
And soon the sordid spell begins to take hold And he drank and he drank and he drank 
What have you got yourself into Frank? 
Why can't you see how this is going to end? Vision blurred and all askew 
He bumps the witch right into the stew 
And passes out so warm so safe the end
