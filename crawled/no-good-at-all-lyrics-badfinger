Don't let your mother see you rock 
Don't let your mother see you roll 
Don't let your mother hear you knocking 
Don't let your mother see you go 
Don't ever let her see you out of your head 
Do you no good at all Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na Don't let your brother put you down 
Don't let your brother put you on 
Don't let your brother hear your barking 
Don't let your brother see you go 
Don't ever let him see you out of your head 
Do you no good at all Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na
