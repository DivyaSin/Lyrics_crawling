I heard she drove the silvery sports car 
Along the empty streets last night 
Hanging around 
With hair-dos like mine 
No I haven't seen the kids for some time Picked up her shoes from the red brick stairway 
Just like a harpsichordist she moves 
And back upstairs at half past two 
With a paper folded outside the loo Rain falls like Elvis' tears 
Oh no, no sugar tonight 
Out on the high street 
Dim all the lights and 
Cry coloured tears again And baby 
Don't forget to catch me 
Don't forget to catch me 
Don't forget to catch me 
Hobart paving, don't you think that it's time? 
On this platform with the drizzle in my eyes And baby 
Don't forget to catch me 
Don't forget to catch me 
Don't forget to catch me 
Hobart paving, don't you think that it's time? 
The ticket's in my hand, the train pulls down the line Rain falls like Elvis' tears 
Oh no, no sugar 
Out on the high street 
Dim all the lights and 
Cry coloured tears... And baby 
Don't forget to catch me 
Don't forget to catch me 
Don't forget to catch me 
Hobart paving, don't you think that it's time? 
On this platform with the drizzle in my eyes (Oh no no sugar tonight) don't forget to catch me 
(Oh no no sugar tonight) don't forget to catch me 
(Oh no no sugar tonight) don't forget to catch me 
Don't forget to catch me
