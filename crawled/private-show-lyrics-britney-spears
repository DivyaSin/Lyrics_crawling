Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh I want your attention in this room 
Your eyes on mine 
Sit you down, hop onto your pot of gold 
You make me come alive Swing it to the left, swing it to the right 
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights 
Dripping in smiles, they come on down 
Take your seat now Put on a private show 
Pull the curtains until they close 
I put on a private show 
We'll be whiling all on the low 
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it 
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it 
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it 
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it 
Put on a private show 
Pull the curtains until they close 
I put on a private show 
We'll be whiling all on the low We don't need crowds, we just need us 
Put my feelings up, about to be rough 
All my tricks, they're spectacular 
My encore is immaculate Swing it to the left, swing it to the right 
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights 
Dripping in smiles, they come on down 
Take your seat now Put on a private show 
Pull the curtains until they close 
I put on a private show 
We'll be whiling all on the low 
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it 
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it 
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it 
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it 
Put on a private show 
Pull the curtains until they close 
I put on a private show 
We'll be whiling all on the low Strut it out, strut it out, eyes on me (eyes on me) 
Watch me strike a pose, feel my heat (feel my heat) 
Spin around, spin around, three-sixty 
Ain't no boundaries here, the camera speaks 
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby 
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby 
Ooh, ooh, so entertaining 
Ooh, ooh Put on a private show 
Pull the curtains until they close 
I put on a private show 
We'll be whiling all on the low 
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it 
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it 
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it 
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it 
Put on a private show 
Pull the curtains until they close 
I put on a private show 
We'll be whiling all on the low Curtains are closing now 
Guess that's the end 
Can we go again? 
Can we do it all again? 
Nah, I'll take a bow 
Up, down, run it 'round 
Tasting all my apple pie 
Apple pie, satisfy
