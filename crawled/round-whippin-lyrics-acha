I'm faded in the car, it's like around one (Yo where you at?) 
I'm pullin' up, just make sure that you roll somethin' (Bet) 
4 A.M. drivin' in Rodeo 
We out here doin' donuts like tornadoes 
Cruisin' catch the sun in San Diego 
'Cause I said so I've been goin' 'round whippin' 
All through the night, me with a 
A two seater like 'round whippin' 
Gon' get it right, gon' get it right 
I've been goin' 'round whippin' 
All through the night, me with a 
A two seater like 'round whippin' 
Gon' get it right, gon' get it right Speeding down Pacific like a bullet 
If cops come then we gotta lose 'em 
On this road they love to hate on you 
But I'mma just keep on cruisin' 
After hours off La Brea 
Top down, but that's just how I stay up 
These lazy mothafuckas want a lay up 
See you later I've been goin' 'round whippin' 
All through the night, me with a 
A two seater like 'round whippin' 
Gon' get it right, gon' get it right 
I've been goin' 'round whippin' 
All through the night, me with a 
A two seater like 'round whippin' 
Gon' get it right, gon' get it right California dreamin' 
Long nights, long weekend 
45 at least and 
We gon' go up (Oh yeah, oh yeah) I've been goin' 'round whippin' (California dreamin') 
All through the night, me with a (Long nights, long weekend) 
A two seater like 'round whippin' (45 at least and) 
Gon' get it right, gon' get it right (We gon' go up) 
I've been goin' 'round whippin' 
All through the night, me with a 
A two seater like 'round whippin' 
Gon' get it right, gon' get it right
