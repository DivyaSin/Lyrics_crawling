God came down from heaven yesterday 
gave me somethin everybody else threw away 
made my life much beter than before 
to tell you the truth I cant explain too much at all I cant tell anybody 
what happened to me 
I cant tell anybody 
How does that make you feel ? Crossing the street and the lights all look the same 
people seem hypnotized and incapable of change 
You start up your engines and you run all your life 
tryin to find somewhere where you finally have time I cant tell anybody 
what happened to me 
I cant tell anybody 
how does that make you feel ? time is a concept, that ruins everything 
time was a mistake, everything is 
the whole is impossible to a tiny little mind 
gotta take the leap of faith and leave death far behind I cant tell anybody 
what happened to me 
I cant tell anybody
