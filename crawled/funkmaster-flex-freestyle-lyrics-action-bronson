[Verse 1: Action Bronson] 
You spent your advance on one trip to Six Flags 
With a handicapped class with your candy rap ass 
Bitch you singing like Frankie Lymon 
Fuck around, you might break your hymen 
Then somebody's gonna have to clean the mess up 
Like you fuckin spilled ketchup 
Fuckin flawless from the neck up 
If you want it better step up 
You dont wanna feel that brrat-tat-tat-tat 
Come through the fuckin ball court with Salt N' Pepa [Verse 2] 
If I die change my suit four times at the wake 
Make sure I get my dick sucked also 
Everybody wearing white clothes 
Crush cocaine, put it up your right nose 
You might see me lookin homeless 
Hoppin out the rover, parrot on my shoulder 
Just say what up, I might acknowledge you 
My shit is crazy, don't appear to be a common dude 
I only deal with people that invent shit 
Cause after rap there ain't no pension 
And I'm trying to be the next George Foreman 
Inventing new grills so Jadakiss could cook the base on it 
I might take a shit in some expensive jeans 
I got expensive habits 
My kids are mixed like Lenny Kravitz 
It's not me rappin it's the parrot 
And if I punch you in the face 
You'll never eat a mother fuckin sandwich [Verse 3] 
These dudes wanna claim king, youre dealing with the mortals 
Fuck being cordial I'm laughin while i'm dancin in the ball room 
Former king's head lay in the guillotine 
Snap my fingers chop that mother fucker 
Put a village to siege 
Ain't no man walking iller than me 
If you see me you better kneel on the knee 
I'm like a one in a million case 
Brilliant face, crooked J tryna put me in the cage 
Turn the page, bitch I'm paid 
I been around the world more than carmen sandiego 
Raw meat thrown to lions under the table 
Grown men breakin bread while your face bled 
Found face down in the shed like a base head 
Switch plates on a civic, pivot 
Exotic places that they rap aboout Ii live it 
Fat boy, I'm eatin all the spinach 
Hold up a second baby I ain't even finished (nah) 
Dropped 50k on my mans bail 
Two hours later he was as tan as a potato 
From a foreign land that once was occupied by NATO 
Every line is nasal 
We deal with more numbers than times tables 
Bodies get found in the ground by neighbors 
I'm in the bathroom reading the paper laid up 
Sharp blade cut, need a top girly girlies like it 
The ones that go two ways - it's just my blue phase 
Shit [Outro Freestyle] 
Im in the bathroom reading the paper laid up 
Butt naked in the lamborghini 
These mother fuckers can't see me 
The Magic Johnson of the game these lames don't want to play with me
