She said "You're terrible at stayin', 
Probably better that your goin', 
All the love that you have stolen is a crime" 
But I don't wanna lean on your piece of glass, just to fly. She said "You're always looking inside, why not reaching outside, 
Put some focus on a picture perfect wife." 
I said "The earth is turning 'round, you know, 
The wind is changing also, 
Don't you think the same laws might apply to life?" But I don't want to lean on your wedding bell 
Fare thee well 
I'll remain your friend 'til we meet again 
In the twilight I said everything is blurry, 
I almost can't tell you apart from all the other girls 
Except you don't complain. 
She said "Better fix your vision but I prefer the precision, 
Of everybody looking much the same". 
But I don't wanna lean on your paper back, let's turn the page. 
I will cheer you on 'til your game dissolves 
In the twilight. Oh, oh Magdalene, I love you, 
You think I'm insane, 
Well I'm leaving on evening's train 
Ah, hey Madonna, do the honors and pray for the day. Is the sun so selfish, because it will set now? 
Is the wind a jerk because it change? 
Would you call the earth an asshole 
For turning 'round n round you know, 
It never ever stays in just one place. 
Now if I'm not mistaken, the natural equation would be, 
You and I as best of friends for life. 
Cross all your lines and numbers, 
And wake up from the slumber 
Into a dream of neither day or night. But I don't want to lean on your wedding bell, 
Fare thee well. 
I'll remain your friend 'til we meet again, 
In the twilight 
In the twilight
