Dad, be still 
There is nothing you need say 
It can wait 
Shi, your mother's calling me Sometimes I wanted to cry 
When the people on TV were not quite the way we were 
Somehow I guess I just knew But I didn't know I'd love you so much 
I didn't know I'd love you so much 
I didn't know I'd love you so much but I do Sometimes I'd stay up all night 
Wishing to God that I was the one who died 
Sometimes there's not enough time But I didn't know I'd love you so much 
I didn't know I'd love you so much 
I didn't know I'd love you so much but I do I didn't know I'd love you so much 
I didn't know I'd love you so much 
I didn't know I'd love you so much 
But I do Shilo, go 
Dad, I will not leave you here 
You will live But you've already saved me, dear 
Now go and change the world for me 
And we will always have each other 
In our time of need Shilo, you're the world to me 
Daddy, you're the world to me
