[verse] 
What am I to do all by myself? 
When will the hurting be through? 
I didn't ever choose to feel this way 
Look I'm so lost and afraid 
But then you picked me up and pointed out the way 
Shook away the hurt and the pain 
Love is not a game people play 
You've made me realize there's so much love in me 
[refrain] 
You are the angel of my heart 
I knew it from the start 
You took away the tears 
And brightened up my heart 
You know I never thought I'd love again 
You are the angel of my heart 
[verse] 
When I'm close to you, I can't explain 
The sun shines bright everyday, oh baby 
Can't believe it's true, I'm in a daze 
It's something words can't explain 
Because you picked me up and showed me there's a way 
To wash away the hurt and the pain 
You've made me realize that it's okay 
I've kept so much inside, you've brought it out of me 
[repeat refrain] 
[bridge] 
I know I'll never need no one else 
Something I've never felt 
And my heart's overwhelmed 
I never thought I could feel this way 
Now I see, you were meant for me 
[repeat refrain till fade]
