Mmmmm! 
Ohhhhh! 
Every time youre giving it up 
You leave so unsatisfied 
Pointing the finger, 
The feelings that linger leave you asking questions why 
They talk a real good game 
But they dont know what a tongue is for 
They wine you and dine you 
You let them inside you 
It leaves you wanting more 
Chorus: 
I did my post grad in sociology 
So what I tell you might seem strange 
The things you dont know about your physiology 
You dont have to be ashamed! 
Let me show you how your pussy works 
Since you didnt bring it to me first 
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn 
Let me show you how your pussy works 
Bet you didnt know that it could squirt 
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn! 
You got to let him know that its not going on 
If hes not all about you, and gets up without you 
You dont need his ass around! 
Im gonna be your new best friend 
For those times when youre by yourself 
Im great in the shower, Im battery powered 
You can do it by yourself! 
Chorus: 
I got my post grad in sociology 
So what I tell you might seem strange 
The things you dont know about your physiology 
You dont have to be ashamed! 
Let me show you how your pussy works 
Since you didnt bring it to me first 
I got lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn 
Let me show you how that pussy works 
Bet you didnt know that it could squirt 
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn! 
Have you ever said oh god I came 
More than twice know that, thatd be insane 
We only just began and the best it will come! 
It will come! 
Chorus: (x2) 
Let me show you how your pussy works 
Since you didnt bring it to me first 
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn 
Let me show you how your pussy works 
Bet you didnt know that it could squirt 
I have lots of things to show you if youre ready to learn!
