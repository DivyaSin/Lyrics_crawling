Pit shaft wheels turn for the last time 
In the Rhondda tonight 
The Davey lamps that shone so brightly 
There's no more need for their light 
As the last piece of coal is cut 
From the belly of the black seamed hole 
A man walks home alone 
Past a church full of mourning souls 
Throughout his lifetime he has fought 
He has given his life 
In tears the congregation sing 
Cwm Rhondda Oh my Lord Great is the rape of the fair country 
To Botany Bay for my Great Grandfathers 
Deportation sailed Great so great is the fair country 
GREAT IS THE NEED FOR A NEW SOUTH WALES The slag heap stares 
It blocks out the sky 
It kees this Rhondda grey 
The stale beer spills from angry drinkers 
Their arguments do the same 
A choir voice cries it shatters the silence 
Where's the future in this place 
The question hangs unanswered 
All eyes on a new born babe 
In another lifetime men fought hard 
Men gave their lives 
For the charter that would save their sons 
Cwm Rhondda Oh my Lord Great, great change in the fair country 
The future lies with the sons and daughters 
South will meet with North 
Say, say a prayer for the fair country 
GREAT IS THE NEED FOR A NEW SOUTH WALES Throughout a lifetime men have fought 
Men have given their lives 
To hear the congregation sing 
CWM RHONDDA OH MY LORD Great, great change in the fair country 
The future lies with the sons and daughters 
South will meet with North 
Say, say a prayer for the fair country 
GREAT IS THE NEED FOR A NEW SOUTH WALES Someone hear my prayer 
Someone hear my prayer 
Someone hear my prayer 
Someone hear my prayer 
Someone hear my prayer 
Someone hear my prayer 
Someone hear my prayer 
For A NEW SOUTH WALES
