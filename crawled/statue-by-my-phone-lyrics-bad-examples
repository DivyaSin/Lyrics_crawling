Saturday night I stayed home waiting 
Sunday I thought she might call 
I don't go out, I don't go nowhere 
I'm like a statue by my telephone 
Maybe she's looking for my number 
Maybe she's looking for it everywhere 
She could break this spell I'm under 
I could come to life if I knew she cared I don't go out, I don't go nowhere 
I'm like a statue by my telephone 
I stay at home, I don't do nothing 
I keep on thinking she might call 
I'm like a statue by my phone Sunday night I'm feeling lonely 
Feel my heart as it turns to stone 
She could be my one and only 
But all I ever hear is my dial tone I don't go out, I don't go nowhere 
I'm like a statue by my telephone 
I stay at home, I don't do nothing 
I keep on thinking she might call 
I'm like a statue by my phone
