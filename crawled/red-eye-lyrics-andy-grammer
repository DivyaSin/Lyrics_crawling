I lost perspective of who I was, I hit the wall 
I knew that it would take a lot but it took it all 
No you don't come this far to turn around, covered too many miles 
No you don't get this close to breaking down just to close your eyes While the world sleeps under my feet tonight 
I'm chasing myself in the sky 
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight 
I'll be up here learning to fly 
When you know that you can't let go 
And your heart already knows 
Sure to hurt but it's worth it to be burned 
'Cause one day you'll get home 
Still it feels like I am always on the red eye This time around it's not even about getting paid 
I'm just an addict for the moment when the magic is made 
And when you are who you are who you really are 
It can put you through hell 
Spend a day in the skin that you want to live in 
To see how it feels While the world sleeps under my feet tonight 
I'm chasing myself in the sky 
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight 
I'll be up here learning to fly 
When you know that you can't let go 
And your heart already knows 
Sure to hurt but it's worth it to be burned 
'Cause one day you'll get home 
Still it feels like I am always on the red 
It feels like I am always on the red eye I'm finding myself these days 
Looking down from a window shade 
I'm counting lies on hours 
Just when I should be counting sheep 
Truth is I can't complain 
I do it over and over again and over again While the world sleeps under my feet tonight 
I'm chasing myself in the sky 
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight 
I'll be up here learning to fly While the world sleeps under my feet tonight 
I'm chasing myself in the sky 
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight 
I'll be up here learning to fly 
When you know that you can't let go 
And your heart already knows 
Sure to hurt but it's worth it to be burned 
'Cause one day you'll get home 
Still it feels like I am always on the red 
It feels like I am always on the red eye
