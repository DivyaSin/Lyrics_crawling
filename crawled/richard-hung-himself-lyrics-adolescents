Popped the door of the hinges of his closet 
Black curtained doorway and into the death room 
Took out the ceiling and climbed into the attic 
Tied the ropes to the rafter and he snapped into his doom 'Cause Richard hung himself 
Richard hung himself 
Just the other day they talking Richard hung himself 
They said that Richard hung himself They said too many reasons for him to cease to exist 
And not enough reasons for him to want to stay 
Looking for an escape, a better way than this 
He may have found it or may have lost the way 'Cause Richard hung himself 
Richard hung himself 
Just the other day they talking Richard hung himself 
They said that Richard hung himself Switch to Pomona behind the cornfield 
Around back, underground, where the trees shield 
In the corner of the yard, another death room 
Where the dead are buried in an unmarked tomb Stiff blue painted cat wired to the roof 
Cyanide in the darkness and dangling goat hooves 
Floor covered in dirt, dead grass, and decay 
Now Richard joins them and calls it escape Just the other day they talking Richard hung himself 
They said that Richard hung himself 
They said that 'Cause Richard hung himself 
'Cause Richard hung himself 
I know Richard hung himself 
'Cause Richard hung himself 
'Cause Richard hung himself
