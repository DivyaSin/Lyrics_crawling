People would say I'm lying 
If I tried to tell 'em how we met tonight 
They'd ask how many drinks I'd had 
'Cause ain't no way it all went down that right 
You waiting on somebody and they never did show 
You were pissed off, leaving, came back 'cause you forgot your phone There I was, yeah I just sat down in the seat you left 
You walked up I said "what are you doing with your beautiful self?" 
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on 
I begged you for a dance and we danced 
And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped 
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love 
Oh man, you can't make this up Then I walked you out to your car, it wouldn't start cause you left on your lights 
Then you just shook your head and laughed and said "I guess I need a ride" 
Then come to find out your house was just a block from mine 
Yeah this is one of those movie scene cool kinda things where the stars align 
Just an hour ago There I was, yeah I just sat down in the seat you left 
You walked up I said "what are you doing with your beautiful self?" 
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on 
I begged you for a dance and we danced 
And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped 
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love 
Oh man, you can't make this up You can't make up a night like this 
You can't make up a story like that 
It's one of those 
How in the world did it happen kind of things 
I'd never believe it if I didn't see it girl (yeah) There I was, yeah I just sat down in the seat you left 
You walked up I said "what are you doing with your beautiful self?" 
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on 
I begged you for a dance and we danced 
And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped 
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love 
Oh man, you can't make this up You can't make up a night like this 
You can't make up a story like that 
Oh no
