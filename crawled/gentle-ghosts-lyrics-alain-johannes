Just on the edge of my vision 
They're dancing and playing 
So joyfully loving 
Just on the edge of my hearing 
They're so sweetly saying 
The things that will heal me Just on the edge of this life 
Gentle Ghosts 
Gentle Ghosts Just on the edge of my thinking 
They're solving the riddles 
And posting the signs 
Just on the edge of my vision 
They're dancing and playing 
So joyfully loving Just on the edge of this life 
Gentle Ghosts 
Gentle Ghosts
