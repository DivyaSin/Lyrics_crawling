All aboard It was a big night in December, Chattanooga Tennessee 
All the old folks still remember that snowy Christmas Eve 
The way Santa saved that holiday, it's still hard to believe Oh, the weather man was calling for the snow to keep comin' down 
And the way that it was fallin', Rudolph never saw the ground 
By Christmas day, Santa's sleigh never made it to town Then all at once they heard that mighty whistle blow (ha ha) 
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe 
And then comin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke 
Pullin' sixteen, coaches shoutin' ho ho ho 
Who needs a sleigh, Santa's got a choo-choo train Well now, he could barely hold it comin' down the hill so fast 
Yeah that shiny locomotive made it town in no time flat 
But you can't go slow with a Christmas load coming down the railroad tracks When he pulled into the station and he finally shut her down 
There was a big old celebration, everyone gathered 'round 
They passed out toys to the girls and boys from miles around Then all at once they heard a mighty whistle blow (ha ha) 
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe 
And then goin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke 
Pullin', sixteen coaches shoutin' ho, ho, ho 
Who needs a sleigh, when Santa's got a choo-choo train Oh yeah, ain't need to fly away, Santa's got a choo-choo train Hmm, hmmm, yeah
