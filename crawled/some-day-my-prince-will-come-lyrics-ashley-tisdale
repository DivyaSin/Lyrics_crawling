Someday I will find my prince 
He may be far away 
But I know he will come 
Someday Prince of my dreams 
Far away 
To call my own 
Someday 
Prince of my dreams 
Far away 
To call my own 
Someday Someday my prince will come 
Someday I'll find a love 
And how thrilling that moment will be 
When the prince of my dreams comes to me He'll whisper I love you (I love you) 
And steal a kiss or two (Just one kiss) 
Though he may be far away 
I will find my love someday Someday we'll say and do 
The things we've been longing to 
And I'll know him the moment we meet 
For my heart will start skipping a beat 
Someday when my dreams come true Somewhere waiting for me 
There's someone I'm longing to see 
Someone I can't help but adore 
Who will thrill me for ever more? Someday we'll say and do 
The things we've been longing to 
And I'll know him the moment we meet 
For my heart will start skipping a beat 
Someday when my dreams come true Someday my prince will come (Someday my princess will come) 
And I will find my love (And I will find my love) 
And I'll know it the moment we meet (The moment we meet) Prince of my dreams 
Far away 
To call my own 
Someday 
Prince of my dreams 
Far away 
To call my own 
Someday Prince of my dreams 
Far away 
To call my own 
Someday 
Prince of my dreams (Prince of her dreams) 
Far away (Far away) 
To call my own (To call your own) 
Someday (Someday) Prince of my dreams (Prince of her dreams) 
Far away (Far away) 
To call my own (To call your own) 
Someday (My dreams will come true) 
Prince of my dreams (Prince of her dreams) 
Far away (Far away) 
To call my own (Call your own) 
Someday
