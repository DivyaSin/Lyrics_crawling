Thoughts of You and how You changed me 
Without You where would I be? 
So even though I've tried to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I always want to say so much more 
So with these simple words I'll try [Chorus] 
I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything God, I never could repay You 
You gave everything 
Without You where would I be? 
You still loved me even when I pushed You away 
You stood there and waited 
Till the day I'd return [Chorus]
