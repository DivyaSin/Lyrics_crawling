When you're down and out 
And you can't go on 
When the road you walk 
And the tears you cry 
Start to seem too much Look inside yourself 
For the strength to pull you through 
Gotta set your sights, it will be alright 
'Cause it all comes down to you, oh You can get it, you can have it all 
You can win it, never have to fall 
If the fires in your heart 
Everyday is a brand new start You can get it, you can change the vibe 
You can own it if hope is in your eyes 
All you gotta do is fight 
You can get, you can get it 
You can get, you can get it tonight When the times get tough 
And you can't breath free 
And the friends you make 
Won't return your calls And pretend you don't exist 
Look into my eyes 
'Cause you can always count on me oh You can get it, you can have it all 
You can win it, never have to fall 
If the fires in your heart 
Everyday is a brand new start You can get it, you can change the vibe 
You can own it if hope is in your eyes 
All you gotta do is fight 
You can get, you can get it 
You can get, you can get it tonight Reach for the highest, brightest star 
You'll be sure to catch the moon 
All your dreams are possible 
And you'll get there soon 
Yeah, you'll get there soon You can get it, you can have it all 
You can win it, never have to fall 
If the fires in your heart 
Everyday is a brand new start You can get it, you can change the vibe 
You can own it if hope is in your eyes 
All you gotta do is fight 
You can get, you can get it 
You can get, you can get it tonight You can get, you can get it 
You can get, you can get it tonight 
You can get, you can get it 
You can get, you can get it
