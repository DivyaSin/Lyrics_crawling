Oooh 
Aaah If you walk with your head down 
You can count every step you take 
I know every place I've been now 
I can count every mistake I've been hurt so many times before 
Almost forgotten how to dream 
All that I was running from 
Is all I need to save me I couldn't let you in my heart 
But now my defenses all fall apart 
Just when I thought I'd given up 
I have overcome 
And now I can let you go (Oh no) 
You show me something that I've never known 
And finally I found the one 
I have overcome I have overcome You can never see it coming 
There's always that one you can't count now 
Who keeps on believing 
Nothing's gonna stop me now I've been hurt so many times before 
Almost forgotten how to dream 
All that I was running from 
Is all I need to save me I couldn't let you in my heart (Oh) 
But now my defenses all fall apart (All fall apart) 
Just when I thought I'd given up 
I have overcome 
And now I can let you go (I can't let you go) 
You show me something that I've never known (Never known) 
And finally I found the one (I found the one) 
I have overcome I'm not running anymore 
'Cause now there's nothing left to hold me down 
Some things are worth fighting for 
I see it all - it's waiting for me now I couldn't let you in my heart 
But now my defenses all fall apart (All fall apart) 
Just when I thought I'd given up 
I have overcome 
And now I can let you go (I can't let you go) 
You show me something that I've never known (Never known) 
And finally I found the one (Ooh...) 
I have overcome I couldn't let you in my heart 
But now my defenses all fall apart (Fall apart) 
Just when I thought I'd given up (I'd given up, I'd given up) 
I have overcome 
And now I can let you go (Oh no) 
You show me something that I've never known (Never known) 
And finally I found the one 
I have overcome Oh, I have overcome 
Yeah, yeah
