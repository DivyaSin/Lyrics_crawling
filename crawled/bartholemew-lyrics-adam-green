Bartholemew bring me a fork 
There's a minstrel parade on tv 
Let the lights glow, an excellent reason 
To stay home tonight Oh the old men wave their canes 
They have yesterday's brains 
And their worlds stop turning on sundays 
The young lives are clipped 
And smudged on the rocks 
Distorted and forgotten Quietly she enters the room 
But we can't talk, we can not be seen 
Returning her new pair of jeans 
Just to stay home tonight Oh the mirror always shows 
There's a stranger in my clothes 
Standing on the third rail 
Lost at sea 
Searching for me 
And we don't know how to sail So if you go to guitar store 
You will see me again 
Holding the door 
It's an excellent night to sleep on the floor 
If you stay home tonight Oh I saw you before 
In the guitar store 
I was lonely, lazy and useless 
And Bartholemew moans 
To the counterfeit clones 
When he feels like he's not a human
