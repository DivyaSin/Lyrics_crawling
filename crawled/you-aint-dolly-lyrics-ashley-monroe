You ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter 
She's a little bit fuller and you're a whole lot shorter 
Let's dance all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters 
'Cause you ain't Dolly, no, and you ain't Porter Well I noticed you right off the bat in those cowboy boots 
Who couldn't help but see you in that rhinestone suit 
That's cause I'm the reigning queen of karaoke night 
Well if I get drunk enough to sing, hell I just might Hey now, don't you worry cowboy, cause I'll get you through 
We'll sing a cheating song just like they used to do Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter 
She's a little bit fuller 
Yeah, but you're a whole lot shorter 
Let's drink all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters 
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter You'll probably see me country singing on The Voice someday 
Yeah and I'm the guy they wrote about in 50 Shades of Grey 
Why don't you come on back to my place and you can have your way 
Well baby that sounds tempting, but I just can't stay 
Oh we won first prize cowboy, let's just split the dough 
Honey I will always love you, but we'll never know Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter 
She's a little bit fuller 
Yeah, and you're a whole lot shorter 
We danced all night and filled the jukebox full of quarters 
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter, no 
No, you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
