Marjie 
I wish you could see me now 
And we could look up 
And just wonder how 
We even got here 
How the stars do shine 
And how muchI'm sorry 
I wish that you could be mine Marjie 
Brush the hair from your eyes 
And smile 
Crooked and wide 
While we lay out 
Under the music 
On the bridge where we lost it 
All do to me And that first night 
Before midnight 
I missed my chance 
Wish I could make it right 
And that first kiss 
That I did miss 
I'm fucking pissed 
I fucked up my life Marjie 
This summer I'll never forget 
And you'll never leave my mind 
You were the perfect fit 
Into my life 
Broken and wasted 
I know you're broken 
Let me fit it 
Marjie 
Your beauty shines brighter 
Than all these fucking stars 
And Marjie 
Your voice lifts me higher 
You're perfect to me because we are who we are And that first night 
Before midnight 
I missed my chance wish I could make it right 
And that first kiss 
That I did miss 
I'm fucking pissed 
I fucked up my life Forgive me 
Forgive me 
Don't forget me 
Forgive me And that first night before midnight 
I missed my chance 
Wish I could make it right 
And that first kiss 
That I did miss 
I'm fucking pissed 
I fucked up 
And that first night before midnight 
I missed my chance 
Wish I could make it right 
And that first kiss that I did miss 
I'm fucking pissed 
Come back in my life
