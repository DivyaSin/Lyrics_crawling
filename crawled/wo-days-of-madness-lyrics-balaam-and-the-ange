Worked all week stayed out of trouble 
Walking straight not seeing double 
Ooh it looked so easy 
Then you came along and burst the bubble 
I saw the monster 
Creeping up on you 
His eyes are looking greedy 
Quite a lot like you 
I've seen that look before now 
Time after time 
Another shot of this 
And you'll feel fine 
Two days of madness 
Well it's been so long since I've been so gone 
I was outta my head but having fun 
Ooh you know that feeling 
When you can't recall the things you done
