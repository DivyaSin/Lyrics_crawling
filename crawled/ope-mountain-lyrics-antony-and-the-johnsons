Hope Mountain 
Is the place where 
The girl first dawned her face 
For the crowd 
That was gathered 
Outside her dark white cave 
And then scores of 
Soaring eagles 
Lift her to the breaking day 
We are waiting (We laid there) 
And we're watching (Gently resting) 
The waters as they sigh (On the golden green) 
Hope Mountain (In the falls) 
Is the place where (Of the foxes) 
The people come to cry (The hungry and relieved) 
She was born (Its time to) 
Like a diamond (Take a wild flight) 
Out of the mountainside (And let things start again) 
She treasures our (Its time to) 
Brokenness (To produce whats right) 
And will raise us from the tide (And start to make amends) 
Look. 
Look in the water. 
Look who it is. 
It's Jesus. 
This time shes a girl. 
This time shes a girl.
