This is not the end - it's just another song 
It's only one opinion, right or wrong 
Open up your heart - just one more time for me 
Before we turn to face reality 
Don't stop to think 
This perfect chance may never come again 
This is not the end Let me use your ears - just for a little while 
I've got to find a way to make you smile This is not my fault, I'm not responsible 
These tiny grooves can only take so much 
There's only one more thing I have to say to you 
So long for now, be sure to keep in touch 
This is not the end
