Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, ah 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey You're playin' with my thunder 
Heavens knows I sometimes wonder who you are 
You're so sweet but on the street 
Who do you meet when we're apart? I see trouble rollin' off you like rain 
But I look up and I see lightning again Between the lies and rumours, there's a world of mystery 
Baby but I believe in you, do you believe in me? Hey I fell in love with danger, now I'm going 
Through all these changes by myself, ooh 
You're too cool to play by the rules 
But I can't fool with someone else People saying things I don't wanna hear 
But something tells me we've got nothing to fear Between the lies and rumours, there's a world of mystery 
Baby but I believe in you, do you believe in me? Too many heartaches, too little love 
So many reasons for breaking us up 
We've got something nobody knows 
We got it good, you know I can't let it go With all the lies and rumours, sometimes you gotta roll the dice 
But I believe in you and your cool blue eyes, baby Between the lies and rumours, there's a world of mystery 
Baby but I believe in you, do you believe in me? Hey La la, la la, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
La la, la la, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
La la, la la, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
