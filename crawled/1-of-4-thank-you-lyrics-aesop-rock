1 of 4... My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz 
I was born in 1-9-7-6, at Biosfet hospital, located in Long Island, NY 
I am 6 foot, four I weigh 2-0-0 pounds 
I have brown hair and green eyes 
I enjoy writing songs, painting, movies and diner food 
I have two brothers, Chris and Graham 
and two parents, Paul and Jameija 
In august of 2-0-0-1 I went crazy.. This was originally not for public consumption 
This was made for four people... four people that literally saved my life 
They know who they are.. 
And ahhh I mean I could live to be a thousand years old and never re-pay them 
I don't think this song would pay them 
But hopefully by putting it out, push the bank a little further.. This ain't a burner for the whips (no it isn't) 
This ain't even Aesop Rock fly earthworm demeanor (no it isn't) 
My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz and I was born in Long Island, New York 
Seventy Six, before Graham and after Chris... OK 
In August of 2001 my seemingly splinter-proof brain bone, scaffolding imploded 
I kept it on the hush, but nearly tumbling 
to the cold hard concrete on near bodega trips 
for cigarettes and soda, shook me to casper 
Dizzy with a nausea chaser, motor sensory eraser 
Gorophobe tunnel vision, guilt, self loathing arrangements 
Rose rapidly out a bog I'd never fished in 
that abates three separate foreign meds 
While I use the hook line and sinker simple fishing 
Simple primitive self taught, easing of soul, mind and body 
but the symptoms rejected my cave-man modus operandi 
So now it's one fish belly up, through medicated mileage 
Shrinks that get 250 an hour for awkward silence 
And, I'd be lying if I said all of this 
made even the slightest fragment of sense to me 
That's real... Simply put 
I don't know what happened, or what's still happening 
I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity 
JAIME, I killed the robots and I'm sorry 
Broke down in front of you, embarrassed 
but you lent a heart and hand that only you could 
you're one of my best friends and yes I'd take that bullet for you 
That's my word, which is about all I have left 
TONY, I know you know I'm crazy, 'cause you told me 
but that did never bother you, I hold you as my brother 'til death 
And I got your back if ever the drunk goblin step 
for makin' a cat laugh, when I was walking with the dead 
KATHERINE, mother figure, older sister, concerned be a limits 
Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this 
Continuous offers for vacation, Chicago visits 
Talked me through repair of a head full of broken pistons 
RIYAH, for the late night movie rentals and the company I needed 
An' you knew it, but I just wouldn't admit it 
You listened to me blab about my issues for hours 
Offer incredible advice, gave me a hug when I was finished 
Am I a jack of all trades? Nope... I like to write songs tho' 
Are they good? I dunno.. 
But I could tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it 
So take this how you want, but know I mean it 
I want you all to know that I'm scared 
Out my fuckin' crooked soul and never faced a monster like the last few months 
ever in my whole life... I wish I could explain this better (I can't) 
But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive 
So I guess this is my feeble way to thank you 
Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness 
I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement 
'Cause without y'all I may not have a life to offer, take it Thank you 
I wish I could explain this better. (Thank you) 
I'm sorry for burdening your pleasures. (Thank you) 
I love you all with all that's left of me. (Thank you) 
For helping try to kill what made a mess of me. (Thank you) 
Somehow, someway. (Thank you) 
I'ma get you back someday. (Thank you) 
Just gotta figure this all out... So.. I guess it is kind of funny when you look at it from a step back 
How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures 
Other men operate normally under 
I have soaked this out from all angles, walking through time 
I have been over everything in my head, still I can't think anymore 
But I guess some times, when you can't breathe, there are people there 
to breathe for you 
I am lucky enough to have those people around me 
Thank you for helping me to not die 
Thank you for helping me to not die Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt 
Cockpit full of memories and a dream full of guilt
