(Intro) {Sax Solo} (Verse 1) 
I am the monster under your bed 
My skin is all green;my hair is dead red (Hook) 
Deep in the night I come to awake you 
I come to awake you 
I become visible;I come to awake you 
I come to awake you 
I become visible;I come to awake you 
I come to awake you 
I come to awake you 
I come to awake you 
I become visible;I come to awake you 
I become visible 
I come to awake you (Verse 2) 
I shall manifest dressed in all black 
My immortal perfection shows what you lack 
I vamp in the night if the vapors right 
Caustic exhaustion burns the night (HOOK) 
Through bloodshot eyes and slurring speech 
All the dark angels die to the beat 
This violent rhythm 
Takes me deep 
Takes me deep 
Takes me deep 
Takes me deep (Verse 3) 
I am the voice that lives in your head 
I came from the monster under your bed 
My vowels scatter;my consonants fall 
All the body in the east obey my beckoned call 
'Cause (Hook) 
Deep in the night 
I scream and awake you 
I scream and awake you 
I become audible 
And i awake you 
And i awake you(pitch) 
Deep in the night 
I scream and awake you 
And i awake you 
I become audible 
And i awake you 
And i awake you 
And I awake you 
And i awake you 
And i awake you 
I awake you (Bridge) 
I am the monster under your bed 
I come from the land Ecnaderif 
West sides made of fire 
East side of rain 
And I will not tell u again (Hook) 
Deep in the night 
I scream and awake u 
And i awake you 
I become audible 
And I awake you 
And i awake you 
And i awake you 
And i awake you 
And i awake you 
I awake you Deep in the night 
I scream and awake u 
And i awake you 
I become audible 
And I awake you 
And i awake you 
And i awake you 
And i awake you 
And i awake you 
I awake you (Outro) 
I-I vamp in the night if the vapors right 
Caustic exhaustion burns the night 
Through bloodshot eyes and slurring speech 
All the dark angels 
Die to the beat 
Die to the beat 
Die to the beat Through bloodshot eyes and slurring speech 
All the dark angels 
Die to the beat 
Die to the beat 
Die to the beat
