We've been running round this world too much, girl 
Trying not to see 
But no freer then, we can see again 
Now the old corruption packed its ransom sack 
Buttoned his dirty Mac 
He won't be coming back with us, 
He won't be welcomed back Oh you, you never show your face no more 
Slam the door 
Changes... But if, oh... if you should fall 
I vow today to pay tomorrow 
The debts you owe to sorrow We've been running round this world too much, girl 
Trying not to see
