Lead, lead, lead me on to the light 
Oh, take my hand, precious Lord 
And lead your child home And when my, when my way goes dreary 
Precious Lord please linger near 
And oh, when my, when my life is almost, almost gone 
Father, Father, Father hear my cry, Lord And oh, hear my call and hold, hold my 
Hold my hand [Incomprehensible] Jesus lest I fall 
Oh, take my hand, precious Lord 
And lead me, lead me on
