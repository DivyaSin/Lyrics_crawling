in a minute they'll be coming for us 
for us 
some odd times, we will be turning 
turn in 
i don't wanna be their prisoner 
i don't wanna get caught up again 
take me down and i'll keep breaking out 
and out aching, i keep running 
aching behind your skin 
aching, fever in the road 
come now! 
come around 
oh! there's a man who's got something for you 
for you 
covered out in all your secrets 
secrets 
treat him like things you need to hear 
holding on to broken souvenirs 
pull the strings, start to reappear 
appear aching, i keep running 
aching behind your skin 
aching, fever in the road 
come now! 
come around 
oh! (x2)
