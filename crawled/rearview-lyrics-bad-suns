You wear your hair down, your face is made up 
You know this town so well, you talk a lot, it's okay 
Pretend that you look the same, a crown of a different edge 
You wonder where it went Feels so far from home, try to fill a hole 
Sunset in the rearview, losing your control 
No matter what she took, it feels so far from home 
Sunset in the rearview losing your control 
Losing your control That quarter moonlight, rev up the engine 
The rusty neon glow, complain a lot, it's okay 
The city's just ain't the same, shadow of a brighter day 
You wonder where it went, though Feels so far from home, try to fill a hole 
Sunset in the rearview, losing your control 
No matter what she took, it feels so far from home 
Sunset in the rearview losing your control 
Losing your control, losing your control Man you keep calling, time starts scrolling by 
Knows how the hedges behind you 
You keep running, time starts scrolling by 
The fact is there's no one behind you Feels so far from home, try to fill a hole 
Sunset in the rearview, losing your control 
No matter what she took, it feels so far from home 
Sunset in the rearview losing your control 
Losing your control, losing your control, losing your control, you're losing your control 
Losing your control, losing your control, losing your control
