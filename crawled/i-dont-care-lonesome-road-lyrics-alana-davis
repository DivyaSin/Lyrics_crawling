Soul driving down this lonesome road 
Somewhere, somewhere someone's waiting 
You're leaving with a part of me 
Stolen, stolen time that once was mine 
Precious words we left unheard Desert me and deceive me but I don't care 
I don't care anymore 
You love me then you leave me but I don't care 
I don't care anymore Heart stepping through the door alone 
Somewhere, somewhere someone's longing 
Smiled, someone at the red light smiled 
Saved me, saved me from my inner strife 
Baby, he just saved my life
