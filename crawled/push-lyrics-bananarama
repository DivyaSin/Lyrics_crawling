(chorus 1) 
Pushing pushing pushing 
On the streets at night 
He doesn't care what's wrong 
He doesn't know what's right 
Working so fast and now he's moving along 
You'll never know 'til he's gone Take a look at his face 
Tell me what does it say 
(What does it say) 
If you step out of place 
Then you'll just have to pay 
(You'll have to pay) (bridge 1) 
'Cos this is the game and the price is high 
You'll get the blame but you won't know why 
You won't know why (chorus 1) (chorus 2) 
Pushing pushing pushing 
On the streets at night 
He doesn't care what's wrong 
He doesn't know what's right 
Working so fast and now he's moving along 
You'll turn around and he's gone They say the crime doesn't pay 
Well that's how it goes 
(That's how it goes) 
It's harder every day 
That's all he knows 
(That's all he knows) (bridge 2) 
He'll take a chance to get what he needs 
No second plans with his dirty deeds 
His dirty deeds (chorus 1 & 2) (bridge 1) (chorus 1 & 2) Pushing... 
Working so fast and now he's moving along 
You'll turn around and he's gone (chorus 1 & 2 ad lib) publishing : In A Bunch Music Ltd / J&S Music 1984
