Driving down the road 
Under the southern light 
Looking back to see 
Where we've come from 
As we watched the sun go down 
Rain it fell like diamonds 
From Kimberley mines 
On the road to Jo'burg 
With the dying light 
Farewal Durban 
City of Natal 
Stopped a while to stretch my thoughts 
As we crossed the borderline 
And into Transvaal I saw the sun go down 
Under the southern skies 
Over and over 
I'll always remember 
Those beautiful African nights In the old VW 
We'd count the miles 
We traveled with a friend 
Whose name was Farr 
The stories that he told us 
Talked of faces 
Times and places 
Sang and played his guitar Driving down the road 
We hear the morning rise 
Leaving all the past 
So far behind 
The sound man played the Eagles 
As we listen 
"Take It Easy" 
Echoes on through our lives
