Time is movin' quickly 
I have never seen it go so fast 
I was tryin' to recover but my 
watch was just a minute fast 
It's not that I haven't been there though 
I just cannot stand to let you go.. 
And I have to say 
It shouldn't be that way 
What I have to do 
Is get through to you 
That all I've got to give is yours 
if I can give it to you 
All I've got to give is yours 
if I can give it to you.. 
Bums are sleepin' in the alley 
you can hear the streetcats cry 
But I can't get no rest, i doesn't 
really matter where I lie 
Sometimes I think I should be feeling sad 
but then I end up thinkin' that it ain't so bad.. 
{chrous} 
Well, the night is growin' heavy 
I can barely get up off the floor 
I've been tryin' to forget you 
but I think about you more and more 
It used to be such a simple thing 
to wait around and see what would tomorrow bring.. 
{chorus}
