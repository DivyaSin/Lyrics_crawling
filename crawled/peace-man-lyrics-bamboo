I have words to say to you my friend 
Is it hard to know what's right from wrong 
Have you ever felt your life so self assured 
You don't know the things that you've done wrong And then we'll say At first it seems so daunting 
How to start or how to grow 
But make believe becomes a living 
'cause in life, in life you will know We'll rip out our covers 
Shake the walls until they break 
I'll hold out my hand to you 
Supreme love and respect 
Peace man
