Do you remember how we used to kiss in the rain 
I thought that would never be the same 
When we found ourselves rulling around So tonight you and I running through the lines 
We ignite like the fight never die 
Turn me on, leave me on , let me be the one 
I know you just like that oh my [Chorus] 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful When I left you, I thought I never did endure the pain 
So that my heart will never beat together 
Pick me up, then keep throwing me down , down So tonight you and I running through the lines 
We ignite like the fight never die 
Turn me on, leave me on , let me be the one 
I know you just like that oh my [Chorus: x2] 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful It's like the time moves slow 
And when I let you know 
Take my hand I'll fly 
Into your heart, into your heart 
And you could be mine You could be mine x6 [Chorus: x2] 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 
You're beautiful 
You're beautifu
