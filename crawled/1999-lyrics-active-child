I think about you all the time 
Wonder if when you think of me you smile 
Because from the moment we met we were out of our heads 
I know So the story goes 
Man and a woman linger alone Thinking that you're all that 
Unaware of this life that we're living 
Thinking that you're all that 
On with this life that we're living Tell me, do you know? 
When I'm looking out, rip through soul 
Looking out, rip through soul 
Sit back and let the days unwind 
Somewhere between now and 1999 
And back in that time I was only a boy 
Soon a man don't you think? 
Now it's gone So the story goes 
Makes you want to lay down 
With the one that you love Thinking that you're all that 
Unaware of this life that we're 
Thinking that you're all that 
Unaware of 
(All that) 
(Unaware) 
(That's you'll)
