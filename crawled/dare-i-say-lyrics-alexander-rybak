Far from a place where I'm writing a song 
There is a girl to whom my heart belongs 
She doesn't know that I'm thinking of her 
But again that's not the point She makes me glad just by being alright 
Though I would wish that just for one night 
She would come back and again we'll be friends 
Like those times where love never ends Watching your picture, I feel I'm with you 
And your hand is flirting with mine 
Maybe it's pointless but what can I do 
Knowing you're one of a kind 
Honestly I know I'll be fine But dare I say you are amazing in every way? 
And would you mind if we woke up with each other each day? 
But then I remember that I'm just a guy 
And still I keep dreaming of you 'cause that's all I can do You said you love him the last time we met 
Please tell your boyfriend that I'm not a threat 
I know the difference between right and wrong 
But again that's not the point Sometimes I sleep with a smile on my face 
'Cause dreaming of you makes me glad 
And then I wake up while I'm still in my dreams 
The sweet kiss that we've never had 
Honestly, how foolish is that But dare I say you are amazing in every way? 
And would you mind if we woke up with each other each day? 
But then I remember that I'm just a guy 
And still I keep dreaming of you 'cause that's all I can do Dare I say? Would you mind? 
But there I say you are amazing in every way 
And would you mind if we woke up with each other each day 
But then I remember that I'm just a guy
