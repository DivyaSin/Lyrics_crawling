There is a house in New Orleans 
They call the Rising Sun 
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And God, I know I'm one My mother was a tailor 
She sewed my new blue jeans 
My father was a gamblin' man 
Down in New Orleans Now the only thing a gambler needs 
Is his suitcase and his trunk 
And the only time he's satisfied 
Is when he's gone and drunk Oh, mother, tell your children 
Not to do what I have done 
Spend your lives in sin and misery 
In the house of the rising sun Well, there is a house in New Orleans 
They call the Rising Sun 
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And God, I know I'm one And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And God, I know I'm one
