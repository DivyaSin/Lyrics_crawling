Well I got up in my sleep 
I had the devil chasin' me 
I had to run, I had to hide 
run away from him 
And I looked under my bed 
and I looked into my closet 
but I'm a tough grown man 
I had to get a little bit closer You know he came to me as a mule 
with dark red eyes upon it 
he came to me as a red-haired 
woman with a big tattoo 
and he let me free to pick, oh lord 
just pick one of the two 
but it ain't hard to tell 
for the very first time I knew You know he came to me as a mule 
with dark red eyes upon it 
he came to me as a red-haired 
woman with a big tattoo 
and he let me free to pick, oh lord 
just pick one of the two 
but it ain't hard to tell 
for the very first time I knew
