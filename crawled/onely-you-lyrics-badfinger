When I look into your tearful eyes 
I don't know what to do 
And though you say that I don't realize 
I sympathize with you 
Lonely you, only you, yes I do 
Lonely you, only you, lonely you When I ask you just to be my friend 
I want to lend a hand 
But if we get too close it's sure to end 
Oh can't you understand 
Lonely you, only you, yes it will 
Lonely you, only you, lonely You will really need a friend 
And friends are hard to find 
And harder still to keep 
Lonely you, lonely me Lonely you, only you, yes it will 
Lonely you, only you, lonely you 
Lonely you, lonely you
