{"Hey, nice piano playin', Manilla" 
"Thank you, Miss. M" 
"Whatcha doin' these days?" 
"Makin' records" 
"Really?" 
"Yes, really" 
"Do you still play piano for people?" 
"Well, depends on who"} 
I'm gonna get you on a slow boat to China 
All to myself alone 
Get you and keep you in my arms evermore 
Leave all the others waitin' on a faraway shore 
Out on the briny where the moon's big and shiny 
Melting your heart of stone 
I'm gonna get you on a slow boat to China 
All to myself alone 
Bette, I didn't know you felt that way about me 
I don't, I need a piano player 
Ahh, just like the old days 
You're not gonna change keys on me, are ya? 
Unh, huh 
Oh 
I'm gonna get you 
(You're never gonna get me) 
On a slow boat to China 
(Not in a fast or slow boat to any crick) 
All to myself alone 
(I just get motion sick) 
I'm gonna make you mine 
(Ha, you'll have to stand in line) 
Get you and keep you in my band evermore 
(Now there's a new attack) 
Leave all the others on the shore 
(For me they'd swim to China, to China and back) 
Out on the briny 
(I wouldn't like the ocean) 
Where the moon's big and shiny 
(Not even in a rowboat) 
Melting your heart of stone 
Come on, what do you say? 
(Ha, ha, you always get your way) 
I'm gonna get you on a slow boat to China 
All to myself alone, together 
All to myself alone
