Talking about you 
Down at Gino's 
He said he'd seen you 
Fooling around with John 
Well what do you think 
That you're doing with that loser 
He's never one for hanging around too long 
Something has gone wrong 
And I can see the change in you 
I was thinking maybe I should call you 
We need to talk about the way you act 
We've got to sit down 
And work it out together 
Cause you've changed and, 
baby, that's a fact 
Why do you seem so amused 
You never used to be so cruel 
Why am I confused 
I can't believe it
