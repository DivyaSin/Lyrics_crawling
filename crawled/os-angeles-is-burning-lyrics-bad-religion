Somewhere high in the desert near a curtain of a blue 
The sane man skirts under the wind 
But down here in the city of the lime lights 
The fans of Santa Ana are witherin' 
And you can't deny that living is easy 
If you never look behind the scenery 
It's showtime for drag lines 
And bedlam is dreamin' of rain When the hills of los angeles are burnin' 
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind 
So many lives on the breeze 
Even the stars are ill at ease 
And los angeles is burnin' This is not a test 
Of the emergency broadcast system 
When Malibu fires and radio towers 
Conspire to dance again 
And I cannot believe the media Mecca 
They're only trying to battle reality, catch it on prime time, story at nine 
The whole world is goin' insane When the hills of Los Angeles are burnin' 
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind 
So many lives are on the breeze 
Even the stars are ill at ease 
And los angeles is burnin' A plague that reads 
The end of days 
Shotgun roundabouts are bending in the haze More a question than a curse 
How could hell be any worse? The flames are startin' 
The cameras runnin' 
So take warnin' When the hills of Los Angeles are burnin' 
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind 
So many lives are on the breeze 
Even the stars are ill at ease 
And los angeles is burnin'
