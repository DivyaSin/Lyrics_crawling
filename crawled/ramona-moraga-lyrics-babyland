As if isolation's not enough 
Just try to organize and rise above it 
Then you'll find out what it's all about 
This is not my community 
This is not what I represent 
Participation's breathing down my neck 
There's no way I'm giving in 
But still you're stuck living in ... 
Ramona 
Where there's nothing more than meets the eye 
A peaceful lie for vat-grown teenage alcoholics 
Unchallenged by adversity 
Disjoint from history 
And pinned down by boredom 
In lowered trucks and concert shirts 
It's a great place for children and pets 
It's a rural cage with no need for walls 
The blind youth crawl insanely towards the nets 
In search of identity 
They're already condemned to 
Poorly planned pregnancies and vocations 
But you know what 
They don't want 
(Welcome to Del Taco, may I take your order?) 
All the politics of growing up 
As if coping with it ain't enough 
You try to organize and rise above it 
Because you found out what it's all about (bullsh ...) 
This is not my community 
This is not what I represent 
Participation's breathing down my neck 
There's no way I'm giving in 
But still you're stuck living in ... 
Moraga 
It won't let things change 
An upper-crust fairy tale for the popular and decent kids 
Ignorant of reality 
Handed everything from hatred to their G.T.I. 
Ganja, kegs and football games 
With the cops there to keep out all minorities 
A quiet fraud buried in the hills 
Where schooling means exclusivity, intolerance and hypocrisy 
And the sad thing is 
You better get used to it 
Because high school, it never ends 
Welcome to the system 
(You got a problem with me?) 
This is not our community 
This is not what we represent 
Participation ain't where it's at 
There's no way we're giving in 
Yet still we're stuck living in 
R.A.M.O.N.A. M.O.R.A.G.A. 
R.A.M.O.N.A. M.O.R.A.G.A. 
(Hey, where're ya from?)
