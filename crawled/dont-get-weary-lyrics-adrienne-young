Don't get weary, don't get weary children 
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball Nashville full of big hotels, 
Chattanooga full of saloons 
Knoxville full of republicans 
And Memphis loves the Blues Don't get weary, don't get weary children 
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball Wish I had a sugar rump, 
Sugar by the pound 
Great big bowl to stir it in 
Pretty gal to hand it around Don't get weary, don't get weary children 
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball Big bee sucks the blossom, 
Little bee makes the honey 
Poor man picks cotton and corn, 
Rich man see the money Don't get weary, don't get weary children 
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball Daddy had a big ole gal; 
He brought her from the South 
Hair so curly on her head, 
She could not shut her mouth Don't get weary, don't get weary children 
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball People on the corner 
Watching us go by 
Could not see us very long, 
'Cause Bobtail, he could fly
