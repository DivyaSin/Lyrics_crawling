I am lost and I am lonely and I 
I am cursed and I am empty 
Turning to stone 
My heartbeats growing slow 
Now where can I go 
When I need strength the most 
I'll find a home I was done and I hurt you and I 
I was worn but followed through 
Stabbing through your heart 
I knew we'd fall apart 
Now where do I go 
At night, when I'm alone 
I'll find a home And I can see your smile 
And I can see your tears I 
But I can't see tomorrow 
But I can feel my fears I am raw and I am barren and I 
I am new and I am wanting 
Searching for truth 
My body's bleeding you 
Rejecting empty promises, the fights 
Seeking closure tonight And I can see your smile 
And I can see your tears I 
But I can't see tomorrow 
But I can feel my fears But I can't see tomorrow 
But I can feel my fears 
But I can see your smile 
And I can feel my tears I'll find a home, I'll find a home 
I'll find a home, I'll find a home
