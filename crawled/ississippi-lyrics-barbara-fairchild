Where you can hear a country song for fun 
And someone plays the honky tonk guitar 
Where all the lights will go out one by one 
Where people join the song 
And the wind takes it away 
Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea 
And lovers found the place they like to be 
How many times before this song was ending 
Love and understanding everywhere around 
Mississippi I'll remember you 
Whenever I shall go away 
I'll be longing for the day 
That I will be in Greenville again 
Mississippi you'll be on my mind 
Every time I hear this song 
Mississippi roll along 
Until the end of time Now the country song forever lost its soul 
When the guitar picker turned to rock 'n' roll 
And every time when summer nights are falling 
I always will be calling dreams of yesterday 
Mississippi I'll remember you
