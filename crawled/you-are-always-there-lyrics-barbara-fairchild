I love to say your name even when you're not around 
I just love the way it sounds it's music to me 
I love to dream of you even when I'm not asleep 
Baby your love just keeps gettin' deeper in me 
Darlin' you are always there 
No matter where I am you're never far away from me 
And baby you are always there 
You're everywhere and you've become a part of me 
[ piano ] 
When I have to leave your side you know it doesn't worry me 
I've got your love inside of me each and every day 
When I have to face the world you know I'll feel so secure 
Cause baby I know for sure you're with me all the way 
Darlin' you are always there...
