What will we do when the morning comes? 
When we say goodbye, will we let go let go slow? 
And how will it be in the future? 
Will it feel the same? 
Will we remember? Here comes that love again, and it just won't stop us 
So we try to be together 
Spend all of a lifetime 
Trying to find the love we've got 
Can we try to stay together? And who will we call at the end of the day? 
When I check the machine will it be your name? 
And how will I know when to turn out the light 
Or save you a place forever? Then here comes that love again, and it just won't stop us 
So we try to be together 
Spend all of a lifetime 
Trying to find the love we've got 
And will it last forever? And how can I be true? 
And how can I be true and still have you? And what will we do when the morning comes? 
When we say goodbye, will we let go slow? 
And how will it be in the future? 
Will we feel the same? 
Will we remember? Here comes that love again, and it just won't stop us 
So we try to be together 
Spend all of a lifetime 
Trying to find the love we've got 
Can we try to stay together? As we pull away, as we pull away 
As we pull away, as we pull away As we pull away, as we pull away 
As we pull away, as we pull away
