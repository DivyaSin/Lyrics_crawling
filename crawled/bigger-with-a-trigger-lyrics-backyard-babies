Ao! 
What were you thinkin' 
When you went down? 
It's kinda funny 
Since we always stuck around 
Yeah! 
What were you doin' 
What went so bad? 
You and me togheter 
And everything we had 
Run into a future 
Try not hiding from my past 
I'm looking for tomorrow 
And the next day just as fast 
On...ly one... 
Only lonely one 
Paranoia mornings 
Nightmares in my bed 
To hard to fuckin' cry 
So I'd rather sweat instead 
Yeah! 
No zero numbers 
Just having fun 
No time for seconds 
I'm the only lonely one 
Run into a future 
Try not hiding from my past 
I'm looking for tomorrow 
And the next day just as fast 
On...ly one... 
Only lonely one 
Never pull the trigger 
Cause your finger's working best 
Ao! 
Run into a future 
Try not hiding from my past 
I'm looking for tomorrow 
And the next day just as fast 
You want it all 
You do not want the rest 
On...ly one... 
Only lonely 
You think you're bigger 
With a trigger
