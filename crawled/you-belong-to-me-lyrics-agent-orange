(i can change anything) 
You're all alone - just staring at the phone 
As if you're reaching out to dial my number 
I hear your voice - I hear you call my name 
You know I only want to change your destiny you know - you belong to me hang up and then - it rings again 
This time I know it's you - no, I won't answer 
Unplug the phone - I want it to be known 
I need a chance to cause a new catastrophe
