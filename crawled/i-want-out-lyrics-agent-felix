tears dripping on the ground 
I see this barrel staring up at me 
will the trigger set me free 
my legs are shaking as I 
decide if I'll consider one more try 
or if I'll end it all tonight I need to know that someone cares 
I need to know that someone's here 
cause that's never been the case with me 
so I will bow out gracefully 
and save everyone the breath 
that they don't need to waste on me anywhere is better than here 
my body limits me from my dreams 
I'm more alive when I'm asleep 
destination unknown right now 
I see my soul dancing in the sky 
free from all this pain and strife 
I cried up high last night I begged 
I begged for you to come down and to 
help me with my life 
but I haven't heard back from you 
that's ok cause I am through 
its too late now I made up my mind all I need is someone to take my hand 
and tell me that I'll be ok 
I'm not as alone as it seems I want out tears falling to the ground 
that's the last one I will loose 
you cut me up so I'll show you all I need is someone to take my hand 
and tell me that I'll be ok 
I'm not as alone as it seems 
say my good-byes to my misery 
this is the last of it I will see 
cause I want out I am through 
its hard to live when you know 
no one cares for you
