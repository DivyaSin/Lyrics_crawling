Asap, asap 
I'm so tired of creepin' around 
I'm walking on eggshells 
Like a thief in the night 
Sneaking in and out of your house 
See, your momma don't like me 
I admit that I'm no angel 
But I treat her with respect 
Still she don't care Baby, believe me 
My patience is running on empty Your momma's in my business 
Can you tell her to let me be, asap 
She's been on my nerves from day one 
(what's going on? ) 
Can you tell me what is this conspiracy against me, asap 
Back off you can't touch this chemistry 
Retreat asap How does it feel for you? 
Being stopped by your very own mum 
Our relationship's for two 
Now the time has come 
So what's it gonna be 
Gonna follow your mum 
Obey everything she says 
Or will you stand on your own 
The choice is yours 
Don't take too long 
'cause, I'll be gone Baby, believe me 
My patience is running on empty Your momma's in my business 
Can you tell her to let me be, asap 
She's been on my nerves from day one 
(what's going on? ) 
Can you tell me what is this conspiracy against me, asap 
Back off you can't touch this chemistry 
Retreat asap She's tapping your phone 
To check who's calling 
From dusk until dawn 
She's on your tail 
Whenever we're alone 
I can feel her peeking 
Been going on too long 
Won't take this no more Baby, believe me 
My patience is running on empty Your momma's in my business
