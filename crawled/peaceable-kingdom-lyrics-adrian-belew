When I wake up in my tree 
Wake up in my bedroom tree 
A little girl and a parakeet 
Are singing to me My, oh my, what a peaceable kingdom 
Why would I ever wanna leave 
Leave a peaceable kingdom And when I wake up on the floor 
On the carpeted forest floor 
All of the squirrels in their conifers 
Are saying to me My, oh my, even if you had set of wings 
Why would you ever wanna fly 
From a peaceable kingdom 
Oh my, oh my, what a peaceable kingdom 
Why would I ever wanna leave 
Leave a peaceable kingdom
