Think I've had enough 
I must my way 
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind 
You're leading me astray 
You haunt me like a ghost 
And that scares me the most 
There you are the devil on my shoulder 
Smiling as the flames are growing colder 
How can I believer what I have? 
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own 
I fell it in my bones any minute now! 
This train of thought will leave the statio 
My impatience will come out to play 
You've turned out to be the only face I see! 
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room 
You spin a web in every room 
And try to break the backbone that I've grown 
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown 
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown 
Or wander where I'm thrown?
