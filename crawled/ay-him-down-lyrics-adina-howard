LAY HIM DOWN Listen Girl 
I ain't afraid to tell a man just what I want and what I need 
Even if he's short even if he's long as long as he's here to please 
And as we go our juices flow we scream again, scream again 
Let me do the things I want with you in here 
Girlfriend (Chorus:) 
Let's lay him down 
'Round and 'round 
Make us hold our breath 
Until we exhale 
Let's lay him down 
'Round and 'round 
Come give me that 
Come give me that 
Come give me your body Lay him down 
'Round and 'round 
Make us hold our breath 
Until we exhale 
Let's lay him down 
'Round and 'round 
Come give me that 
Come give me that 
Come give me your shh... There ain't no need to tell nobody what we want 
So we don't need to flaunt when we're done 
Innerbitions go when we let go just let the flow take you 
Where no one needs to know 
When we're alone maybe I'ma take you 'till the break of dawn 
When we are alone 
Come give me that 
Come give me that 
Come give me your body baby (Repeat Chorus) There ain't no need to tell nobody what we want 
I ain't afraid 
Let me do the things I want with you in here 
Girl 
No one needs to know 
Come give me that 
Come give me that 
Come give me your body 
I know 
Come give me that 
Come give me that 
Come give me your shh... 
I know 
When we are alone 
Come give me that 
Come give me that 
Come give me your shh... (Repeat Chorus Twice)
