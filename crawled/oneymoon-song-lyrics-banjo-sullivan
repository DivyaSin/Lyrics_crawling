We were shoveling sunshine 
The hard times were the good times 
In the back of a good times van 
Wedding ring was fresh on your hand I guess you were a little shy 
When you gave me some nipple pie 
Reached over and you grabbed my wood 
Don't you know, that it felt so good? And with you is where I belong 
That's why I sing this honeymoon song Well, I spilled my red wine 
Right below your panty-line 
I finally got your bra undone 
My Johnson was on the run Your head was a keepin' time 
You were blowin' more than my mind 
I was slapping' on your behind 
Parked in the bush doing sixty nine Honey, with you I can do no wrong 
That's why I sing this honeymoon song Your nails were digging in 
Your teeth were biting skin 
Then you pulled out a big black whip 
Took me on some love slave trip I was screaming for my life 
Whatever happened to my wife? 
Said to call you Madam X 
That ain't no country boy sex You beat me black and blue for so long 
I guess it?s my fate, this honeymoon song You locked the doors on the Chevy van 
Slapped the cuffs on my hands 
I couldn't even try to shout 
You strapped a red ball in my mouth I was thinking about the wedding vows 
How that's a bad idea now 
I was thinking about death do us part 
Buddy that's a bad place to start And oh, where has my sunshine gone? 
It's too late, it's my honeymoon song 
Oh, my God, it's my honeymoon song
