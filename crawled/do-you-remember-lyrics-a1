Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu 
Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu 
Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu 
Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu Looking back on yesterday, memories won't fade away 
I can't forget the love we made, so beautiful, we had it all 
No use looking to the past, we both knew it wouldn't last 
But it was fun, we had a blast, so beautiful, as I recall 
Where did it go? Say do you remember the 1st of December 
When we were riding on the back seat 
Turn the radio on and play our favorite song 
We were making out the the back seat 
My girl'd get sad and your man'd get mad 
But they don't have to know 
Do you remember singing? Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu 
Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu Breaking rules we always would 
Doing things we never should 
We were so bad but it felt so good 
Do you remember, I think I remember I wonder where you are tonight 
But I know that you'll be alright 
'Cause I see our star is shining bright 
It's so beautiful, it will never fall 
Where did it go? 
Come on now, sing it loud! Say do you remember the 1st of December 
When we were riding on the back seat 
Turn the radio on and play our favorite song 
We were making out the the back seat 
My girl'd get sad and your man'd get mad 
But they don't have to know, yeah 
Do you remember singing? Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu 
Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu 
Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu 
Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu Looking back on yesterday, memories won't fade away 
I can't forget the love we made so beautiful, we had it all 
Where did it go? 
Come on now, sing it loud! Say do you remember the 1st of December 
When we were riding on the back seat 
Turn the radio on and play our favorite song 
We were making out the the back seat 
My girl'd get sad and your man'd get mad 
But they don't have to know, yeah 
Do you remember singing? Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu 
Du tu, du tu tu tu tu tu 
But the guess is over now
