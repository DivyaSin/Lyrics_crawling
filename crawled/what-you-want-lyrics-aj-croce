I walked away 
'Cause I fell out of like not love 
I'm thinking of you now 
Where I stand 
Waiting for the perfect plan 
To spark a flame So fragile are the lives we lead 
So simple are the words we need 
So few and yet so far between 
What you want and really need I sleep alone 
Better that than lie in bed 
I'm only lonely now 
For in time 
I will find the one I seek 
When I'm done searching So fragile are the lives we lead 
So simple are the words we need 
So few and yet so far between 
What you want and really need If you can think that it?s been easy 
You don't know how much it grieves me So fragile are the lives we lead 
So simple are the words we need 
So few and yet so far between 
What you want and really need Though time can heal 
I don't need an hourglass 
To feel I'm mending 
I see the signs 
Soon I will be on my knees 
Starting over So fragile are the lives we lead 
So simple are the words we need 
So few and yet so far between 
What you want and really need I walked away 
'Cause I fell out of like not love
