I really don't know how long I've been doing this sh-t 
I guess 2010's the first year you gave a sh-t 
I was the underdog so please excuse me a bit 
I need some space so someone please make me some room in this bitch cause I'm in Beast mode, beast mode 
give me those beats I eat those 
all day I don't sleep no 
I don't even know what I got sheets for 
them pillow cases and bed frames oh nah take that, don't need those 
so high I don't get high, don't even know what I got weed for 
people I'm in beast mode, why'd you think I got these teeth for 
why do I rep that east side and why do they all call me B.O 
but see I knew this before 
anybody fed my ego 
back in the hood at east shows 
so we take hood wherever we go 
please know, I am as loyal as loyalty is when it's gained 
dedicated, determined, dependable 
yes I committed myself to the game 
don't be letting them tell you them lies 
we make the industry real when it's fake 
so stay meditating so your head is facing into the direction you aim bitch! Okay then, know what my name is 
excuse my language but I'm fed up with the same sh-t 
they say they love me but its really cause I'm famous see 
my momma told me all this back when I was nameless 
so f-ck y'all, I'm shameless, I'm a beast unleashed I'm raging 
I'm living inside of this Matrix, this video game that I'm playing 
I ride around and they praise me 
I crack a smile and they waving 
I guess you could call me David Ruffin I'm circled in the Temptations 
or maybe I'm angry, maybe I just need a little more patience 
or maybe I'm crazy, maybe I just get a little too anxious 
some-times-I-rhyme-like-I'm-inside-Einsteins-mind 
look at the time fly by, plenty of times I've died 
looking at these jive guys claiming they lost there mind 
she aint really seen sh-t n-gga til you had the whole World flipped upside down 
right side up from the DEC so the Eastside's up 
fired up so you know when I get to the booth I go ham 
cause I gotta do what I can 
something like Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish, Adonai 'Tsebayoth i chant I'm kinda like a blur with these words, yes I'm a wizard with these verbs 
running at a hundred kilometers 
pretty soon I'mma leave Earth 
Earthlings, or whatever Human beings, I'mma beast 
your a feast, curly fries, onion rings 
this is not a f-cking game 
aint no referee's involved 
this is military combat soldiers standing guard round my yard 
Entourage, ham squad to be exact, smoking ham, smacking back 
take your girl have her back, we don't want her round my team 
she's a slut and she's a freak, but you don't know cause she's discreet 
I swear I see everything thats a bit, man I'm fed up to my neck with the stress 
I could use a wish Hayley where you at 
I guess the only exception to these girls is that I rap 
but I only attack 
Cause I'm in beast mode, just beast mode
