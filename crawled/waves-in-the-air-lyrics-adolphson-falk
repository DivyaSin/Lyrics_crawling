I'm tuning in 
On my radio 
A whole world 
Trying to let me know 
A world of voices 
Riding on the waves in the air 
And though I'm shy 
I'm not afraid to speak 
Through the skies 
To a face I cannot see 
Do you read me? 
I'm calling on the waves in the air 
And though I'm alone 
Somehow I feel you right here by my side 
I've got your voice 
To get me through the night 
If you're a thousand miles away from my home 
(Many miles from home) 
Without a telex or a telephone 
(Wherever you are) 
Remember 
You can find me on the waves in the air 
Your sweet voice 
Coming loud and clear 
And your message 
Is music to my ears 
Love's sweet music 
Is playing on the waves in the air 
My antenna 
Stands with open arms 
To receive 
Your radioactive charms 
In return 
I'm putting all my love on the air 
And though I'm alone 
Somehow I feel you right here by my side 
I've got your voice 
To get me through the night 
If you're a thousand miles away from my home 
(In Tokyo or Rome) 
Without a telex or a telephone 
(Wherever you are) 
Remember 
You can find me on the waves in the air 
My antenna 
Stands with open arms 
To receive 
Your radioactive charms 
In return 
I'm putting all my love on the air 
And though I'm alone 
Somehow I feel you right here by my side 
I've got your voice 
To get me through the night 
If you're a hundred thousand miles away 
(Many miles away) 
In Aberdeen or Adelaide 
(Wherever you are) 
Remember 
You can find me on the waves in the air
