Black as night 
And bad as hell 
Light the tires up 
I love that burning smell 
I drop that clutch 
Just to hear her scream 
All the lights turn green 
For my illegal street machine 
Are you ready for the ride 
Grab the wheel and hold on tight 
Hit that nitrous suicide 
Feel the rhythm of the road 
Let it penetrate your soul 
Turn it up 
And rock that radio 
Now your feeling the adrenaline 
Feel the adrenaline 
Come on 
Can you feel the adrenaline 
Are you feeling the adrenaline 
She's running hot 
I've lost control 
Cranking ZZ Top 
On the radio 
I love that rock and roll 
Are you ready for the ride 
Grab the wheel and hold on tight 
Hit that nitrous suicide 
Feel the rhythm of the road 
Let it penetrate your soul 
Turn it up 
And rock that radio 
Now your feeling the adrenaline 
Feel the adrenaline 
Come on 
Can you feel the adrenaline 
Are you feeling the adrenaline 
Ghost flames running down her sides 
Tuned up lean and mean 
She looks so fine in her chrome shine 
Sipping on gasoline 
She's just a 
Show stopping 
Jaw dropping 
Purring as she rolls on by 
She looks so good with her top rolled down 
Oh my, my 
I can't get enough 
I... 
Wanna take her for a ride 
Oh I can't get enough 
I... 
Wanna take her for a ride 
Oh I can't get enough 
You know I can't get enough 
You know I can't get enough 
Are you ready for the ride 
Grab the wheel and hold on tight 
Hit that nitrous suicide 
Feel the rhythm of the road 
Let it penetrate your soul 
Turn it up 
And crank that radio 
Now your feeling the adrenaline 
Come on 
Are you feeling the adrenaline 
Come on 
Are you feeling the adrenaline 
Come on 
Are you feeling the adrenaline
