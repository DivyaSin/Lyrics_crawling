Shame on me for loving you 
Can't deny that you've been untrue 
You lie so sweet but you love to tease 
Putting out the fire with gasoline 
Woah, yeah! I'm baptized and born again 
You can go to hell with your fucked-up friends 
Crazy little bitch in the first degree 
Shame on you for loving me. 
Yeah, woah... Oh my my! 
(That's what I get for loving you) 
Lie, lie, lie! 
(You know I can't live without you) 
Why, why, why? 
(And all the things you put me through) 
Cry, cry, cry! 
(Cause I'll get my kicks without you) I could not live without you 
I could not live without you 
I could not live without you 
I could not live without you Shame on me for loving you 
Can't deny that you've been untrue 
Lie so sweet but you love to tease 
Putting out fires with the gasoline Are you baptized and you born again?

I'm a crazy little bitch in the first degree 
Shame on you for loving me. Oh my my! 
(That's what I get for loving you)
