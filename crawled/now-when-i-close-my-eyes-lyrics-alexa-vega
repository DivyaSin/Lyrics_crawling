[Verse 1:] 
He remembers the night like it was yesterday, 
No I wasn't there but I heard him say, 
That it was real and it was true, 
And when I close my eyes I can be there too, [Chorus:] 
Red flowers swaying on the white curtains blowing in the kitchen window, 
New Orleans in the summertime Edna James singing on the radio, 
Slow dancing on the checkered board floor, 
Bare for memories from long ago, 
I'm there when I close my eyes. [Verse 2:] 
I remember my mother lying on my bed, 
Holding me close she always said, 
That it was real and it was true, 
And when I close my eyes I can be there too [Repeat Chorus] [Bridge:] 
And if I'm only dreaming 
If you just once believe it [Repeat Chorus] Cause I'm there when I close my eyes
