Kneel! All must concede to her will of everlasting greed. 
Kneel before your queen. 
Feel the wrath of her alliance. 
Bow down. Drain the lake. 
You won't believe your eyes. 
Drain the lake. 
It will reveal her lies. At nerves end, you push with full force. 
A blinded intellect will suffocate the tale built in your favor. No restraints on your tongue. 
Her beautiful face reflecting grotesque imagery. Taking action. 
Wars engaged. 
We are fighting to rid all past tense. 
Break the bond. 
Unnecessary evil An inviting facade on a shameful foundation. 
She will pull you to your knees. 
Bow down! A gift and a curse. 
The savior to the nemesis. 
A necessary evil. 
One thing we can't deny. No restraints on your tongue. 
Her beautiful face reflecting grotesque imagery. Taking action. 
Wars engaged. 
We are fighting to rid all past tense. 
Break the bond. 
Unnecessary evil. [x2]
