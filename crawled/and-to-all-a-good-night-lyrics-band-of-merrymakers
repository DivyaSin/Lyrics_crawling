All the kids are sleeping in their beds 
The lights are out 
A silent pile of presents in their heads 
They hear a sound 
Now maybe it's the reindeer and the sled 
Or just a tiny mouse who runs around the house 
instead Say when's he gonna tumble down the chimney 
We've been waiting 364 nights Now we all are on holiday 
Now we're all ready to celebrate 
Havin' a ball 
We can't hardly wait 
Happy Christmas everybody 
And to all a good night! 
Fa la la la 
And to all a good night Footprints made of ashes on the rug 
I wonder if the 
Fairies came with sweet and sugar plums 
He must've ate the cookies that we left 
They're only crumbs 
With all these lords a leepin' 
Thought I heard the drummers drum Say 
Think I'm hearing Rudolph on the rooftop 
Jolly jelly belly St. Nick with a pipe Now we all are on holiday 
Now we're all ready to celebrate 
Havin' a ball 
We can't hardly wait 
Happy Christmas everybody 
And to all a good night! 
Fa la la la 
And to all a good night Fa la la la 
And to all a good night
