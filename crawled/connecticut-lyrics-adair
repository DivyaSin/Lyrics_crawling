long days and drunken nights haunted by 
brown eyes that stare right through me. 
so close I can feel your breath upon my lips. 
most snipers kill from far away. I've been waiting here for so long. 
my body's broken and I'm tasting blood. I'm shaking. hold me. hold me. 
my sickness waits for no one. 
an airport full of people mocking me. 
this drug will wipe it all away. I've been waiting here for so long. 
my body's broken and I'm tasting blood. 
when everything's said and done, know that I never could hate you 
for everything that we've been through. it's winter and another year 
my hair is falling out again. 
I'm praying for an accident 
to take me away from all of this 
it's over. it's over...
