Hot summer's gone and you're still ready to burn 
Back from vacation and you're eager to learn 
Anticipation mixed with desire 
No one can stop you cause your heart's on fire Back, back to school 
I'll teach you all the things that you never knew 
'Cause it's back to school for you Now I 'm the teacher but I have no degree 
Forget the rest I'll teach you biology 
Now just relax and you'll do your best 
Concentrate and you'll pass the test I'll be your teacher and you'll be my pet 
Put down your notebook 
Cause's there's no written test 
Graduation is what you deserve 
You'll have no problem cause I grade on a curve
