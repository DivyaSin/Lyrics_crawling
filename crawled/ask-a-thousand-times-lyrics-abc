When I`m high, you`re low 
When I`m up, you`re down 
And we`re never around 
When we need each other Back stabbing 
You know that I bleed 
I just know you`ll disagree * Ask a thousand times 
A thousand times I`ll see no 
Love is never blind 
Though sometimes you might think so 
Ask a thousand times 
A thousand times you`ll hear me say 
Love is like a weapon 
When you`re back stabbing me When I`m weak, you`re strong 
When I`m all right, you`re all wrong 
And we don`t get along 
Anymore Back stabbing 
You know where that leads 
I just know you`ll disagree (* repeat two times) 
When I`m high, you`re low 
When I`m weak, you`re strong (* repeat two times)
