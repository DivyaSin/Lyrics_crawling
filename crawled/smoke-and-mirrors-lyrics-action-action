Comatose, feed my head with liberty 
I've got an appetite for deceit 
I'm done, well done, stick a fork in me 
Cover me in apathy, discreetly and distinctable 
I am trying to break your heart, 
I'm plagued with doubt, no frogs or murdered first born 
My thoughts are just a little sun burnt, dismantle all that ever was, 
Strip it down; withdraw the blood Something's going to break real soon, who's covering those eyes? 
Safety in knowing others lies pulled by the strings of time Hold me back; I'm going to throw it all down on the table 
Do you expect us to believe in these fables? 
Oh, what to do with you? 
With you, with you, with you? 
Hold me tight, it seems all I really have is in front of me 
Is the rest just a dream or a fallacy? 
Oh, what to do with you? 
With you, with you, with you? A throw back to all those 80's slasher flicks 
You're a cheap killer, and I'm getting sick of it 
God's dead, and all bets have waived their rights 
All is fair in love and time, who will win the game of war? 
Illusion, delusion, a terrible secret, 
What one does see is another's lost prophet 
Hold me close, I can see right through you 
Challenge all you've ever heard, incite the search and motivate Something's going to break real soon, who's covering those eyes? 
Safety in knowing others lies pulled by the strings of time Hold me back; I'm going to throw it all down on the table 
Do you expect us to believe in these fables? 
Oh, what to do with you? 
With you, with you, with you? 
Hold me tight, it seems all I really have is in front of me 
Is the rest just a dream or a fallacy? 
Oh, what to do with you? 
With you, with you, with you? Please read between the lines 
A simple compromise between the sands of time 
Please say with me, say with me Hold me back; I'm going to throw it all down on the table 
Do you expect us to believe in these fables? 
Oh, what to do with you? 
With you, with you, with you? 
Hold me tight, it seems all I really have is in front of me 
Is the rest just a dream or a fallacy? 
Oh, what to do with you? 
With you, with you, with you?
