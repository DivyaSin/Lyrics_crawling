Some are confused between love and sex 
For there is a difference... oh yeah 
Sex satisfies lust, lust wont change you 
It just lies there. yeah, yeah 
You can pay someone for sex 
You cant pay no one to love you 
If true love can be bought... 
I could never be rich enough 
Ah... Leave it alone 
Dont bet that Im ready to sell my soul 
Ah... leave it alone... 
Dont mean that Im willing to make it alone 
Am I missing the point 
Ah... leave it alone 
Some love to lie, dont care with who 
I think Im indifferent... what about you... 
Two halves are whole, no one is in control 
Or more the wiser... yeah, yeah 
Sex without love is lust 
Thats where we get confused 
In love you give yourself... 
Lust is just, someone gettin used... 
Ah... Leave it alone... 
Dont bet that Im ready to sekll my soul 
Ah... Leave it alone... Dont mean that Im willing to make it alone 
Am I missing the point 
Ah... Leave it alone...
