My mother told me, 
She said andy, 
You'll be a man soon, 
So understand me 
Most of this world sees, 
Women like candy 
You'll be a man who, 
Will be standing for me My sisters, my daughters and wives, 
Girls, you will learn are not a shining light 
Dedicate some of your life, 
Stand for them all 
Sing it now, me 
My sisters, my daughters, and wives, 
Girls, you will learn are not a shining light 
Dedicate some of your life 
You will stand for them all Sing it now 
Ladies, 
You are beautiful, you are beautiful, 
You don't even have to try 
Oh ladies, 
You are beautiful, you are beautiful, 
More than you could realize My mother told me, 
She said andy, 
I know this song may, 
Seem demanding 
But I'll be leaving, 
And will be handing, 
All of my love to you, 
You will be standing for me My sisters, my daughters and wives, 
Girls who are learning how to shine their light, 
Dedicate some of your lives, 
Stand for them all Sing it now, 
Ladies, 
You are beautiful, you are beautiful, 
You don't even have to try, 
Oh lady, 
You are beautiful, you are beautiful, 
More than you could realize I'm not sure if I'm the best one 
To carry this torch, 
I'm a mess and my nose is sore 
Fallin' on my face tryin 'to 
Break the norm, 
But I still conform 
And I know you see, 
The mistakes I make and wait 
Patiently, for me to replace them 
And I can't quite seem, 
To be the perfect man, 
That you needed me to be, 
I need you to believe that 
I'll be standing here, 
I got my sword, I got my shield 
And you keep ringing in my ear, 
Oh lord Talking bout me 
My sisters, my daughters, and wives 
Girls learning how to shine their light, 
Dedicate some of your life, 
Stand for them all Sing it now ladies, 
You are beautiful, you are beautiful, 
You don't even have to try, 
Oh ladies 
You are beautiful, you are beautiful, 
More than you could realize 
Ladies, 
You are beautiful, you are beautiful, 
You don't even have to try, 
Sing it ladies 
You are beautiful, you are beautiful, 
More than you could realize
