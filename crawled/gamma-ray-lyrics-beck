Trying to hold 
Hold out for now 
With these ice caps 
Melting down 
With the transistor sound 
And my Chevrolet Terra plane 
Going round, round, round Come a little gamma ray 
Standing in a hurricane 
Your brains are bored 
Like a refugee 
From the houses burning 
And the heat waves 
Calling your name She's got 
On a cactus crown 
With a dot, dot, dot 
On her brow 
And she speaks 
Inside crowd 
With the cavalry 
Turning around Hit me like a gamma ray 
Standing in a hurricane 
And I'm pulling 
Out thorns 
Smokestack lightning 
Out my window 
I want to know 
What I've lost today
