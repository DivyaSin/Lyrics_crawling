[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky] 
I thought you said youd never leave 
I think back as I took a puff 
Know what happens every time you leave 
Always come back cause you wanna fuck 
Always come back cause you wanna fuss 
Holdin back, aint no turnin back when you fall in love 
Know what happens every time you speed 
Always fall flat cause you wanna rush 
So we could take it slow 
Separate the highs from the lows 
Separate the evens from the odds 
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart [Hook: Florence Welch] 
I come apart, and you keep it together 
I come apart, and I cant stand the pressure 
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare 
I come apart, this cant last forever 
Cant last forever [Verse 2: A$AP Rocky] 
I woke up today high 
Felt a little less pressure from you 
And Im here to say I 
maybe even learned a lesson from you 
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure 
If you fly away then rest assured [Hook] [Bridge: Florence Welch] 
Youre the eye, but Im tearing all the time 
Always there to catch me, but Im never coming down 
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way 
I guess you know, in control 
Chaos I create 
I come apart [Verse 3: A$AP Rocky] 
You made a bet with me, now youre in debt with me 
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me 
Its ruthless, she the closest thing next to me 
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me 
Especially hard to express to me 
European attitude but born in West Philly 
She just have a smokin gina, where the Wet Willies? 
I come apart, Im in her heart on the left titty [Hook]
