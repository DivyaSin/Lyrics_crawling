(yeah! alright!) 
Dying felt so goddamn good today 
If I was ever alive well it's hard to say 
It was kissing my eyelids and burning my face away 
Dying felt so goddamn good today! We dance the electric Pagan Love Song 
We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs 
(alrighhtt!) 
(YEAH!) 
Eating dead flowers bleeding in a strange daze 
I was cutting throats and eating tears 
Smiling in a ruined age 
Douse my love everything with gasoline 
Grave flower blooms at your red light death scene We dance the electric Pagan Love Song (YEAH!) 
We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs(OH YEAH! .. ALRIGHT! .. YEAH!) Trippin' on real blood in strange sunshine 
Have you felt such weight upon your eyes 
Sister I been trippin' in your sky 
I woke up adrift in a Technicolor bliss 
Ten million miles high (yeahhh) (YEAH!!) 
I'm a Christian zombie by daylight (OH YEAH!) 
Satan, he come trippin' 'round midnight 
Circle jerkin' redneck truckers' dream (yeah) 
You scream, I scream 
Everybody screams for morphine
