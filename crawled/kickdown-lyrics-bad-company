Ralphs I was brought up in a back street 
Working every night and day 
Fought like a man for everything that I am 
I got the kickdown, yeah. Well I came back with a vengeance 
Searching for that southern gold 
One of these days I'm gonna blow their minds 
Before the kickdown, yeah. But we made it together, made it together 
Hell or high water's gonna take me away. But we made it together, made it together 
Hell or high water's gonna take me away. Money came in, I bought everything 
Tried to keep it all together 
Hold on tight 'cause in the middle of the night 
You get the kickdown, yeah. I was brought up in a back street 
Working every night and day 
I fought like a man for everything that I am 
I got the kickdown 
Well I fought like a man for everything that I am 
I got the kickdown, yeah yeah yeah. . 
. kick me down, no no 
this place
