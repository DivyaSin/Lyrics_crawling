They say that hell hath no fury 
A fact that I can't deny 
I see the victims of circumstance 
Convicted without a crime 
Call it aggressive behaviour 
Call it the need to be free 
Call it the cry of the innocent 
That no-one can believe Rebel, rebel woman, I know you well 
Rebel, rebel woman, I know you well They say there's truth in the old truths 
No reason to cheat or lie 
We're caught in the crossfire 
Convicted without a trial This mother's scorn is a strange thing 
She pays her children for love 
She heeds the cry of their innocence 
They pay her with their blood Rebel, rebel woman, I know you well 
Rebel, rebel woman, I know you well They say that hell hath no fury 
A fact that I can't deny 
I see the victims of circumstance 
Convicted without a crime Another plane in the ocean 
Another wall in the sky 
The victims of circumstance 
Convicted without a trial Rebel, rebel woman, I know you well 
Rebel, rebel woman, I know you well
