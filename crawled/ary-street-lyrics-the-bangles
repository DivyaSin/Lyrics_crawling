(S. HoffsV. Peterson) 
Time's up girl now 
No more excusing you 
And those books you read 
Oh girl, you better review Oh oh oh, Mary Street 
Looking out your door 
Oh oh oh, Mary Street 
Now what are you waiting for (what are you waiting for) You thought that cool 
Was in someone else's shoes and makeup 
Sitting in your room 
Waiting for the moment to come Oh oh oh, Mary Street 
Looking out your door 
Oh oh oh, Mary Street 
Now what are you waiting for (what are you waiting for) You got no tears for 
All the guys who passed you by 
All the girls who shut you out 
They won't recognize you now You're a good girl now 
No more excusing you 
And those books you read 
Oh girl, you better review Oh oh oh, Mary Street 
Looking out your door 
Oh oh oh, Mary Street 
Now what are you waiting for (what are you waiting for) Oh oh oh, Mary Street 
Looking out your door 
Oh oh oh, Mary Street 
Oh yeah, oh yeah
