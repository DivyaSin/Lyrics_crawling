Autumn has come to rest 
In her garden 
Come to paint the trees with emptiness 
And no pardon 
So many things have come undone 
Like the leaves on the ground 
And suddenly she begins to cry 
But she doesn't know why 
Heavy are the words that fall through the air 
To burden her shoulders 
Caught up in the trees, 
Her soliloquy, 
"don't leave me alone" Rome now comes to sit 
In her garden 
Mingling the breeze with memories 
Of a time when 
There was a room with pale yellow hues 
Her room with a view 
Where love made a bed of happiness 
In muslin and lace 
Sweet is the voice from far away 
That speaks sotto voce and 
Is lingering there in the golden air 
To quiet the day
