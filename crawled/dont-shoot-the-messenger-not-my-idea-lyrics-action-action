Well, you look so true in undressed eyes 
Is your coma real? Did you change your mind? 
I see so clearly in these bargain eyes 
Words coffee drip out my head T-t-time will set us free as we both roll back our eyes 
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea 
Relationships deplete as the tears run down your eyes 
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea I might be blessed with amnesia instead 
Ghost written parade, all the nonsense said, oh yeah 
The worlds keep on sinning inside my head 
Your words are an army between wars Time will set us free as we both roll back our eyes 
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea 
Relationships deplete as the tears run down your eyes 
I'm sorry now to say to you that everybody makes mistakes 
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea, oh no Yeah, I see so clearly inside my head 
Your words are an army between wars T-t-time will set us free as we both roll back our eyes 
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea 
Relationships deplete as the tears run down your eyes 
I'm sad to say it wasn't my idea My idea, oh no, my, my 
My idea, oh 
My my, my idea 
Oh, no, my idea
