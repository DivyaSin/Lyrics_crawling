You come running to me 
Every time that you fall 
I'm the one that you call 
When you feel lonely You will me to life 
You make me feel strong 
I can right every wrong 
& make you feel beautiful again Just one tender kiss 
From your trembling lips When all your heroes are dead 
& all your white knights 
Are soaked in red 
I'm the last one in line 
Yet I'm the first one who comes to mind 
When all your heroes are dead 
You come running back to me 
Every time Lovers will come and go 
Falling down row by row 
Like domino's 
Like domino's You come running to me 
Every time that you fall 
I'm the one that you call 
When you feel lonely Just one tender kiss 
From those trembling lips When all your heroes are dead 
& all your white knights 
Are soaked in red 
I'm the last one in line 
Yet I'm the first one who comes to mind 
When all your heroes are dead 
You come running back to me 
Every time
