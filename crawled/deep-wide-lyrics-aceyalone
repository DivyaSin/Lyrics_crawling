breath out breath in breath out there's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
rhymes i got plenty keep 'em right by my side 
come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride 
there's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide now everybody up odd man in 
fit to play a game of russian roulette and God's fit to win 
i hope you're equip for the adventure men to the front 
and the women and children to the back of the boat 
fit to be afloat in about fifty seconds 
better believe we brought enough free chicken for the picnic 
and while the time is tickin' 
automated belt drive felt tip scribe i'm your guide 
to the innermost outtermost post to the other side 
now my body is my temple and my temple is my prize 
and my mind shine like the sun do 
and here's a little word from the wise 
you go up the river down the creek cross the lake 
and over the stream tryin' to escape this MC there's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
- what is it MC's flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
rhymes we got plenty keep 'em right by our sides 
come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride 
there's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
- what is it obviously this happens periodically 
it's not me it's the god in me i'm rappin' so melodically 
aeronautically Aaron is I, Aaron is high, Aaron is flying 
why in me means the glare in your eye 
they're in the lyin' down position 
the music's a masseuse 
goin' through your body makin' all the tension loose 
audio boost their reaction means satisfaction 
seems to happen when i'm rappin' and they hear me clearly 
and cheering even teary-eyed in the be	-boy kingdom 
we some rude stylish scattin rappin world twists 
but that's just for audio analysis 
the dopest you diagnose this 
but still don't get too close this 
may have a ferocious side 
there's and MC flowin' by deep and open wide 
- what is it MC's flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
rhymes we got plenty keep 'em right by our sides 
come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride 
there's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
- what is it breath out breath in breath out 
- yo Ab feel the wind blowin' 
breath in breath out 
breath in breath out i am a universal soldier
