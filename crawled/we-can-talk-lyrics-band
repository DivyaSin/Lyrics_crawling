We can talk about it now 
It's the same old riddle, only starting from the middle 
I'd fix it but I don't know how 
Well, we could try to reason, but you might think it treason 
One voice for all, echoing along the hall 
Don't give up on Father Clock 
We can talk about it now Come, let me show you how 
To keep the wheels turning, you've got to keep the engine churning 
But did you ever milk a cow? 
I had the chance one day, but I was all dressed up for Sunday 
Everybody, everywhere, do you really care? 
Well then, pick up your heads and walk 
We can talk about it now It seems to me we've been holding something 
Underneath our tongues 
I'm afraid if you ever got a pat on the back 
It would likely burst your lungs 
Stop me if I should sound kinda down in the mouth 
But I'd rather be burned in Canada than to freeze here in the South Moving that eternal plow 
We've got to find a sharper blade, or have a new one made 
Rest awhile and cool your brow 
Don't you see there's no need to slave, the whip is in the grave 
No sulfur, no trance, it's safe now to take a backward glance 
Because the flames have turned to chalk 
We can talk about it now
