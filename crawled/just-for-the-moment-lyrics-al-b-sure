Yeah, alright Just for the moment, just for the moment 
Don't ya know I tried so hard to please 
Just for the moment, just for the moment The way we first me, it happened so fast 
I thought too soon, but I hoped it would last 
I didn't know you and yet we still made love 
We rushed into things, but it was heaven above I know you were not sincere, you were not sincere 
I know you were not sincere, 'cause if you loved me 
I know you'd be here You'd be here with me You know I love ya' so right don't throw it away 
You've got to feel right if you want me to stay 
I want somebody to love me for me 
'Cause if you come back around I need to get up and leave You'd be here my dear See I can tell you how I feel about you 
But you loved me just for the moment 
I can tell you how I feel about you hey
