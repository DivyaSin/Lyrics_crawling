SO MANY TEARS AND PAIN IN THE NAME OF A GOD 
SO MUCH SORROW AND FIRE IN THE NAME OF A LORD 
WITH THE NAME OF GOD SPOKEN OUT 
WE HURT OUR FELLOWMEN 
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR AGES 
I FEEL SAD PEOPLE'S HOLINESS IS INFITE WHILE 
THEIR TOLERANCE IS SLIGHT 
BUT "RELIGION" MEANS MUTUAL 
CONFIDENCE LOVE AND HELP THE OTHER 
EVEN UNSAINT MAN 
UNFORTUNATELY THE FAITH IS JUST A BEAUTIFUL 
COVER UNDER WHICH 
THE FALISITY - EVIL LIES IN WAIT I FEEL SAD ONE THERE'LL COME THE DAY WHEN 
THE SOUL CLEAR PEOPLE REMAIN 
THEY'LL CARRY THE LIGHT IN THEIR HEARTS 
AND KINDLE LOVE AGAIN 
THE DAYS OF TRUTH AND TOLERANCE WILL COME 
I HAVE FAITH IN IT !
