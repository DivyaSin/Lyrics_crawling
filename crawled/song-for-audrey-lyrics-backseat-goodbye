Well, if I'm Frank Sinatra you're Audrey Hepburn 
I like to sing and you like the movies 
Life it's not a photograph, you gotta keep moving 
Frames are for folks with no hope If I'm all alone, you're a new brick home 
Windows and doors, locks and rugs 
I don't have a reason or a simple excuse 
To put it nicely I'm likely do anything for you, you Well, everybody lies sometime 
Even winners have to lose 
Doors, they work both ways 
Even blind men have to choose Whether they're gonna wake up with a smile on their face 
Just because they can't see don't mean that they can't sing 
It's up to you to find beauty in the ugliest days 
Don't you waste your life waiting for it to change 
Just put on your dancing shoes and dance those cares away Yeah, if I'm 'The Sound Of Music' you're 'The Science Of Sleep' 
'Cause I'm obviously and you're obviously 
Too young to care, too bold to love, too naive to notice 
That sometimes all you need is some love 
To get by, to get by, to be alright even when the world is off it's axis 
It's Sunday and you just wanted to enjoy the afternoon I need a new love, someone to help me home 
When I'm drunk and can't stand up 
I need a new life, someone to tell me wrong 
From right so I won't screw it up again Maybe we could wait 'til the sunset sank 
And devise a new plan to start over again 
Good luck with all the things you took 
It's amazing how much a month can change someone 
I thought one of us would end up in the middle 
But beginnings and endings are pretty much the same thing 
Pretty much the same thing I'm not going home alone again 
I'm not going home alone this time 
I'm not going home alone again 
I'm not going home alone tonight Maybe we could wait 'til the sunset sank 
And devise a new plan to start over again 
Good luck with all the things you took 
It's amazing how much a month can change someone 
I thought one of us would end up in the middle 
But beginnings and endings are pretty much the same thing 
Pretty much the same thing, pretty much the same thing
