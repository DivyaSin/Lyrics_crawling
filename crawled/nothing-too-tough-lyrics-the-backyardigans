If there's trouble under water 
Deep beneath the sea 
Call up harbor rescue 
And we'll send rescue 3 Do you really mean it 
Am I the one you'd send? 
When it comes to swimming 
On you we can depend There is nothing too tough 
Nothing too tough 
Nothing too tough for us 
The situation can make us fuss 
There is nothing too tough for us The sharks are spinning all around 
There's no need to run 
Call up harbor rescue 
And we'll send rescue 1 Oh, I'm so embarrassed 
You've really called on me 
Well everybody else is 
Scared of sharks to see There is nothing too tough 
Nothing too tough 
Nothing too tough for us 
The situation can make us fuss 
There is nothing too tough for us If you need to solve a problem 
Then this is what you do 
Call up harbor rescue 
And we'll send rescue 2 Now you got me blushing 
You think that I'm that smart 
When it comes to thinking 
Your skills are all to judge There is nothing too tough 
Nothing too tough 
Nothing too tough for us 
The situation can make us fuss 
There is nothing too tough 
Nothing too tough for us
