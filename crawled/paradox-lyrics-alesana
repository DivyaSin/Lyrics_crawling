Dearest love, I hope this finds you well 
I am kidding this is probably hell 
Lonely stranger with a brush in hand 
Never saw me sneaking up on him 
Tonight say goodbye to what you thought you knew 
They'll blame the blood spilled on you 
I'm closing my eyes, one more kiss before I never wake again Two moves ahead of you 
You are a pawn 
Castle now but I'm behind your king 
As your queen lays bleeding on the board 
Accept you have lost the game, misjudged your enemy Unleash the myth living in your worst fears 
I'm trapped, don't wait Page abandoned, the stories write themselves 
The author lost his way again and he forgot to write the end 
Race towards the sun, seeing who comes undone 
The villainess, the broken bride, we sit and watch the world's collide 
The story is ending Would you remember Joan of Arc was her flesh yet unlicked by flame 
Will you remember how the waves crash on the shores of time 
Who would've ever known that each choice made sense 
Who could've ever known 
Are we not our actions 
Our lives are poetry, make them sonnets Unleash the myth living in your worst fears 
I'm trapped, don't wait Page abandoned, the stories write themselves 
The author lost his way again and he forgot to write the end 
Race towards the sun, seeing who comes undone 
The villainess, the broken bride, we sit and watch the world's collide 
The story is ending Why do the floorboards creak like a heartbeat 
This room is driving me insane 
What's behind the bricks 
Who's rapping at my chamber door 
Pendulum, why do you torment me 
What am I saying, have I lost my mind I am her No longer Fatima, goddess, light 
I've become Rusalka, demon of night Two moves ahead of you 
You are a pawn 
Castle now but I'm behind your king 
As your queen lays bleeding on the board 
Accept you have lost the game, misjudged your enemy Don't wait Page abandoned, the stories write themselves 
The author lost his way again and he forgot to write the end 
Race towards the sun, seeing who comes undone 
The villainess, the broken bride, we sit and watch the world's collide 
Page abandoned, time is ending 
The story is ending, make them sonnets 
We sit and watch the world's collide The night that I died I had become Rusalka. 
I was no longer me. I was no longer Annabel 
The beautiful evil coursed through my veins 
And I saw so clearly what needed to be done 
As you lay, fast asleep, I penned her farewell 
And kissed your cheek. The knife felt so light in my hand 
So heavy in my stomach. There is something about this room
