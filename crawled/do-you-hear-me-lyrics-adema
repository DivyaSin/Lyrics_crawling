Are you looking down on me right now? 
I feel your presence beem down 
Watching you get ill, it changed our lives 
Your hand went limp and we cried 
I didn't realize you had to go 
Emotionless overflow 
I wish I had the chance to tell you I'm so sorry Do you hear me pray to you? 
I'm thinking of you 
Do you hear me pray to you? 
I'm thinking of you I know that you are in a better place 
Somewhere that you can escape 
I'm looking for a sign from up above 
That you still care and have love 
I was really young and didn't know 
The pain took over your soul 
I wish I had the chance to tell you, I'm so sorry Do you hear me pray to you? 
I'm thinking of you 
Do you hear me pray to you? 
I'm thinking of you Work harder 
For nothing 
To find you 
I'm sorry 
Work harder 
For nothing at all 
To find you 
You're nowhere Do you hear me pray to you? 
I'm thinking of you 
Do you hear me pray to you? 
I'm thinking of you Do you hear me pray to you? 
I'm thinking of you 
Do you hear me pray to you? 
I'm thinking of you
