Speaking as a guy who's really got it going on 
It's only natural 
It's only me Take it from a fella 
Who's been round the block so many times 
He knows the only parking spot that's free 
It's only me You can say I've tried everything 
I'd save on my wedding ring 
Who knows me, half as well as me? I'm not antisocial and it's nothing that's reproachful 
It's just natural 
It's only me I can't think of anybody else 
I'd rather spend some one on one time with 
It's not that hard to see 
It's only me I me, me in monogamy 
I'm not asking a lot of me 
I give me r e s p e c t And if your heart is broken 
You can just do, what you do best 
You can just do what you do 
When your heart is broken Trust in the one who will love you 
Never put others above you 
I thought I was using me to get to you 
But this is too unnatural 
It's only me They say you'll never love another, till you love yourself 
Well brother, I'm in love with everyone I see 
It's only me You can say I've tried everything 
I'd save on my wedding ring 
Who knows me half as well as me? I me, me in monogamy 
I'm not asking a lot of me 
I give me r e s p e c t, oh 
Oh yeah
