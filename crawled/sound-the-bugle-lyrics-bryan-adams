Sound the bugle now 
Play it just for me 
As the seasons change remember how I used to be 
Now I can't go on I can't even start 
I've got nothing left 
just an empty heart I'm a soldier 
Wounded so I must give up the fight 
There's nothing more for me 
Lead me away 
Or leave me lying here Sound the bugle 
Tell them I don't care 
There's not a road I know that leads to anywhere 
Without a light I feel that I will stumble in the dark 
Lay right down 
Decide not to go on Then from on high 
Somewhere in the distance 
There's a voice that calls remember who your are 
If you lose yourself 
Your courage soon will follow 
So be strong tonight 
Remember who you are
