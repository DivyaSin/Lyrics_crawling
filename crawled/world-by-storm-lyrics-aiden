Sometimes when fear strikes home 
We hit back hard now with a 
Vengeance all our own 
The slate has been wiped clean 
My eyes have been opened up 
I feel the pride pushed away 
And bad feelings stop I know now 
I feel it coming Here we go 
Standing side by side 
Right through the door 
World by storm 
They'll syndicate and 
Complicate this war 
World by storm 
We're standing side by side 
Right through the Disintegrate 
Follow me 
Now I see 
Now I see the truth 
Disintegrate 
Follow me 
Now I see 
Now I see it's you The bridges burned 
Have been swept away 
The past has been erased 
Our minds feel awake I know 
The slate has been wiped clean 
I won't pretend to 
Let the world pass by 
And there's kids in the world 
Who's dreams will die I know now 
I feel it coming Here we go 
Standing side by side 
Right through the door 
World by storm 
They'll syndicate and 
Complicate this war 
World by storm 
We're standing side by side 
Right through the 1-2-1-2-1-2-3-4 The world By storm It's in our heads
