Luther's windows are littered with nothin' 
A crystal, a picture, a dead potted sage 
A dusty white curtain, the nose prints of a dog 
A shot glass collection from his truck driving days Luther's bedroom is as hot as an oven 
With air that's as stale as old forgotten bread 
In a cage on the dresser there's a parrot that talks 
But her name over and over is all that it says Turn your back to the sun 
You see only shadows 
Look beneath the stars 
You see only night Like a homesick sailor 
Luther's standin' in the window 
Watching the world 
Floating by him tonight Luther's hands once held a chain 
With keys to a home and a blue Chevrolet 
Now he lives with his mother, steals all her liquor 
And chain smokes and stares at the ceiling for days Turn your back to the sun 
You see only shadows 
Look beneath the stars 
You see only night Like a homesick sailor 
Luther's standing in the window 
Watching the world 
Floating by him tonight Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
He is watching the world 
Floating by him tonight Luther's sitting by himself on the sofa 
With his head bowed down but his eyes are open wide 
Having a one man revival with an electronic Bible 
Listenin' to the parade going by And the bass drum is poundin', the trumpets are bleatin' 
And he's reading a verse from St. John 
A trickle of light seeps through the blind 
Luther pulls down the shade until he makes up his mind Well, turn your back to the sun 
You see only shadows 
Look beneath the stars 
You see only night Like a homesick sailor 
Luther's standin' in the window 
Watching the world 
Floating by him tonight It's floating by him tonight 
It's floating by him tonight 
It's floating by him tonight
