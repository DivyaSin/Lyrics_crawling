Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
Now it's about to be talked about You're gettin' slapped by my grammar 
Vocals like a hammer with roots from Alabama 
I'm under cover, make moves like no other 
In dark alleys, you're gettin' opened from your belly I rock spots for blocks, I knock you inna Skelly 
I know you're jelly, because Fame, Billy and I be 
Mashin' out crews of bad dudes for nothin' 
Or 'cause they frontin', they corny style, I show 'em somethin' A buck fifty ear to ear smash and fear 
I'm scrubbin' down, this hip hop shit's infested 
Too many niggas sexin' the mic, they not protected 
Don't get infected, like a child that's been molested The surgeon general rap shit just hit your section 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me 
It's picture perfect, blaze your mind like it's chronic 
'Cause M.O.P. and afu-ra, shits bionic It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me Brownsville slugger, put it on, come on, bring it on 
It's a new way for this hip hop shit, sing a long 
Who it is, nah bitch the question is, what it is? 
It's that back yard bangin' shit, that I rocked for the kids Clack clack, move son I got nothin' to lose son 
There's a million and one ways to die, choose one 
Hit or miss, it won't matter to peel yo ass 
I'm still left with a million ways to kill yo ass Now afu-ra split 'em in half with the sword 
You heard it from yours truly, chairman of the board 
Fizzy Womack, I blow back they whole strap committee 
We live and direct from New York City I'm a stretch a nigga, so you better get your weapon 
Stop yappin' with ya dick in your hand and start steppin' 
Ghetto warfare, heavy metal warfare 
This is war here and we gettin' it on all year, biatch It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me Let's take a trip down burner bark lane 
Where the innocent get slain 
And what you visualize will ruin your brain 
A lot a blood sweat and tears, pain Nobody stop a murder, as a dealer does it's muthafuckin' thing 
Bang bang, just like that, the man'll slit open you 
And put two under your hat 
And as you lay flat just another nigga whacked Before he stepped, he threw three through your chest through your back 
And your outta here, lights out, game over 
You said, you wanted to live life as a soldier 
I told ya, we on shaky grounds, a lot of ups and downs 
We on force, to run a crash course and blast off rhymes And of course we have emotions inside, yeah 
That's just some shit that we been trained to hide 
You hear, be cautious, nigga walk slow 
Talk low, this ain't no muthafuckin' talk show, this is It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
It's warfare, against any that come up on me 
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me Fire!
