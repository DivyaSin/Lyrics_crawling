The Real Secret of Kris Kristofferson 1. 
so here's the real secret of Kris Kristofferson 
as revealed by one Bobby McGee (tell the story) 
"well, I've never stood right by his side 
or been to Baton Rouge you see 
and I never thumbed a diesel down 
just before it rained 
and if I'd wanted New Orleans 
(why) I would've hopped down there in a plane CHORUS say Kris Kristofferson 
I'd love to share your pain 
but if I'd wanted New Orleans 
I would've hopped a plane 2. 
no I never stood beside him 
near those black Kentucky mines 
or ever been to California 
where the sun forever shines 
it's a shame about Salinas though 
or better still Carmel 
to fall in love and settle there 
would have suit me rather well CHORUS tell me Kris Kristofferson 
why Salinas not Carmel 
to fall in love and settle there 
would've suit me rather well 3. 
and if you think I saw his old harpoon 
wrapped up in a dirty bandana 
I'll have you know I'm a Christian girl 
not long from Indiana 
why would I ever want to sing the blues 
to the rhythm of a wiper blade 
I'd sooner hum my John Denver songs 
so I would not feel so afraid CHORUS please Kris Kristofferson 
don't give me no wiper blades 
I'd sooner be singin my Anne Murray tunes 
if it's all the same INSTRU-MENTAL VERSE 4. 
I feel a wee bit sorry though 
I never heard him blowin sad 
but I guess I could've used a key change 
if it was the only harp he had 
yeah I could have stood beside him 
shared the secrets of his soul 
I could've stood him a motel room 
just to keep him from the cold CHORUS sorry Kris Kristofferson 
about the secrets of your soul 
I guess I could've stood you a motel room 
just to keep you from the cold 5. 
he said freedom's just another word 
for nothing left to lose 
but I don't think he really meant it 
cos we've all got to pay our dues 
to earn the right to make our place 
but are we ever really free 
and maybe right there you just heard the real secret 
of Mr Kris and Bobby McGee CHORUS say Kris Kristofferson 
are we ever really free 
maybe right there we'll find the real secret 
of you and Bobby McGee END CHORUSES Mr Kris Kristofferson 
don't you feel so bad 
cos you know I was the best friend 
that you never had But hey Kris Kristofferson 
don't you feel so bad 
cos you know I was the best goddamned friend 
that you never, never, never 
that you never had"
