Somewhere hiding underneath 
Kicking off covers while you sleep 
Soon you're gonna leave, so leave us 
One more weekend You've got all the friends you need 
Bad tattoos and worse IDs. You feel alive 
Do you feel alive? [Chorus:] 
You'll go off, you'll forget 
You'll grow out of hanging from the edges 
Breaking off the past 
You'll know when to move on 
You'll know when to take all the right chances 
Never looking back Somewhere hiding underneath 
Driving around these empty streets 
Do you think you're better off dead 
Better off dead than alive in here? 
You've got all the friends you need 
Bad tattoos and worse IDs. You feel alive 
Do you feel alive? [Chorus:] How could you think the time we spent was all wasted 
Sleepwalking through every morning that we took for granted? 
Maybe the time we spent was not wasted... 
Let it go, I'll let you go [Chorus:] We are half alone, out hearts are leaving home 
Now we don't belong to anyone at all Somewhere hiding underneath 
Kicking off your covers while you sleep 
You feel alive
