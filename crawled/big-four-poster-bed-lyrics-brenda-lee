It was just boards of rough cut pine 
And a quilt of patch work cotton 
A place to lay your body down was that big four poster bed Daddy built it out of pine two days before the wedding 
They say the neighbors cheered and hollered till his face got red 
And mama brought the feather pillows and some handmade bedding 
And they spent their wedding night in that big four poster bed 
That night they swore like that bed their love would last forever 
And they'd ask no more of life than the simple things they had 
So they planed there future as they laid close together 
And later I was born there in that big four poster bed It was just some boards of rough cut pine 
And a quilt of patch work cotton 
A place to lay your body down, a place to rest your head 
A field of fluffy mountains for a little girl to hide in 
Clouds and chasing rainbows was that big four poster bed I remember as a child waking up on a winter morning 
With Sound of laughing voices and the smell of baking bread 
And running across that coal wood floor jumping there with them 
And Lord, I felt so safe and warm in that big four poster bed The day that daddy died, he whispered something soft to mama 
To this day she's never told a soul the words he said 
She just smiled through her tears and held his hand and nodded 
And my daddy looked so much at rest in that big four poster bed It was just some boards of rough cut pine 
And a quilt of patchwork cotton 
A place to lay your body down, a place to rest your head 
A field of fluffy mountains for a little girl to hide in 
Clouds and chasing rainbows was that big four poster bed Now time has dried up all the tears here I stand a woman 
Your arms reach out to touch my soul, your sweet words turn my head 
Darling, won't you tell me first this will be forever 
Before you lead me up the stairs to that big four poster bed 
'Cause only love has ever touched, that big four poster bed Yes, it was just some boards of rough cut pine 
And a quilt of patchwork cotton 
A place to lay your body down, a place to rest your head 
A field of fluffy mountains for a little girl to hide in 
Clouds and chasing rainbows was that big four poster bed
