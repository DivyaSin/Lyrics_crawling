Awaken my soul, come awake 
To hunger, to seek, to thirst 
Awaken first love, come awake 
And do as You did at first Spirit of the Living God come fall afresh on me 
Come wake me from my sleep 
Blow through the caverns of my soul 
Pour in me to overflow, 
to overflow Spirit come and fill this place 
Let Your glory now invade 
Spirit come and fill this place 
Let Your glory now invade
