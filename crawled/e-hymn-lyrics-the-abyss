Sunday morning, very bright, I read Your book by colored light 
That came in through the pretty window picture. I visited some houses where they said that You were living 
And they talked a lot about You 
And they spoke about Your giving. 
They passed a basket with some envelopes; 
I just had time to write a note 
And all it said was "I believe in You." Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence 
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants. 
The discussion was theology, 
And when they smiled and turned to me 
All that I could say was "I believe in You." I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving 
And a balded man said You were dead, 
But the house would go on living. 
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave 
He shook his head and said I'd never find You.
