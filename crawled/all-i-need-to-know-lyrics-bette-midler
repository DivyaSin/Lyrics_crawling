Look at my face. I know the years are showin'. 
Look at my life. Still don't know where it's goin'. 
I don't know much, but I know I love you, 
And that may be all I need to know. Look at these eyes. Oh, they never see what matters. 
And look at these dreams, so beaten and so battered. 
I don't know much, but I know I love you, 
And that may be all I need to know. So many questions and still no answers. 
I climb and climb but never get the view. 
But when I hold you near me sometimes I feel so clearly 
The only truth I'll ever know is me and you. In my heart I long for inspiration. 
And in my soul I know someday I'll find salvation. 
I don't know much, but I know I love you, 
And that may be all I need to know.
