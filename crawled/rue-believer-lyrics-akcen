Rain`s falling down 
Turning everybody weaken 
Can you see the pain 
Spreading all over in vain People just cry 
Drowning all the world in tears of lie 
Can you see them too 
All of them cold and untrue I`m a true believer in my heart 
Living every second from the start 
Can you feel the love I sent to you 
I will live today like lovers do x2 Rain`s falling down 
Turning everybody weaken 
Can you see the pain 
Spreading all over in vain People just cry 
Drowning all the world in tears of lie 
Can you see them too 
All of them cold and untrue I`m a true believer in my heart 
Living every second from the start 
Can you feel the love I sent to you 
I will live today like lovers do x2 I`m a true believer in my heart 
Living every second from the start 
Can you feel the love I sent to you 
I will live today lke lovers do x2
