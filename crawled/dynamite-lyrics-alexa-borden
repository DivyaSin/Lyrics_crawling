You came like a sudden spark from the dark 
Set a fire in me blazing 
You, like heroin straight to the heart 
Oh, you're driving me crazy We don't need anything now 
Everything we got 
Just tell me where you wanna go 
I don't want nobody else 
Been waiting wide-eyed 
And now you got me all alone Don't know why 
But nothing seems to do for me lately 
Let's get higher 
And tell me what you want from it baby Come on, honey 
How about it, honey? You, a fleeting rush of heat through my blood 
It's only you that I'm craving 
You, I can never get enough 
And it's driving me crazy You got something in your eyes 
I'm electrified 
Just tell me where you wanna go 
Every word is dynamite 
God I feel alive 
And now you got me all alone Don't know why 
But nothing seems to do for me lately 
Let's get higher 
And tell me what you want from it baby Come on, honey 
How about it, honey? Come on, come on 
I know you feel the same Don't know why 
But nothing seems to do for me lately 
Let's get higher 
And tell me what you want from it baby Come on, honey 
How about it, honey? You got something in your eyes 
Every word is dynamite
