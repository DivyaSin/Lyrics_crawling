You've been runnin' in the streets again 
But I'd never had a hand on you 
I've been a better man this year 
Than all the men that you've been through 
Don't mistake kindness for weakness 
'Cause a little girl, only a fool would stay with you I tried so hard to please you, babe 
I've even turned your lies to truth 
I said, I tried so hard to please you, baby 
I turned your lies to truth 
But when you said were my baby 
I think I got to ask you for more proof Don't mistake kindness for weakness 
'Cause your chicken has come to roost 
I said, don't mistake kindness for weakness, baby 
Your chicken done come to roost 
I think another man would be a fool 
To try to hang around with you I'm all done Mister Nice Guy 
But I ain't playin' around with your rules 
If you think that's liquor talkin' 
You better try an' get on back to school 
So don't mistake kindness for weakness 
Woman you done used up your, your last fool
