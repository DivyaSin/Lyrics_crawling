And well, I have to say 
If I don't know what I have to say 
If I could find a way 
Then I would find what I need to say Say something 
Say something that you mean 
Birds in the sky steal my melodies 
All I know is I don't now what this means But sometimes it's good 
To rearrange the orders of things Rubies and diamonds 
Rubies and diamonds 
Throw me to the lions 
Make me a man And if I had to wait for a time 
Where things fall into place 
If I could see your face 
Then it would change all I have to say Mean something 
Mean something that you say 
Birds in the sky sing my melodies 
And I don't know why 
I don't know what this means But the truth is always there 
Behind the order of things Whistles and sirens 
Whistles and sirens 
Throw me to the lions 
Make me a man If I could sing you now 
First two phrase, even back to back 
If I you could hear your voice 
Then maybe then I would have the choice To say something 
Say something that I mean 
Birds in the sky change my melodies 
I know that I know 
I don't know what this means But sometimes it's hard 
To rearrange the orders of things Rubies and diamonds 
Silence the sirens 
Throw me to the lions 
Make me a man
