My first mistake was thinking I knew where I stood 
I thought I had a place here in your heart 
If I can make your mind up, you know I would 
But a girl can only chase a dream so far Do you see forever when you look at me 
Am I the everything you'll ever need 
Should I stay, I've got to know 
Boy, it's now, or let me go Does this feeling have a chance at all 
If you can't tell me where I stand 
I'll find somewhere else to fall I'm still waiting for a reason not to leave 
If you've got one, I haven't heard it yet 
Boy, why's it so hard for for you to talk to me 
Tell me before I take another stand Do you see forever when you look at me 
Am I the everything you'll ever need 
Should I stay, I've got to know 
Boy, it's now, or let me go Does this feeling have a chance at all 
If you can't tell me where I stand 
I'll find somewhere else to fall Do you see forever when you look at me 
Am I the everything you'll ever need 
Should I stay, I've got to know 
Boy, it's now, or let me go Does this feeling have a chance at all 
If you can't tell me where I stand 
I'll find somewhere else to fall 
To fall
