She is so brave for seventeen 
Smoking it up, making a scene 
She could pass for twenty two 
With her sisters out, they make up in tattoos 
Love has no feeling, into her innocence they're stealing And every corner she cuts reaches out and cuts her back 
And every little white lie she try to sell turns black as coal 
Oh, what a heart breaker to be a failure as a faker He wants to work in rock and roll 
Get all the girls, be a part of the show 
Shouldn't jump so he could show his friends 
That his act is [Incomprehensible] 
But I've got to tell him just how much it scares him And every corner he cuts reaches out and cuts him back 
And every little white lie he try to sell turns black as coal 
Oh, what a heart breaker to be a failure as a faker Said I could not take no more 
Our love is a bore, I'm hitting out the door 
Even now while looking back 
Wondering how long it could have last 
So my old heart freezing, in my stomach's a queasing And every corner I cut reaches out and cuts me back 
And every little white lie I try to sell turns black as coal 
What a heart breaker I'm a failure as a faker And every corner I cut reaches out and cuts me back 
And every little white lie I try to sell turns black as coal
