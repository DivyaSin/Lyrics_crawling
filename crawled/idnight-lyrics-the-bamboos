Nobody put it in my head 
I could feel it in my bones 
I knew that our love was dead One moment was there an now it's gone 
You were turning off the lights 
But you said there's nothing wrong You said it was all in my mind 
You're so unkind 
You're so unkind When midnight is calling 
And all my teardrops are falling 
When the rain comes a pouring over me Somebody they put it in your head 
Giving him the time of day 
I remember what you said Why you running round 
Worrying for nothing 
There ain't nothing happening 
Why you think there's something wrong 
It's all in your head 
It's all in your head And now they say that I was blind 
It's so unkind 
You're so unkind When midnight is calling 
And all my teardrops are falling 
When the rain comes a pouring over me over me 
When midnight is calling 
And all my teardrops are falling 
When the rain comes a pouring over me over me I wish I could go back and you could prove me wrong 
Coz there's no joy in being right now you have gone 
I spend my time holding up a flame over you You said that everything we had it meant so much 
If fate is made of gold you've got the midas touch 
I spend my time taking all the blame over you And when midnight is calling 
And all my teardrops are falling 
When the rain comes a pouring over me over me 
When midnight is calling 
And all my teardrops are falling 
When the rain comes a pouring over me over me 
When midnight is calling 
And all my teardrops are falling 
When the rain comes a pouring over me over me
