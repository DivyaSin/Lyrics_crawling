Lift of the eyelids 
Bleary with sleep 
she's cold as the rainfall 
but heat to his sheets Quiet as a dormouse 
swift as the wind 
untangle your breath 
and your fingers from his Oh what pathetic displays 
hunger satisfied by a stay 
regretful, what a pleasant mistake 
now I must pay. Pressed into pillows 
silk as skin 
a kiss on the forehead 
now she's gone with the wind Damage the broken 
then use it again 
one special glance 
now she's under your grip Oh what pathetic displays 
hunger satisfied by a stay 
regretful, what a pleasant mistake 
now I must pay. Fill up your mouth with her porcelain lips 
take all you can and run with it 
take for yourself 
for your selfishness Oh what pathetic displays 
hunger satisfied by a stay 
regretful, what a pleasant mistake 
now I must pay
