A little boy in a village 
The village full of legends and myths 
He wanted to be someone 
A hero of amazing stories 
He went to his grandpa shaman 
Who wiped his lovely little tears 
He said oh, boy, I know the courage in your heart, 
cause Ive been watching you for years 
Watching you for years The snow has fallen down on the ground so fertile 
A seed has hidden inside to survive 
And people started to tell ancient stories 
Of a woman-seal and water life 
The boy was sitting in the darkest corner 
A shelter for his deeply hidden fear 
There are so many different gods, 
There are so many different stars 
Will there be a place for me? 
Will there be a place for me? Days will come and go 
You will take them all 
Tears are in your eyes 
yes, you are the Sun 
Hopes and mysteries 
All daily routines 
Circle in your life 
Yes, you are the Sun 
Yes, you are the Sun The boy felt anger with his inner weakness 
That made him feel great pain and jealousy 
He asked his grandma shaman 
Is it a shame for a hero 
To feel such a stupid feeling? 
And she said 
Its all right 
And when you feel it again 
Its all right 
Its O.K. 
And you feel it again 
Its O.K 
All right. cause 
Days will come and go 
You will take them all 
Tears are in your eyes 
Yes, you are the Sun 
Falls and mysteries 
All daily routines 
Circle in your life 
Yes, you are the Sun 
Yes, you are the Sun And its absolutely crazy 
Unexplainable 
But I saw him standing facing the ocean 
Talking to waves like a friend or madman Snd its absolutely crazy 
Unbelievable 
But I saw him standing facing the ocean 
Raising the waves with his hands 
As he believed he could Only this moment
