When they stare out at the stars 
Like satelllites, we'll always be there 
I am the sun, you are the moon 
We are the hope they'll always see there [Chorus:] 
It's true 
I burn for you 
This time each day 
We meet this way 
To share the things we've got to say When they go to sleep at night 
Like reveries, we'll always be there 
Our souls entwine and share the dream 
We both believe we can fly anywhere [Chorus]
