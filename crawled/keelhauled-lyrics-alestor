My friends I stand before you 
To tell a truth most dire 
They lust a traitor in our midst 
Who haven't vote the captain's ire He don't deserve no mercy 
We ought to shoot him with a gun 
But I am not an evil man 
So first let's have a little fun We'll tie that scoundrel to a rope 
And throw it overboard 
Drag him underneath the ship 
A terrifying deadly trip Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below 
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below 
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho I will not say what he has done 
His sins are far to grave to tell 
It's not my place to judge a man 
But boy he will burn in hell The sharks will dine up on his flesh 
And davie jones will have his soul 
Take his money and his hat 
He won't need them where he's gonna go And first lets tie him to a rope 
And throw him overboard 
Drag him underneath the ship 
A terrifying deadly trip Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below 
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below 
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho We'll tie that scoundrel to a rope 
And throw him overboard 
Drag him underneath the ship 
A terrifying deadly trip Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below 
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below 
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho
