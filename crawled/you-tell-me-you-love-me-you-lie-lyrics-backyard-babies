When you burn out 
There is no doubt 
Nobody can hear you whine 
So little space 
It's in your face 
Just draw the line then erase I'm an armed detonator 
A natural born separator 
At the price of my time 
At the price of my 
Motivation too 
Only when you tell me 
You love me you lie x2 You're really late 
I can not wait 
I will not stay for the night 
We separate 
And then we date 
The last page! 
Terminate I'm an armed detonator 
A natural born separator 
At the price of my time 
At the price of my 
Motivation too 
Only when you tell me 
You love me you lie x2 I'm an armed detonator 
A natural born separator 
At the price of my time 
At the price of my 
Motivation too 
Only when you tell me 
You love me you lie x2 Can't make a promise 
Last for a life!
