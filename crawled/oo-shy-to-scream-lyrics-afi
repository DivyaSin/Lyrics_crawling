I come quietly, silent entities 
Can lock us up and wait when unseen 
Do they speak of me? 
My voice left with the breeze that whispered 
"You should flee or you shall be seen" I die, if you only met my eyes before you pass by 
Will you pause to break my heart? 
I die, if you only met my eyes before you pass by 
Will you pause to break my heart? I am everywhere, everywhere but here 
For here is where you grace the nameless 
Were I not so weak, could I even speak? 
I warn that you should leave 
Before you're seen with me I die, if you only met my eyes before you pass by 
Will you pause to break my heart? 
I die, if you only met my eyes before you pass by 
Will you pause to break my heart? 
Will you pause to break my heart? Will you pause? I am everywhere, everywhere but here 
I am everywhere, everywhere but here I die, if you only met my eyes before you pass by 
Will you pause to break my heart? 
I die, if you only met my eyes before you pass by 
Will you pause? I die, if you only met my eyes before you pass by 
Will you pause to break my heart? 
Will you pause to break my heart? Will you pause?
