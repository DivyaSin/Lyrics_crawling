Baseheads locally approach all spark plugs 
Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump 
Post-meridiem pretty tungsten attracts any oncepale horse painted gunmetal black 
Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat 
Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span 
Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading 
For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37 
2000 out the weekly under "Cycles to Gehenna" gets him floating over 20 busses 
Fireproof and festive 
Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign 
Knows no zen in the art of maintenance 
Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby 
Here is how a great escape goes when you can't take your dead friends names out your phone Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief 
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, 
every other mighty lion asleep 
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth 
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth 
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth The man-ape translates glam thru the visor 
Goes in water lillies 
Am-scrays Giger, and manray 
Crammed in a one-player campaign 
Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain 
Span where the praying hands mandate 
Bars an extension of the arms 
They're mutating instead of being farmed 
Tonight beneath a marmalade venus 
Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us 
Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus 
All cones you can slalom when your focused 
Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly 
And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee 
Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring 
And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank charlie 
The scarfthank Mom's new hobby, kssssht! copy Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief 
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, 
every other mighty lion asleep 
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth 
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth 
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth
