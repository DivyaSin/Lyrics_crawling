[Music: M.Carlsson / D.Linden / Ablaze My Sorrow] 
[Lyrics: K.Lonnsjo] I will follow my desire 
Building up my dreams empire 
Not listening to your bullshit 
I'm free I have no sire I will not hesitate 
If you stand in my way 
Then I'll promise you 
You won't see another day I am the one 
That fulfill my dreams 
I will live my life 
Ad Libitum!! See my crowbar in your face 
My knife in your heart 
My fingers around your neck 
I won't think twice I am the one 
That fulfill my dreams 
I will live my life 
Ad Libitum!! I am a predator 
You are the prey 
So shut your mouth 
And hear what I have to say Life is survival 
Only the strong will live on 
The future lies clouded 
For you, not me I'm on top on the food chain 
Your just another worm 
Your efforts to pull me down 
Well they are in vain I am the one 
That fulfill my dreams 
I will live my life 
Ad Libitum!! This is our world 
We don't want you here!
