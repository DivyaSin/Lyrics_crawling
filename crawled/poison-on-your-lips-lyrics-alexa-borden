Don't know how to think without you. 
Cos when you're gone, 
it's hard to think at all. And I guess I don't know who to be. 
Unnoccupied. 
There's nothing left of me. And I know that it's not fair 
to wear you down. 
You've got a grasp on me. 
And I know it's not okay 
to feel that pinge of aching jealousy. Do I have hope? 
Or a reason to hold on? 
Is there a chance? 
Or a fragement of the sun? I'm infected by your kiss. 
It's like there's poison on your lips. I don't know how to fight it anymore. 
The games you play, 
add to my heart of lore. And I feel engulfed in the warmth of your breath. 
And just the thought, 
intoxicates my head. Well I know It's not your choice 
to keep me down, 
you've got a grasp on me. 
But I know it's not okay 
to take my freedom, 
and everything else from me. Do I have hope? 
Or a reason to hold on? 
Is there a chance? 
Or a fragement of the sun? I'm infected by your kiss, (infected by your kiss) 
It's like there's poison on your lips. 
It's like there poison on your lips. 
It's like there's poison.
