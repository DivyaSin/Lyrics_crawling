just a cold millennium in another dry age 
just a cold millennium in another dry age 
the vanishing man has madness to sow 
there are secrets he knows that have never been told 
i was sleeping with the insects yeah..... 
i was dreamin of the ocean 
the devil is just out of frame 
the devil is just out of frame 
it's suck a cold dimension 
this slow burn in my head 
(soul, blood) 
phantom green is the color of the sky 
its the color i see when i close my eyes 
phantom green is the color of the sky 
its the color i see when i close my eyes 
the devil is just out of frame 
the devil is just out of frame
