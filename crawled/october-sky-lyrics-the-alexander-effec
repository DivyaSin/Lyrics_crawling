He created all that we have, 
We built this on his foundation. 
A brother, a friend, 
A man with a future. 
He lost his life by your hands. 
He lost his life by your hands. We will never forget, 
He who showed us the way. 
We will never forget, 
He who brought us where we are today. The substance that plauges you will be purged. 
(I can give you salvation). 
I can give you the freedom you deserve. 
Just step this way. He created all that we have, 
We built this on his foundation. 
A brother, a friend, 
A man with a future. 
He lost his life by your hands. 
He lost his life by your hands. The price of life steep. 
(I will give you salvation). 
His blood is on your hands, 
And your blood is on ours. The substance that plauges you will be purged. 
(I can give you salvation). 
I can give you the freedom you deserve. 
Just step this way. He created all that we have, 
We built this on his foundation. 
A brother, a friend, 
A man with a future. 
He lost his life by your hands. 
He lost his life by your hands. Knock knock, motherfucker!
