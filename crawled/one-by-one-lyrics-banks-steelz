I don't need these highs to raise me 
I don't need these highs to lift me up 
I don't want your smiles to wake me 
I don't think that I should slowly go 
Never ending trials I am facing 
I don't want their wives to mix me up 
I'm all fucked up today 
My lucky friend says your luck will end today 
I don't need these highs to raise me 
I don't need these lows to numb 
I don't want these trials to be raiding me 
I don't need their noses to nose my heart 
That's a start 
Let's get it on 
My lucky friend says your luck will end today 
My lucky friend says your luck will end today Ice cold on the battlefield 
Twenty below was the wind chill 
Winchester rifle with the hot lead 
It burnt a hole in their fucking heads 
Bullets ring on the battlefield 
The survivor is the one who kills 
Now they drown in their own blood 
Men laying where they once stood 
Through the fire and the gunsmoke 
Niggas crawling with their back broke 
And they're hopeful that they don't croak 
Bullets spraying and there's no hope 
From (?) I slay my enemy, drained him of his energy 
I fight for this victory, you die in your iniquity 
Ice c-c-cold on the battlefield 
Twenty below motherfucker, that's the wind chill 
A thousand men they come and they fall 
One by one 
Call the preacher, the mortician 
You can't stop this coalition 
Its like I'm fighting against the prohibition 
In the sunlight, bong, you see that sword glisten My lucky friend says your luck will end today 
Now we got this taste for blood 
Now we got this taste for blood from the 
This pain is all but surmounted by peace 
It truly is Killa Hill, Brownville 
Never ran, never will 
Besmirch the quarter mil 
Movie cams on y grill 
Never jam, never squeal 
C'mon every wheel 
A bag of cash in the stash 
Queen on the bills 
I'm just one of my mom's eight born sons 
One of those nine swordsmen 
Slice your neck with a tongue 
Its an Ol' Dirty cousin 
A student of Allah's justice 
Boosting my mind 
(?) the atom bomb to crush us 
I bathe in the moonlight 
Gain praise in the sunlight 
Seen the platoon strike at midnight to the noonlight 
Oh what a life 
With just a butter knife they could hijack your crew (?) interrupt your life 
Then raise the price of grass, hash, gas, and rice 
I send a white square (?) to sacrifice the night
