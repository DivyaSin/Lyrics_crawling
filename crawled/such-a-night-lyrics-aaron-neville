Twas the night before Christmas all white with snow 
I was lying back waiting for my baby to show 
I was searching my mind for the right things to say 
'cause she had to leave the very next day 
When out on the driveway I heard such a clatter 
I dimmed all the lights and put on Clyde Mcphatter 
And she came to the doorway and she gave me a kiss 
And the rest of the night went something like this It was a night 
Oh what a night it was, it really was 
Such a night 
The moon was bright 
Oh how bright it was, it really was 
Such a night 
The night was alive 
With the stars above 
Oh when she kissed 
I had to fall in love. Oh it was a kiss 
Oh what a kiss it was, it really was 
Such a kiss 
How she could kiss! 
Oh what a kiss it was, it really was 
Such a kiss 
Just the thought of her lips sets me afire 
I reminisce, I'm filled with desire. And I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender 
Oh how I remember! 
I'll always remember Oh that night 
Oh what a night it was, it really was 
Such a night 
Came the dawn 
And my heart and her love and the night were gone 
But I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight 
Oh such a kiss 
Oh such a night And I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender 
Oh how I remember! 
I'll always remember Oh that night 
Oh what a night it was, it really was 
Such a night 
Came the dawn 
And my heart and her love and the night were gone 
But I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight 
Oh such a kiss 
Oh such a night Well it's now Christmas morning and my baby's gone 
So I light up the tree and turn the radio on 
I sit down in my chair and let out a sigh 
I sang away in a manager and angels on high 
Now my family and friends will soon knock on my door 
So I'll say merry Christmas to you and to yours 
May your days be cheerful and your burdens be light 
Oh but mostly I wish everyone such a night Now she's gone, gone, gone 
Yeah she's gone, gone, gone 
And the dawn, dawn, dawn 
And the night was gone 
And my heart was gone 
And her love was gone 
And before the dawn 
Oh oh oh 
Such a night!
