Never come outside but you know that they want to (x5) 
You know that they want to, you know that they want to 
Never come outside but you know that they want to 
You know that they want to, you know that they want to 
Never come outside but you know that they want to 
You know that they want to, you know that they want to 
Never come outside but you know that they want to 
You know that they want to, you know that they want to Just moved onto a new street and the motherfuckers sweet 
Liquor store right on the corner which is good because I drink 
Had to move because my old crib was looking all hit 
Aluminum falling off the sides like a snake does his skin 
Anyway where I'm at now is so much better 
Except for the kids man I swear they need to get they shit together 
Staring at me out the window all crazy 
Never met me but they lookin like they hate me 
What did the parents do to make these children so damn rude 
Stuff them in the closet, and beat they ass with a shoe 
They need to let em outside, but it's like they never do 
So now these kids stare out the window and give me the attitude [Chorus x2] 
Let em outside [x4] 
Hey let those children play 
I don't know whether I should leave or stay 
Because if I take on too much I might go insane 
Little bad asses, half my age 
Locked in they crib like a cage 
Looking out through the shades 
It's like my whole blocks been hypnotized 
And now they trying to get to me with this glare from they eyes 
Just beamin at this killa with their infrared 
Like I'm the main reason they on house arrest 
I thought kids was supposed to have fun 
Instead of being all pale from never seeing the sun 
If it was me, I'd have to break free 
Cause life too short not to be able to breathe [Chorus x2] [Chorus 2 - x2] 
Why don't they come out 
Let them out 
Why don't they come out 
Let them out 
Why they look so lonely [Chorus x2] 
[Chorus and Chorus 2 - x2] 
Why they look so lonely? [x2]
