The lonesome Texas sun was setting low 
And in the rearview mirror I watched it go 
I can still see the wind i nher golden hair 
I close my eyes for a moment, I'm still here The bluest eyes in Texas 
Are haunting me tonight 
Like the stars that fill 
The midnight sky 
Her memory fills my mind 
(Where did I go wrong) 
Did I wait too long 
Or can I make it right 
The bluest eyes in Texas (the bluest eyes) 
Are haunting me tonight Another town, another hotel room 
Another dream that ended way too soon 
Left me lonely way before the dawn 
Searching for the strength to carry on The bluest eyes in Texas 
Are haunting me tonight 
Like the stars that fill 
The midnight sky 
Her memory fills my mind 
(Where did I go wrong) 
Did I wait too long 
Or can I make it right 
The bluest eyes in Texas (the bluest eyes) 
Are haunting me tonight, tonight For every heart you break 
You pay the price 
But I can't forget the tears 
In her blue eyes The bluest eyes in Texas 
Are haunting me tonight 
Like the stars that fill 
The midnight sky 
Her memory fills my mind 
(Where did I go wrong) 
Did I wait too long 
Or can I make it right 
The bluest eyes in Texas (the bluest eyes) 
Are haunting me tonight, tonight The bluest eyes in Texas 
Are haunting me tonight 
The bluest eyes, the bluest eyes 
Are haunting me 
The bluest eyes tonight
