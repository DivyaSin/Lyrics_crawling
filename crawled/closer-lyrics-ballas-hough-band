Hey 
Put the pain that you have in the back of your mind 
Wait, I wanna wipe away all the tears in your eyes 
Cause I got that rhythm in the moves that'll make you hot 
I'm the only one that gets your heart to stop Please believe me, that you're the only one I want 
But every time I get closer, you push me away 
I don't get it 
You said you want me closer to you 
And every line I step over, you tell me to wait another minute 
You sure don't make this easy to do 
Maybe you need to get a little bit closer to me Why are you crying about the bad times in the past 
Try to take the good that you got and make it last 
Cause you got that rhythm in the moves that'll make me hot 
You're the only one that gets my heart to stop Please believe me, that you're the only one I want 
But every time I get closer, you push me away 
I don't get it 
You said you want me closer to you 
And every line I step over, you tell me to wait another minute 
You sure don't make this easy to do 
Maybe you need to get a little bit closer 
Closer to me
