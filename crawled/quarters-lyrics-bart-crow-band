Well I got my quarters for the jukebox and your memories on my mind 
There aint no doubt that the fires all out Because Im the only one sittin here crying 
Barmaid wont you set me up with a round before you walk by 
Let me hear that jukebox playin Im so Lonesome I Could Cry Well this time she really did it like a hundred times before 
I never thought her words were true I heard the slamming of our door 
So I intend to sit right here at least till I cant think 
Its a lot better than sittin at home while Im slowing going insane Chorus Well I guess she went and did it well she pulled that plug on me 
So I intend to knock em back, hey at least till I cant see 
So bartender, dont forget about me when you walk by 
And dont you pay attention to these tear drops in my eyes Chorus Said let me here that jukebox playin Im so Lonesome 
Im goin outta my mind
