Candles in the window 
Shadows painting the ceiling 
Gazing at the fire glow 
Feeling that gingerbread feeling Precious moments 
Special people 
Happy faces 
I can see Somewhere in my memory 
Christmas joys all around me 
Liiving in my memory 
All of the music 
All of the magic 
All of the family home here with me Memories of my childohood 
When I was 5, 6, and 7 
I would wake when dawn would 
Living in Christmas Day heaven! Precious moments 
Special people 
Happy faces 
I can see Somewhere in my memory 
All of these dreams all around me 
Living in my memory 
All of the music 
All of the magic 
All of the family home here with me
