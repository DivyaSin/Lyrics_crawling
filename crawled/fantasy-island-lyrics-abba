I had a dream, there was a rainbow, 
Over the mountains, over the sea Just you and me, we were go walking together, 
Watching the sunrise over the trees Wa-Oo-Wa-Oo-Wa 
Wa-Oo-Wa-Oo Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream but 
True love, holding us together 
Starshine, Fantasy Island 
You know I wish that we could stay like this forever 
Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream but 
True love, holding us together 
Star shine, Fantasy Island 
You know I wish that we could stay like this forever People like me, can always believe in 
Love on an island surrounded by sea We had a dream, of love never liven 
But I know that love can't live in a dream Wa-Oo-Wa-Oo-Wa
