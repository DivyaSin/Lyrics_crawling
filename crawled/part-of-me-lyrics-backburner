When you're wishper i can't hear 
It's a sign you go so far 
When no longer i feel you're love 
I know it's time for me to go Chorus : 
I hope you find another heart 
Like i love you every single day 
I will pray for you, you will find you're love 
Like i love you every part of me When i far away from you 
I hope someday you will understand 
I realize this is the best for us 
and, I know it's time for me to go Back to Chorus 1x
