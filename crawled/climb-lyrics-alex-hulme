There's a path that we all must take 
To reach the dreams that we seek to make 
Some wish to shine bright like a star 
To leave their light for when times are dark She's got so lost 
Between the stones and stars that's is where you are I know I know 
One day you'll grow 
I know i know with time 
You will learn how to shine 
So keep moving your feet 
Don't stop till you decide 
Hit the ladder and climb It not all up there in the stars 
The stone is the root is the ground of who we are 
Its the cement that holds so tight 
the mountain eclipses the light in the sky I know I know 
One day you'll grow 
I know i know with time 
You will learn how to shine 
So keep moving your feet 
Don't stop till you decide 
Hit the ladder and climb Hit the ladder and climb I know I know one day you'll grow... (Hit the ladder and climb) 
I know I know 
One day you'll grow 
I know i know with time 
You will learn how to shine 
So keep moving your feet 
Don't stop till you decide 
Hit the ladder and climb
