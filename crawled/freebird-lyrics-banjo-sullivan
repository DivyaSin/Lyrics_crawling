If I'll leave here tomorrow 
Would you still remember me? 
For I must be traveling on, now 
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see If I stay here with you, girl 
Things just couldn't be the same 
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now 
And this bird you cannot change 
Lord knows, that I can't change Bye and bye, baby, it's your sweet love, yeah, yeah 
You know it's a feeling that I can't change 
Please don't take it so badly 
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame If I stay here with you, girl 
Well, things just couldn't be the same 
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now 
And this bird you cannot change 
And this bird you cannot change 
Lord knows, I can't change
