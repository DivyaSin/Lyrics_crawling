In the weeks that follow a breakup 
The last thing you want to do 
Is be out buyin' groceries 
And see you-know-who I left a half-filled shopping cart 
Sittin' on isle three 
Made a beeline for my car 
Prayin' that she didn't see me and It ended well 
We said we'd still be friends 
So somebody tell me why 
It's so hard to say hello 
To the one who said goodbye Months pass and you move on 
You hardly think about it 
I don't remember where I was 
I just remember it was crowded I ducked behind a friend of mine 
The minute she walked in 
And it'd be one thing if we 
Swore we'd never talk again but It ended well 
We said we'd still be friends 
So somebody tell me why 
It's so hard to say hello 
To the one who said goodbye You spend years with a person 
You know all their secrets 
You've said, "I love you", a million times 
I used to light up the moment I'd see her 
Now I look for a place to hide Now I've found the woman 
That I'm meant to be with 
The moment I saw her I just knew 
So isn't it crazy I still get flustered 
Whenever I run into you-know-who It's so hard to say hello 
Can somebody tell me why 
It's so hard to say hello 
To the one that said goodbye
