My pride it falls 
Waiting on the feeling 
And only for you You've been the last thing on my mind 
You've been everything incredible lie 
Waiting on a life time 
Waiting on Saturday night Day Break with Paradise 
Lay wide awake with burning eyes 
And I don't need a reason why 
I choose to waste away my night My pride that's all 
Waiting on a feeling 
And only for you You've been the last thing on my mind 
You've been everything incredible lie 
Waiting on a life time 
Waiting on Saturday night Day Break with Paradise 
Lay wide awake with burning eyes 
And I don't need a reason why 
I choose to waste away my night When you're around i never watch the clock 
Hands will be faster as you talk your head off 
And I don't need a reason why 
I choose to waste away my night Day Break with Paradise 
Lay wide awake with burning eyes 
And I don't need a reason why 
I choose to waste away my night when you're around i never watch the clock 
Hands moving faster as you talk your head off 
And I don't need a reason why 
I choose to waste away my night
