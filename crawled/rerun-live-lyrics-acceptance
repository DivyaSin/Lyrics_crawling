Thought you saw this last time 
It's a rerun 
But this time it's changed you 
You said you never watched it 
Oh, it's your free time Image passed, forget your words 
You live it, you live it everyday 
Dead end stare, eyes transfixed 
Focused on destruction, destruction of yourself This could be, this could be 
I wait for you, I wait for Take a while, things only you can change 
As you relieve, as you relieve 
Stay awhile, things only you can change 
As you revive, as you revive yourself, yourself This is the last [Incomprehensible] with you 
It's the last [Incomprehensible] 
[Incomprehensible] Take a while, things only you can change 
As you relieve, as you relieve 
Stay awhile, things only you can change 
As you revive, as you revive yourself, yourself
