I'm gonna talk about a place 
That's got a hold on me, 
Mill Valley 
A little place where life 
Feels very fine and free, 
Mill Valley 
Where people aren't afraid to smile 
And stop and talk with you awhile, 
And you can be as friendly 
As you want to be. 
Mill Valley! 
Talkin' 'bout Mill Valley, 
That's my home! 
It looks as pretty in the rain 
As in the sun, 
Mill Valley 
And there's a mountain 
That belongs to ev'ry one, 
Mill Valley 
And there are creeks 
That run on endlessly, 
And trees as far as you can see 
It makes you feel as if 
Your life has just begun. 
Mill Valley 
Talkin' 'bout Mill Valley, 
Talkin' 'bout Mill Valley, California, 
That's my home! 
I know that there may come a time 
I'll have to leave Mill Valley, 
And ev'ry memory 
Will seem like make-believe Mill Valley 
And all the good things 
That are mine right now, 
Will call to me and ask me how 
I could have left them all behind 
How could I leave Mill Valley, 
Talkin' 'bout Mill Valley, 
Talkin' 'bout Mill Valley, California, 
That's my home! 
(song written by Rita Abrams-1970)
