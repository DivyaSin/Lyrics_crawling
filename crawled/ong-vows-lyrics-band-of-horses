Hey little darlin' 
Sweet little love of mine 
Well it's only, a matter of time All that you see 
All that you set out to find 
Nothing change your mind At the brink of day 
In the middle of the night 
You remember me 
Don't know why I'm in the running 
In the running 
Oh 
Got me where you want me 
Where you want me 
Oh It's harder to recall 
How bad time 
Or the frame of my mind 
Frame of my Who could even blame me 
In hindsight 
You snuck around with that guy 
It wasn't right It isn't funny 
It isn't funny 
Oh 
No it's nothing, nothing 
Wits don't show me the way 
Blankets... stayed in place 
Just as they were raised I'm in the running 
In the running 
Oh 
You got me where you want me 
Where you want me No one's going to show you the way 
When it it gets cold 
You find yourself babe 
Back in the whole from which you came And everything will fall into place
