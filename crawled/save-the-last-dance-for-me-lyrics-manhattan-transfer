You can dance ev'ry dance with the guy who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight 
You can smile ev'ry smile for the man who held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight 
But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be 
So darlin', save the last dance for me mm Oh, I know that the music's fine like sparkling wine go and have your fun 
Laugh and sing but while we're apart don't give your heart to anyone 
But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be 
So darlin', save the last dance for me mm Baby don't you know I love you so 
Can't you feel it when we touch 
I will never never let you go 
I love you oh so much You can dance go and carry on till the night is gone and it's time to go 
If he asks if you're all alone can he take you home you must tell him no 
Cause don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arm's you're gonna be 
So darlin save the last dance for me Cause don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arm's your gonna be 
So darlin save the last dance for me mm Save the last dance for me mm Save the last dance for me
