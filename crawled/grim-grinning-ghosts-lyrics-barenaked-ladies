When the crypt doors creak 
And the tombstones quake 
Spooks come out for a singing wake 
Happy haunts materialize 
And begin to vocalize 
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize Now don't close your eyes 
And don't try to hide 
Or a silly spook may sit by your side 
Shrouded in a daft disguise 
They pretend to terrorize 
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize As the moon climbs high o'er dead oak tree 
Spooks arrive for the midnight spree 
Creepy creeps with eerie eyes 
Start to shriek and harmonize 
Grim grinning ghosts come out socialize When you hear the knell of a requiem bell 
Weird glows gleam where spirits dwell 
Restles bones etherealize 
Rise as spooks of every size
