Welcome to hell's paradise 
I always heard life was a pair of dice 
Seven eleven, or a pair of eyes 
As I'm looking at her smearing eyes 
She yelling take them glasses off your eyes are the only things that not lying 
Not caring to the point that I stopped lying 
I tell her I feel the same 
She tell me nigga quit playing you the only one that's not crying 
You said you wasn't on no steal your man shit 
If I broke it off now we won't be on some friend shit 
Man, what goes around comes around like some ceiling fan shit 
I broke the levy to your eyes 
That I don't give a damn shit Another time, another time, it's the same old shit 
It might be to late, for me to learn from my mistakes 
I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you 
But you should have used your head first 
This might be the biggest mistake, it's too late 
Because two can't be in first place Wake up then, call your ex and make up then 
What was no strings attached got tangled when 
Fun stopped being fun, and feeling tried to finagle in 
We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in 
Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one 
You need a good guy, and I'm already not one 
She said we lost a kid already, I'm already not that young 
My biological clock is ticking, I'm not just trying to have fun 
Shits way different from us first chilling 
Sometimes last words can have the worst ending 
Which we could fast forward time and reverse feelings 
Is there a warranty for love to return and fix it 
She said you good either way, when it was her last night nigga and me today 
You the man, huh getting on the tna 
You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA? 
And so on and so on, and the shit just always goes on 
Nothing about us feeling right 
But she'll be back before the end of the night Another time, another time, it's the same old shit 
It might be to late, for me to learn from my mistakes 
I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you 
But you should have used your head first 
This might be the biggest mistake, it's too late 
Because two can't be in first place
