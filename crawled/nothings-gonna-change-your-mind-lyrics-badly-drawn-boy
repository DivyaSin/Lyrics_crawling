This would be easier if you'd understand 
Face the truth and realise that none of this was planned 
The way we worry about such little things 
Take a time to take the break 
Darling spread your wings 
I stole all the roses that make your crown 
Now it's easier 
To just put aside the things that face us now Let's dance! To the beat of the drum! 
Let's go out! Where we don't know anyone! 
Cause it's you! I don't need anyone else! 
I got you! I don't need anyone else but you... strange how something comes from nothing 
I came around to your way 
Of thinking about these things 
Saw your face in a crowd 
I knew that you were special 
And ****** change my world 
If I could help you now but nothing's gonna change your mind 
And no one's gonna help you now 
If nothing's gonna change your mind 
Then no one's gonna help you find 
Your place in this world 
So strange we don't need ************* Let's dance! To the beat of the drum! 
Let's go out! Where we don't know anyone! 
Cause it's you! I don't need anyone else! 
I got you! I don't need anyone else but yoooooooouuuuuuu!!!!!! and no one could ask for more but nothing's gonna change your mind 
And no one's gonna help you now 
If nothing's gonna change your mind 
Then no one's gonna help you now
