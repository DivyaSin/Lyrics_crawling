Take your pride and lift it high 
I've come to say goodbye 
You've got your live and I've got mine 
Sometimes hard to draw that line I like to walk and my way is my own 
You taught me how, don't you know And there must be some place to meet 
I'll take off my shoes, I'll walk bare-foot when I do 
Standing there in front of you 
I want to be honest, I want to be true I like to walk and my way is my own 
You taught me how, don't you know what we found Brother maybe, we're on holy ground 
Brother, take your pride and lift it high 
Take your pride and lift it high 
There must be some [Incomprehensible] I must leave without you 
Good advice, I grow stronger 
Where the mountains rise Standing there in front of you 
I want to honest, I want to be true 
In front of you Brother, take your pride and lift it high 
And I praise you 
There must be some [Incomprehensible] 
We're on holy ground Brother, take your pride and lift it high 
Take your pride and lift it high 
There must be some [Incomprehensible] And I praise you 
Take your pride and lift it high 
I'm here to save the ground
