V1. 
Spend your dollars 
Spend your pounds 
We sleep it off and make our rounds 
I followed you around the world 
Through every city, every town But how much longer? Ch. 
See there's aiming the gun 
And there's pulling the trigger 
You can say what you want 
But you know that there's a difference V2. 
We meet with smiles 
Part with cries 
We board a plane and dry our eyes 
The hands create a disconnect 
It breaks through bonds and takes our eyes And the obligation is not yours 
When winter ends and we head north 
You've kept the breath inside our lungs 
And we stood up on your supports But now no longer Ch. 2 
See there's aiming the gun 
And there's pulling the trigger 
You can say what you want 
But you know that there's a difference 
And you are not your mom 
And I am not my father 
But if we don't have the time 
I suppose that it's no bother 
No, it's no bother.
