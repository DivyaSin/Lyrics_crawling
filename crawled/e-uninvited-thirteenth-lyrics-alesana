You should have known better than to insult me 
That won't happen again Sleep, I'll pretend that you died 
And as you rest may your youth be stripped away from you 
Sleep my precious, the darling Rosamond 
May nightmares lay with you, revenge is mine There must be something everyone has missed 
The end is drawing near, it's everything I feared 
I'm starting to wonder will this haunt me? 
In spite of doubt I have to break the spell A lovely day to be tortured by dreams of you Now as she wakes I'll finally look in her eyes, my brilliant prize 
Please know you'll never again be alone for I'm with you Her sweet lips, oh so fair, to awake is now everything I crave 
Time's catching up with me 
I've come this far, there's no turning back 
My sword is drawn, the only choice I have is to fight 
Nothing can stop me now but myself I will break the spell 
Save me, help me, someone 
Anyone, please, can you hear me? 
My eyes, will I ever see light of day again? Never Now as she wakes I'll finally look in her eyes, my brilliant prize 
Please know you'll never again be alone for I'm with you You'll never get away, you'll never get away 
You'll wish you both had died, he will not break the spell 
A lovely day to be tortured by dreams of you Now as she wakes I'll finally look in her eyes, my brilliant prize 
Please know you'll never again be alone for I'm with you 
My sweet princess finally awake
