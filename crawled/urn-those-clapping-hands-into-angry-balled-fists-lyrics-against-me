Sleep on pillows made in Singapore 
Wrapped in comforters 
Sweatin' through sheets 
Drinkin' coffee in the morning 
Flown in on aeroplanes across the vast seas And your house is made of wood 
Central air, central heat 
You've got your furniture of particle board 
Your doors are locked for, for safety And you walk in leather shoes 
Pants of denim, a black cotton sweatshirt 
And you do what you do 
'cause doing, you start to form a habit And you drink all night long 
And you sleep through the morning 
And if something doesn't break 
I'm just gonna go, go fucking insane Away And you sweep up the floor when it's dirty 
You do the dishes, when the sink's full 
And when the refridgerator's empty 
Well it's time, it's time, it's time, it's time, to go the store You put your books on a shelf 
Clothes arranged in the closet 
You hang the things on the wall that you don't wanna be so easily forgotten I hate these songs 
I hate the words 
That the singer is singin' to me 
I hate this melody 
I hate this stupid fucking drum beat But I'm not gonna tell anyone 
What I'm really thinking about 
Keep the conversations on the surface 
Just keep on smiling 
Just keep on saying 
Everything's gonna be alright 
It's gonna be alright [x2] 
Alright [x11]
