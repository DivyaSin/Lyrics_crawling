He's a very smart Prince 
He's a Prince who prepares 
Knowing this time I'd run from him 
He spread pitch on the stairs 
And I'm caught unawares 
Well it means that he cares 
This is more than just malice 
Better stop and take stock 
While you're standing here stuck 
On the steps of the palace All right what do you want 
Have to make a decision 
Why not stay and be caught 
Should I give that a thought 
What would be his response 
But then what if he knew 
Who I am when I know 
That I'm not what he thinks 
That he wants But what if I am 
What a Prince would envision 
But then how can you know 
Who you are till you know 
What you want, which I don't 
So then which do you pick 
Where you're safe, out of sight 
And yourself, but where everything's wrong 
Or where everything's right 
But you know that you'll never belong And whichever you pick 
Do it quick 
'Cause you're starting to stick 
To the steps of the palace It's my first big decision 
The choice isn't easy to make 
To arrive at a ball 
Is exciting and all 
Once you're there, though, it's scary 
And it's fun to deceive 
When you know you can leave 
But you have to be wary 
There's a lot that's at stake 
But you've stalled long enough 
'Cause you're still standing stuck 
In the stuff on the steps Better run along home 
And avoid the collision 
Though at home they don't care 
I'll be better of there 
Where there's nothing to choose 
So there's nothing to lose 
So I'll pry up my shoes 
Wait no thinking it through 
Things don't have to collide 
I know what my decision is 
Which is not to decide 
I'll just leave him a clue 
For example, a shoe 
And then see what he'll do Now it's he and not you 
Who is stuck with a shoe 
In a stew, in the goo 
And I've learned something, too 
Something i never knew 
On the steps of the palace
