When we are walking urban streets and we got ourselves a gun 
Not thinking about our lives and the shape, shape, shape 
Shapes of things to come Ducking down the alleyways of fear 
A hungry cat calls and he knows, knows, knows 
Knows the end is near Now we can't take it no more 
We'll smash down society's walls Bad boys are comin', it's too late to cry 
You better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye 
Bad boys are comin', it's too late to cry 
Too fast to live, we're 2 young 2 die Listen little darlin', I said you'll never understand 
Our times runnin' out, out, out, out 
In this jungle land Clock strikes twelve and the wind begins to moan 
Shivers down our spines and there's no, no, no 
No returning home Now, we can't take it no more 
We're gonna rip down society's walls Bad boys are comin', it's too late to cry 
You better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye 
Bad boys are comin', it's too late to cry 
Too fast to live, we're 2 young 2 die We can't take it no, no, no, no more 
We're gonna kick down the fuckin' wall Bad boys are comin', it's too late to cry 
You better start runnin' or kiss your salty ass goodbye 
Bad boys are comin', it's too late to cry 
Too fast to live, we're 2 young 2 die Bad boys are comin', it's too late to cry 
You better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye 
Bad boys are comin', it's too late to cry 
But too fast to live, we're 2 young 2 die
