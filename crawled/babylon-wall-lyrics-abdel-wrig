Have you ever wondered why you really paying tax 
Vague use of the money now it's no surprise attack 
Budgeting for the war to come and all the weaponry 
Yet unbelievable poverty in your rich country Chorus Babylon wall will have to fall, Babylon wall one day 
Babylon wall will have to fall, Babylon wall 
Babylon wall will have to fall, Babylon wall one day 
Babylon wall will have to fall, Babylon wall 
President of your country a coloured will never be 
Racial problems why call it the 'land of free' 
Pentagon, CIA and KKK the history 
Assassination the answer when your system disagrees Chorus Speech in Interlude 
How long their wall shall stand up firm 
With each block that build it has pain, poverty 
Greed, starvation, disease, 
Yes all of that have to go stop 
Crumble to the ground 
We have to go break down that MY DECISION 
(written by: Abdel Wright) Every man want a good girl, every man want a good girl 
Girls dem plenty and the whole of them look good 
Trust me some no really act as they should 
Bad principles from birth to childhood 
Old dirty ways gone up inna adulthood. 
Anytime you see a girl you like investigate it 
Hard core no want no girl who bend up and switch 
Think me like fe call a girl skettel and bitch 
Who no have nu pride they deserve it. Chorus 
I do want a good girl Yes I do 
Plan to search the whole world 
I prefer girls than pearls 
It?s my decision. Some of them barefaced 
And want fe give you a jacket 
Tell them say it definitely can?t fit. 
Still insist, you ultimately park it 
When she touch the turf, tell her exit. 
Met few girls with a lot of bad habits 
All have in common, search yu pockets 
Wake up next morning can?t find yu wallet 
Few hours away she?s on a taxi. Chorus repeat?
