Everybody says don't 
Everybody says don't 
Everybody says don't it isn't right 
Don't is isn't nice Everybody says don't 
Everybody says don't 
Everybody says don't walk on the grass 
Don't disturb the peace Don't skate on the ice 
Well I say do, I say, 
Walk on the grass it was meant to feel 
I say sail till to the windmill 
And if you fail you fail! Everybody says don't 
Everybody says don't 
Everybody says don't get out of line 
When they say that then lady that's a sign No times out of ten 
Lady you are doing just fine. 
Make just a ripple come on be brave 
This time a ripple next time a wave 
Sometimes you have to start small, Climbing the tiniest wall 
Maybe you're going to fall 
But it is better than not starting at all. 
Everybody says no stop 
Musn't rock the boat musn't touch a thing Everybody says don't 
Everybody says wait 
Everybody says can't fight city-hall 
Can't upset the court 
Can't laugh at the king! 
Well I say try, 
I say, 
Laugh at the king or he'll make you cry 
Loose your poise 
Fall if you have to but lady make a noise... 
Yes! 
Everybody says don't 
Everybody says can't 
Everybody says wait around for miracles 
That's the way the world is made 
I insist on miracles if you do them, 
Miracles might come true, 
Then I say don't... 
Don't be afraid!
