Your lion has left the ring now 
Blood there in the dust 
Every jaw hanging open 
Look on if you must How are you dreaming? 
High on your hill 
Gold in the turning light 
I remember it still Up there somewhere in the ether 
Summers without shoes 
Now you're here with the danger 
Things you cannot do How are you dreaming? 
High on your hill 
Gold in the turning light 
I remember it still 
I remember it still 
I remember it still
