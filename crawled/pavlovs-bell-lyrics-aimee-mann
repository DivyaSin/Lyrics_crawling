Oh, Mario 
Sit here by the window 
Stay here 'til we reach Idaho 
And when we go, hold my hand on take-off 
Tell me what I already know That we can't talk about it 
No, we can't talk about it 
Because nobody knows, that's how I nearly fell 
Trading clothes and ringing Pavlov's Bell 
History shows there's not a chance in hell But, oh, Mario 
We're only to Ohio 
It's kinda getting harder to breathe 
I won't let it show 
I'm all about denial 
But can't denial let me believe 
And we could talk about it 
But he can't talk about it Because nobody knows, that's how I nearly fell 
Trading clothes and ringing Pavlov's Bell 
History shows but rarely shows it well 
Well, well, well Oh, Mario, 
Why if this is nothing 
I'm finding it's so hard to dismiss 
If you're what I need 
Then only you can save me 
So come on baby give me the fix 
And let's just talk about it 
I've got to talk about it Because nobody knows, that's how I nearly fell 
Trading clothes and ringing Pavlov's Bell 
History shows like it was show and tell So tell me... 
That's how I nearly fell... 
By ringing Pavlov's bell... 
So, baby, show and tell... 
Oh, Mario, Mario
