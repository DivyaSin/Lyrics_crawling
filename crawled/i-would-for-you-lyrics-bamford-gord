The list is long and the cost is high 
There's a lot of things that I won't try 
But I would for you And I know better than to test my luck 
I wouldn't risk my life for a million bucks 
But I would for you I'll be the biggest fool you've ever seen 
A regular Joe doing crazy things 
A daredevil heart wouldn't have no limits 
But all the things I wouldn't do 
I would for you I wouldn't swim an ocean full of barracuda 
Or jump from a plane with a parachute 
But I would for you I wouldn't run with the bulls over in Spain 
I wouldn't climb mount Everest in the freezing rain 
But I would for you I'll be the biggest fool you've ever seen 
A regular Joe doing crazy things 
A daredevil heart wouldn't have no limits 
But all the things I wouldn?t do 
I would for you You wouldn't think for a minute that there's a chance 
We could fall in love with just one glance 
But I would for you 
Yeah I would for you 
Girl I did for you I would for you 
I did for you 
I would for you
