We share a wine at your table 
Young summer sun in our eyes 
With a voice that you save for strangers 
You read loudly from your book of lies 
I know but one thing is for sure 
Our love's in a heap on the floor 
Tell me 
Caroline 
How divine 
How do you sleep there so soundly? 
With bells on your toes and a lie on your lips 
Tell me 
Who am I if I'm not the one 
Who is feeling used? 
But now that it's done... 
Who'll keep your sweet thing satisfied? 
Caroline 
(how I wish I was free) 
Caroline 
Blue masquerade in the evening 
Words from some purple crusade 
Delivering the loaves and the fishes 
To the soulds of a passing parade 
I clearly see your design 
Pass me some more holy wine 
Tell me 
Caroline 
How divine 
Oh how you sleep there so soundly? 
With bells on your toes and a lie on your lips 
Tell me 
Who am I if I'm not the one 
Who is being used? 
But now that it's done... 
Who'll keep your sweet thing satisfied?
