I don't wanna be a man who brings home every girl he can 
I just want to have you back again 
And I don't wanna be a king with servants bringin' me everythin' 
I just want to have you back again Oh, what a lonely feelin' to be all by myself 
I can't even eat my breakfast 'cause your plate's up on the shelf I don't want a beauty queen, I know that's been the way it seems 
But I just want to have you back again 
And I don't wanna be the dude that only wants to see you nude 
I just want to have you back again Oh, what a lonely feelin' to be all by myself 
I can't even eat my breakfast 'cause your plate's up on the shelf
