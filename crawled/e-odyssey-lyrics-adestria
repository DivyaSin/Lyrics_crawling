The shadows will lead us back 
the silhouettes point to the west.! I will not be kept from the life 
that I was meant to lead. Rah! It's hard to trust an aching body 
sealed with trust 
but we've come to far 
to fall today The end will be delayed 
We'll make it home 
if we have to crawl on 
our hands and knees 
our minds may grow tired 
but these feets 
know the way! We've wandered far too long 
we've seen the gates of hell. There are those that would 
see is us fail. 
Place us in our coffin 
Strike the final nail 
But who's to say 
that we wouldn't do the same WE CAN'T BE STOPPED 
YOU'LL FALL APART 
WE'LL JUST MOVE ON. It's hard to trust an aching body 
sealed with trust 
but we've come to far 
to fall today 
The end will be delayed We'll make it home 
if we have to crawl on 
our hands and knees 
our minds may grow tired 
but these feets know the way! You speak with silver 
but you leave an ugly stain 
on all you touch 
on everything you say. WE WILL BE LEGEND.
