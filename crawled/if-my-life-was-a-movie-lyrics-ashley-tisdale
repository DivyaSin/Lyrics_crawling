If my life was a movie 
I was scripted so differently 
Starting with the scene where you left me 
See I changed the part where I break down into tears 
If my life was a movie I would be so cool 
I wouldn't miss you 
I wouldn't hate you like I do 
I would just move on 
I would be so strong 
I would be better without you 
Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should 
And its all good If my life was a movie 
It would not be, no tragedy 
I will not let you get to me 
I would ride up in the sunset 
You'd be easy, easy to forget 
By produce it, directing it I would be so cool 
I wouldn't miss you 
I wouldn't hate you like I do 
I would just move on 
I would be so strong 
I would be better without you 
Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should 
And its all good Hollywood, its all good, good, good, good If my life was a movie 
I would be so cool 
I wouldn't hate you 
I would just move on 
I would be better without you Id be cool 
Wed be true 
Cause I wanted love too Id be strong 
You'd be gone 
Because I love you 
I would not break down 
I just wouldn't know how 
I wouldn't miss a thing Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should I would be so cool 
I wouldn't miss you 
I wouldn't hate you like I do 
I would just move on 
I would be so strong 
I would be better without you 
Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should 
And its all good Its all good, Hollywood 
Its all good, Hollywood 
Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should 
And its all good
