Gettin so weak 
And i wish u understood 
How u make me feel 
'cause right now i don't feel real 
And you don't even listen 
To the words that i speak 
And the thoughts that i'm havin r gettin me really freaked 
And the tears in my eyes 
Fall like rain from the sky 
Like the planets unligned 
And your questioning why 
I don't get the point 
It just makes no sense 
I thought it was the beginning 
Have I reached the end I'm hiding from my friends 
How could they understand me 
When they do not know me 
They can't show me 
How to live my life 
What is wrong from right 
But then again 
Who am i 
Look back the days 
When i tried so hard 
Just to fit in 
The way i am feeling 
Where do i begin
