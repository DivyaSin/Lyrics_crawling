When I'm feeling all alone 
There's so far to go 
The signs are no where on this road 
Guiding me home 
When the night is closing in 
It's falling on my skin 
Oh God will you come close? Light light light up the sky 
You light up up the sky to show me 
That you are with me 
I I I can't deny 
No I can't deny 
That you are right here with me 
You've opened my eyes 
So I can see you all around me 
Light light light up the sky 
You light up the sky to show me 
That you are with me When stars are hiding the clouds 
I don't feel them shining 
When I can't see beyond my doubt 
The silver lining 
When I've almost reached the end 
Like a flood you're rushing in 
Your love is rushing in Light light light up the sky 
You light up up the sky to show me 
That you are with me 
I I I can't deny 
No I can't deny 
That you are right here with me 
You've opened my eyes 
So I can see you all around me 
Light light light up the sky 
You light up the sky to show me 
That you are with me So I run, straight into your arms 
You're the bright and morning sun 
To show your love there's nothing 
You won't do 
(you won't do) Light light light up the sky 
You light up up the sky to show me 
you are with me 
I I I can't deny 
No I can't deny 
That you are right here with me 
You've opened my eyes 
So I can see you all around me 
Light light light up the sky 
You light up the sky to show me 
That you are with me Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
That you are with me 
Oh oh o o oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
That you are with me 
Oh oh o o oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
