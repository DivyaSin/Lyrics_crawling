Bring your pipes and bring your sword 
I'll meet you in the lowland 
Tune your banjo, don't be late 
It's time we all were going Fling your arms and clap your hands 
Gather round and sing 
Round and round til we fall down 
Doing the lowland fling 
I'll meet you in the lowland 
Meet you in the lowland Leave your troubles and I'll leave mine 
I'll meet you in the lowland 
We'll make music through the night 
Won't get home til morning Fling your arms and clap your hands 
Gather round and sing 
Round and round til we fall down 
Doing the lowland fling 
I'll meet you in the lowland 
Meet you in the lowland Bring your pipes and bring your sword 
I'll meet you in the lowland 
Tune your banjo, don't be late 
It's time we all were going Fling your arms, clap your hands, gather round and sing 
Round and round til we fall down, doing the lowland fling 
Wave your arms and clap your hands, gather round and sing 
Round and round til we fall down, doing the lowland fling 
I'll meet you in the lowland 
Meet you in the lowland
