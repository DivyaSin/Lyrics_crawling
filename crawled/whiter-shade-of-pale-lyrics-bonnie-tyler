We skipped the light fandango 
Turned cartwheels cross the floor 
I was feeling kind of seasick 
The crowd called out for more 
The room was hummin' harder

They might just as well have been closed (Oh) it was later 
As the miller told his tale 
That her face at first just ghostly 
(It) turned a whiter shade of pale 
(Oh) it was later

That her face at first just ghostly 
(It) turned a whiter shade of pale
