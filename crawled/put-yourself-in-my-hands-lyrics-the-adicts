There is nothing to be scared of 
In my trap, frightened of love 
Don't try to fight me 
You might even like me 
Sends a shiver down your spine 
Told you that you would be mine 
Hush baby now don't you cry 
Don't you wanna die 
Put yourself in my hands 
I'll hold you tenderly 
Put yourself in my hands 
You'll be safe with me 
Sometimes it's hard to bear 
You can only stop and stare 
When your life unfolds 
And your soul is sold 
If you should walk the world alone 
You may never find a home 
Come on take my hand 
There is no promised land
