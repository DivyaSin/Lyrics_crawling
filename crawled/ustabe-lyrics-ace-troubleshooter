It used to be, but not anymore 
Time slipped through my fingers to the floor 
It used to be, but not anymore 
Tipped my hat and walked through the door It used to be the greatest thing to catch fireflies in the evening 
And to watch cartoons in my underwear 
It used to be my greatest fear 
Was what the girl sitting in front of me would say about my hair But now it's so hard, I'm so far from where I have been 
I cannot win anymore 
Now I sometimes cry, wonder why, oh I can't stand it 
Why can't it be like before? It used to be the greatest thing to get in Your presence 
Get lost in You and revel in Your majesty 
It used to be I'd spend an evening alone with You 
Get lost in You and hear You speak to me
