Last night I dreamt of flying 
Over hillsides in the snow 
And I dove down through the clouds 
Into the valley there below 
When the fields turned into parking lots 
My freedom turned to dread 
The ground rose up to greet me 
And I jumped up out of bed 
You can fly, fly, fly 
Off to anywhere you choose 
You can try, try, try 
But eventually you'll lose 
It seems there's always something 
Tryin' to bring a good man down 
I have no fear of falling 
But I hate hitting the ground 
Searchin' through my sofa 
Tryin' to find some extra change 
I thought that I knew everything 
'Til everything changed 
Now I'm standing on an island 
That is sinking into the sea 
And all that I can do 
Is just enjoy the scenery 
Well you can fly, fly, fly 
Off to anywhere you choose 
You can try, try, try 
But eventually you'll lose 
They say a man hears sweet, soft music 
Just before he drowns 
I have no fear of falling 
But I hate hitting the ground 
You and I have politics 
There's lines that we don't cross 
And we live happily ever after 
Inside this little box 
But you just can't take a lion 
And throw him into a cage 
And expect him to be thankful 
For the shelter that you gave 
Well you can fly, fly, fly 
Off to anywhere you choose 
You can try, try, try 
But eventually you'll lose 
The more you try to cling to me 
The less I'll stick around 
I have no fear of falling 
But I hate hitting the ground
