Baby, we're sitting on top of the world We can fly on the wings of an eagle 
Take a ride on a rocket ship 
Drink to the bottom of a bottle 
But we can't get any higher than this We could tiptoe up to the mountaintop 
Snuggle and cuddle and a kiss 
But sooner or later we gotta come down We can't, no, we can't 
Yeah, we can't get any higher than this 
Baby, we're sittin' on top of the world 
And we can't get any higher than this If the sky is the limit 
There's no telling how far we'll go 
Even the angels are grinning 
If there's a heaven we're right in the middle of it If this ain't stoned on loving 
Oh, then I don't know what is 
Cloud nine is right below us 
And we can't get any higher than this We can't, no, we can't 
Yeah, we can't get any higher than this 
Baby, we're sittin' on top of the world 
And we can't get any higher than this If the sky is the limit 
There's no telling how far we'll go 
Even the angels are grinning 
If there's a heaven we're right in the middle of it If this ain't stoned on loving 
Oh, then I don't know what is 
Cloud nine is right below us 
And we can't get any higher than this We can't, no, we can't 
We can't get any higher than this 
Baby, we're sittin' on top of the world 
And we can't get any higher 
No, we can't get any high We can't, no, we can't 
We can't get any higher than this 
Baby, we're sittin' on top of the world 
And we can't get any higher than this I said, baby, we are sittin' on top of the world 
We can't get any higher than this
