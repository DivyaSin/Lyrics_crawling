Little lady with electric fever 
All the guys, they run and hide 
They're afraid of this pioneer 
But peek-a-boo, I see you Don't hold me down 
I'm irrepressible 
Dangerous ground 
Stop bossing me around The only time you can tell me what to do 
Is when we're dancing 
The only time you can tell me what to do 
Is when we're dancing Take this chance right now 
To be my leader 
Lay it on me, wow 
Make me smile from ear to ear Shake me up and break me down 
I've got my dancing shoes on 
So make me move 
'Til I cry out like a hound A pretty bird sitting in her birdcage 
Should be up in the air to fly 
Now you're here trying to clip these wings 
But that won't do, who the hell are you? I'll say it loud 
Step back from the scene of the crime 
I won't allow 
Stand behind the yellow line The only time you can tell me what to do 
Is when we're dancing 
The only time you can tell me what to do 
Is when we're dancing Take this chance right now 
To be my leader 
Lay it on me, wow 
Make me smile from ear to ear Shake me up and break me down 
I've got my dancing shoes on 
So make me move 
'Til I cry out like a hound Shake your pepper 
Shake your tail feather 
Shake your money maker 
Hell even shake your grandma Let it all hang out 
And just scream and shout 
Like me, like me, like me Take this chance right now 
To be my leader 
Lay it on me, wow 
Make me smile from ear to ear Shake me up and break me down 
I've got my dancing shoes on 
So make me move 
'Til I cry out like a hound
