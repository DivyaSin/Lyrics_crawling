I cry myself to sleep at night 
I toss and turn while I think of you 
I just wanna know 
once a flame burned oh-so bright 
but now I try to keep it high 
just wanna know, hm I wanna know givin' it up could be so easy 
livin' it up would be better to do 
go back to the start but I don't want to'cause I am your woman and you are my man no pin-up girl whose body's tight 
can give you what you get from me 
I just wanna show 
so listen to what I say to you 
and keep your eyes hold open wide 
I won't let you go I would never love anyone but you 
I hope you do remember that you love me too can't you see I'm your woman 
givin' it up... 
livin' it up... I would never love...
