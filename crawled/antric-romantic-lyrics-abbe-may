Singing along to the cheesy love songs 
Madonna, Timberlake, Rihanna and K-Pop 
Walking around like a non-cerebral 
Love zombie with a taste for love not evil 
Like when he said I couldn't make the scene 
And I replaced him with a drum machine 
She said I'd never find better 
But I replaced her with a ... 
And later on with someone better better better better And afterwards when I feel like a cigarette 
I hold back 'cause I know you don't like the smell of it 
I taking corners in fourth gear 
One hand on your thigh, the other just to steer 
And unlike you, when I open my mouth 
I open my mouth and the suburbs come out Tantric romantic I sleep alone in the suburbs tonight 
And above me summer birds circle against a pink and blue sky 
I think of you on the other side of a continental divide 
Sending me photos from your mobile of you smiling 
And right then I don't know quite why 
But it's more than implied, it's like a flood tide 
Inside, outside, inside, best side, worldwide, I sighed 
And the world got better better better better
