Rain loves the flowers for a drop at a time when they collide 
petals love the dirt and make it strong when flowers die 
dirt tries to love everything but it's only dirt just because it hurts 
don't mean that it's love you are the punch lines of every joke I've ever told 
you are in coffee and everything I've ever loved 
you can kiss a million other boys, I don't mind 
you can't break what's not real just because it hurts 
that don't mean that it's love
