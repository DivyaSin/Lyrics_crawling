It was a Friday like any other night 
We were playin' the crowds and doin' alright 
Jammin' it out to our favorite country songs 
Laughin' it up and workin' the crowd 
Playin' our guitars just a little too loud 
But nobody cares cuz we got em all singin' along 
Then a hush fell over the place 
And I looked out to see your face (Chorus) 
You started a fire when you walked in 
Couldn't help it girl 
You were pretty as sin 
With your Justin boots 
And your skin tight jeans 
You were the hottest damn thing 
That I'd ever seen 
Those big blue eyes 
And your flamin' red hair 
A smile that said the Devil may care 
My temperature is risin' higher 
You started a fire The rest of the night all eyes were on you 
You sizzled as you danced across the room 
And I just had to watch you mesmerized 
I told myself don't fall too hard 
You don't need to lose your heart 
Cuz if you do a country boy can't survive 
But I had to let that all go 
When you walked up and said hello (Chorus) 
You started a fire when you walked in 
Couldn't help it girl 
You were pretty as sin 
With your Justin boots 
And your skin tight jeans 
You were the hottest damn thing 
That I'd ever seen 
Those big blue eyes 
And your flamin' red hair 
A smile that said the Devil may care 
My temperature is risin' higher 
You started a fire I can't tell what this is all about 
It's a fire that just can't be put out I don't know what all this means 
Whatever you got put a spell on me 
I gotta see you night and day 
Ain't gonna make it any other way I don't know what all this means 
Whatever you got put a spell on me 
I gotta see you night and day 
Ain't gonna make it any other way My temperature is rising higher 
My temperature is rising higher 
You started a fire 
You started a fire
