There's some Polynesian dive 
Downwind from the badlands 
Buh buh buh buh 
The Palace at 4 a.m. 
We kicked through the diamond dust 
Halfway between 
[Incomprehensible] 
[Incomprehensible] 
Kicking around in the promised land 
Just one flick of the wrist 
One flick of the wrist 
And look, look, look, look 
We're in the Palace at 4 a.m. 
When the daydreams in the cupboards 
Back, back, back, back, back 
It's for your soft 
The ribbon tied around your thumb 
When you were kicking hearts around 
With a straight shot, a straight shot 
But lady, would you call it off? 
A straight shot, a straight shot 
But lady, would you call it off? 
Lady, would you call it off? 
Now no more pushing words around 
No more pushing words around 
Bah, bah, bah 
In the Palace at 4 a.m. 
You're asking for the book to be thrown down 
It opens with the third 
With the dumb luck that wasn't blind 
Kicking around in the promised land 
With a straight shot, a straight shot 
But lady, would you call it off? 
A straight shot, a straight shot 
But lady, would you call it off? 
Lady, would you call it off? 
Now no more pushing words around 
No more pushing words around 
No more pushing words around 
No more pushing words around
