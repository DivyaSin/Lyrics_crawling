Hey Rider,hey rider,hey rider .Lay down your arms. 
Hey rider,hey rider,hey rider.All is not lost. 
Come all yea turn riders.Take leave of your war.lay down the plowshares. 
You have beaten to swords. 
Come all yea unbending. 
you tattered and worn. 
lay down the crown you have.Made out of thorns. 
Hey rider,hey rider,hey rider. 
All is not lost. 
Sisters and brothers. 
With your sticks and your stones. 
Come lay down together. 
in the valley of bones. 
With breath from the one who. 
Breathed life into dust. 
We will rise up as one man. 
Let our swords turn to rust. 
Hey rider X3 lay down your arms. 
Hey rider x3 all is not lost,all is not lost.
