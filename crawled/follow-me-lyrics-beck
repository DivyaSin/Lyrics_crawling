Follow me 
Baby, I won't let you leave if you believe in me 
And I always set you free from all those yesteryears 
But you don't know how much 
I got believe in you I was staring at your shoulder shivering 
In such a coldest summer breeze 
Meanwhile I wonder why we're here 
Look for the line between love and friends 
We'll be twisting ourselves again I was standing at the corner on the street 
Watching the wheels are turning free 
Waiting to back up on my feet 
Reading a line between night and day 
I'll be twisting myself again
