In the night, when no one would be watching 
A man came with a question on his mind 
He'd seen this Jesus working many wonders 
He'd watched as Jesus spoke, performing signs "Teacher, surely you must come from Heaven 
For without God, no one could do these things." 
But Jesus saw the longing in the man's heart 
And simply said, "You must be born again." You must be born again Nicodemus, can't you see that you can't enter in 
The Kingdom of the Lord is closed, unless you're born again Nicodemus found what he'd been seeking And you can find it too, my searching friend 
'Cause in your heart, you know He died to save you 
Just ask Him in, and you'll be born again You must be born again
