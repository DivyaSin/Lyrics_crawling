Do you remember the twenty first night of September? 
Love was changing the minds of pretenders 
While chasing the clouds away Our hearts were ringing 
In the key that our souls were singing 
As we danced in the night, remember 
How the stars stole the night away Ba de ya, say do you remember 
Ba de ya, dancing in September 
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day My thoughts are with you 
Holding hands with your heart to see you 
Only blue talk and love, remember 
How we knew love was here to stay Now December found the love that we shared in September 
Only blue talk and love, remember 
The true love we share today Ba de ya, say do you remember 
Ba de ya, dancing in September 
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day Ba de ya, say do you remember 
Ba de ya, dancing in September 
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day The bell was ringing 
And our souls were singing 
Do you remember 
Never was a cloudy day Ba de ya, say do you remember 
Ba de ya, dancing in September 
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day 
Ba de ya, say do you remember 
Ba de ya, dancing in September 
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day Break it down for me (say do you remember) 
Dancing in September Ba de ya 
Say do you remember (Do you remember?) 
Ba de ya, dancing in September (dancing in September) 
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day Uh huh! (bring it back now) 
Dancing in September, uh huh! 
All the way down to the summer
