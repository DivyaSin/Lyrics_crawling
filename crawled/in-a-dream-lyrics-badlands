When I'm down and feeling low 
And confusion has touched my soul 
How I need some place where I can hide away Let me fall within your arms 
Melt away this cold I feel 
All I need is to hold you tonight Hold me close when I'm cold 
Let me hear your beating heart 
Close my eyes far away in a dream In the morning I wake 
And I'm blessed by God's grace 
Just to open my eyes, see your face Hold you tonight, sweet child 
Never let me go 
Tell me everything, oh, will be alright In the morning I awake 
And I'm blessed by God's grace 
Just to open my eyes, see your face 
Just to open my eyes to see your face
