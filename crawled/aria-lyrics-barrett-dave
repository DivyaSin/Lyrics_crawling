Hey Maria, where are ya goin 
Put down the suitcase and please bolt the door 
Children play'n oh can ya hear 'em 
Their calling your name from outside the corridor. 
Hey Maria, you know what I'm here for 
Didn't bring no ladder, ain't down on my knee 
Come and take my hand now, Maria 
And just say you'll run away with me 
So come on little Maria 
We're two bush leaguers on the attack 
I'm an ugly Casanova 
With a chip on my shoulder 
And there ain't no turning back 
Hey Maria, there's your Daddy 
Look's like he's collecting our bail 
He doesn't think we'll make it to Wisconsin 
His big hope is that we'll land in jail. 
Hey Maria, look out the window 
Come on now and tell me what ya see 
Cops are book'n and the pimps they are hook'n 
This ain't no place for you and me. 
So come on little Maria 
We're to bush leaguers on the attack 
We're just two Casanovas 
With a chip on our shoulder 
And there ain't no turning back 
Now someday Maria, you and I 
We'll find ourselves on our own. 
And I might me making minimum wage 
In some bar room minstrel show 
And then someday we'll own it 
Like I said we always would 
Remember how we were talk'n on the top of my car hood. 
Hey Maria, it's time to go now 
Pack up your suitcase, throw in some of my clothes. 
Look at the Dukes, they are standing on Ashland 
Their wiping the eyes and blow'n they nose. 
Hey Maria, we'll come back soon 
And we'll stand on our own wealth and fame 
Maybe we'll come back and get your Daddy 
If the guy will just remember my name. 
So come on little Maria 
We're two bush leaguers on the attack. 
We're just two bosanovas 
With chips on our shoulders 
And there ain't no turning back.
