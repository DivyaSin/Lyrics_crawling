(By the Criminals) You're bigger and stronger, better than het I had a dream last night that I stabbed you to death You're not who you say you are, something surely worse by far You're charming and you're bold, you make my blood run cold I hope your score made par You set me at ease, I don't want to hear about your sex in my dreams you're stabbed in the neck. Tetanus infection locking jaw Just so, just so lusty, I want to stab you with something rusty You cannot conceive what I saw So let's not talk about last night You're an all-poison sight and besides cheap talk it hurts my ears But you steal our precious air All I know is that it's not fair I can feel you drawing near with just a wiggle of my nose Decent upon your meaty frame I want to stab you with something rusty Giant robotic killer wasps They only know to kill and maim. I want to make you dead
