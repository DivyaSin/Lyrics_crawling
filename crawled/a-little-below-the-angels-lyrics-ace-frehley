Alcohol was a friend of mine 
It almost got me dead 
I crashed some cars, got into fights 
Somethings I now regret I've been told, I've got nine lives 
Or maybe even ten 
Now I've changed my ways, my soul's restored 
I'm better now than then We're just a little below 
A little lower than the angels 
And that's alright, that's alright with me Temptin' fate's not what I wanna do 
I'll soon enough be dead 
And all that glitters isn't always gold 
You know I've heard it said II've taken chances, I crossed the line 
I lost my faith in love 
Now the road is clear, my aim is true 
With help from above We're just a little below 
A little lower than the angels 
And that's alright, that's alright with me We're just a little below 
A little lower than the angels 
And I can't fly, I won't fly away You know I won't fly away 
We gotta find our own way 
But I don't know If I'll make it to heaven 
Just open the gates of hell Daddy, have you ever seen an angel? 
Sure baby, well what was it like? 
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen Just a little below 
A little lower than the angels 
And that's alright, that's alright with me We're just a little below 
A little lower than the angels 
And I can't fly, I won't fly away We're just a little below 
A little lower than the angels 
And that's alright, that's alright with me We're just a little below 
A little lower than the angels 
And I can't fly, I won't fly away We're just a little below 
A little lower than the angels 
And that's alright, that's alright with me We're just a little below
