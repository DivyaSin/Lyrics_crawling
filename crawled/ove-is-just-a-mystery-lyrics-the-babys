You turn your back on me 
And you slam the door 
I burn my bridges 
Watch the players 
I know the score 
The starlings fly for winter skies 
Only the cold wind blows 
Love is just a mystery 
Like colors to the blind 
You always need 
A secret agent love 
You feel you've missed 
Once chance for the spirits 
Something stronger than a kiss 
Around the world 
The signal beams 
For others and their dreams 
Love is just a mystery 
Like colors to the blind 
Love is just a mystery 
Like colors to the blind 
Love is just a mystery 
Love is just a mystery 
Love is just a mystery 
Love is just a mystery
