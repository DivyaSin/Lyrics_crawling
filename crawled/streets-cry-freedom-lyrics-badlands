In the coldness of the city 
Where the neon sleeps 
The streets show the pity 
And the nights run deep 
And every shadow seems to hold a hidden story 
And every heart, oh, is a refugee And the old ones hope 
And the lost ones scream 
The hustlers float 
And the young ones dream 
In the city 
Livin' in the soul of the city And the streets cry freedom 
Do you stand or retreat 
As you stare by the neon gods above 
While you bask in the heat And the streets cry freedom 
As the blood runs cold 
As you stare into the eyes of the walking ghosts 
Who've lost their souls In the summer's heat I'm weary 
In the soul of the city 
Potential's burning bright 
In the Harlem halls 
Have you ever lived looking down a shotgun barrel 
When they said hey boy, this ain't your home There ain't no cure for the bleeding heart 
'Cause when you fall 
There's no second start in the city 
There'll always be the soul of the city And the streets cry freedom 
As it burns in the heat 
As you stare by the neon gods above 
While you bask in the heat And the streets cry freedom 
As the blood runs cold 
You stare into the eyes of the walking ghosts 
Who've lost their souls (Solo) There is no reason 
For livin' in sin 
I don't believe when they say hey boy, you better give in 
You know I'll fight for what I know 
Till the day that I die 
'Cause I'm better off dead 
Then buried along with my pride And the streets cry freedom 
Till the day that I die, yeah 
Till the day that I die 
And the streets cry freedom 
Till the day that I die, yeah 
Till the day that I die, yeah 
Till the day that I die 
Till the day that I die, die, die, die, die, oh 
Streets cry freedom Potential's burning bright Oh, oh 
Till the day that I die 
Till the day that I die 
Till the day that I die 
Till the day that I die
