i was asked to get away 
shut my mouth forget what i saw 
be the fool 
and that is something i can do 
quite well, thank you 
i walk away obliterated 
but sedated with the fact 
that i've retained my sanity 
and that is something that 
you've forsaken you wont see me act unkind 
unless you beg to be 
treated that way remember when you were young 
you were the one with the most scars 
remember what is done is done 
even if it hurts in the worst way you wont see me act unkind 
unless you beg to be 
treated that way 
because i will
