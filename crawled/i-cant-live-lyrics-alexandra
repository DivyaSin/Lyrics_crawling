I can't live with someone who's always upset with me 
I can't live having this problem at 3:03 
I can't live with human being like you 
I can't live 
oooooo 
I can't live I don't know what's goin on 
ur always treating me wrong 
I felt a connection between us 
but I guess it entirely went down oo 
down in that drain 
oo I can't live with someone who's always upset with me 
I can't live having this problem at 3:03 
I can't live with human being like you 
I can't live 
oooooo 
I can't live (2x) When we kissed when we hugged i thought you truley loved me 
I was sad so mad but I guess it happened for the best
