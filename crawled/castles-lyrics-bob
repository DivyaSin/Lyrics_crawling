Everything I ever said 
Everything that I have done 
Tryna show 'em it's my time 
Building mansions in my mind 
Now that's all so yesterday 
I'm just lighting up my fire 
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye 
You ask me why 
I'm building castles in the sky 
I'm building castles in the sky I use to ride around town in a watchu call it 
Looking like a demo rapper 
Feeling like a dusty wallet 
Getting fired, then hired, then re-fired 
The idiots guide to how to build an empire 
I show you how to stunt show you how to pop 
Gotta watch from my wrist and a watch for my pops 
Ballin' from the baseline, bottom to the top 
Got bullets on speed-dial yeah I call shots 
Now you can't act like you never heard of me 
'Cause I'm so third degree, everyday I'm burning leaves 
I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down 
They always said I had my head in the clouds, ha Everything I ever said 
Everything that I have done 
Tryna show 'em it's my time 
Building mansions in my mind 
Now that's all so yesterday 
I'm just lighting up my fire 
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye 
Why 
I'm building castles in the sky 
I'm building castles in the sky I use to fantasize about the baddest girl I couldn't get with 
Couldn't get her number couldn't even get her digit 
Then I saw the light now my nights are quite explicit 
I be lost inside the ganja, would've sworn I went missing 
Got bills paid 
Got the whole hood saying, "Damn, Bobby Ray done came a mighty long way" 
No GPS, OnStar or navigation 
We some self made niggas, shout out to my operation 
It started in my mind then it started taking shape 
I still cannot believe that these events are taking place 
I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down 
It's no wonder why my head is in the clouds 
Ha! Everything I ever said 
Everything that I have done 
Tryna show 'em it's my time 
Building mansions in my mind 
Now that's all so yesterday 
I'm just lighting up my fire 
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye 
Why 
I'm building castles in the sky 
I'm building castles in the sky Building castles the size of coliseums 
Thirty thousand feet up, I swear you gotta see 'em 
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude 
Headed for the moon maybe Mars, maybe Venus Building castles the size of coliseums 
Thirty thousand feet up, I swear you gotta see 'em 
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude 
Headed for the moon maybe Mars, maybe Venus Everything I ever said 
Everything that I have done 
Tryna show 'em it's my time 
Building mansions in my mind 
Now that's all so yesterday 
I'm just lighting up my fire 
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye 
Why
