I don 't care what you say 'cause I 'm born to lose 
And I don 't give a damn if I 'm a fool for you 
Uh! Look out! All messed up this time 'cause I 've been walking round with myself 
I 'm just a dead end cruiser didn 't mind to use it 
Now it 's happened to me all over again Somewhere deep inside there 's a neon sign 
Tells me where to ride, man 
When I 'm bombed out of my mind I was desperate for a place to put out my cigarette 
I found love in the nick of time 
And that is something that I really don 't have 
I don 't care if I live or die, man You want to come with me 
You want to ride with me 
You want to blow this town 
'Cause I ain't got time to show you All my secrets are buried down here 
And I will show them if you want me to 
A white night space rocket in sight 
It 's so beautiful with valleys and heights Somewhere deep inside there 's a neon sign 
Tells me where to ride, man 
When I 'm bombed out of my mind I was desperate for a place to put out my cigarette 
I found love in the nick of time I was desperate for a place to put out my cigarette 
I found love in the nick of time 
And that is something that I really don 't have 
I don 't care if I live or die, man
