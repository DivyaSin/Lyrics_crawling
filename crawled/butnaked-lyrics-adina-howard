I'm sitting here lookin' at your body, baby baby baby 
I've never seen something so beautiful here, lately lately lately 
I love tha way, tha candles are bringing out your skin tone, baby baby baby 
Don't ever put your clothes on again, stay buttnaked, baby baby baby I love the way you sound 
When I let you in 
That sweet low moaning 
(You look so good I'mma sing it again) I'm sitting here lookin' at your body, baby baby baby 
I've never seen something so beautiful here, lately lately lately 
I love tha way, tha candles are bringing out your skin tone, baby baby baby 
Don't ever put your clothes on again, stay buttnaked, baby baby baby The neighbors are gonna damn sure hear us tonight 
I know your gonna do some eatin' at my table tonight 
Your body's banging, you don't need no protection tonight 
(Did I just say that? Yes I did) I'm sitting here lookin' at your body, baby baby baby 
I've never seen something so beautiful here, lately lately lately 
I love tha way, tha candles are bringing out your skin tone, baby baby baby 
Don't ever put your clothes on again, stay buttnaked, baby baby baby I love the way you sound 
When I let you in 
That sweet low moaning
