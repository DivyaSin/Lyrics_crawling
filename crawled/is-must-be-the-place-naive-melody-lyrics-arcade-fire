[Talking Heads cover] Home is where I want to be 
Pick me up and turn me round 
I feel numb - burn with a weak heart 
(So I) guess I must be having fun 
The less we say about it the better 
Make it up as we go along 
Feet on the ground 
Head in the sky 
It's ok I know nothing's wrong . . nothing Hi yo, I got plenty of time 
Hi yo, you got light in your eyes 
And you're standing here beside me 
I love the passing of time 
Never for money 
Always for love 
Cover up & say goodnight Home - is where I want to be 
But I guess I'm already there 
I come home - she lifted up her wings 
Guess that this must be the place 
I can't tell one from another 
Did I find you, or you find me? 
There was a time Before we were born 
If someone asks, this where I'll be . . . where I'll be
