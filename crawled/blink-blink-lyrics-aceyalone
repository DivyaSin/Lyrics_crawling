With a grin that matched his own she said, 
"You're not a thief, are you?" 
He shrugged. "Do I look like a thief?" 
"You look like the most attractive man here." 
She paused long enough to catch his eye 
Of course looks can be deceiving. 
She didn't say it, but she could picture him pocketing 
A necklace carelessly left in a jewelry box during a big party. 
Or a Seiko watch from under a poolside towel. 
She didn't imagine him planning a heist, 
But just taking what came his way. 
Returning her smile, he said 'Bout that money, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout 
'Bout that money, gettin' that money [Chorus] 
Blink Blink, every time you open up your eyes 
Blink Blink, every time you open up your mind 
Blink Blink, yeah, yeah 
What the fuck are people talkin' 'bout? Blink, every time you open up your eyes 
Blink Blink, every time you open your mind 
Blink Blink, yeah, yeah 
What the fuck these people talkin' 'bout? I say it once, I'll say it again 
Cold cash money make the whole world spin 
You can laugh, and you can grin 
But you ain't sayin' shit if you ain't got ends 
So hold your breath, and wait for God 
And when you get here, tell him that you need a job 
Because shit is hard, in the battlefield 
And the next business deal can get you killed [Chorus] The phone's in my name and it can't be cut off 
The water and the power and it can't be shut off 
Food, shelter, cheese, I gotta break off, please 
I gotta shake off, that's why I gotta take off 
I'm young and full of vigor, West coast nigga 
Tryin' to make my pockets bigger from the shit that I deliver 
Stay afloat, sell your boat 
Sell what you wrote, fuck it, sell dope Yeah, yeah, what the fuck are people talkin' 'bout? 
Yeah, what the fuck do people think about? [Chorus: x3] You should put on a mask, and go in home savings 
Wit yo nuts and yo' heart and yo' forty-five waving 
Westsiders got West cravings 
God damn motherfuckin' money is amazing Yeah, you know money money in everything 
You know money make the world go round 
You know money runnin' everything 
You know money make the world go round 
You know money runnin' everything 
You know money make the world go, round Blink
