If you listen, fly with me 
Our bodies will disappear now 
It was your idea to take a walk 
Started talking about dreams Clear the water from your plate 
A line's been drawn 
Washed away by shelling rain Sole off on a motor bike 
Stretching out across the hills 
You said everything's once done 
Crossing out your boots and river grown Clear the water from your plate 
A line's been drawn 
Washed away by shelling rain I feel you like other days 
Days that drift along You said everything's once done 
Crossing out your boots and river grown 
Clear the water from your plate 
A line's been drawn 
Washed away by shelling rain
