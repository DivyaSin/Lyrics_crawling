Cast off your shame and believe in something more 
don't romance blame as your pain reliever, soul deceiver next time i shatter 
i hope that you're long gone 
but if i should handle my god 
i hope you're still there 
such a failure blackening angelic eyes 
I'm going to have almost nothing left pleased to meet you want you cut you 
I'm sorry i didn't know who i was hurting 
wait you're bleeding from somewhere beautiful 
I'm sorry its over now "...and if you never stop to face all that you do 
in all your actions and expenses of the loved ones that you master that you master 
you can never be a part of what is graceful 
what is good and 
what is honestly the presence of a love inside your heart 
and it is breaking by the thousands 
due to people like your father like your father 
its a never ending never bending threshold of abuse that you are always forced to take 
and so you can never break down the raw side 
defense landslide splinters of the hurt 
and pain piercing all that you have been 
and if you think you're hurting now 
you better not wake up again melting in the sibling sun exposing all that 
you have done and if you think you're hurting 
now you ain't seen nothing yet..." there's a reminder inside of your anger 
about all the people that you have damaged 
that you have hurt 
its just like i said that your life would turn out
