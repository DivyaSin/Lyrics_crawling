Well any sense I had is gone 
On an open field, you had me run 
Where is the light we had before 
I don't know why I ask at all 
I keep on talking carelessly 
I look in books and magazines 
Thinking our word could be enough 
You look at me, I'm burn it up. When I hear your good advice, I'm starting something 
And good advice, I'm running from it 
I didn't ask, and I didn't want it In an empty room you pardon me 
But all around us whispering 
But we have now, anyone's guess 
So just be rude or your kindest 
You give it out so easily 
That now I drown in reasoning 
I can't held or even hurt 
And every word makes me feel worse When I hear your good advice, I'm starting something 
Your good advice , I keep running from it. 
I shouldn't ask since I never wanted
