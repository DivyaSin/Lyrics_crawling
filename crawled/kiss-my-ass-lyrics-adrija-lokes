Baby, this will make you feel alright 
It's easy, just be near me all night long 
Baby, let me give you something strong 
Lazy, this will surely add up spice But baby, this comes at a price 
Are you ready, to pay up at the time 
This may, need your soul to be loaned 
Are you ready, to pay up what you need to pay Baby, think you need me right now 
But really, you need what I give you more 
So hey, you can shut your crap right now 
Cause I am, bitch walking on the freedom road Someday, you might realize what you've done 
Crazy, your mind will go for a ride 
This is, end of live and your pride 
So baby, kiss my ass and say goodbye
