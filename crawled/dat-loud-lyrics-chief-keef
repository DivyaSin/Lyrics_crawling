Hook : Chief Sosa I'm smokin' on loud (on loud)

Never spend my money on hoes

On hoes (3x) Hook Repeats Ballout: You kno me and Chief Sosa off loud 
Everytime we come to your town 
We smoke dope bitch, and we smoke out the pound 
We got choppers and I swear they so loud 
Sneak diss us and we come to your town 
Pull up in the Rari so loud 
All the bad bitches be goin' wild 
Everytime we come around 
They be like Ballout and Sosa so wild 
Is it because we smoke so much loud 
We at the top bitch and we aint comin' down 
Ballout (3x)
