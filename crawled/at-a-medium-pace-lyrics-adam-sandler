Put your arms around me baby 
Can't you see I need you so 
Hold me close against your skin 
I'm about to begin 
Lovin' you Spit on your hand and stroke my cock 
At a medium pace 
Play with my balls and tell me 
How big they are 
Honey, rub your beaver 
Up and down my face 
Sit on the corner of the bed 
And watch me whack off You see that shampoo bottle 
Now stick it up my ass 
Push it in and out 
At a medium pace 
Talk about your old boyfriend's dick 
And how big it was 
Now shave off my pubes 
And punch me in the face 
Whoa darlin' 
Make me push my dick and balls 
Back between my legs 
Call me an ugly woman 
And take my picture to show 
All the people you work with Now pull up my scrotum 
And take the shampoo bottle 
Out of my ass 
Pretend I'm the pizza delivery guy 
And watch me whack off
