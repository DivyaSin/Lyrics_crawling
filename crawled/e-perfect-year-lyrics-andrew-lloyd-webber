Ring out the old 
Bring in the new 
A midnight wish to share with you 
Your lips are warm, my head is light 
Were we in love before tonight? I don't need a crowded ballroom 
Everything I need is here, if you're with me 
Next year will be the perfect year No need to hear the music play 
Your eyes say all there is to say 
The stars can fade 
And they can shine 
Long as your face is next to mine I don't need a crowded ballroom 
Everything I need is here, if you're with me 
Next year will be the perfect year We don't need a crowded ballroom 
Everything I need is here, if you're with me 
Next year will be the perfect year It's New Year's Eve, and hopes are high 
Dance one year in, kiss one goodbye 
Another chance, another start 
So many dreams to tease the heart We don't need a crowded ballroom 
Everything I need is here, if you're with me 
Next year will be the perfect year
