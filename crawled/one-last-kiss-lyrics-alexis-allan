you, say what you need you to 
feel like you have the 
power to break my heart 
into pieces crash, right into me 
just get right through me 
and run away from all your mistakes and suddenly i can see finally things are clear one last kiss before we fall apart before i break your heart cuz im moving on this was sweet when it lasted you and me but now its all gone and im moving on dont, beg me to love you 
way the i used to 
you had your chance and you blew it
