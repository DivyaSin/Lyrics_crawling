in those days nothing to lose in my life 
only innocense if you can forgive me now the spiral of the light i didn't know my own sins i didn't know others lies 
the rain became a stream and flows in the sea of blood i spend all my sinful days 
the light breaks with no care 
but i have no fear of anything 
so i want that from you now it's something i can feel please do it for me now
