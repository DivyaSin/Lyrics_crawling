Here it goes take a deep breath 
And let all of your secrets 
Come and go the way we used to do 
It don't hurt that bad I can't believe it 
Now that it's all completed let us go 
The way I know you'll do But then again 
You might choose to 
Change your mind this time Another day of growing older 
Winds blowing colder 
Don't you know, it chills me to the bone 
Now you grow tall as I stay smaller 
And I'd hate to stall you 
Love of mine, it's fair to say I can't let go But then again 
Sometimes the rain clears 
And the sun shines Now I pass the time with flying colors 
And fly by others though I know they'll only wish me well 
For I my dear cannot be bothered 
With wishful talkers 
None of whom know just what story to tell But then again 
My mind could use just 
One more friend in life
