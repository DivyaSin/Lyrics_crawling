Standing 
By the dancefloor 
Looking for some 
Trick or treat 
That was 
When I saw her 
Looking so good 
So good to eat 
Body and soul 
Keep me going 
You'll be there 
When the blood is flowing 
Only got one life to live 
Body and soul 
Keep me moving 
You'll be there 
When the rest are losing 
Only got one life to give 
Moving 
Closer to her 
And I asked her 
For a dance 
Feeling 
Kinda lucky 
So I thought I'd 
Take a chance 
Then I reached out 
To touch her hand 
She pulled me close 
And whispered I'm a man - say what
