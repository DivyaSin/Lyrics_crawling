Like a rock, 
Like a planet, 
Like a fucking atom bomb, 
I'll remain unperturbed by the joy and the madness That I encounter everywhere I turn 
I've seen it all before 
In book and magazines 
Like a twitch before dying 
Like a pornographic sea 
There's a flower behind the window There's an ugly laughing man 
Like a hummingbird in silence 
Like the blood on the door 
It's the generator 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, like the blood on my door Wash me clean and I will run 
Until I reach the shore 
I've known it all along 
Like the bone under my skin 
Like actors in a photograph 
Like paper in the wind
