And in the end I will show you that this life is only madness 
Can we filter out the toxicity and find worth in the static 
We build and build; we forget the model, we design the madness and we paint it gold Swarming and spiraling burning at both ends 
A blur on the horizon 
We fail to keep site over and over again 
Open your palms up resist the current 
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static) 
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static) 
and you'll find me at the end 
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones 
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static) 
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static) 
and you'll find me at the end 
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones 
With pressure we creak and we bend. crimson feet trample our joints 
We splinter and break. we suffer again 
We become a path others use to take 
A distant undertaking to suffer the same 
I'll stand right beside you. we slog side by side 
Become a path others use to take 
Lost in the static 
Just to suffer the same Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones 
Hold me up and join me on the horizon 
Kill whats left of the inner glow 
Giving up the ghost 
Growing cold 
We never begin 
Our own feet trample our joints, we burn at both ends 
A blur on the horizon 
We become a path others use to take 
A distant undertaking to suffer the same 
I'll stand right beside you. we slog side by side 
Lost in the static 
We build and build we forget the model, we design madness and 
Paint it gold 
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static) 
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static) 
and you'll find me at the end 
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones 
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static) 
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static) 
and you'll find me at the end 
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones
