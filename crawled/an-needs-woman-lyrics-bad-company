Hot damn I'm down on my knees 
I want a love someone please me 
Come on baby I want to be in love again 
Lonely nights give me the blues 
I've had enough of loving and losing 
Come on baby and hit me like a hurricane 
Every man needs a woman 
Every woman needs man Do my best to try to make you understand Now every man needs a woman 
Every woman needs man 
Do my best to try to make you understand Bad luck don't get in my way 
Pretty woman you can save me yeah 
Come on baby and take me up to heaven above 
Treat me right give me a chance 
I'm looking for a sweet romance 
Come on baby and hit me like a hurricane Now every man needs a woman 
Every woman needs man 
Do my best to try to make you understand I want a love someone please me 
Come on baby I want to be in love again 
Lonely nights give me the blues Now every man needs a woman 
Every woman needs man 
Do my best to try to make you understand
