Knifing my way through a diamond mine 
Dragging those rocks 
From seabed to shoreline 
Rubies and sapphires from Emerald bay 
Stretching across the milky way 
One day... one day... Prospecting gold and staking my claim 
But the only thing I treasure 
Is hearing your name 
Most everyone dreams diamonds and furs 
I dream of love and baby it's yours 
One day... one day... One day you'll realise 
You'll see it on her eyes 
No room for alibis - one day... one day... 
One day you'll realise 
Feel me materialise 
You'll see you're just a fool to leave me 
One day... one day... one day soon baby They say that your life is an open book 
Well I just wrote a chapter so take a look 
Can't blame it on fate or destiny 
Now that your book... it features me 
One day... one day... One day you'll realise 
You'll see it on her eyes 
No room for alibis - one day... one day... 
One day you'll realise 
Feel me materialise 
You'll see you're just a fool to leave me 
One day... one day... one day soon baby Hardly a day goes by without me thinking of you 
No matter how hard I try you can't escape a dream 
Living my life - in the lap of luxury 
Living my life - confuse me... confuse me babee One day you'll realise 
You'll see it on her eyes 
No room for compromise - one day... one day... 
One day you'll realise 
Feel me materialise 
You'll see you're just a fool to leave me You can't shake a dream - how I wish that you could 
One day you're mine get that understood 
Until then each night I shall pray 
For a love that lasts forever and... 
One day... one day...
