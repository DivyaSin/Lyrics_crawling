Like cattle to the slaughter 
He lures them to their death 
Morbid thoughts fill twisted mind 
A crave for tearing flesh Friendly face, a lollipop 
He traps them after school 
Flat chested, pretty six year old 
The type that makes him drool Lubricates his vile tool 
Child tied to the bed 
Rams his rod, the pelvis snaps 
Sheets stained brown and red Frustration tears his mind apart 
The pain in his brain, making him insane His tool shed hosts, a magnitude of corpses 
Torn and scattered 
Bloodied meat strewn on the floor 
From bodies slashed and tattered Sickened brain, repulsive lusts 
Feeble bodies torn apart 
Finger paints with body fluids 
Disgusting abstract art Stark staring mad 
Re-enacting horrid dreams 
Horrors of his mind made reality More than flesh and blood can bear 
Raging uncontrolled 
Feeble heartbeat drifts away 
Corpse lies still and cold
