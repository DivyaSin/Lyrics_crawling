I saw her, yea I saw her 
With a black tongue tied round the roses 
A fist pounding on a vending machine 
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger 
With a noose she could hang from the sun 
And point it out with the dark sunglasses 
Walking crooked down the beach 
She spits in the sand 
Where their bones are bleaching And I know I'm gonna steal her eye 
She doesn't even know it's wrong 
And you know I'm gonna make her die 
Take her where her soul belongs 
Know I'm gonna steal her eye 
Nothing that I wouldn't try Hey my sun-eyed girl 
Hey my sun-eyed girl 
My sun-eyed girl 
Hey my sun-eyed girl I saw her, yea I saw her With her hands tied back 
Her rags are burnin' 
Calling out from a landfilled life 
Scrawling her name up on the ceiling 
Throw a coin in the fountain of dust 
White noise, her ears are ringing 
Got a ticket for my midnight hanging 
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving And I know I'm gonna steal her eye 
She doesn't even know it's wrong 
And you know I'm gonna make her die 
Take her where her soul belongs 
Know I'm gonna steal her eye 
Nothing that I wouldn't try Hey my sun-eyed girl 
Hey my sun-eyed girl 
My sun-eyed girl 
Hey my sun-eyed girl Hey my sun-eyed girl 
Hey my sun-eyed girl 
My sun-eyed girl 
Hey my sun-eyed girl 
Hey my summer girl 
Hey my sun-eyed girl 
My sun-eyed girl 
Hey my sun-eyed girl
