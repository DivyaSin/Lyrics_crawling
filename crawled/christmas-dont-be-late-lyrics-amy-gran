Time goes by, and Christsmas lists change 
But some things don't ever change 
Like the anticipation of being together 
Christmas at our house is full of a whole lot of last minute everything 
'Cause that's just our pace Christmas, Christmas time is near 
Time for toys and time for cheer 
We've been good, but we can't last 
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast 
Want a plane that loops the loop 
Me, I want a hula hoop 
We can hardly stand the wait 
Please Christmas, don't be late I guess I like nostalgic gifts because they remind me of my childhood 
There was one year I gave the kids potholder kits 
You know with the metal loons and the cotton loops? 
It was a disaster 
But before Christmas day was up, guess who was making pot holders? 
Everybody in the whole family 
And you can't even wrap this under the tree but, here comes Christmas for me 
Just getting to hear my girls sing Christmas, Christmas time is near 
Time for toys and time for cheer 
We've been good, but we can't last 
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast 
Want a plane that loops the loop 
Me, I want a hula hoop 
We can hardly stand the wait 
Please Christmas, don't be late
