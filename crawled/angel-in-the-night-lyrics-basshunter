You are my light in the dark 
You are the beating in my heart 
But that is not enough 
Will I ever be by your side? Your hair is dancing in the wind 
Your eyes are burning up my skin 
And I'm so happy when I see 
That you are smiling back at me You're leaving burn marks on the ground 
Thank You, God, for what I've found 
I don't know how, I don't know why 
But you're my angel in the night You are my light in the dark 
You are the beating in my heart 
Let me hold you now 
Just like days before you start to cry You are my light in the dark 
You are the beating in my heart 
But that is not enough 
Will I ever be by your side? Prepare for lunch in three, two, one I try my best to satisfy 
But all you do is wave me goodbye 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 
But I'm so crazy about you Even if I don't know where to start 
Even if my love is tearing me apart 
I just know that you and me 
We were always meant to be You are my light in the dark 
You are the beating in my heart 
Let me hold you now 
Just like days before you start to cry You are my light in the dark 
You are the beating in my heart 
But that is not enough 
Will I ever be by your side? Three, two, one 
You're my angel in the night
