One hour ahead of the posse 
the bloodhounds are hot on my trail 
last night I shot my sweetheart 
this morning I broke out of jail my Pinto is tired and hungry 
and I'm feeling weary and warm 
we started ahead of the posse 
and we got to keep going on the sherrif aswored he would get me 
he's riding with 20 and 5 
but I'm not afeared of that posse 
they never will get me alive One hour ahead of the posse 
no turning to left or to right 
we must win the race to the river 
or there'll be a hanging tonight one hour ahead of the posse 
no time for remorse or regret 
but somehow her eyes still haunt me 
her laughter is taunting me yet it started the night that we might 
she kissed me and vowed she would care 
I traded the gold in pocket 
to fondle the curls in her hair she lied when she told me she loved me 
she lied with each kiss that she gave 
she lied to the moment I caught her 
and now she lies still in her grave on hour ahead of the posse 
the night is a-coming on fast 
we must win the race to the rio 
and well shake that old posse at last we're nearing the end of our journey 
and now I'm inside of my goal 
at last we've beaten the posse 
- gun shot - 
may the Lord have mercy on my soul
