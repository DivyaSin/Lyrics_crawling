The kids are right from doing wrong! 
Check him in 
Check her out 
Check that chick is passin' out 
I'm checkin' out 
Before I piss my money down the drain A sacrifice to get salvation 
Built it up on aggravation That's why the kids are right 
From doing wrong 
Everyone I've seen was better that me 
Well it gets alright 
From doing wrong 
Everyone I've seen was better then me Make her up 
Make him win 
Makin' me commit a sin 
I.D.I.T 
I think I will go insane A 1000 years of salutation 
And all we built was a Disney-nation You know 
You know that I'm just a dead boy Can't keep 'em isolated
