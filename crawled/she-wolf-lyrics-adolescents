She Wolf - You can tell, by the way she moves 
She Wolf - You can tell, she dont't play games to lose 
She Wolf - She eats men, who can't pass her by 
She Wolf - She's on the prowl, another's gonna die DIE! She's the blonde queen of the silver screen - 
Smashing the weak of the single's scene. 
Is she the hawk, the hunter or the hunted? 
Will she cut them down from the hangin tree? 
Dressed to kill in black and red - 
Wanders late at night she wants to be fed. 
Men can't resist her, they haven't got the will, 
She Wolf moves in for the kill. She Wolf grabs her men by the throats and yells 
"This is what i need!" 
She Wolf rips their heads off shrieking 
"Open up and bleed!" Take the strange case of the missing husband 
Of the widow at the end of the street: 
Friday night he went to the pub with his buddies 
To have a couple of drinks. 
As his eyes started to wander, 
She Wolf spun her web. 
As harmless as a spider, 
She offered him her bed. She Wolf grabbed him by the throat and yelled 
"This is what i need!" 
She Wolf ripped his head off shrieking 
"Open up and bleed!" Mother's life was stolen 
By the wicked hands of man. 
Unholy maggot on her soul to the end 
In death she made her last stand: 
"I was raped of love of life - 
Man took from women ALL. 
No more subservient wife, 
No longer do I bid your call. 
As a blood oath then, 
I offer you my girl. 
NEVER AGAIN WILL WOMAN BE 
NIGGER OF THE WORLD!" She Wolf grabs them by the throats and yells 
"This is what i need!" 
She Wolf rips their heads off screaming 
"Open up and bleed!" She Wolf - You can tell, by the way she moves 
She Wolf - You can tell, she dont't play games to lose 
She Wolf - She eats men, who can't pass her by 
She Wolf - She's on the prowl, another's gonna die She Wolf! 
She Wolf! 
She Wolf! 
She Wolf!
