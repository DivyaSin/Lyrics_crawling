Thirty-two years never learned a thing 
Spent too much time on cold dark streets 
Selling her body her soul for the almighty dollar 
If theres a god somewhere watching me she says, 
"Damn him for making me weak; but strong enough 
at the same time to live so long in hell." She can wash away the dirt and stains 
Tastes of the impure 
Wash away the dirt and stains 
And wind up on the floor 
She can sell her body sell her soul 
Forget what it's all for 
And pretend that she don't care when they call her 
A dirty whore Twenty-six years and I'm still here 
Collecting baggage scars and fear 
Selling my body my soul for the almighty dollar 
Sometimes I think that I just might 
Tumbleweed some desert night 
Leave this all behind and start a life 
That's not a lie And wash away the dirt and stains 
The taste of the impure 
Wash away the dirt and stains 
And find a place to grow again 
Or walk away, just walk away 
And start a life that's more 
And go where I don't feel like another 
Dirty whore Sometimes at night it feels like I could walk away 
Leave it all behind and start a life that's not a lie 
Sometimes I think that we could all just walk away 
Leave it all behind leave it all behind Going to leave some desert night going to start a brand new day 
Going to leave some desert night going to start a brand new day 
Going to wash it away going to wash it away
