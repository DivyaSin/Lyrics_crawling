[1st verse] 
I've got something to talk about 
I've had a lot on my mind 
But i think i finally figured it out 
What I'm feeling on the inside 
'Cause where i want to be 
is in the thick of things 
It's all I'm thinking about [Chorus] 
These are the exciting times 
I can see that you are leading me 
and it feels so right 
I'm assured of this, my offering 
I'm finally living 
'Cause these are the exciting times Things can happen so rapidly 
Then again they can take a lot of time 
But i know these things are not up to me 
But I'll be ready in the mean time 
Opportunity is calling out to me 
I lay it all on the line [Chorus] This thing is bigger than me 
and I'm just wanting to be a part of anything 
And everything you ask of me [Chorus]
