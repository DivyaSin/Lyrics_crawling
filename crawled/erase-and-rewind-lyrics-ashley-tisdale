I don't want to feel like this 
I don't want to, I don't want to 
I don't want to freak you out 
But I (but I, but I) 
Think I might have said too much 
Didn't mean to, didn't mean to 
Think I might have said it's you 
And I (and I, and I) Guess I should leave this behind 
Guess I should erase and rewind 
But somehow I can't seem to stay away 
I don't want to sound desperate but I am 
So say that you'll come around 
Guess I should erase and rewind 
Erase and rewind I don't wanna stand in line 
Like I used to, like I used to 
I don't wanna have to scream 
And shout (and shout, and shout) 
Cause I'm the kind of girl that sticks 
Like a tattoo, like a tattoo 
Yeah I'm the kind of girl that wears 
On your arm, arm Guess I should leave this behind 
Guess I should erase and rewind 
But somehow I can't seem to stay away 
I don't want to sound desperate but I am 
So say that you'll come around 
Guess I should erase and rewind 
Erase and rewind You never do return my calls 
Just like we never met at all 
No matter what I'll always wait for you 
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you I don't wanna feel like this 
I don't want to (Yea) Guess I should leave this behind 
Guess I should erase and rewind 
But somehow I can't seem to stay away 
I don't want to sound desperate but I am 
So say that you'll come around 
Guess I should erase and rewind 
Erase, erase and rewind Guess I should leave this behind 
Guess I should erase and rewind 
But somehow I can't seem to stay away 
I don't want to sound desperate but I am 
So say that you'll come around 
Guess I should erase and rewind 
Erase and rewind
