We greet each day with bloodshot eyes 
The dirt of our labor still clinging to our hands 
Filled with our warped intentions 
The tread of our shoes filled with foreign sands 
The sun laughs in all our faces 
It shows a world that we can't save 
So now, armed with blades in hand 
We cut a path from birth to grave We don't know, where we're going 
But we know, that we'll get there No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked 
No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked 
No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked 
No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked We don't think like you think 
And we move like no one moves 
With a song on our lips, across the land 
Born to traverse 
We don't think like you think 
And we move like no one moves 
With a song on our lips, across the land 
Born to traverse We don't know, where we're going 
But we know, we'll get there No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked 
No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked 
No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked 
No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked Like a car crash 
Like a landmine 
Like mixing drugs, we are dangerous Like a snake's tooth 
Like thin ice 
Like mixing blood, we are dangerous No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked 
No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked 
No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked 
No rest for the blessed 
Long life for the wicked
