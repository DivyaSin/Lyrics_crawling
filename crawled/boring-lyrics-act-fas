Things never seem to turn out just right 
Why I don't know 
Things used to move way to fast 
Now it seems to move so slow 
We used to do lots of cool stuff 
Now I just sit and watch tv 
Life used to be so exciting 
What is wrong with me *chorus* 
Life is 
Supposed to be spontaneous 
When we're young 
Everything is supposed to move to fast 
But lately 
Nothing seems too exciting 
I've been getting lazier 
Always out first and always in last I think about the way things used to be 
And then I kick myself 
'cause I know it will never be the same 
Sometimes I wish I was someone else 
I just get so God damn bored 
Sometimes I feel like I'm dead 
Everything is too calm 
I know it's not all in my head
