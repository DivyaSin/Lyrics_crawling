instrumental intro Sun take my pain today 
Give the devil back his heart 
Do not pray for us 
We are not sleeping while the others are sleepin' Every bone I beg 
Every cup is shone 
Every bottle 
Baby don't be that way Every talk of the town 
Every Julius 
Every moth heading towards a flame Psalm One Hundred and Twenty One 
Is that my son comin' over the hillside? Fine o pray for us 
We are not sleeping while the others are sleeping Every bone I beg 
Every cup is shone 
Every bottle 
Baby don't be that way Every dog on the prowl 
Every Tiberious 
Every moth heading towards a flame mmm mm mm 
mmm mm mm 
ohhh Sun take my pain to the East 
Cause the day I made my frown Final prayer for us 
Oh he's sleepin' 
The devil is sleepin' Give the devil back his heart 
Give the devil back his heart 
Give the devil back his heart 
Give the devil back his heart oh oh oh oh 
oh oh oh oh
