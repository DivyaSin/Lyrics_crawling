I am exploring the inside 
I find it desolate 
I do implore these confines 
Now as they penetrate, recreate me I'm hovering throughout time 
I crumble, in these days 
I crumble cannot, I cannot find 
Reflection in these days If you listen 
Listen, listen 
Listen close 
Beat by beat 
You can hear when a heart stops 
I saved the pieces 
When it broke 
And ground them all to dust I am destroyed by the inside 
I disassociate 
I hope to destroy the outside 
It will alleviate and elevate me Like water flowing into lungs 
I'm flowing, through these days 
Like morphine drops through, through deadend veins 
I'm numbing in these days So if you listen 
Listen, listen 
Listen close 
Beat by beat 
You can hear when a heart stops 
I saved the pieces 
When it broke 
And ground them all to dust I know what died that night 
It can never be brought back to life once again, I know 
I know what died that night 
It can never be brought back to life once again, I know 
I know, I died that night and I'll never be brought back to life 
Once again, I know 
I know, I died that night and I'll never be brought back to life 
Once again, I know If you listen 
Listen, listen 
Listen close 
Beat by beat 
You can hear when a heart stops 
I saved the pieces 
When it broke 
And ground them all to dust So if you listen 
Listen, listen 
Listen close 
Beat by beat 
You can hear when a heart stops 
I saved the pieces 
When it broke 
And ground them all to dust
