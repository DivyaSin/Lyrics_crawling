Mother and child, mother and 
Just the mother and child On a cold starry night in the winter time 
Stood three old men by a mill pond in the moonlight 
And they spoke of the young men on the front line 
How they all wished them home for the Christmas time As they spoke from the east came a bright light 
And it sparkled like pure gold in their sad eyes 
And an angel came down on Denshaw Mill 
Spreading her light all around on the dark side Are you blind can you not see? 
Do you think that it's me who deceives? 
He promised to be there if you believe 
To carry you home A hole as rotten as ever fouled the green earth 
"Was this old mill in its day", spoke the angel 
Yet, there's many a poor boy in foreign climes 
Who would think this old mill now a palace fine As she spoke from the mill who came laughter 
Came the warm sounds of the young men like a summer breeze 
And they rose in the night like fire bright 
Spreading their light all around on the dark side Are you blind can you not see? 
Do you think that it's me who deceives? 
He promised to be there if you believe 
To carry you home No one knows what became of the bonny lads 
Posted missing, lost in action in a far land 
Fools and heroes, gallant men, now side by side 
With the old men who believed they came home that night 
To the warmth of their homes at Christmas time To the peace of their homes at Christmas time
