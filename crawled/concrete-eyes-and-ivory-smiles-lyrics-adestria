The waters have grown calm. The boat meets it's mark. 
So I wrap myself in these self made binds, 
As the clouds begin to creep, begin to creep. Make sure it digs in, these shackles of words. 
The blood means it's working so bring on the frenzy. 
The water soothes, it's the salt that stings. Fins all around, all around me. 
The water soothes, it's the salt that stings, bring on the frenzy. 
Concrete eyes and ivory smiles, concrete eyes and ivory smiles. You know why you're here, you could smell the blood, 
You know why you're here, you could smell the blood, 
You know why you're here, you could smell the blood, 
You know why you're here, you could smell the blood, You are the shark so bring it in closer, if you want this feast then we'll do it tonight, 
So turn it red! 
Oh!
