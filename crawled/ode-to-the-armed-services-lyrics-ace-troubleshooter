Andy's gonna be a marine 
He'll eat mashed potatoes and a can of cold baked beans 
He'll be out there digging a latrine 
'cause Andy's gonna be a marine Andy's gonna be a marine 
He'll have the biggest muscles that you've ever seen 
He'll be lean, green, mean, a muscle machine 
'cause Andy's gonna be a marine I can crush you! I can pound you! It'll be so nifty 
The drill sergeant will tell him to drop and 
"Gimme Fifty!"
