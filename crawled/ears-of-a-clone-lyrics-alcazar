A room with a hundred men 
The design of a perfect blend 
Identical strains of code 
Dressed up in the fashion mode The air I breathe 
The blood that moves 
My heart to mend I cry The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone The mind of a mannequin 
The look of the perfect twin 
This army of confidence 
Is an army of no defense The air I breathe 
The blood that moves 
My heart to mend I cry The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone The air that I breathe 
The blood that moves me 
One broken heart mend 
The self I defend 
The air that I breathe 
The blood that moves me 
One broken heart mend 
The self I defend I walk through a no man's land 
Come lend your creating hand 
How I crave for identity 
Come lend me your fantasy The air I breathe 
The blood that moves 
My heart to mend I cry The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone 
The tears of a clone
