I know all the little bus drivers saying The clocks of the world are evil in their design 
Our days of wine and song never came 
And calendars map the places, we've never been 
So call us The Unlucky Ones We walk under ladders, as a matter of course 
Jump on every crack, we can find 
Thirteen a day, if we get half a chance 
So call us The Unlucky Ones Come out and dance awhile 
Out in the black cat infested night 
We dance on ledges and spires 
With losers and liars, we don't have a thing to fear
