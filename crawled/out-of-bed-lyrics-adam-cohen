For you I'd try to make it rain in the desert. 
I'd ask the mountains to kneel down, pick you up 
And give you the perfect rose in the middle of winter. 
I'd ask the angels to sing to you, from up above. I just can't get out, I can't get out, can't get out of bed. 
If I could I surely would do everything that I said. 
I, I can't get out... of bed. For you I'd end all forms of war, confrontation. 
I'd bridge the gap between the poor and the millionaires. 
I'd declare your eyes another constellation. 
I'd find the gold mines in every strand of your hair. I just can't get out, I can't get out, I can't get out of bed. 
If I could I surely would do everything that I said. 
I, I can't get out... of bed. Don't call me a liar, don't say I'm a fraud, 
I thought all that really counts it was the thought, the thought. For you I'd crush coal in my hands, to give you jewels. 
I'd consider life a game and I'd let you make up the rules. 
I'd start a new religion based on your silhouette. 
I'd have the clouds spell out your name in every alphabet. I just... can't get out, I can't get out, I can't get out of bed. 
If I could I surely would do everything that I said. 
I, I can't get out... 
Oh I, I can't get out... of bed.
