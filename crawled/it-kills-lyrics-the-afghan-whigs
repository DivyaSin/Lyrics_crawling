Over and over 
I get to know myself 
Over and over 
There ain't nobody else 
Imperceptible the lines I draw to you 
It kills to watch you love another I should have known better 
When I caught you wild 
You were incredible 
Never knew you like I know you now 
You are illegible 
Imperceptible the lines that form the screw 
It kills to watch you love another Over and over 
I get to know myself 
Over and over 
There ain't nobody else 
A receptacle of lies 
Construed to waste your time 
It kills to watch you love another Over and over 
I get to know myself 
Over and over 
There ain't nobody else 
Imperceptible the lines 
Construed to waste your time 
It kills to watch you love another 
It kills to watch you love another 
It kills to watch you love another
