She's gonna flash her eyes under moonlit skies 
He's gonna meet her there under the exit sign 
Yeah, they both look good they need to be seen 
He's a James Dean rebel, she's a beauty queen Lets dance, lets dance She wants to go all night, he wants to make no sense 
She wants to feel his kiss, it's so much better tensed 
She says "trip the lights", that's what she said 
And now she's in his head, she's in his head Lets dance and let the world fall apart Cause I need you tonight 
Just howl at the moonlight 
I say it two times 
I love you, I love you 
Cause it feels like 
Savage uncivilized 
A teenage wildlife 
I love you, I love you She says "I get so bored living in this place 
We all need to go where the music plays" 
All night, so lets dance 
He said "Life's a cage, lets jump the fence 
All I want is you and lets forget the rest" Lets dance, and let the world fall apart Cause I need you tonight 
Just howl at the moonlight 
I say it two times 
I love you, I love you 
Cause it feels like 
Savage uncivilized 
A teenage wildlife 
I love you, I love you And we fall from the sky when we hear the sound 
Go on for miles but won't hit the ground 
Don't be afraid, they can't catch us now 
Cause baby we are teenage wildlife And I need you tonight 
Just howl at the moonlight 
I say it two times 
I love you, I love you 
Cause it feels like 
Savage uncivilized 
A teenage wildlife 
I love you, I love you I love you, I love you 
I love you, I love you
