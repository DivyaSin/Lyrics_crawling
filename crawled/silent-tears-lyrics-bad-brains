Listen to the lock 
Listen to the lock 
Brandish apart 
Culture in a thought 
Intricately wrought 
Now let's see what you got 
I Lord yeah, I Lord yeah 
to invoke again 
Upon Jah I lean, Sir 
Take away the cringe In the sea nets are cast for most 
Still don't stop, don't stop 
Hyper spots and their likes with them, 
Stay away from our crops Listen to your heart 
Listen to your heart 
What have you bought? 
Open up your pot 
Dem guy now fe stop 
Recognize silent tears 
let the children of Zion 
be joyful in their king 
Bring I soul out of prison, 
that I may praise thy name In the sea nets are cast for most 
Still don't stop, don't stop 
Hyper spots and their likes with them, 
Stay away from our crops
