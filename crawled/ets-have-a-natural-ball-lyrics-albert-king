Well come on baby 
Let's have a natural ball 
Yes come on woman 
Let's have a natural ball 
Well if you don't rock 'n' roll 
There won't be no fun at all 
Well you love me in the morning 
Love me late at night 
Don't ever leave me darling 
Everything's alright 
Come on baby 
Let's have a natural ball 
Well if you don't rock 'n' roll 
There won't be no fun at all 
Yeah come on baby 
Let's have a natural ball 
Well if you don't rock 'n' roll 
It won't be no fun at all 
Won't you love me in the morning 
Love me late at night 
Don't ever leave me baby 
'Cos everything's alright 
Come on woman 
Let's have a natural ball 
Well if you don't have fun 
Won't be my fault at all
