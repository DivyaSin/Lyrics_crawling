She's down and dirty 
She's everything a mother wouldn't like to see 
Don't you ever come back home to me Losing my pride, losing my faith 
Losing everything that I used to have 
Hell dance around you baby Could I be such a fool myself 
Could I, should I Should I, should I be damned 
Baby, don't slap my face again 
Little honey, should I be so damned Man keeps talkin' what I should do 
Won't get the fuck out, I don't care about you 
I can never come back down again Losing my love, losing my sex 
I leave you, honey, lying on the bed at night 
Hell dance around you baby Could I be such a fool myself Should I, should I be damned 
Baby, don't slap my face again 
Little honey, should I be so damned Should I, should I be damned 
Should I be damned Well, could I be such I can't do what you want 
I can't talk like the devil in the glass 
You don't mean nothing 
You don't mean nothing to me I can't believe what I saw in your eyes 
When you cried little sister 
People might come and people might go 
But do you really wanna be a devils toy again Should I, should I be damned 
Baby, don't slap my face again 
Little honey, should I be so damned Should I, should I be damned 
Should I, should I be damned 
Should I, should I be damned Should I be damned
