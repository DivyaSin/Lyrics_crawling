You're staring me down with those electric eyes 
No matter how hard I try, 
I cant escape that gaze tonight 
That girls up in the atmosphere 
That girls up in the atmosphere Im hypnotized by the way she moves 
Baby girl please help me soon, 
Imma take you to sun and the moon 
That girls up in the atmosphere 
That girls up in the atmosphere [Chorus] 
And Ive been catching myself thinking of it 
It was 3 in the morning, 
Every day I chase after her 
But I cant catch lightning 
Catching myself thinking of it 
It was 3 in the morning, 
Every day I chase after her 
But I cant catch lightning No, I cant catch lightning Shell make you believe anything she wants 
Make you think that youre the one 
She will keep you there 
That girls up in the atmosphere 
Shes way up in the atmosphere [Chorus] 
And Ive been catching myself thinking of it 
It was 3 in the morning, 
Every day I chase after her 
But I cant catch lightning 
Catching myself thinking of it 
It was 3 in the morning, 
Every day I chase after her 
But I cant catch lightning No, I cant catch lightning 
Oh, I cant catch lightning 
Yeah, I cant catch lighting You're staring me down with those electric eyes 
No matter how hard I try, 
I cant escape that gaze tonight 
That girls up in the atmosphere 
That girls up in the atmosphere 
That girls up in the atmosphere 
Shes way up in the atmosphere And Ive been waiting, waiting, waiting for you 
Anticipating 
Chasing after things that you do 
But I cant catch lightning 
Waiting, waiting, waiting for you 
Anticipating 
Chasing after things that you do 
But I cant catch lightning No, I cant catch lightning 
Oh yeah 
No, I cant catch lightning 
Oh, I cant catch lightning 
Oh no 
I cant catch lightning.
