I watch you in the candlelight 
My head is in your hands 
The neon lights have all gone down 
We make our future plans I wanted things to get better 
I was in pain 
I wanted you to be in my lifeline I wanted love to get better 
I'd wait in line 
For something I knew that I would get to keep Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
And I can feel it bleeding Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
Today is the day 
That I love you Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
And I can feel it bleeding Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
Today is the day 
That I love you The flashing lights have gone away 
Emergency has passed 
The future's right in front of me 
And I won't finish last Today is the day 
That I love you 
Today is the day 
That I love you Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
And I can feel it bleeding Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
Today is the day 
That I love you Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
And I can feel it bleeding Your "I love you" 
Your "I love you" 
Today is the day 
That I love you Your I love you Emergency has past
