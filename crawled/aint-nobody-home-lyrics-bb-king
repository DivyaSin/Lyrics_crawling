Once upon a time, a long long time ago 
Wherever you'd lead me, I would surely follow 
Girl, you put me through some pain and misery 
And now you are standing on my doorstep 
Telling me how much you need me Baby, ain't nobody home 
Ain't nobody home How many times I begged for you to come home 
But you laughed at me and said, "Let me alone" 
Through my falling tears, I saw you walk away 
And now you're beggin' me to forgive you 
But this time baby, it's your turn to beg Baby, ain't nobody home 
There ain't nobody home Girl, I used to love you 
In ways no one else would love you 
Gave you everything that I own 
Girl, you can't come back here 
Ain't nobody home Once upon a time, when you went on your way 
But, girl, I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day 
But time has made some changes, turned me upside down 
So, you can beg me to forgive you 
But this time baby, you can turn right around Ain't nobody home 
Ain't nobody Baby, there ain't nobody home 
You know you hurt me once 
There ain't nobody home 
Oh, you can beg me baby 
But still there ain't nobody home Ain't nobody baby 
Ain't nobody home I hear you knockin' 
But there ain't nobody home
