I fell from Holy Moses mountain, where love's a slippery slope 
And all the others I've been hanging with, never gave me too much rope 
And then one day she came to me, love at first sight, head to toes 
I love her wild, my mountain child and that's just how she goes 
And here she got Hey I can't stop loving you 
'Cause it's all I wanna do 
Yeah the world needs more of this, tell me what you put into that kiss, yeah 
Now keep that coming on, let me hear my favorite song 
Yeah you're all I wanna do, 'cause I can't stop loving you Got me a good old kinda cowboy 
He got my picture on the fridge 
And the first time that he kissed me, we was high up on the ridge 
And when we came down from the mountain, I will ride with ma kin 
And for all it costs, for getting lost, there ain't no better sin 
Oh, yeah You know I can't stop loving you 
'Cause it's all I wanna do 
Yeah the world needs more of this, tell me what you put into that kiss 
Now keep that coming on, let me hear my favorite song 
Yeah you're all I wanna do, 'cause I can't stop loving you When I wake up and see your face 
All that jump in a pigtail lace 
And that there's nowhere else I would rather be 
Then all tied up in this rhapsody Hey I can't stop loving you 
'Cause it's all I wanna do 
Yeah the world needs more of this, tell me what you put into that kiss, 
Now keep that coming on, let my hear my favorite song 
Yeah you're all I wanna do, 'cause I can't stop loving you
