As you walk away I could not see 
Darkness pushes in and down on me 
Youre out somewhere with him instead of me 
Im trying to hang on so desperately Take me as I am 
I am just a man and my love for you wont fade 
As you walk away As you walk away, how was I to know? 
My world crashes in, Ive fallen in the hole 
The way youve done me wrong 
Ive lost all control 
Holding onto you but still you go Take me as I am 
I am just a man and my love for you wont fade 
As you walk away I long to hear your voice 
Youre here but cant be found 
Reflections ache 
Manipulate 
Echoes of the heart beat loud As you walk away I could not see 
Im trying to hang on so desperately Take me as I am 
I am just man and my love for you wont fade 
As you walk away my love wont fade 
As you walk away my love wont fade 
As you walk away
