I feel like I wanna smack somebody 
Turn around and bitch slap somebody 
But I ain't goin' out bro 
(No, no, no) 
I ain't givin' into it 
(No, no, no) 
Anxiety bashed my mind in 
Terrorizing my soul like Bin Laden 
But I ain't fallin' down bro 
(No, no, no) 
I ain't givin in to it 
(No, no, no) 
Shackled in chains 
My soul feels stained 
I can't explain 
Got a itch on my brain 
Lately my whole brain 
Lately my whole aim is to maintain 
And regain control of my mainframe 
My blood's boilin' it's beatin' out propane 
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train 
I'm in a fast car drivin' in the fast lane 
In the rain and I might just hydroplane [Chorus:] 
I don't fear none of my enemies 
And I don't fear bullets from uzi's 
I've been dealin' with somethin' that's worse then these 
That'll make ya' fall to your knees 
And that's the... Anxiety 
The sane and the insane rivalry 
Paranoia's brought me to my knees 
Lord please, please, please 
Take away my anxiety 
The sane and the insane rivalry 
Paranoia's brought me to my knees 
Lord please, please, please 
Take away my anxiety My head keeps runnin' away my brother 
The only thing makin' me stay my brother 
But I won't give into it bro (No, no, no) 
Gotta get myself back now 
God I can't let my mind be trapped by enemies 
My own 
Got's to find my inner wealth 
Grasp a hold of my thoughts 
I can't get lost 
I can't give into it now (No, no, no) 
Emotions are trapped on lock 
Got my brain stuck 
Going through the motions 
Only I know what's up 
I'm filled up with pain tryin' to gain my sanity 
Everywhere I turn it's embedded in front of me 
Nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety 
Got me feelin' strange 
Paranoia took over me 
And it's weighin' me down 
And I can't run any longer 
Knees to the ground
