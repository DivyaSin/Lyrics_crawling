(J.& N. Cassidy) When I was a little kid 
I never liked to eat 
Mom would put things on my plate 
And I'd dump 'em on her feet 
But then one day she made this soup 
I ate it all in bed 
I asked her what she put in it 
And this is what she said: "Oh, chicken lips and lizard hips 
And alligator eyes 
Monkey legs and buzzard eggs 
And salamander thighs 
Rabbit ears and camel rears 
And tasty toenail pies 
Stir 'em all together 
And it's mama's soup surprise" I went into the bathroom 
And I stood beside the sink 
I said, "I'm feeling slightly ill 
And I think I'd like a drink" Mama said, "I've just the thing 
I'll get it in a wink 
It's full of lots of protein 
And vitamins, I think" "Oh, chicken lips and lizard hips 
And alligator eyes 
Monkey legs and buzzard eggs 
And salamander thighs 
Rabbit ears and camel rears 
And tasty toenail pies 
Stir 'em all together 
And it's mama's soup surprise"
