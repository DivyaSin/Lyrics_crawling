I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
Shawt, shawty (somebody better tell 'em) 
I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
I come through swervin' (somebody better tell 'em) 
I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
Shawt, shawty (somebody better tell 'em) 
I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
I come through swervin' (somebody better tell 'em) I'm border, grit on that killer 
They call it Front Street, nobody know about it 
He works the concretes 'til it breaks daylight 
You see him post up in the cut, how many? 
I ain't servin' nothin' but good products 
I broke that wall, work that slang, choke that thang 
I'm talkin' 'bout 'I ain't dressin', nothin' but pain 
Keep the Chevrolet funked out 
I ain't even try to hitcha 'less y'all trunked out 
I come through, tear that thang up 
Whippin' new grain and he all glassed up 
You see us swervin' on some seventeen-nines 
Mr. F.F., I'm a stay bright every time I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
Shawt, shawty (somebody better tell 'em) 
I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre

Shawt, shawty (somebody better tell 'em) 
I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
I come through swervin' (somebody better tell 'em) Talk a dollar outta dime, drinkin' liquid lime 
Pull out sideways and leave these suckas from the line 
Over time, like Dental, seein' green with the grill 
Super clean see a gleam through the windshield It's everyday like the clock tick 
Hit me with some super thick up in the cockpit 
It's off limits baby, you see the hand stiched material 
Workin' the original inertial 
I'm in a coma, get he and Bean up out the trunk 
I step on stage and get the whole place crunch 
Always guarantee friend-shh y'all 
You shoulda rocked the microphone to this, y'all 
Yes sir, hold on, hold the dice 
Set these down, then I'm gone 
One more shot cause I'm on tonight 
I shook another fifty-two 
Now tell me what do they wants to do? I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
Shawt, shawty (somebody better tell 'em) 
I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
I come through swervin' (somebody better tell 'em) 
I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
Shawt, shawty (somebody better tell 'em) 
I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
I come through swervin' (somebody better tell 'em) I could fly these sucka ducks with the right dosage 
Now hear, bust it open, get it smokin', that's him 
Sack it up and watch it jump out the gym 
Shorty told you what it is when you come through here 
This sucker emcee say he lookin' for me 
Tell him, ain't nothin' boy, is you the police 
When I put the mic down they say they found residue 
And the laws wanna charge me for verbal abuse 
Blow smoke up out the roof, they ain't got no proof 
Six-eights, skate Decatur, them boys blue, I'm sayin' 
Go getcha ass bread, ya understand 
Man these suckers think I'm playin' 
(Man they puffin' weed) I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
Shawt, shawty (somebody better tell 'em)

I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
Shawt, shawty (somebody better tell 'em) 
I'm still buckin' like five, deuce, four, tre 
I come through swervin' (somebody better tell 'em) Five, deuce, four, tre 
Shawt, shawty
