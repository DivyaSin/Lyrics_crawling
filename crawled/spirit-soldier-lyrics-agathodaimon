Spirit is your fate and burden 
Spirit is your destination Once long ago, on a dark night 
You felt body and soul unite 
In a dream of epiphany 
You were given perspicuity, dignity, autonomy, supremacy Ancient spirits cursed through your veins 
The sparks in you turned into flames 
You heard battle drums thundering 
Was this a dream or an awakening, a destining, foreshadowing offering? The gods have marked you for your life and death 
The gods will guide you up to your last breath You will lead a secret life sheltered by darkness 
Up to the day that the spirit soldiers will conquer and then The twilight mountains you will climb 
Brighter than the sun you will shine 
Louder than thunder you will roar 
Above the world your voice will soar Through the universe you will fly 
Expand the earth, tear up the sky 
Once your spirit will break free 
A new spring will bring liberty The gods blessed you with power and a vision 
The gods gave you life to accomplish a mission Being a soldier of spirit in a cold and shallow world 
Will at times seem to you rather a curse than a gift Sometimes you damn the ancient spirits 
Everything seems grim and senseless 
They tell you that there's no forgiveness 
For the thousand sins you could confess Then you envy the blind fools 
Who thrive in mediocracies 
Who love and hate as they are told 
Devoted to trivialities Spirit soldier 
Spirit soldier Spirits, spirits, spirits 
Spirit soldier 
Spirits, spirits, spirits 
Spirit soldier Sometimes your dreams take you to the land 
Of purity, silence and soul 
Where you feel unchained and alive 
Where fate is under your control Then you thank the great omnipotent 
Creators of life and spirit 
That with the dawn of a new age 
You'll be united with the infinite Spirit soldier 
Spirit soldier Spirits, spirits, spirits 
Spirit soldier 
Spirits, spirits, spirits 
Spirit soldier The gods sent you to provide for enlightenment 
The gods have placed you in line of their descent You will lead a secret life sheltered by darkness 
Up to the day the spirit soldiers will conquer and then The twilight mountains you will climb 
Brighter than the sun you will shine 
Louder than thunder you will roar 
Above the world your voice will soar Through the universe you will fly 
Expand the earth, tear up the sky 
Once your spirit will break free 
A new spring will bring liberty
