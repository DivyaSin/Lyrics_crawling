You want to get married 
He wants to screw 
You know that he's at it 
Can't say the same about you 
You want him to listen 
But failed to get his thoughts off the cars 
Kind a guy 
Who leaves a dead poet on your cup-board 
Flyes back to mars 
You know that 
For you there'll be no tomorrow 
Praying for a better day 
Trying to spend the day away 
You're 26 but you look so much older 
So what will you be like tomorrow 
Praying for a better day 
Trying to spend the day away 
He bought you a record 
Called the power of love 
Romance in a gutters 
God he makes you want to trow up 
So you pray to god 
Worship it throught his penis 
His idea of making love 
While he's having his peanuts 
All men are pigs you're the Venus 
You name his son swineard after Jesus
