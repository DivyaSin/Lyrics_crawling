here she comes maybe this time she will notice me 
a simple smile or a wave would mean so much 
but she'll just walk right be she never says hello to me 
oh well i guess i'm just down on my luck and i'm trying to be cool 
as she walks right by 
trying to pretend 
that she never caught my eye 
as soon as she's out of sight 
i'll walk home once again 
spend the rest of the night 
with her vision in my head and as she's drawing near 
she stops to tie her shoe 
here comes the nervousness 
of not knowing what to do 
i offer her my hand 
to help her to get up 
tell her that she's beautiful 
and then she tells me she's in love 
with another guy why does this always happen to me 
why are they always so happy 
in love with someone else 
before i get a chance 
what has he got that i don't have 
that i don't have
