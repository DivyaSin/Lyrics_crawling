With hemlock breath you tell me things / Noxious whispers / Amphetamine / Intoxicated faery tales / A bed of roses / A bed of nails 
Down into the dark beneath the floors / Above the lights / Beyond the doors / You know my mind can be a whore / So I'll bang it really sore 
I'm cycling strapped into a wheel / And there is nothing / There's nothing I couldn't have been / I'll waste a week / And save a dime / I'm all wound up biding my time 
I wanna party all the time / Grow myself a second head / Be a party guy and a party gal / You know the check is in the mail / And just like blowjobs and cocktails / I'm fine / Fuck me if I ain't fine 
I've learnt to love the nightmares / In my damaged brain / Stowaway in this hellbound train / If God don't love you / Buy a gun and be a man / Know the pride of the damned / Go on and be a man / Try and make of it what you can
