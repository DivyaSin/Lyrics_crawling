Don't argue amongst yourselves 
Because of the loss of me 
I'm sitting amongst yourselves 
Don't think you can't see me 
Don't argue amongst yourselves 
Because of the loss of me 
I haven't gone anywhere 
But out of my body 
Reach out and you'll touch me 
Make effort to speak to me 
Call out and you'll hear me 
Be happy for me Don't argue amongst yourselves 
Because of the loss of me 
I haven't gone anywhere 
But out of my body 
Reach out and you'll touch me 
Make effort to speak to me 
Call out and you'll hear me 
Be happy for me 
Reach out and you'll touch me 
Make effort to speak to me 
Call out and you'll hear me 
Be happy for me
