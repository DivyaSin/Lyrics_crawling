Ten minutes til' twelve o'clock, 
That's when the hammer drops, 
Sienide in the chamber, 
Until the humvee stops, The last man (Dying man), 
In a dying democracy, 
Past americana, 
From see to shining see, [Chorus:] 
Lockdown, America Lockdown, 
America Lockdown, America... Solution in his layer, 
Is locked up in a cage, 
Sweepin' under a road, [Chorus] Lock him in a cell, 
Spread him of his rights, 
One latch a time, March above the hill, 
Stand above the ground, 
One latch at a time, [Chorus]
