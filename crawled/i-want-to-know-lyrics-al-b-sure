I want to know Ooh my baby can I hold you close to me 
Always thinking about you and I know you know that 
That's why I can't get you off of my mind Oh when I was a little boy (little little boy) 
I thought grown men were not supposed to cry 
But now that I'm all man, all man now 
I can't hold back the tears and I don't know why I want to know ooh baby, baby, baby 
I want to know, I want to know, I want to know 
It's all about you and me 
I want to know, oh I want to know Ooh sweet baby can I share sweet love with you 
I want to know is there a future 
That me what I've got to do oh Am I wasting my time, I want to know 
Oh don't you play with my mind 
Can I make love to you all night through 
Please don't say no 'cause I do love you Ooh baby take away my insecurities and I'll always be strong for you 
I hope nothing will go wrong with us two 
Can I trust you when I'm gone away 
You can trust me each and every day 
Every day (I want to know) 
Break it down Oh they say that curiosity killed the cat 
And I know that satisfaction brought him back (hey) 
Finders keeps, loser weeps 
I want to know
