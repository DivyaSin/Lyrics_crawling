I'd say I love you but my words are spent 
I lost them in the heat of argument 
And consequence falls around me like rain 
I dream and see you floating overhead 
I let my passion fly furious red 
Out to meet you again and again 
Now I feel your touch in the night 
With me my lover lays between the days 
So no matter what the day will bring 
I have the space in between 
To touch and taste enjoy my dream 
I know its true or so it seems 
You paint the pictures in my dreams 
My lover lays between the days 
Now I feel your touch in the night 
With me my lover lays between the days 
I've built an empire custom made for me 
In the moments between two and three 
Well thats where you'll be 
Now I fell your touch in the night 
With me my lover lays between the days
