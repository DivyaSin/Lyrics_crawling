[Verse 1] 
Better for me to leave 
This brightness is dazzling me 
Can't get enough of you 
I'd like to get to know you [Chorus] 
Oh she flips her hair 
Can't stand this beauty damn 
Wish she knows how my heart 
Warms towards her 
She so classy 
Tryin' to find out how to attract your attention baby Shawty so damn fine 
Take a step to me now 
Wanna be your night sugar 
Shawty caught my eye 
Let's get crazy 
Be my lover [Verse 2] 
The closer that you get 
My words start to slip 
My breathing just ain't the same 
Just ain't the same 
Just ain't the same [Chorus] 
Oh she flips her hair 
Can't stand this beauty damn 
Wish she knows how my heart 
Warms towards her 
She so classy 
Tryin' to find out how to attract your attention baby Shawty so damn fine 
Take a step to me now 
Wanna be your night sugar 
Shawty caught my eye 
Let's get crazy 
Be my lover
