On a clear day 
Rise and look around you 
And you see who you are 
On a clear day 
How it will astound you 
That the glow of your being 
Outshines every star 
You'll feel part of 
Every mountain, sea, and shore 
You can hear from far and near 
A world you've never, never heard before 
And on a clear day 
On that clear day 
You can see forever, and ever, and ever 
And ever more
