How dare you 
Turn on me turn on me 
I know you 
Turn on me don't turn on me 
I won you 
Tread on me don't tread on me 
Now let me blow your figgin mind 
Do you remember 
Whatcha said whatch said to me 
Do you remember 
Let me refresh your fuckin memory 
You took an oath 
Are you insane can you explain 
Or have you lost your goddamn mind 
Blood is burning 
The saints are crying 
Have you forgot who and what you are 
You gave me your word 
We swore allegiance 
Don't turn your back on who and what we are 
Let it burn let it burn 
It's on your soul 
Let it burn just let it burn 
Cause they control 
Feel the heat you'll feel the heat 
Yeah, like a dog they'll hunt you down 
Do you remember 
What was said what was breed in you 
Do you remember 
You signed the line so give the devil his due 
You took an oath 
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide 
They're gonna take you down 
Blood is burning 
The saints are crying 
Have you forgot who and what you are 
You gave me your word 
We swore allegiance 
Don't turn your back on who and what we are 
Blood is burning 
The saints are crying 
Have you forgot who and what you are 
You gave me your word 
We swore allegiance 
Don't turn your back on who and what we are
