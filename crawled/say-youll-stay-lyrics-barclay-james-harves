Dreams and castles 
We build them constantly 
Who will see what we've done before? 
Thoughts that follow me 
Fools of destiny 
This is what we've become Say you'll stay with me 
I just want to be 
Here with you 
Say you'll stay with me 
I just want to be here Taking chances with 
Time that passes us 
Who can tell what will be? Words that call to me 
Eyes that try to see 
Make it all mystery Say you'll stay with me 
I just want to be 
Here with you 
Say you'll stay with me 
I just want to be here Can you hear those little people 
Tell me what to do? 
They cannot see there's no tomorrow 
But for me and you Say you'll stay with me 
I just want to be here...
