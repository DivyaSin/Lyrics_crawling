Words can't express how I've been feeling 
Well since the day that I met you, 
You've been running through my mind 
And I can't get through to my feelings 
And tell them to come back 
Because I wanna be by your side I keep telling all my friends about them, 
the way that I feel whenever you're gone 
So I'm stealing time to tell you what's on my mind 
And that I'm feeling so strong So what I gotta to get this in your head 
Can you see it in my eyes when we're lying in bed 
And if I'm losing you, I'ma put up a fight Cause I wanna hold you all the time 
Tell you that you're all that's on my mind 
Baby, baby, please just dim the lights 
Wanna treat you like your birthday 
And give it to you your way I wanna give it to you 
I wanna give it to you 
I wanna give it to you 
I wanna give it to you 
I wanna give it to you 
I wanna give it to you And I don't think we saw it coming 
Because you never get it when you want it 
I wanna take away your breath 
Tell me you love me to death 
And later on you'll get some loving And I keep telling all my friends about 
how much of you that I have been missing 
So listen closely, you don't need to worry 
Cause soon I'm gonna bathe you in kisses So what I gotta do to get this in your head
