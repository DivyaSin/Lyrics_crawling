It's time to follow the black path 
And come tommorow you won't laugh alone 
Faced down you can see the ground turn 
From green and red, black to grey 
Where everyone becomes afraid of you To find your journey on the black path 
The darkest Sunday from your own past 
Right now, I can see the ground turn 
From green and red, black to grey 
Where everyone becomes afraid of you If you're the one 
If you're the one 
If you're the one 
If you're the one 
If you're the one 
If you're the one 
If you're the one See how blasphemous laugh can be 
See how blasphemous laugh can be 
See how blasphemous laugh can be 
See how blasphemous laugh can be
