rain hits the windshield 
and tires give way 
and for a moment 
just a moment ... and you whisper, you whisper 
"it's your anxiety" tell me why you're scared 
tell me why you cannot sleep 
and i won't do a thing and shore lines spread out infinite 
in four-four time with wasted breath. 
their spinning heads 
don't make a dent in you ... 
and you whisper in my ears 
"it's your anxiety"
