So why do I yearn so 
So very much for you 
Hooked on adrenaline 
It's found and known to make me do what I do All my friends keep telling me 
She's no good I've been through the rain 
Trying to drive myself sane 
Monday morning, screw faces 
Get off the train 
Then I see two lovers until they smile into each others eyes 
And I think She's no good (She's no good) 
She's no good (She's no good) 
She's no good (No good) 
She's no good (She's no good) 
All my friends keep telling me 
She's no good Oh, I cannot learn this craziness, you like glue 
You got me in a guillotine 
Lady, what am I gonna do All my friends keep telling me 
She's no good She's no good (She's no good) 
She's no good (She's no good) 
She's no good (No good) 
She's no good (She's no good) 
My friends keep telling me 
She's no good I want her back 
(Oh, you know you need her like crack) 
I need her so 
I can't, I cannot let her go 
Then I see two lovers until they smile into each others eyes 
And I think of you I'm so good 
I'm so good 
I'm so good 
So, so good 
I'm so good for you and you know it I'm so good 
I'm so good 
I'm so good 
So, so good 
I'm so good for you and you know it Shes no good, oh 
I cant take it no more 
Shes oh, oh, oh 
So so so good 
Aw baby, oh 
I love you so now 
I dont know no no no
