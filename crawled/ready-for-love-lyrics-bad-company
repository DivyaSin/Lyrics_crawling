Walkin' down this rocky road 
Wonderin' where my life is leading 
Rollin' on to the bitter end 
Finding out along the way 
What it takes to keep love living 
You should know 
How it feels my friend Ooh 
I want you to stay 
Ooh 
I want you today 
I'm ready for love, oh baby I'm ready for love 
Ready for love, oh baby I'm ready for love, yeah 
For your love Now I'm on my feet again 
Better things are bound to happen 
All my dues surely must be paid 
Many miles and many tears 
Times were hard but now they're changing 
You should know that I'm not afraid Ooh I want you to stay 
Ooh I want you today 
I'm ready for love oh baby I'm ready for love 
Ready for love oh baby I'm ready for love Oh I'm ready for love 
Yeah, I'm ready for your love Ooh I want you to stay 
Ooh I want you today 
I'm ready for love oh baby I'm ready for love 
Ready for love oh baby I'm ready for love 
Ready for love oh baby I'm ready for love 
Ready for love oh baby I'm ready for your love 
Ah woah 
I'm ready for your love 
Oh I'm ready, I'm ready, mmm
