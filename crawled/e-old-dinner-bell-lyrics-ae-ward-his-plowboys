I must travel back to Arkansas tomorrow 
I left there several months ago 
For it's the only time that ever I was happy 
When I used to beat that old banjo All the lingering 
All The waitin' 
I'm longing for the home I love so well 
For it's the only time that ever I was happy 
When I used to hear that old dinner bell I'm a travel back around like we used to 
From the head of the Mississippi to the mouth 
We will have a song and dance at every station 
That's the best we've got in this sunny South All the lingering 
All the waitin' 
I'm longing for the home I love so well 
For it's the only time that ever I was happy 
When I used to hear that old dinner bell I'm excited for my journey will be merry 
And at home I've got a good ol' time in store 
For the people they are glad for to see me 
When they see me driving up to the door All the lingering 
All the waitin' 
I'm longing for the home I love so well 
For it's the only time that ever I was happy 
When I used to hear that old dinner bell
