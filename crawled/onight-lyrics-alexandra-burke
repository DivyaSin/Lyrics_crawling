Don't you know rule number one 
Gotta make me feel wanted 
Don't ever flaunt it, run it 
Many of the guys wanna try 
Wanna die to jump on it 
So, so baby tonight I can't make no longer 
I've been here before 
Don't want this no longer 
I'm letting you know 
I'm letting you go See it's all in my eyes 
Can't hide so why pretend 
Wanna tell the world how I feel about you 
It's building inside 
I'm thinking of when and where 
Running down of time So I gotta cut through So baby tonight 
I'm letting you know 
I'm letting you go Baby tonight 
I already know 
I'm letting you go 
Cause tonight 
I'm letting you know 
I'm letting you go Baby tonight 
I already know 
I'm letting you go 
Go go go go go go go
