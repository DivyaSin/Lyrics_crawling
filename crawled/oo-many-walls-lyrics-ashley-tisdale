Wish on a rainbow 
Is all I can do 
Dream of the good times 
That we never knew 
Lonely nights 
Alone in your arms 
I'll dream on Living in wonder 
Thinking of you 
Still looking for ways 
To uncover the truth 
You're so young 
Is all they can say 
They don't know If I could change 
The way of the world 
I'd be your girl Too many walls 
Have been built 
In between us 
Too many dreams 
Have been shattered 
Around us 
If I seem to give up 
They'll still never win 
Deep in my heart 
I know 
The strength is within Watching the others 
Chances drift by 
They'll never discover 
These feelings I hide 
Deep inside 
I'm falling apart 
All alone 
With a broken heart 
Thinking in silence 
Is all they allow These words 
Still unspoken 
May never be found 
All these dreams 
One day will be mine 
They cross my mind 
My time 
Has yet to come 
Until then Too many walls 
Have been built 
In between us Too many dreams 
Have been shattered 
Around us 
If I seem to give up 
They'll still never win 
Deep in my heart 
I know 
The strength is within (Chorus)
