I caught you caroling and giving grief 
Thought you were cannonballing after me 
I let your actions speak for themselves 
And wished you well But you're a mirror I cannot void 
Strung out and jittery and paranoid 
A leaky battery that cant keep charged 
Get in the car and say what you mean 
Explain yourself to me and Ill try not to judge you more than you would Let me help, I promise not to tell 
Like anyone's asking or anyone should First time I met you I was full of fear 
Knew that eventually you'd disappear 
Just when I needed you you'd burn to smoke 
And off you go Just come back and peel away the mess 
Lay here beside me and open your eyes 
Take it back your dignity your tact 
Turn back to the person you tried to let die I caught you nesting with your analog 
Glassy eyes from kissing poison frogs 
Becoming infinite against his couch Open your mouth and say the words 
You used to wish you heard 
Back when you focused enough to be good And if you''re gone 
An endless false alarm 
Just remember I loved you 
As long as I could
