Steppin' right along 
Like it ain't nothing, baby 
Something just, something just blew your mind 
Something come along 
To make you stronger, baby 
But you know it got to take time Talk a little deep 
To make you wonder, baby 
And it's not that same old line Whoa, look out now Something some time 
Come along and blow your mind 
Watch out, girl 
Somebody hot (hot!) 
Make you give up everything you got Steppin' right along 
Like it ain't nothing, baby 
Something just, something just blew you mind 
Something come along 
That kick like thunder, baby 
You know got to give it up for them 
Right on time 'Would it be wise or weak?' 
You wonder, baby 
Goodbye Reason, Hello Rhyme 
Look out, girl Something some time 
Come along and blow your mind 
Watch out, girl 
Somebody hot (hot!) 
Make you give up everything you got Steppin' right along 
Like it ain't nothing, baby 
Something come along 
And just blew your mind 
'Some kind of magic spell?' 
You wonder, baby 
Make a drink of muddy water 
Taste like wine And 'Would it be wise or weak?' 
You wonder, baby 
Goodbye Reason, Hello Rhyme 
'Love made me do it!' Something some time 
Come along and blow your mind 
Watch out, girl 
Somebody hot (hot!) 
Make you give up everything you got Said I will follo the Lord in heaven 
I want to be thy holding angel 
'Til the Kingdom come 
Thy will be down 
Down here on earth 
Just like it is in heaven 
Give us this day 
Our daily bread 
Give us our sins 
We forgive our brothers 
Lead us far away, every day, 
From temptation 
Heavenly Father 
Deliver us from evil 
Thine is the kingdom 
And the power 
And the glory 
Forever! 
Heavenly Father 
Sweet heavenly Father 
Heavenly Father 
Sweet sweet heavenly Father 
Sweat ol' Heavenly Father
