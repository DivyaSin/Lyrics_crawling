Yo, ayo there's war on the street 
Blood on the cobblestone 
I leave them buried alive just like a fossil bone 
Body bags line the streets, reporters reporting 
Mafia ties to drugs and extortion 
DeLucees vs. Starkeano headline the news 
Police call war on crime they gonna lose 
Judges get kidnapped captains get decapitated 
Starks rise above all to be emancipated 
Black godfather, families at war 
Drive by's and Molotovs to settle the score 
Butcher shops filled with chopped up casualties 
I make sure to keep guns in all my faculties 
Streets going red when the boss is disrespected neglected 
I guarantee no man's protected 
To each his own grab a gun off the shelf 
Cause in a war zone of course every man for self (x3) [U-God] How you prepare for war, grab your guns and your hardware 
Never close your eyes in the barber chair 
Ya heart of a lion that's what got him here 
Bullet proof your car yo we're out of here 
Fuck the DeLucas we got? with sub-machines 
Bone crush a nigga like a football team 
Under a new regime, the old we throw it out 
Spit back the hammer you yo ought to throw them out 
Your gun cocked at the whole house 
Sip the brown liquor while we move a quarter ounce 
Pick the territories move north to south 
Your high power shine yours is watered down 
I'm underground with the vest on 
Open up your head now your flesh is torn 
Never turn my back of a restaurant 
Put holes in your chest come test the don 
45 of them hoes let me stretch my arms Cause in a war zone of course every man for self (x3) [Inspectah Deck] So the DeLucas want Tone nah not today 
Cock his spray side with him and you got to pay 
Don't even kill him just make him feel a lot of pain 
Stake out his wife and his seed at the soccer game 
Weed him with open arms weed him with open thoughts 
Feed him 2 2 3 squeeze him leave him with no resolve 
Make a led homie repping for the territory 
No steppin on me reg that's a negatory 
You want a war these men pop dangerous 
Taking all in a 10 block radius 
Murder rate double, triple 
Cripple the strip 
Like it got hit with a couple of missiles 
? through your door 
I get in your crib in wig in a cable guy uniform 
My shooters maneuver got DeLuca in the scope 
Movin close, say the word Tone you was ghost
