We done pain and sorrow 
We done been through change 
We done had way better days, yes sir 
But I seen tomorrow 
I ain't see no rain 
'Cause our sun's gonna shine again, yes it is I been thinking 'bout it 
Ain't no doubt about it 
We got something that the world 
Just can't explain 
It was the one thing 
That makes it always work out 
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love 
If we got nothin' else 
We got love 
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love 
At least that's something, yes 
We got love And the world goes round and round, round and round 
And the world goes round and round, round and round 
And the world goes round and round, round and round 
Around in circles We didn't have no money 
Our bills ain't been paid 
Coulda lost 'bout everything 
But we climbed that mountain 
And we found a way 
And we back on top again I keep thinking 'bout it 
Ain't no way around it 
Girl, we got something that the world 
Just can't explain 
It was the one thing 
That makes it always work out 
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love 
If we got nothin' else 
We got love 
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love 
At least that's something, yes 
We got love And the world goes round and round, round and round 
And the world goes round and round, round and round 
And the world goes round and round, round and round 
Around in circles And the world goes round and round, round and round 
And the world goes round and round, round and round 
And the world goes round and round, round and round 
Around in circles I keep thinking 'bout it 
Ain't no way around it 
Girl, we got something that the world 
Just can't explain 
Oh babe, it was the one thing 
That makes it always work out 
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love 
If we got nothin' else 
We got love 
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love 
At least that's something, yes 
We got love 
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love 
If we got nothin' else 
We got love 
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love 
At least that's something, yes 
We got love 
Come on say love
