Only when you're sleeping I get peace of mind, tucked in your safety blanket of the night. You toss and you turn and you fall out of bed. Forget peace of mind I'll just hold you instead. 
Hey little boy, one foot in front of the next, turn out your toes and watch out for the hall and the floor you will hit. You'll trip up and fall down like your daddy and me and when you realize that you're prone, you'll try and run and you'll say mamma, oh mamma, hold me instead and I'll hold you instead. 
You're out when you should be sleeping I'm losing my mind. You're out 'til eleven you should be by nine. You crash when you walk, let alone when you drive. I'm scared that the damage will get worse with time. 
Hey little boy, one foot in front of the next, turn out your toes and watch out for the hall and the floor you will hit. You'll trip up and fall down like your daddy and me and when you realize that you're prone, you'll try and run and you'll say mamma, oh mamma, hold me instead and I'll hold you instead. 
I can help you with the bruises, broken bones and stitches but a broken heart is something you might have to fix yourself. The world's been cruel to you my little prone baby, but you are not a baby anymore. 
I'm sorry that you're dangerous you got that from me, I've gotta let you go but remember on thing. 
Hey little boy one foot in front of the next, turn out your toes and watch out for the wall and the floor you will hit.
