( Live MCM Caf ) I'm on my way to end it all 
It's driving my mad 
My eyes are dry, My mind is gray 
Nothing inside 
Comming to see you 
I'm on my way I'm on my way to end it all 
It's driving my mad 
My eyes are dry, My mind is gray 
Nothing inside 
Comming to see you 
I'm on my way My eyes are dry, My mind is gray 
Nothing inside 
An empty mind, With empty eyes 
Look at me now 
I'm on my way 
I'm on my 
I'm on my way 
I'm on my 
On my way 
On my way
