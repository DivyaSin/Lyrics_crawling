(voice of woody guthrie: I been robbed for cash and I been robbed on credit; 
Woke up a lot of mornings, didn't even know where I was at. the hardest 
Work I ever done is when I was trying to get myself a worried woman to ease 
My worried mind.) All the things they said would happen to you 
Don't ya know they're all comin true 
Goin nowhere fast. Nothing's strange as when it seems 
You're living out all your worst possible dreams 
Goin nowhere fast Bad times, worse times, 
All the times in between 
I tangle in the shadow, stumble in the trees 
Goin nowhere fast I learn my lesson 
And I learn it again 
I heard what they said, "live fast and die stupid" 
Goin nowhere fast 
My compass is spinnin 
Like a gamblin wheel 
It takes a hideous misfortune for to tell how I feel 
Goin nowhere fast I threw it all away 
Like shoes into the street 
These terrible things will tear me in three 
Goin nowhere fast I don't care what time will tell 
Just tell me if I might as well be halfway to hell 
Goin nowhere fast I'm sick through my skin 
With silence and doom 
I break my back, I cry on the moon 
Goin nowhere fast 
Going nowhere fast
