Well he died at 39 
Some kind of pills and homemade wine 
He left his english bride 
And a love he couldn't deny behind 
Folks have come to say 
He nearly gave the land away 
He couldn't understand 
How a man could own the land anyway 
When grandpa had had his fill 
He'd take a walk up old Ore Hill 
To the land of a thousand shadows 
And things would come around 
From the day that he was born 
The mountain had been his home 
He'd sit late afternoon 
Watch the shadows reach the moon alone 
Then shewanakw-nan came 
And things began to change 
He dealt against his will 
And moved down off the hill ashamed 
When grandpa had had his fill 
He'd take a walk up old Ore Hill 
To the land of a thousand shadows 
And things would come around 
Well, he died at 39 
Glad to leave this world behind 
Tired of holding on 
To a place he didn't belong 
To find.... 
That grandpa had lost his will 
To take a walk up old Ore Hill 
To the land of a thousand shadows 
And things would come around 
When grandpa had had his fill 
He'd take a walk up old Ore Hill 
To the land of a thousand shadows 
And things would come around
