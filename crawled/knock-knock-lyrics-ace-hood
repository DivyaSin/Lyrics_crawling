[Intro] 
Uh 
Oh you thought I wasn't coming back with this one right here huh? 
Haha 
Mr. Hood! 
Look 
It go [Chorus] 
Aye knock, knock, bang, bang, where the cash at? 
(Hey where the cash?) 
Aye knock, knock, bang, bang, where the cash at? 
(Hey where the cash?) 
Where the cash at? 
(Hey, where the cash?) 
Where the cash at? 
(Hey, where the cash?) 
Aye knock, knock, bang, bang, where the cash? [Verse 1] 
Okay see, ain't nothing funny boy them dollars keep coming 
Okay I got a lot of money 
Ain't shit changed, big face hundreds 
Pinky and the Brain, triple black cars 
Bitch you know the name 
Mister Hood lover, supermodel brains 
Kicking down the door, give me what I came for 
Checking with my shooters, blow a hole in your Kangol 
They some barracudas, and I'm up with the cash flow 
They some assholes 
I think I'm Castro, I think I'm Scarface 
Blowing money fast, Ricky Rose' 
Big fire with me, up in the parleyed [Chorus X2] [Verse 2] 
Hey knock, knock, bang, bang, bitch I'm past that 
Hey wait a minute, bitch I think I had a relapse 
Don't jack my money I ain't asking where the cash at 
Pull out that chopper, make you wonder where your legs at 
Hold up wait doctor better ask him where your meds at 
Where the cash at? Better have that 
Super money shit, now can you smell that? 
I'm on my grizzle, trying to make a milli' 
Duffle full of money, more off in my denims 
That's brown paper, only thing I'm chasing 
Money over bitches, that's just in my nature 
Coming for my moula, I'm sharp with that eraser [Chorus X2]
