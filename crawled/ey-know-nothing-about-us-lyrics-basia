Right from the start there was none who had faith in us 
Who believed two of us had a chance 
Many years 
Precious scars 
We survived 
We are stronger they don't know about us 
They know nothing about us 
They don't understand 
They know nothing about us 
They don't know about us 
They know nothing about us 
No, nothing about us 
They don't get our love wish we could be somewhere else 
Where they wish us well 
Where the people are happy for us 
Just imagine how far we could go 
What we could do
