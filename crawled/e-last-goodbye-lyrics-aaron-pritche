Sprintime in Savannah 
It dont get much prettier than this 
But it feels like its wintertime to me The sky is clear and the sun is bright 
I aint looking forward to the night 
Cuz a cold chill is all Im gonna feel Im so sorry, I know the fault is mine 
I guess theres nothing left to try 
As you pack your bags I cannot deny 
This is the last goodbye We always managed to get through tough times 
Without getting burned 
I took you for granted and said youd never leave 
Now the tables have turned Im so sorry, I know the fault is mine 
I guess theres nothing left to try 
As you walk away I cannot deny 
This is the last goodbye I never told you that I loved you 
There was so much time 
But now its too late much too late Im so sorry, I know the fault is mine 
I guess theres nothing left to try 
As you close the door and I begin to cry 
This is the last 
This is the last 
This is the last goodbye
