Up all night, again 
As for sleep, no comprende 
I don't sleep 'cause sleep is the cousin of death 
Least that's what Nas say 
Sleep is a state of mind 
And to know is to be on your way 
I bought some bad drugs 
Off these snotty little rave kids I met 
And I shuffled off to Buffalo 
If I have love, then I hide it 
Then the people that I hide it from 
Have helped me to deny 
That it's not enough to show you care 
You gotta take on every double cross 
And every double dare, I swear to you 
Unchain your mind, become divine 
Surrender, surrender my love 
And get on down here and say it with me 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Sick and tired again 
Fucked and wired again 
It's all so beautiful 
Sound like a stone temple sob story to me 
If I'm on your mind again 
You must be trippin' on some of that 
Voodoo I been throwin' down 
When you're high and lost in the clouds 
Then you know it's time to get down, again
