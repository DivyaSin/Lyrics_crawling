Oh, I'm walkin' through the city 
It's lonely heartbreak streets 
The wind gives a chill 
And the sun begins to weep Oh, I don't know where I'm goin' 
And I don't know where I've been 
But the night's coming down 
And I'm feeling good again Cheap wine 
And cheaper women 
Oh, give me cheap wine 
And cheaper women and I may I had myself a lady 
To hold me tight and warm 
To keep out the cold 
And make love 'till the dawn She loved me tender 
And she loved me sweet 
But then she kicked me out 
And now I'm on the street Cheap wine 
And cheaper women 
Ooh, give me cheap wine 
And cheaper women, oh yeah Women come and go 
They never do remain 
They take more than they give 
But it's me who's to blame I'm at the bottom of the bottle 
And nothin's all I got 
Yeah, it may not be the answer 
But it sure does hit the spot Cheap wine 
And cheaper women 
Oh, give me cheap wine 
And cheaper women, oh yeah Oh, give me cheap wine 
And cheaper women, oh yeah 
I said, give me cheap wine, yeah 
And cheaper women, oh yeah 
Oh, give me cheap wine
