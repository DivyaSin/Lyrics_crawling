He's a boy from somewhere in mexico 
She's a sweet girl from somewhere in l.a. 
They met in a special way 
They don't know 'bout barricades 
They just know how to be good friends. A world between them 
Separated by discrimination 
They just want to live 
Without hate and seperations 
They only need understanding and hope 
While they speak along their dreams 
So they want more than... 
Chorus 
A love across the border 
They want love 
They want a peaceful place 
To believe once growth; 
A love across the border 
Throughout this world 
A world with pretty thing 
Once were made by god. They are everywhere 
They are common kids 
Among their stories they have in common 
A heartful dream 
To live in a better place 
In a better land 
And lead the exodus that today begin 
Within... Bridge: 
Today there's so much hate 
Today there's no good morning 
Someday i hope this will be 
The land for every human being 
Without hate and seperations.
