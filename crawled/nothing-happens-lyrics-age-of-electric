I don't get it, I completely understand 
She is a perfect person, I hate the bitch 
I'd like to talk to her, and not say a word 
My thought out instinct, is simply intricate 
That's all, that's all downhill, downhill 
Disappointed, out of time 
We never got there 
Disappointed, out of time 
Nothing happens 
You get softer as you soak me up 
Disappointed, out of time 
We never got there 
Disappointed, out of time 
Nothing happens 
You get softer as you soak me up 
There's a beauty in those words that you find 
A subtlety, we can't thank or find 
The less I try, the more easier it gets 
It's not me, its the attention you love 
You ate yours, you ate mine too, mine too 
You get softer as you soak me up 
You breathe deeper as you choke me out 
Disappointed, out of time 
We never got there 
Disappointed, out of time 
Nothing happens 
Nothing ever seems to happen
