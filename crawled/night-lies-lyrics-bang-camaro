Load in, she's there 
I am a big deal, baby 
Tune up, prepare 
I make a lot of money Tell her I care 
You're my one and only, baby 
Rock stars, small bars 
I wanna love you, honey We can be all you need 
Lick it up, all we're saying 
We can be anything you can dream Just believe our night lies 
Gimme, gimme night lies 
Gonna tell you all my night lies 
Gimme night lies Her eyes tell lies 
This is my first time, honey 
Whispers to me 
You are all I need, baby She's honestly deceiving me 
Dreams are free, her lies slay me 
She can be all for me, set me free I believe her night lies 
Gimme, gimme night lies 
Wanna hear you tell me night lies 
Gimme night lies Night lies 
Gimme, gimme night lies 
Wanna hear you tell me night lies 
Gimme night lies Night lies 
Gimme, gimme night lies 
Wanna hear you tell me night lies 
Gimme night lies
