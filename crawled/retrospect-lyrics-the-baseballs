I've been through the dirt - When my life got absurd 
Just a few were believing in me 
(She was the one who kept you from falling too deep) It was my believe - That the live I achieved 
Had to be some kind of bewitched 
(She was the one made you smile 
when your life was a bitch) If it was the same 
Still a chaos got me insane 
It I felt uneasy 
She would be the one to rescue me Retrospect - Everything is alright 
Oh, what a delight 
She's makin' me feel so happy Just perfect - Everytime she was right 
When I need an advice 
She's makin' me feel so good, oh my Blunder each day - Shed my hope far away 
Meditate to find a way out 
(No matter how down you've been, 
she was always so proud) Got the concern - That whatever I learned 
She would tell me to hold up my head 
(That's what she gave on your way, uh, that's what she said) If it was the same 
Still a chaos got me insane 
It I felt uneasy 
She would be the one to rescue me Retrospect - Everything is alright 
Oh, what a delight 
She's makin' me feel so happy Just perfect - Everytime she was right 
When I need an advice 
She's makin' me feel so good, oh my I love it, I love it, I love it... Retrospect - Everything is alright 
Oh, what a delight 
She's makin' me feel so happy Just perfect - Everytime she was right 
When I need an advice 
She's makin' me feel so happy Retrospect - Everything is alright 
Oh, what a delight 
She's makin' me feel so happy Just perfect - Everytime she was right 
When I need an advice 
She's makin' me feel so good
