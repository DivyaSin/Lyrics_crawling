My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun 
Troll of a treadmill, record on the Kessel Run (allegedly) 
Edgy from elevensies to megabucks 
Techies with the treble down, this is how we level up 
Dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease 
As ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys 
The coping mechanism in his LMNOPs 
Went from healthy to unhealthy to oh hell he never leaves 
Cineplex Jesus, curse at the curly fries 
Mulling over Chuck D telling me diversify 
I'm at the Supercut souping up the wardrobe 
Fourcast looking like Ganesh on four phones 
HelloHelloHelloHello base camp space camp 
Bass in your facefuck, brace for the rain dance 
Back in the back of the classroom 
After a magical nap in a vacuum Act natural 
Whatever that means for ya 
Whatever that means for ya 
Whatever that means for ya Before climbing douchebag mountain I was skate or die 
Started eating kale and came to terms with my lazy eye 
Puttin on the yoga lady, cuttin off the cable guy 
Whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize 
A/V cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched 
Mentholated tiger balm, Aleve with the arthritis cap 
Irons in the niacin, iron quiet riot masked 
Unabashed privacy expanding in a simulcast 
Forty winks never the same adventure 
Refreshing or this ain't the longest exorcism ever 
In the end you gotta wonder if its even worth the effort 
No stairways into heaven, you can step into the Escher 
Some people have mistaken my allegience for a weakness 
They fucked me up for eons, I wish there wes a theist 
The type to fake his death and forget he faked his death 
Show up on TV in the crowd at the AVNs (like) Act natural 
Whatever that means for ya 
Whatever that means for ya 
Whatever that means for ya Sometimes I feel my heart putrifying inside my body 
From diary at dark, to piety in the ponzi 
On my better days they mingle and walk off into the poppy 
On my worst, work is overshadowed by the monte 
I had to buy some clothes that fit me and pretend I like agave 
With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley (in em) 
Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars 
I'm feeling kinda done, too many moving parts 
The piss-poor vision is forty percent floaters 
The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers 
The friends you confessed all the dark shit to 
Would weaponize the information before we can send roses 
And they want a little pearl and how we got to where we at 
I can't remember where I am, I feel it's probably a trap 
Balk with the lawless, cough in his notes 
Walk on even when the walls hug his coat Oh, and act natural 
Whatever that means for ya 
Whatever that means for ya 
Whatever that means for ya
