I will not fall, 
Is it a matter of love, or a matter of pride? 
Can't stop a broken heart from bleeding 
Don't make it harder than it has to be 
Nothing worth love is ever easy 
Love is never easy 
Better to love and lose than never ever love at all? 
So tell me something new, tell me why do fools fall? 
Tell me why, yeah why do they fall? 
Ain't a matter of love, it's a matter of pride [Alexis Jordan] 
So if you want my love tell me now 
And if you need my love I'll show you how 
Just open up your heart and let me love you 
Seems like we're guarding our hearts again 
Trust is the key that we're missing so bad 
Cause I....... want to be happy and never sad again 
Cause I....... want to be happy and never sad again [Sryan]

Seems like we've got our share of differences 
We can't even agree to disagree 
Talking when we should be listening 
So trynna to meet our needs 
Is an impossibility 
You say (I don't give you respect) 
But I say (I'm suffering from neglect) 
It's all just the same 
No one takes the blame 
But the conclusion still will remain [Alexis Jordan] 
So if you want my love tell me now 
And if you need my love I'll show you how 
Just open up your heart and let me love you 
Seems like we're guarding our hearts again 
Trust is the key that we're missing so bad 
Cause I....... want to be happy and never sad again

That there's no sense in fighting 
About who's wrong or right when 
There's no end in sight so 
We both need to learn how to love 
Maybe there might be 
A chance even slightly 
If we both agree 
We both need to learn how to love [Alexis Jordan] 
So if you want my love tell me now 
And if you need my love I'll show you how 
Just open up your heart and let me love you 
Seems like we're guarding our hearts again 
Trust is the key that we're missing so bad 
Cause I....... want to be happy and never sad again
