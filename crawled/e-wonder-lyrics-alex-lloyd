Falling on your, broken bones 
Hitch a ride to, get you home 
Stormy road and rocky path 
Every step we, take a chance Cause in your heart and in your mind 
Sometimes lost now sometimes blind 
Well it's sometimes blind See the wonder of it all 
Take a breath before it falls 
The wonder, the wonder of it all 
The wonder of it all Innocence wasn't meant to fail 
Stretched it out on a bed of nails 
All your rights and all your wrongs 
What it meant now to belong Cause in your heart and in your mind 
Sometimes lost now sometimes blind 
Well it's sometimes blind See the wonder of it all 
What we had and lost before 
The wonder, the wonder of it all the wonder of it all Did you see the wonder like a crash of thunder 
It's the spell we're under now 
The wonder the wonder of it all See the wonder of it all 
What we had and lost before, 
See the wonder of it all 
What we had and lost before 
The wonder, the wonder of it all
