I'm the chosen one 
I'm the setting sun 
Hottest car on the block 
Faster than you'll take me Picture where I've been 
Underneath 
Within 
I could love you 
I could steal your light 
Day conjoined with night 
And I could hide away I'd see you thru 
I'd see you thru Take me there 
If you're coming 
What to wear, where you goin? 
What would you like for me to know? 
And would you die to tell me so? 
You said recovery is slim 
I could complicate it 
I could recreate it 
My only cover was a con I succinctly 
Distinctly 
Completely knew And this is where it's gone 
And this is why we came 
As long as we're apart 
The game is not the same I see you 
Eternal 
I'm burning 
Encircled Day conjoined with night 
And I could hideaway
