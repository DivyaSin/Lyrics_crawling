Fine, don't you know I'm feeling fine? And I finally cleared my mind, and now I know it's time, to move on with my life. Sunny days are hard to find, when you're not with your baby, and your vision's going hazy. 
Chorus: 
Then you gotta be the one to take your life and turn it good. And you want to make a break you gotta leave your neighborhood. Go far from here... I'll teach you how to disappear. Then maybe we can find a little something special, right here, there's nothing in the way of you and I movin' on to something better. Together faraway. 
My, my, I said you're never gonna know if you sit around and you don't try, try. And I promise you that, but I have payed my dues, won't refuse, you snooze you lose. I'm kissing you bye bye. I said you know we gotta go when the show's cuz' there's no time, time to be messin' around and I will take you miles away, from hurricanes, let me say... 
Repeat Chorus 
And I'm tryin' so hard to please everyone but me, but now it's down to me. And I find it hard to see, almost every night, cuz' I wanna make it right 
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-di-doo-doo... 
Repeat Chorus
