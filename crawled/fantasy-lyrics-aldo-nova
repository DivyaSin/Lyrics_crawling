City nights 
Summer breezes makes you feel all right 
Neon-lights 
Shining brightly make your brain ignite See the girls with the dresses so tight 
Give you love, if the price is right 
Black or white 
In the streets there's no wrong and no right Outta site 
Buy your kicks from the man in the white 
Feels all right 
Powder pleasure in your nose tonight See the men paint their faces and cry 
Like some girl, it makes you wonder why 
City life 
Sure is cool, but it cuts like a knife 
It's your life So forget all that you see 
It's not reality, it's just a fantasy Can't you see what this crazy life is doin' to me Life is just a fantasy 
Can you live this fantasy life 
Life is just a fantasy 
Can you live this fantasy life
