(Alexa Lusader) No way you can play with my mind 
And still go to bed just fine. 
Don't tell me you love me when you really don't, baby. 
Don't tell me you love me when you really don't, baby. Electronic Rift Your winter's so cold, your winter's so cold. 
Our love is frozen, our love is froze. Oh how long can your heart survive? 
The cold is eating you alive. 
I wanna be loved, just not by you. 
Your lips are turning blue. I am just a souvenir 
To show that you've been here. 
I've seen everything I need to know, baby. 
So don't tell me you love me when you really don't, baby. Oh how long can your heart survive? 
The cold is eating you alive. 
I wanna be loved, just not by you. 
Your lips are turning blue. 
Our lips are turning blue. I am just a souvenir.
