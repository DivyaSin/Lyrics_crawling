Blinded by the light that I can't see 
claimed to rescue me 
deafening the sounds I cannot hear 
for some obvious speeches-for others not as clear 
not as clear Serpent I am of thee... prodigal son 
striving to win that which... cannot be won 
seeking a faith in which I... can believe 
scrutinizing the messages I receive Won't you make me see (come alive) 
come awaken me (come alive) 
won't you make me be (come alive) 
to it instantly Won't you make me see (come alive) 
arouse me (come alive) 
show me on my way (come alive) 
to it and seize the day] Harbouring the port of my alleged sanctuary 
still I'm trapped in a vicious circle on this merry 
go round on churning seas that ferry'll make me 
searching but my eyes can't see my redemptory Alas, I'm lost in the jungle I've grown 
in my quest to find the way 
what I asked of the tarots was not was shown 
am I but a soul astray? 
enlighten me give me back my spark 
deliver me from grey 
give me the strength to go on 
to seize each and every day Stuck, I am stuck in the cobweb of my mind 
(black is the path that leads me to think I'm blind) 
numb, I am numb from the pain I cannot feel 
(dead emotion, all seams so unreal)
