She doesn't dare go in the place with those bruises on her face 
So she goes through the drive-thru and keeps her sunglasses on 
She didn't know when she married that man 
She'd get to know him like the back of his hand 
But now she's had enough, and the battle lines are drawn He's in a bar chasing Cuervo with Tecate 
He doesn't know she's been taking karate 
The way she figures it about July 
She'll finally have the belt to match her eye She's on a mission as the months pass 
Five days a week and never misses a class 
And now she's up to breakin' boards and concrete blocks He's in a bar chasing Cuervo with Tecate 
He doesn't know she's been taking karate 
Now here it is just about July 
She's gonna get that belt to match her eye He stumbled through the door tonight 
And started treatin' her rough 
Well, she took one look at him and her training kicked in 
And she'd finally had enough He threw a punch, she spun around 
Grabbed his arm and put him on the ground 
Grabbed a cuttin' board on his way down and she kicked it in half 
His knees hit the floor, his chin hit a chair 
Knocked out his tooth and it flew through the air 
Grabbed his head by the back of his hair and slammed him into the fridge 
She landed a left, a right and then a left 
She landed a roundhouse right in his chest and a scissor punch upside his head 
Broke his nose, swept a leg, he started to fall 
And on his way down, she took a bow, and the lights went out He's on the floor like he went a round with Rocky 
He didn't know she'd been taking karate 
A hundred bucks says tomorrow night 
She's got a brand new belt that's gonna match his eye He doesn't dare go in the place with those bruises on his face 
So he goes through the drive-thru with his sunglasses on
