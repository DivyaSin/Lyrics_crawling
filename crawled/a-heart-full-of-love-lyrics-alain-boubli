MARIUS: 
A heart full of love 
A heart full of song 
I'm doing everything all wrong 
Oh God, for shame 
I do not even know your name 
Dear Mad'moiselle 
Won't you say? 
Will you tell? COSETTE: 
A heart full of love 
No fear, no regret M, ARIUS: 
My name is Marius Pontmercy COSETTE: 
And mine's Cosette MARIUS: 
Cosette, I don't know what to say COSETTE: 
Then make no sound MARIUS: 
I am lost COSETTE: 
I am found! MARIUS: 
A heart full of light COSETTE: 
A night bright as day MARIUS: 
And you must never go away 
Cosette, Cosette COSETTE: 
This is a chain we'll never break MARIUS: 
Do I dream? COSETTE: 
I'm awake! MARIUS: (Counterpoint) 
A heart full of love COSETTE: 
A heart full of you MARIUS: 
A single look and then I knew COSETTE: 
I knew it too MARIUS: 
From today COSETTE: 
Every day COSETTE & MARIUS: 
For it isn't a dream 
Not a dream after all. EPONINE (Counterpoint): 
He was never mine to lose 
Why regret what cannot be? 
These are words he'll never say 
Not to me... 
Not to me... 
Not to me... His heart full of love 
He will never feel this way...
