The smoke above my chimney's 
Pouring fast with the fires rage. 
And I'm sulking like a child, 
It's pathetic for my age. The snow is softly falling 
And the street lamps are a-glow. 
It should feel like it is Christmas, 
But it just isn't so. I could stay awake for hours 
And pray that you'd appear. 
I could laugh at an old letter 
That you wrote me just last year. But the wind is coming strong, 
And a flurry too I'm told. 
It's a miracle that life could exist 
In all this cold. What keeps us warm in the night, 
When we're all alone? 
I'm not feeling alright, 
Laying on my own. In the darkness of night, 
Will love ever grow? 
With the shortage of light, 
Beneath all the snow. The tree is strung and tall, 
And everything's the same. 
Because it's just like every year, 
Now I'm all that remains. The shirt that you gave me 
Is battered out and worn. 
but it's all that keeps me 
Bright in this grey and violent storm. What keeps us warm in the night? 
When we're all alone? 
I'm not feeling alright, 
Laying on my own. In the darkness of night, 
Will love ever grow? 
With the shortage of light, 
Beneath all the snow. The icy clouds will surely change to summer's glow. 
But I'd do anything for, one last winters kiss with you. What keeps us warm in the night? 
When we're all alone? 
I'm not feeling alright, 
Laying on my own. In the darkness of night, 
Will love ever grow? 
With the shortage of light, 
Beneath all the snow. In the darkness of night, 
Will love ever grow? 
With the shortage of light.
