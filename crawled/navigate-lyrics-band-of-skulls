Everybody's back in town 
Give me the armor and let me prepare this 
It can't be easy our... to stair 
Your heart and breath stops death cheats death It's clear 
Time in time wait for no man 
Slowly realizes fast stairs you get 
Thought a sorrow glimps so how you were at five 
And it strange how these things take you by surprise We are driftin on the deep sea me 
And I gone now the gate the stars like my follow 
Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water 
If we scared it books our sun though The more you talk the less you mean 
You told me that when I was just seventeen 
When it sing sing you will not always be here 
Funny how all your small worries dissappear We are driftin on the deep sea me 
And I gone now the gate the stars like my follow 
Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water 
Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water 
Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water 
Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water 
Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water 
Oh it driftin out to see I 
N too deep water If we're scared it puts us under 
If you're thinking what you know is 
To then tell them with them... 
If your time goes what's the question 
Boy you tender 
So close this uhh We are driftin on the deep sea me 
And I gone now the gate the stars like my follow 
Oh it driftin out to see I 
N too deep water Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water 
Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water 
Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water 
Oh it driftin out to see 
In too deep water
