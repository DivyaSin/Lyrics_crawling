Don't move 
I only think the truth unless it you 
Don't move 
I tried to be the best and there's no proof 
Please move 
Its a long time coming 
A long time making you 
I hope that it will get the best of 
And I didn't know you wouldn't have 
The key to the end of it all 
I really hoped it would be okay 
To save it for another day 
For another day' I hope you 
Can take it slower than we are used to 
Don't lose 
Your hope in me if there is actually proof 
Don't move 
I'm a long time coming 
A long time making you 
I didn't know you wouldn't have 
The key to the end of it all 
Now I would make it to be okay 
To save it for another day 
For another day' There's no use 
It's a long time coming 
A long time saving you
