Your my world 
The shelter from the rain 
You're the pills 
That take away my pain 
You're the light 
That helps me find my way 
You're the words 
When I have nothing to say In this world 
Where nothing else is true 
Here I am 
Still tangled up in you 
I'm still tangled up in you 
Still tangled up in you You're the fire 
That warms me when I'm cold 
You're the hand I have to hold 
As I grow old 
You're the shore 
When I am lost at sea 
You're the only thing 
I like about me In this world 
Where nothing else is true 
Here I am 
Still tangled up in you 
I'm still tangled up in you 
Still tangled up in you How long has it been 
Since the story line began 
And I hope it never ends 
It goes like this forever In this world 
Where nothing else is true 
Here I am 
Still tangled up in you 
I'm still tangled up in you 
Still tangled up in you 
I'm still tangled up in you 
I'm still tangled up in you
