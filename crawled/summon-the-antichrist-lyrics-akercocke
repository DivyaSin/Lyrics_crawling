Master, take wing over the desert 
And parched land 
Master the art of suffering 
A divine dance Summon the master Mouth incendiary evocation 
Black flame engulfs 
Filth and maggots of humanity 
Hair burning, faces melt Summon 
Master The inexhaustible beauty 
The incomparable gift 
Satan has made to the human race 
In his only child, antichrist Mouth incendiary evocation 
Black flame engulfs 
Filth and maggots of humanity 
Hair burning, faces melt Obscene ritual 
Totems sacrosanct 
Divine Baphomet Worship the Goatlord 
Divine Lucifer 
Worship the Goatlord Swarming, the spirits of the pit 
Infernal, arise from the abyss 
Absonant, within the Pentagram 
Ritually summon the Antichrist The wings of the master
