Said it's 2a.m. 
I want it girl, right now I'm turnt up in this bitch 
Drunk off that liquor 
I can't trust these hoes 
But you look so different, girl 
You, you got your girls, I got my niggas 
So you should tell yo girls to come fuck with us Come live in the fast lane 
Bottles every night, whatever you like 
'Cause I do things 
And you know my niggas keep that thing on the side 
'Cause a nigga wanna act strange 
But this ain't about me, girl it's all about you 
And I ain't just running game 
I ain't running game Said it's 2a.m. 
I want it girl, I want this girl 
I know you're horny, girl 
I want it girl, I want it girl 
Said it's 2a.m. 
I want it girl Neck frozen, wrist too 
They ain't never seen a California igloo 
My dude own a magazine for the issue 
You better off tryna kick it like jiu-jitsu 
It's 2a.m. and I'm tryna get in there 
Say X marks the spot but your ex not in here 
On my momma, I ain't for the drama 
I'm from the Sev, no beef 
We just get the commas Said it's 2a.m. 
I want it girl, I want this girl 
I know you're horny, girl 
I want it girl, I want it girl 
Said it's 2a.m. 
I want it girl Let's pull off in this whip 
Full speed to my after-hours 
Take a couple more sips 
Girl, you know I'll be good for hours 
You, you say it's real and I can feel lonely 
You know the deal, we in the moment Come live in the fast lane 
Bottles every night, whatever you like 
'Cause I do things 
And you know my niggas keep that thing on the side 
'Cause a nigga wanna act strange 
But this ain't about me, girl it's all about you 
And I ain't just running game 
I ain't running game Said it's 2a.m. 
I want it girl, I want this girl 
I know you're horny, girl 
I want it girl, I want it girl 
Said it's 2a.m. 
I want it girl
