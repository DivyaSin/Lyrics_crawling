Do you feel so betrayed like 
To dance that beat away? 
Hip-pop club guys look at 
You feel so free what can 
You do put yourself down 
You're a disgrace 
Why do you support them? 
As they call you bitch to your face 
Why do you support them? 
Listen to the rhythm it's so 
Great you don't care what the lyrics say 
Trade your pride for a 
Dance you'll support them 
As you laugh As I see you're going nowhere 
But you like the fashion that they wear 
You let them put you down 
Cause it's popular music and 
You'll pretend that you don't care 
Speak up in a crowd you don't dare 
You'll just pretend that you don't care 
Oh yeah
