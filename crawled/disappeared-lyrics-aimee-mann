Somehow, I wound up on your bad side 
til now, I guess I had a free ride 
but now I join the queue 
of people dead to you 
the one-time chosen few Thats all, thats it, 
you got yourself disappeared 
the atom split, and you got back-engineered 
youre a forgotten face behind a beard 
thats it 
thats all 
youre gone Though Ive been master of the thankless task 
nearby are questions you just have to ask 
was every enemy 
bad as you made him be? 
or were they just 
some gullible stooge like me? Thats all, thats it, 
you got yourself disappeared 
the atom split, and you got back-engineered 
youre a forgotten face behind a beard 
thats it 
thats all 
youre gone And everyone who knew you, said theyd been there too 
and soon enough Id see the mill you put them through 
that Irish Goodbye you do That's it, that's all 
you got yourself disappeared 
a curtain call 
at which your absence was cheered 
you're a forgotten face behind a beard 
that's it, that's all 
you're gone
