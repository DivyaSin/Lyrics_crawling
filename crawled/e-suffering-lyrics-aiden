Burn! Your! Friends! [Repeat: x4] Living is easy 
With your eyes closed by and by 
Do you wake up 
Do you wake up and cry at night 
The evil inside 
That breaks right through the light 
With hard times and long goodbyes Take me 
Into your dark dream 
And scream so loud this place 
Fills with misery 
Suffer the kiss 
And take me out alive. We are those things that you despise 
(We will sing) 
We are the suffering alive Burn! Your! Friends! [Repeat: x4] Shadows and hearts 
In which to carry your rule aloud 
Can you believe we are 
The shock of existence now 
Something's amiss 
And this generation has been found 
We're brought to the underground Waste me to your dark dream 
And taste me until all I see 
A thousand sparks we fake 
Love futility 
I see the rain We are those things that you despise 
(We will sing) 
We are the suffering alive tonight 
(Suffering) We are those things that you despise 
(We will sing) 
We are he suffering alive tonight This time we're coming home worthless 
This time, this time alive [Repeat: x8] We will sing We are those things that you despise 
(We will sing) 
We are the suffering alive tonight 
(Suffering) We are those things that you despise 
(We will sing) 
We are the suffering alive
