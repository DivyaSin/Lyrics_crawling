Shes discovered a brand new way to feel superior 
Shes discovered another way to get attention 
Shes discovered how an attitude can change her life 
Shes putting on the mask of Mona Lisa 
I dont know, maybe she spent the summer in Verona 
And in an attic found the missing notebooks of old Leonardo 
All the tricks of trickery were laid out for her virgin eyes 
Shes discovered a brand new way to feel superior 
I dont know, maybe she was on an African adventure 
Found herself in the death grip of young boa constrictor 
And acting unimpressed was the only way to save her life 
Shes discovered a brand new way to feel superior 
Shes discovered another way to get attention 
Shes discovered how an attitude can change her life 
Shes putting on the mask of Mona Lisa 
Putting on the mask of Mona Lisa 
Maybe its a part of the human condition 
Maybe its a sign of an unhappy heart 
Maybe its a part of an unnatural tradition 
But she took to the position like a water snake to water 
I dont know, maybe its just a phase that shell grow out of 
When she has kids of her own, she can blame them for her problems 
Cause all shes ever wanted were the questions that have easy answers 
Shes discovered a brand new way to feel superior 
Shes discovered another way to get attention 
Shes discovered how an attitude can change her life 
Shes putting on the mask of Mona Lisa 
Putting on the mask of Mona Lisa 
Putting on the mask of Mona Lisa
