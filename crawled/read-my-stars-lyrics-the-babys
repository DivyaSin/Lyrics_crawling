Say you love me 
I know you do 
Go anywhere I want you to 
Yeah but I love ya So now I read my stars 
Gettin' worried 
I face the floor 
Hearin' noises outside my door Think it's friends 
Can't be sure 
So now I read my stars 
And now I turn the cards Is it love 
Oh I don't know 
Is it real I can't tell 
Why the smile Well I'm happy 
Do you know her that well 
Is it strange 
Well I don't know Seein' stars all around yeah 
It's a spell yeah I think so 
Seein' rainbows well 
Crystal gaze and visions fade Make the card the ace of spades 
Can't walk the streets 
I don't feel safe 
So now I read my stars Say you love you me I know you do 
Do anythin' I want you to 
Oh the things you put me through 
So now I read my stars 
But where to turn the cards
