He knocked it off, knocked it off 
He knocked it off, knocked it off Some of us have talent, some of us just haven't 
Some are super sensitive like Mr Spock 
Chose my vocation, ? application 
I'm an overnight sensation, The King of rock 
Available for parties, Bar Mitzvahs and charities 
Do another session, I'll be carried off 
I have my creativity, thank God, my sensitivity 
You know I really love my art 
(We think you are a boring ?) 
Knocked it off, you know I knocked it off 
While I was sitting in the corner with my tracksuit off 
I was hopin' I'd be playin' 
But I never thought I'd be winnin' the game 
You knocked it off. Yeah, I knocked it off 
While I was standing on the goalline when the ball got crossed 
I thought I'd have a go and shoot it 
But I never thought I'd put it away He knocked it off, knocked it off 
He knocked it off, knocked it off I made meself a million, had my house painted vermillion 
But I'm still the same civilian, even talk to me pork 
I'm happy to be playin', what's that you're sayin'? 
There's got to be a limo to take me down the shops 
Tell them they can stuff it, I'm not about to rough it 
In some Granada Ghia, I was top of the pops 
Talk like a vicar when they get a little tickle 
And they get a little sick when they get a little flop. Knocked it off, you know I knocked it off 
While I was sitting in the corner with my tracksuit off 
I was hopin' I'd be playin' 
But I never thought I'd be winnin' the game 
You knocked it off. Yeah, I knocked it off 
While I was standing on the goalline when the ball got crossed 
I thought I'd have a go and shoot it 
But I never thought I'd put it away To Maharajahs and kings show the door 
Cause my Gucci ? blazer's secure 
My diamante personalised number plate, sure He's going to have a ?? cash He knocked it off, knocked it off 
He knocked it off, knocked it off I knocked it off, he knocked it off 
I was the flavour of the month, you get me in the shops 
I was hopin' I'd be playin' 
But I never thought I'd be winnin' the game 
You knocked it off. Yeah, I knocked it off 
While I was standing on the goalline when the ball got crossed 
I thought I'd have a go and shoot it 
But I never thought I'd put it away He knocked it off, knocked it off 
He knocked it off, knocked it off 
He knocked it off, knocked it off 
He knocked it off, knocked it off?
