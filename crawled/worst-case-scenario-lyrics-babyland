I am the lowest of the low 
It's hell being enlightened 
You've got to live with what you know 
Worst case scenario 
Always fighting with my mind 
Always kicking down to compromise 
My grip is gone, the past is black 
It's been done before, and I like where I'm at 
I am the lowest of the low 
It's hell being enlightened 
You've got to live with what you know 
Worst case scenario 
Higher, high, high 
You've got to come down
