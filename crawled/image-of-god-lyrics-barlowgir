When my beauty fades away and all I see is gone 
Reflection in my mirror doesn't please you anymore 
What will be left within me 
You promise me eternal bliss 
Never ending happiness 
If I'd only look and play the right part 
But, Now look what's been left in me Tell me why do I Why do I try 
try so hard to please you 
Can you promise me, In a few years 
You will even remember my name Chorus 
And I am made in the image of God 
I am loved for who I am Your flashy Magazines & & billboards always scream 
Your worth don't lie within, Its how you look it's how you dress 
It's who you know 
But, That's a deadly trap 
I'm breaking all your rules and getting off your path 
cause I have come to see that where it leads is only heartbreak and shame 
and who could be satisfied with that. 
Tell me why do I Why do I try 
try so hard to please you (Yeah) 
Can you promise me, In a few years 
You will even remember my name Chorus 
And I am made in the image of God 
I am loved for who I am 
And though I may not please your eyes But always know, that 
It's in me that God takes delight Takes delight (la la la)
