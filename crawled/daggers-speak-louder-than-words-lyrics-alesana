Eyes open to splattered blood 
Cold tile mocks me as I arise to find the knife is still in my back 
Shifting thoughts now slow with venom 
Take me as I stagger...is this all we were worth? 
I've lost you for good without regret 
Your once gentle words now bleeding from my chest 
Screams of terror now fill my every breath 
I know you'll rue the day you ever met me 
I'll lay you down to sleep when sorrow will bury the blade hilt deep You know I would have died for you 
Now I'm forced to choose between a life of revenge or regret 
As I thirst for vengeance, my heart struggles to come to grips 
Why would you leave me to die, turn, and walk away? Alone, you stood so still as you watched me break 
Did it now kill you too? what has led you to the dagger my friend? You know I would have died for you 
Now I'm forced to choose between a life of revenge or regret 
As I thirst for vengeance, my heart struggles to come to grips 
Why would you leave me to die, turn, and walk away? My revenge is made so clear midst cold tears left with the betrayed 
I'll see that you never forget this 
I will hunt you down like a dog 
Lies could never disguise what I saw behind me in you 
Remembering times we have shared...my friend for life is gone 
We'll let the embers serve as the only memory of last days, so long ago Why would you leave me to die, turn, and walk away? 
Why would you leave me to die after you had buried the dagger hilt deep? You're dead to me 
I would have died for you 
Now I'm forced to choose between a life of revenge or regret 
As I thirst for vengeance, my heart struggles to come to grips 
Why would you leave me to die, turn, and walk away? 
You're dead to me
