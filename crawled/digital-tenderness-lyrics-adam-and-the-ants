why does this feeling of togetherness 
always scare me away? 
why do the feelings that I have for you 
have to become a word ? don't say you "love" me-oh no 
don't ask that from me-oh no no that alphabet you call love 
that alphabet you call love 
that alphabet you call love 
is just a digital tenderness 
tenderness here is the start for so many broken people 
all with a hard luck story 
and a sad sad tale don't say you love me-oh no 
don't ask that from me-oh no no that alphabet you call love 
that alphabet you call love 
that alphabet you call love 
is just a digital tenderness 
tenderness sometimes 
I need to be by myself 
I need to be by your side 
I need 
sometimes 
I need the company of art 
I ned the company of friends 
I need you and my heart is stronger 
than a four-letter-long word searching the eyes of so many broken 
people 
whose cowardice proved much too strong 
for vice 
don't say you "love" me ... 
oh no 
don't ask that from me 
no no no that alphabet you call "love" 
that alphabet you call "love"
