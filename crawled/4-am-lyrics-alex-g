It's pouring rain at 4 a.m. 
I feel so close to you right now 
But have you fallen for me yet? 
I'd let you go but I don't know how And I know it's just another night 
But I fell for you again 
And I remember when You didn't wanna waste a moment 
You were captured in my arms 
And stolen by my eyes 
It's still your heart that lifts me 
And your words that can kill me 
But still I'd run for miles 
Just to be near you Oh ohhh? Your presence lingers on my neck 
I can't let go of you right now 
I'm kinda scared of what comes next 
I might just die if you forget And I know it's just another night 
but I fell for you again 
And I remember when You didn't wanna waste a moment 
You were captured in my arms 
And stolen by my eyes 
It's still your heart that lifts me 
And your words that can kill me 
But still I'd run for miles You cut me open 
And you fill me with this hope 
When you know this whole thing's hopeless 
And I'm hopelessly hoping 
That you will see 
What lies inside of me It's pouring rain at 4 a.m. 
I feel so close to you right now And I don't wanna waste this moment 
Captured in your arms 
And stolen by your eyes eyes 
It's still your heart that lifts me 
And your words that can kill me 
But still I'd run for miles So close so close now 
Don't let go let go now 
Won't you fall for me tonight? It's still your heart that lifts me 
And your words that can kill me 
But still I'd run for miles 
Just to be near you
