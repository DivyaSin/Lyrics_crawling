For a little while we know what heartache is 
And we feel the pain the world can sometimes bring 
For a little while we cry in the night without a single song to sing 
But one day all will change, there will be no more stormy rain 
Then at last we will rest forever more So if you're in the valley 
(If you're in the valley now) 
And life is so unkind 
(Life is so unkind) 
And if your tears keep falling 
(If your tears keep falling) 
From your tired eyes 
(From your eyes) Your burden seem so heavy 
(Your burden seem so heavy now) 
And its hard to smile 
(So hard to smile) 
You must remember 
(You better remember) 
It's only for a while For a little while, well, you lose someone you love 
And you miss the time together that you shared 
For a little while you feel all alone and scared 
With no one there to hold, oh, the nights get long and cold 
But it won't last, it will pass in time So if you're in the valley 
(If you're in the valley now) 
And life is so unkind 
(Life is so unkind) 
And if your tears keep falling 
(If your tears keep falling) 
From your tired eyes 
(From your eyes) Your burden seem so heavy 
(Your burden seem so heavy now) 
And it's hard to smile so hard to smile 
(So hard to smile) 
Oh, you gotta remember, you gotta remember 
It's only for a while You better remember, gotta remember 
It's only for a while 
Oh, yes remember 
It's only for a while
