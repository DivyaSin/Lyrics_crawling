You've been a fool and so have i 
But come I'll be your wife 
And let us try before we die 
To make some sense of life 
We're neither pure nor wise nor good 
We'll do the best we know 
We'll build our house and chop our wood 
And make our garden grow 
And make our garden grow I thought the world was sugar cake 
For so our master said 
But now I'll teach my hands to bake 
Our loaf of daily bread 
We're neither pure nor wise nor good 
We'll do the best we know 
We'll build our house and chop our wood 
And make our garden grow 
And make our garden grow Let dreamers dream what worlds they please 
Those edens can't be found 
The sweetest flowers 
The fairest trees 
Are grown in solid ground 
We're neither pure nor wise nor good 
We'll do the best we know 
We'll build our house and chop our wood 
And make our garden grow 
And make our garden grow
