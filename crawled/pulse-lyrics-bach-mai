I pushed away half of my heart 
I buried it 
I smothered it with dirt 
And I thought I left six feet under 
But where my feet rest 
I can still feel it's pulse 
I know that I have changed 
But it still beats like yesterday, pounding inside in sync with my brain And I miss you, but I can't say word 
I am poison I am what's hurting you 
And I miss you, but I can't say word 
I am poison I am what's hurting you And I miss you, but I can't say word 
I am poison I'm what's infecting you And I miss you, but I can't say word 
I am poison I am what's killing you When I close my eyes all, I need is the darkness 
But your piercing light cuts right through 
I swear to god I'll be blind And I know I pushed my heart away 
But it still beats/bleeds like yesterday
