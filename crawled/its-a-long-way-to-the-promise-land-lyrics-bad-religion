It's a long way to the promise land 
So you'd better well know your way 
Where's a ship on the ocean 
And an albatross who is trying to lead you astray 
Leaders, politicians, and power whores 
Are in line to receive your choice 
And you bet your ass, if you give it to them, 
They will gladly take your voice 
And it's a long way to the promise land 
Wo-oh oh oh oh It's a long way to the promise land, 
If we work we might find it here 
There's no substitute for enlightenment, 
There's no reason for bridled fear 
When you join the people who've joined the club 
You gotta clench and play your hand 
'cause if you fall in line you're gonna fall in time 
And you'll never make a stand 
It's a long way to the promise land 
Wo-oh oh oh oh What are you going to do? 
When they call for you? 
Bend and capitulate? 
Or keep your head on straight? 
Easy answers bought without experience, 
Is gonna lead you to certain doom 
Because the truth is just what you make of it, 
It begins and ends with you! 
And it's a long way to the promise land 
Wo-oh oh oh oh
