I'm gonna stay right here beside him cause a woman's place is with her man 
So many times a man gets lonesome and that's when he needs a helping hand 
A woman's hand though so soft and gentle can do so much to help her man 
Just holding him each time he needs you the power of love is in a woman's hand 
It's a woman's hand that makes a man go searching 
It's a woman's hand that's make a man stay home 
For he can't do either one without a woman 
It's a woman's hand that leads him right or wrong 
No he can't do either one...
