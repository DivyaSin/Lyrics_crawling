I'm not alone 
Even when we're apart 
I feel you in the air, yeah 
I'm not afraid 
I know what you're thinking 
I can hear you everywhere Some people say it'll never happen 
We're just wasting time 
But good things come when you least expect them 
So I don't really mind We'll be together 
Come whatever 
I'm not just staring at the stars 
Just remember 
That no one else can tell us who we are 
We'll be together 
So don't ever stop listening to your heart 
'Cause I can't turn mine off I can't pretend 
This is a rehearsal for the real thing 
Because it's not, and 
I know we're young 
But I can't help feeling what I'm feeling 
And I won't stop Some things are meant to be, and they'll be there 
When the time is right 
Even though I know that I swear 
I wish it was tonight We'll be together 
Come whatever 
I'm not just staring at the stars 
Just remember 
That no one else can tell us who we are 
We'll be together 
So don't ever stop listening to your heart 
'Cause I can't turn mine off I like what's happening to me 
Nothing else to say 
Somebody finally got to me 
Carried me away We'll be together 
Come whatever 
I'm not just staring at the stars 
Just remember 
That no one else can tell us who we are 
We'll be together 
So don't ever stop listening to your heart 
'Cause I can't turn mine off I'm not alone 
Even when we're apart 
I feel you
