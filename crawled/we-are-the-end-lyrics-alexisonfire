Look around, look around 
There's no affection, only infection 
Search yourself, search yourself 
Can I depend on you to surrender And we will storm their shores 
Eyes suffocating all they see 
Feet sturdy on the rubble that will soon be dust 
And there will be no ruins, no memory, no history 
Only our unrelenting march side by side 
We will comb the earth and sweep it clean, hearts and feet unified 
The hand of man is no match for our warless army Please tell me that this is the end of the world 
(And we will strike with the arms of Gods and leave nothing in our wake) 
It's time that we erase history 
(And we will strike with the arms of Gods) 
Without a trade or a memory 
(On my word, we will seize fate) 
Please tell me that this is the end of the world. 
(And we will strike with the arms of Gods and leave nothing in our wake) 
It's time that we erase history 
(And we will strike with the arms of Gods) 
Without a trace or a memory 
(Destiny choked in our wage) Steadfast soldiers with hands of Gods 
And the numbers to succeed. 
We will persist until all that's left is a perfect sphere. 
Never a break in the chain, 
Never a folly of conviction, 
And may the traitors' ashes seal the barren landscape. We are the end! [2x] Please tell me that this is the end of the world. 
(And we will strike with the arms of Gods and leave nothing in our wake)
