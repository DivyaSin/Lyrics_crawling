Rock And Roll Is The Only Way Out 
Randy Bachman Monday morning comes too soon 
We all wanna sleep till the aftermoon 
Tryin' to get movin' but one thing's clear 
Takes all day getting back in gear 
24-7 Workin' for the man 
Gotta keep doin' the best we can 
The weekends comin' and there ain't no doubt 
We just like kids when school gets out Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Whoa-Clap your hands in the air and shout 
Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out The politicians wastin' time 
We lost control and we losing our mind 
Money's worth nothing - nothin's worth the money 
No one's laughing cuz it ain't that funny 
We gotta keep rockin' the neighborhood 
We come together when the music is good 
We gotta have a party and there ain't no doubt 
We're just like kids when school gets out Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Whoa-Clap your hands in the air and shout 
Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out Got to the point where there's no use trying 
Wake me up cuz the dream is dyin' 
Get a little crazy, get a little high 
Gotta have something to help you get by 
We all like to party and there ain't no doubt 
We're just like kids when school gets out 
We all like to party and there ain't no doubt 
We're just like kids when school gets out Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Whoa-Clap your hands in the air and shout 
Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Whoa-Clap your hands in the air and shout 
Whoa-Rock 'n' roll is the only way out Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Rock 'n' roll is the only way out 
Rock 'n' roll is the only way out
