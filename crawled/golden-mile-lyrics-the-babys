Had a vision on the Golden Mile 
Turned my head and walked away 
Sun was shining and it caught my eyes 
Damn near blew me away Sometimes I look back and I think to myself 
Had some friends there and they lost their way 
It's funny, when I recall their smiles 
I swear to God, I didn't know them all 
But it seemed so for a while 
And sometimes I look back and I cry to myself I can feel, I can feel the world turning round 
Yeah, feel it turn 
I can feel the world turning round on me 
Yeah, I can feel the world turning round, oh Going back there to the Golden Mile 
It's where I belong anyway 
If you should see me stay out my way 
I'm going back to find my golden days
