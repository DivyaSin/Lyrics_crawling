Sifted through the library of the lost ten years 
and there hasn't, I don't suppose, been a moment we can hold as close as the night we kicked of your clothes and swam in the salt I wish a deep and early grave to the collection of moments I caved 
Whether they were minute or massive waves 
As I lay in the bed we made, swallowed whore Soon we'll leave this place for not a full stop but parentheses 
The most lovely of life sentences 
All I wanted was to mention this, you're here in my 
heart!.....
