I will love you each day of my life 
And when I die they can 
Fetch them a knife 
Cut me open 
Written on by brain 
And in my heart they'll find a name 
It'll be yours, yours, yours, yours 
A love dare not speak it's name 
If you wanna be happy 
Live out of the past 
Make your new lover 
As good as the last 
Or better... 
Please don't love me 
For what I'm not 
Better you hate me 
For what I've got
