No more, bitches, no more, no more, bitches, no more 
Even though the bitches they be flocking all around me 
Doesn't mean I need to give into all of this flaunting 
Dirty dirty flirting is exactly what they want 
Gotta keep my mind on the things that keep me going 
In the world we living it's easy to forget that we gotta 
Make the choices so we the future don't regret 
Ain't no runnin from the bitches that be up and commin' 
Gotta keep my mind on the things that keep me going 
No more, no more, no more, bitches 
No more, na na na, no more, bitches 
(I said no more bitches in my house tonight) 
Everybody knows we got them ups and downs 
Sunny days of winter through the stormy autumn clouds 
Even though that lust keep getting me aroused 
I know them bitches ain't the source of happiness or spouse 
Flockin' all around me day to day, dusk till dawn 
I know it ain't what's gonna give me strength to carry on 
In this crazy day to day that keep me up and running 
Gotta keep my mind on, things that keep me going 
No more, no more, no more, bitches, 
No more, na na na, no more, bitches 
(I said no more bitches in my house tonight) 
No more 
I said no more bitches in my house tonight 
No more... bitches
