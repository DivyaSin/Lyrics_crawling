Strobe lights beam create dreams 
Walls move minds do too 
On a warm San Franciscan night 
Old child young child feel alright 
On a warm San Franciscan night 
Angels sing leather wings 
Jeans of blue Harley Davidson's too 
On a warm San Franciscan night 
Old angels young angels feel alright 
On a warm San Franciscan night. I wasn't born there perhaps I'll die there 
There's no place left to go, San Franciscan. Cop's face is filled with hate 
Heavens above he's on a street called love 
When will they even learn 
Old cop young cop feel alright 
On a warm San Franciscan night 
The children are cool 
They don't raise fools 
It's an american dream 
Includes indians too
