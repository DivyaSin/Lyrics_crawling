One, two, three, four! For the love of a woman 
A man will do most anything 
For a love of a woman 
A man will do most anything 
Make him steal from his mother 
Just to buy her a diamond ring Well I love you, baby 
Like a schoolboy love his pie 
Well I love you, baby 
Like a schoolboy love his pie 
Well I love you so much, darlin' 
You make me want to cheat an' lie I've been lovin' you, baby 
Ever since I don't know when 
I've been lovin' you, baby 
Ever since I don't know when 
Oh, I love ya so much, darlin', yeah 
That I'm comin' right back again 
Come on!
