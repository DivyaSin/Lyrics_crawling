This is a Tensta thing, there's nothing more personal 
How I got it, how I lived, and now I write it down for ya 
Show you what my life is like, show you how we move it like 
Hopefully, ya gon' relate to what I'm speakin 'bout 
Cause what I heard when I was listening close 
What the people sayin on the corner where they shoppin everyday 
Right next to hoe, is we not working hard enough 
We not face to what we say 
Discrimination, racism, none of it's alive today 
My niggah, are you jokin with me, you behind that wall too 
You try to say that you ain't notice how they look at you 
You try to say that I ain't competent for this job 
Since to pay him over me, swedish name, blue eyes 
You probably right my niggah, they leavin' us plenty jobs 
Flippin' burgers, plus man you niggahs supersize 
This what they leavin us, we building it from there 
We got immigrants, single parents, drug dealers here, yeah Here's a Tensta thing, yo hold ya head upon my niggah 
Black, white, yellow, red, call it color blind my niggah 
We all up in the same bump gotta get to the stump 
So we can land on that beach everybody dreamin of 
For me this money pilin', nothing where my soul at 
I got it right here, you know I'd give it all back 
It's on my word, it's on my balls, it's on my life my niggah 
I keep it close to home so you know what it's like my niggah 
Invested in the kids, niggah got some nieces growing 
Plus I got my dudes, they all keep that reefer smoking 
I pull the curtains back, a everyday type of thing 
So light your blunts or whatever cause that's all right with me 
This is who we are, not how we're supposed to be 
Hey nothing changin' that ever, it's a Tensta thing 
This is who we are, not how we're supposed to be 
Hey nothing changin' that, you fuckers, it's a Tensta thing
