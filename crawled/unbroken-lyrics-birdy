Could you keep your head up? 
When you're losing ground 
Could you keep your head up? 
Everything you once loved 
Like your own blood 
Comes crumbling down 
Could you keep your head up? Sometimes the tears we cry 
Are more than any heart can take 
We hurt, just keep it inside 
Small wonder that it starts to break Many moons will lighten the way 
And sure this night will follow a day 
And everything you once loved remains 
Unbroken, unbroken Could you find a daydream? 
In the dead of night 
Could you find a daydream 
Keep a quiet victory 
To a whisper 
In an uphill fight 
Could you keep your head up Sometimes the tears we cry 
Are more than any heart can take 
We hurt, just keep it inside 
Small wonder that it starts to break Many moons will lighten the way 
And sure this night will follow a day 
And everything you once loved remains 
Unbroken, unbroken Everything you once loved lies unbroken 
Many moons will light us 
Many moons will guide us 
Everything you once loved lies unbroken 
Leave the past behind us 
Leave the past behind us Many moons will lighten the way 
And sure this night will follow a day 
And everything you once loved remains 
Unbroken, unbroken, unbroken
