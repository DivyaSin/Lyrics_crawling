We part for ever from today 
Farewell beloved one 
And I unto may death your way 
Will shun I care not now where you may go 
You can no more bereave me 
Today the sweetest girl I know 
Does leave me When the air still moves my curtain 
As it used in times of yore 
Moonlight down the lane just uncertain 
Only you come nevermore, come nevermore, come 
Only you come nevermore, come Nor shall I as in former years 
Build Spanish castles so high 
With starlit windows and with towers that reach the sky When, shivering with bitter cold 
Through winter nights uncertain 
I watched lest you perhaps unfold 
Your curtain Ohh, what delight to stroll with you 
Beneath that flowering trees 
When poured its light their branches through 
The moon When the air still moves my curtain 
As it used in times of yore 
Moonlight down the lane just uncertain 
Only you come nevermore, come nevermore, come 
Only you come nevermore, come That I might catch with rapturous thrill 
The words that you let fall 
And that today I barely still 
I barely still recall How often did I secretly pray 
Swift night her sails would furl 
That we might thus forever stray 
Fair girl When the air still moves my curtain 
As it used in times of yore 
Moonlight down the lane just uncertain 
Only you come nevermore, come nevermore, come 
Only you come nevermore, come
