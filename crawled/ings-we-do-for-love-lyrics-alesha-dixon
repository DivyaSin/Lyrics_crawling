Thought love was easy 
Thought if you gave it you'll get it back 
I must've been crazy 
Crazy for me to believe in that I heard all the stories, 
how love will come round and knock you off your feet, 
but nobody told me, 
that love would take so much of my energy. Why do I feel like I'm workin' on this 9 to 5? 
Always trynna keep the flame alive? 
Always trynna keep you satisfied 
All the things that we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
It never seems like it's enough What does it take to not be the only one to sacrifice? 
I can't do it on my own 
When your sitting on your thrown 
And I know that we all make mistakes 
But I don't know how much I can take anymore 
What is it for? Why do I feel like I'm workin' on this 9 to 5? 
Always trynna keep the flame alive? 
Always trynna keep you satisfied (the things we do) 
All the things that we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
It never seems like it's enough I accept all of the things that you're tell me baby 
Even love you slight? all the times that you kept me waiting 
I do it all for you 
Why does love make us do what we do? Why do I feel like I'm workin' on this 9 to 5? 
Always trynna keep the flame alive? 
Always trynna keep you satisfied 
All the things that we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
It never seems like it's enough Why do I feel like I'm workin' on this 9 to 5? 
Always trynna keep the flame alive? 
Always trynna keep you satisfied 
All the things that we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
The things we do for love (the things we do) 
It never seems like it's enough Never enough 
The things we do for love 
Hey yeah
