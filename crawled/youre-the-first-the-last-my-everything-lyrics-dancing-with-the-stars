My first, my last, my everything 
And the answer to all my dreams 
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star 
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are 
I know there's only, only one like you 
There's no way they could have made two 
You're all I'm living for, your love I'll keep for evermore 
You're the first, my last, my everything 
And with you I've found so many things 
A love so new, only you could bring 
Can't you see if you, you'll make me feel this way 
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day 
I see so many ways that I 
Can love you till the day I die 
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream 
You're my first, my last, my everything 
I know there's only, only one like you 
There's no way they could have made two 
Girl, you're my reality but I'm lost in a dream 
You're the first, you're the last, my everything
