Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around 
Well the trouble with up is there's always a down 
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk 
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks 
But the sun keeps setting and the days go fast 
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass 
And I can just feel it, I'm slipping away 
And babe, I can already say that As long as I live, whatever I do 
As great as it is you know what's a bummer 
I ain't never gonna beat this summer with you 
Baby, it's true 
The taste in your kiss is so bittersweet 
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you Before you know it it's all gonna stop 
They'll be rolling up windows and putting up tops 
Be a cold wind blowing and leaves through the air 
And you won't find a tan line anywhere 
Maybe I know that it ain't over yet 
So let's make the most of what we have left 
But it's hard living for this moment we're in 
Knowing it's all gonna end As long as I live, whatever I do 
As great as it is you know what's a bummer 
I ain't never gonna beat this summer with you 
Baby, it's true 
The taste in your kiss is so bittersweet 
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you Looking at you, girl, standing there, 
Got your wayfarer's on and the sun in your hair 
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in mind 
Bouncing around in my head 
And baby, I can tell As long as I live, whatever I do 
As great as it is you know what's a bummer 
I ain't never gonna beat this summer with you 
Baby, it's true 
The taste in your kiss is so bittersweet 
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you
