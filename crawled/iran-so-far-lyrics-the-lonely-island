They say true love only comes once in a lifetime 
and even though we're from opposite ends of the earth, my heart tells me you're the one for me. 
Mahmoud. I remember when it started, saw you on the news, 
you were hatin' gays, i was eatin' food. 
but I was feelin' you, and even though I disagreed with almost everythin' you said 
you ain't wrong to me, so strong to me, you belong to me, 
Like a very hairy Jake Gyllenhaal to me. 
Mahmoud, you make my heart beat right out of my chest 
my mind says no, but my body says yes 
Nuclear threat, the only threat I see 
is the threat of you not comin' home with me 
Our love for each other's like when atoms collide 
Can't express how I feel 
Ay yo Adam let's ride And Iran, Iran so far away 
It's your home, but in my heart you'll stay He ran, for the president of Iran 
we ran together to a tropical island 
my Man, Mahmoud is known for rilin' 
smiling, if he can still do it then I can 
they call you weasel, they say your methods are medieval 
you can play the Jews I can be your Jim Caviezel 
S&M, nestlin' when we're wrestlin' 
You can be the port that I park my vessel in 
So I try to mute the tv but you can still see me 
with your sleepy brown eyes, butter pecan thighs 
And your hairy butt ... 
Yeah. And Iran, Iran so far away 
come home, and in my arms you'll stay Used to look at the stars and dream 
round the world same stars were seen 
And a twinkle in your eyes, Mahmoud 
Talk smooth to me, without a tie 
your pants high waisted, damn so fly 
We can take a trip to the animal zoo 
and laugh at all the funny things that animals do 
Like Eugene (Levy) you got me straight trippin' boo 
hope you look in my eyes and say I'm trippin' too 
you say Iran don't have the bomb but they already do 
you should know by know, it's you And Iran, Iran so far away 
It's your home, but in my heart you'll stay You're crazy for this one Mahmoud 
you can deny the holocaust all you want 
but you can't deny that there's something between us 
I know you say there's no gays in Iran 
but you're in New York now, baby 
it's time to stop hiding, 
and start living.
