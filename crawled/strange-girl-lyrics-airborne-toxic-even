It was an old song, 
From "Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me" that she sang. 
It was an old line, 
I kept with me, with me, with me when she rang You're such a strange girl, 
You're such a strange, strange girl. 
You're such a strange girl. It's all been embraced (?) 
Everyone is telling me, 
It's slightly deranged, 
Everyone is telling me. We traded blindness for wisdom 
And some lines around the eyes. 
But you just act like it was a fact of life 
It didn't come as a surprise. You're such a strange girl, 
You're such a strange, strange girl. 
You're such a strange girl. And no you can't ever go home. 
Everything has changed and the people are gone. 
So close your eyes and summon up the song 
And you feel your life falling under you like a slide 
Like a slide It was an old song, 
I once knew every note and every line. 
It was a long night, 
When I carried you and you carried me for a time. You're such a strange girl, 
You're such a strange, strange girl. 
You're such a strange girl. It's all been embraced (?) 
Everyone is telling me, 
It's slightly deranged, 
Everyone is telling me. I dreamt of your face 
And what the song was telling me 
For time has made it all obscene 
And trapped us in our dreams
