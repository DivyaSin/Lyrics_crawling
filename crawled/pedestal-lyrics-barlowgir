You're the coolest person 
That I have ever seen 
So perfect with your pretty face 
On the T-V screen You're a god I know it 
How you stand above them all 
You are my perfect person 
Man I'd hate to see you fall [Chorus] 
I want someone to believe in 
Yeah well don't we all 
In this life of imperfection 
I need someone who won't fall Got a magazine today 
That was full of you 
Shocked to read the words they said 
Tell me they're not true Add you to my fallen list 
One more has hit the ground 
The fault was mine 
I held you too high 
Your only way was down [Chorus] I can't deny this need inside 
I have to find the perfect one 
But I wonder if behind my need 
There might just be a reason Is my life just one big searching 
For the one I can adore? 
It never works 
And I'm just left here wanting more Could it be this hunger's there 
To drive me to the one 
Who's worthy of all worship? 
Would my searching then be done? [Chorus]
