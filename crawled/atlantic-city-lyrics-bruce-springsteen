Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night 
Now they blew up his house too 
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready 
For a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state 
And the D.A. can't get no relief 
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and 
The gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth Well now everything dies baby that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty 
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City Well I got a job and tried to put my money away 
But I got debts that no honest man could pay 
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust 
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus Now baby everything dies baby that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty 
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City Now our luck may have died and out love may be cold 
But with you forever I'll stay 
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold 
Put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold 
And maybe everything dies that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find 
Down here it's just winners and losers 
And don't get caught on the wrong side of that line 
Well I'm tired of comin' out on this losin' end 
So honey last night I met this guy 
And I'm gonna do a little favor for him Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
Fix your hair up nice, fix yourself up pretty
