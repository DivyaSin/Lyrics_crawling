Good girls go to heaven 
Bad boys go to hell 
And I believe in miracles 
That's what my Jesus said Rich man lives in whorehouse 
They were always built on sin 
But I swear to God that I will tell the truth 
If I only knew what it was On your own with a bad boy smile 
Mama, kickin' dust around you 
On your own with a bad boy smile 
I'm living my life without you Good girls go to heaven 
Bad boys go to hell 
And I believe in miracles 
That's what my Jesus said Rich man lives in whorehouse 
They were always built on sin 
But I swear to God that I will tell the truth 
If I only knew what it was On your own with a bad boy smile 
Mama, kickin' dust around you 
On your own with a bad boy smile 
Living my life without you One day I found my friend 
But the old-man didn't know 
He prayed to the lord and asked him why 
He gave him a son like this Father couldn't? realize 
And that really made me blue 
Going down on the road to paradise 
With a six pack getting drunk On your own with a bad boy smile 
Mama, kickin' dust around you 
On your own with a bad boy smile 
Living my life without you Good girls go to heaven 
Bad boys go to hell 
And I believe in miracles 
That's what my Jesus said Rich man lives in whorehouse 
They were always built on sin 
But I swear to God that I will tell the truth 
If I only knew what it was On your own with a bad boy smile 
Mama, kickin' dust around you 
On your own with a bad boy smile 
Living my life without you On your own with a bad boy smile 
Mama, kickin' dust around you 
On your own with a bad boy smile 
Living my life without you
