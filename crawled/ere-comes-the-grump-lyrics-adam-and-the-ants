When you get a number one 
The only way is down 
And if you have a sticky patch 
They start looking, start looking around Listen close to what men say 
Take what you want 
And throw the rest away When you get a number one 
The only way is down 
And if you have a sticky patch 
They start looking, start looking around In the night when things go bump 
Think of me think 
Here comes the grump, here comes the grump
