We're a couple of misfits 
We're a couple of misfits 
What's the matter with misfits 
That's where we fit in! 
We're not daffy and dilly 
Don't go 'round willy nilly 
Seems to us kinda silly 
That we don't fit in. 
We may be different from the rest 
Who decides the test 
Of what is really best? 
We're a couple of misfits

Why am I such a misfit? 
I am not just a nit wit! 
I'm an adorable reindeer 
Why don't I fit in? 
Why am I such a misfit? 
I am not just a nit wit! 
They can't fire me. 
I quit! 
Seems I don't fit in 
We may be different from the rest

Of what is really best?
