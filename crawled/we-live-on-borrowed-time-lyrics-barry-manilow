I never thought there could be a love like yours and mine 
I never dreamed that I would see the day that I would find 
A love that feels so right, but here we are tonight 
And now the only thing we really need is time We live on borrowed time 
No one can be sure when the loan will finally come due 
But I'm loving all of mine, I know what time is for, 
I've borrowed it so I can spend it all right here with you There was a time when I believed that life held guarantees 
There was a time when I was sure my future was secure, 
But life had other plans, the future's in God's hands 
And knowing that just makes me love you even more We live on borrowed time 
Yesterday is past, tomorrow seems a million miles away 
But I promise you that I'm gonna make love last 
By living every moment, every hour, every day Now we may have a year, or we may have a lifetime, 
No one can be certain what the future will allow, 
But you and I are here, and this time is the right time 
'Cause one thing that I know is that we have each other now, and now, And we live on borrowed time 
Let's celebrate and sing as we walk bravely into the unknown 
'Cause we're gonna be just fine, whatever life may bring, 
We'll face it all together and we'll never be alone 
We may not have forever, but our time will be our own.
