Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm 
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm I've got something I 
Need to talk to you about 
Dealin' with your relationship 
And the things you do See, what I can't understand, uh 
Is how you call yourself a man 
When you don't treat your women right 
And you think everything is cool How you gonna set up a date with her 
And just stand her up and try 
To come up the right excuse why 
Till she tells in your lie She don't even tell you about when 
You do things to hurt her feelings 
All she does is hold it inside 
Then she calls me up and cries Even though (Even though) 
You may not think so 
She really cares for you 
And will be there for you (Ooh, ooh) But even though (Even though) 
She may not say so 
If you don't get it together (Together) 
She'll look for someone better I don't wanna make it seem like 
I'm just checkin' up on you 
But is she decides to leave 
I promise you'll be questionin' in me Askin' me where she at and 
If she found another man and 
If I try to get her back 
Will she be willin' to give me another chance, yeah Now if you was handlin' business 
You wouldn't have to worry about this 
And you and I wouldn't even 
Be havin' this talk right now I don't care what you gotta say or do 
So make it better 'cause I know that you 
Know that I know 
That she ain't someone you want to lose Even though (Even though) 
You may not think so (No) 
She really cares for you (She cares for you, oh) 
And will be there for you (There for you) But even though (Even though) 
She may not say so (She may not say so) 
If you don't get it together (Get it together) 
She'll look for someone better (Yeah, yeah, yeah, 
yeah, oh) So what I'm sayin', just stop playin' 
And make sure you treat her right 
If you don't she'll be gone 
And you'll be the reason why If you love her then you better 
Find some way to let her know 
'Cause I would hate to have to be the one 
To say I told you so Even though {Oh, yeah} 
You may not think so {Yeah, yeah,, yeah} 
She really cares for you 
And will be there for you (Said even though) But even though
