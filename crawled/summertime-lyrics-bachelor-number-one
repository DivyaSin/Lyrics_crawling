And I'm here to free your mind 
Kick off your shoes the blues and use anything but your mind 
'Cause this is the summertime

Leave today don't fall behind Try something new, turn into you if only for a short time 
And feel your head recline 
Kick off your shoes , the blues and use anything but your mind
