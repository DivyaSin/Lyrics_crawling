Sleeping single in a double bed 
Thinking over things I wish I'd said 
I should have held you but I let you go 
Now I'm the one sleeping all alo-oh-one 
Sleeping single in a double bed (ooh-oo-ooh) 
Tossing, turning, trying to forget (ahh-ah) 
I could be lying with you instead 
I'm sleeping single in a double bed 
I'd pour me a drink, but I'd only be sorry 
'Cause drinking doubles alone, don't make it a par-arty 
Another sleepless night and it's the same old stor-ory 
When you're the only one at two in the morning 
I-I'm sleeping single in a double bed (ooh-oo-ooh) 
Thinking over things I wish I'd said (ahh-ah) 
I should have held you but I let you go 
Now I'm the one sleeping all alo-oh-one 
Sleeping single in a double bed 
Tossing, turning, trying to forget (you-ou) 
I could by lying with you instead 
I'm sleeping single in a double bed 
I'm sleeping single in a double bed (ah-hah-ah) 
Thinking over things I wish I'd said (ooh-ooh) 
I should have held you but I let you go 
Now I'm the one sleeping all alo-oh-one 
Sleeping single in a double bed (ah-hah-ah) 
Tossing, turning, trying to forget (you-ou) 
I could be lying with you instead 
I'm sleeping single in a double bed 
I-I'm sleeping single in a double bed 
Thinking over things I wish I'd said (fade)
