get out of the city if it hurts 
you're too blind, move it over 
try to get closer to the lifestyles of the gluttons 
seem so seamless and perfect 
i've been the secret that you've been keeping 
ears to the wall, eyes on the prize 
see that you've made a mistake 
and we all know what you've done here 
dear interceptor, i've been waiting 
show me something, hold the phone, we've found an answer 
full moons and minor keys to get there faster 
mirror, mirror, see this as clear as crystalline 
secondhand interpreter 
the spoken word for change 
wait for me, i wanted to feel this safe 
i can't hear you scream, hold the phone to make it better 
i can't hear you scream, i wanted to feel this safe 
i can't hear you 
blood to the beat, this thirst of the lion can't be quenched by 
cigarette strewn cubicle air 
dear diluted, while you're dreaming 
show me something, hold the phone, we've found an answer 
full moons and minor keys to get there faster 
mirror, mirror see this as clear as crystalline 
secondhand interpreter 
the spoken word for change 
wait for me, i wanted to feel this safe. 
i can't hear you scream, hold the phone to make it better 
deep into the red we need a change 
just look at this cardboard cutout 
this puppet that you've become 
let me be the first to acknowledge 
you've no pride, you've no purpose 
it's so typical to think less is more 
when you're out of the lead 
don't hurt yourself, settle for less 
it's so typical to think less is more 
when you're out of the lead 
secondhand interpreter 
the spoken word for change. 
wait for me, i wanted to feel this safe 
i can't hear you, hold the phone, we've found an answer
