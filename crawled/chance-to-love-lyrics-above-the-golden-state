Why would I bother speaking if my words weren't meant to share? 
Why would I bother breathing if my lungs don't need the air? 
Why would my heart keep drumming on if there's no will here to live? I don't wanna give up 'cause today's a chance to love 
I don't wanna give up 'cause today's a chance to love Why do I search for romance if my heart is made of stone? 
Why should I fight for freedom if the war is far from home? 
Why do I search for meaning here if there's no means to the end? I don't wanna give up 'cause today's a chance to love 
I don't wanna give up 'cause today's a chance to love Yesterday is like the fog at death grips with the sun 
And today redemption's at the mercy of the dawn Why does my God still trust me when I've run away from Him? 
Why does my God come save me from the sins that I commit? 
Why would He send His only Son if we could live without love? I don't wanna give up 'cause today's a chance to love 
I don't wanna give up 'cause today's a chance to love I don't wanna give up 'cause today's a chance to love 
I don't wanna give up 'cause today's a chance to love And today's a chance to love 
And today redemption's at the mercy of the dawn
