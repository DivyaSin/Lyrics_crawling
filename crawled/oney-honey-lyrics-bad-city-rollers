Money-can't make you turn your head now 
Money-can't get you into bed now 
Money 
Honey-can't give more than you get now. Money Honey you aint' got no respect 
But I like to watch you just to see what you can get 
And Money Honey gets you breakfast in bed 
And Money Honey 
oh you drive me out my head. Living like a princess with a frown 
Giving-l can't afford to cry on 
Money 
Honey 
hey 
girl come on 
don't bring me down. Money Honey you ain't got no respect . . . Money-must it buy all I can get now 
Money-without it how far will I get now 
Money 
Honey 
holt it you'd be losing my respect now. Money Honey you ain't got no respect . . .
