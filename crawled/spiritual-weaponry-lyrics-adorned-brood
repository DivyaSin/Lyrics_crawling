This light that I see deep inside 
Songs from Valhalla they come 
Spiritual weaponry I'm tired, the end is close 
One more night and my live is done 
Spiritual weaponry The sun creeps under the shadows in gray 
Coldness is my torment 
This is the beginning of an eternal trip This is the way to my last battle 
My life fly's away 
For death embraces my last wish The desire to get more 
I'm weak but I'm a warrior 
I'm gonna fight for my honor and land The last blood in my veins 
Flows for you Wotan 
I swear yes, I swear yes 
I swear for you Wotan
