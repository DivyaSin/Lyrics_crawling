I don't buy everything I read 
I haven't even read everything I've bought 
I don't cry every time I bleed 
My eyes are dry but they're bloodshot I have faith in medications 
I believe in the Prozac nation 
You play doctor 
But I've lost patience 
This is where it ends 
This is where it ends [Chorus] 
Call the police and call the press 
But please dear god don't tell my friends 
This is where it ends 
This is where it ends Where's my pride where's my self esteem 
Does is show in the drinks I've bought 
I don't hide every time I'm seen 
But I try not to get caught. Make excuses for behavior 
Can my illness be my savior 
Hid my heart while you still gave yours 
This is where it ends 
This is where it ends [Chorus] She says she wants to live in a movie 
I say I want someone else,to stand behind me and write it all down. 
Cause I can't be bothered doing it myself, 
And I don't want the responsibility of proving it's importance. I have loved and I have waited 
Been picked up and been sedated 
Metal health is overrated 
This is where it ends 
This is where it ends [Chorus]
