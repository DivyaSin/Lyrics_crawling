Please tell me what is takin' place, 
'cause I can't seem to find a trace, 
Guess it must have got erased somehow, 
Probably 'cause I always forget, 
Everytime someone tells me their name, 
It's always gotta be the same. 
(In my World) 
Never wore cover-up, 
Always beat the boys up, 
Grew up in a five thousand population town, 
Made my money by cutting grass, 
Got fired by fried chicken ass, 
All in a small town, Napanee. You know I always stay up without sleepin', 
And think to myself, 
Where do I belong forever, 
In whose arms, the time and place? [Chorus:] 
Can't help it if I space in a daze, 
My eyes tune out the other way, 
I may switch off and go in a daydream, 
In this head my thoughts are deep, 
But sometimes I can't even speak, 
Will someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World I never spend less than an hour, 
Washin' my hair in the shower, 
It always takes five hours to make it straight, 
So I'll braid it in a zillion braids, 
Though it may take a friggin' day, 
There's nothin' else better to do anyway. When you're all alone in the lands of forever, 
Lay under the milky way, 
On and on it's getting too late out, 
I'm not in love this time this night. [Chorus:] 
Can't help it if I space in a daze, 
My eyes tune out the other way, 
I may switch off and go in a daydream, 
In this head my thoughts are deep, 
But sometimes I can't even speak, 
Will someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World (la la la la) Take some time, 
Mellow out, 
Party up, 
I don't fall down, 
Don't get caught, 
Sneak out of the house. [Chorus:] 
Can't help it if I space in a daze, 
My eyes tune out the other way, 
I may switch off and go in a daydream, 
In this head my thoughts are deep, 
But sometimes I can't even speak, 
Will someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World Can't help it if I space in a daze, 
My eyes tune out the other way, 
I may switch off and go in a daydream, 
In this head my thoughts are deep, 
But sometimes I can't even speak, 
Will someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World
