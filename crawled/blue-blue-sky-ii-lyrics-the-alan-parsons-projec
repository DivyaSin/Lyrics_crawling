(bairnson) I only know what I can see 
So I imagine what could be 
Where the horizon cuts the air 
Look for me out there Someday I'll touch the blue blue sky 
Someday I'll touch the blue blue sky If I could kiss the earth goodbye 
And cruse the never ending sky 
Where the horizon cuts the air 
Wait for me down there Someday I'll touch the blue blue sky 
Someday I'll touch the blue blue sky Vocal eric stewart
