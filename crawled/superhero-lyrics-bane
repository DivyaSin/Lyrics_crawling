she rolls her eyes 
and lights another 
"one day i'll quit these things, 
they're killing me." 
she blows her brains 
right out her fucking mouth 
i just don't know how you do it well, there is nothing in me 
that you don't have 
deep within your fucking self 
well, there is nothing in me 
that you do not have 
deep within your fucking self yes, the body is weak 
but the mind is stronger 
it controls the body 
you are not a slave. and i am not a superhero!
