It`s more than three years ago 
but it`s like the first day 
When I got you to know 
I just thought please stay. 
There was just your hand 
That took me 
And you said come on 
Let`s try 
We met sometimes aand 
Drank some coffee 
And when you said goodye 
You said: Take care of you 
Whatever you do 
Take care of youI think of you 
When you heard the words 
I love you 
You were afraid you lose 
Your freedom 
But soon you said youLove me too 
Words you never said 
But you agreed them
