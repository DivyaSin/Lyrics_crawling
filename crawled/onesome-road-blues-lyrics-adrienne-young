Lonesome Road Blues I walked on down that lonesome line 
Hung my head and I cried 
I wept and I cried under a willow tree 
Out by the deep blue sea 
My mama, my dear papa can be found, 
And my brother on a county road 
Now I been down that long plank walk, 
I?m on my way back home You cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan 
You cause me to leave my home 
I cried last night and the night before 
I swear I won?t cry anymore Your fast mail train comin round that track 
Killed my brown eyed boy 
They took him down that smokey track 
Brought him back on a cooling board 
Now I?m lookin down that lonesome line 
Just as far as I care to see 
I have no money lost my brown eyed boy 
These blues won?t set me free
