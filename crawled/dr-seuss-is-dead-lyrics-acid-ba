A cloud of flies obscure the sun 
A stone is dropped the dream undone 
Ripples grow and ride the tide 
The dead thing crawls from deep inside 
With its dying sour breath 
The burning smell of insect flesh 
Hungry things in circles crowd 
Around TV's turned up too loud 
We are the dead next door 
Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor 
Taste the light inject the lord 
I cut myself again because I'm so fuckin' bored 
The dream is swirling, I'm alone 
Where the streets are paved with bone 
Buildings with a hundred eyes 
Watch me thru the swarming flies 
Behind shades pulled down tight 
Things are growing without light 
Hungry things in circles crowd 
Around TV's turned up to loud 
The dream sea has been poisoned 
The stop light splashes me red 
Innocence suffocated in its sleep 
Dr. Seuss is dead
