I'm a lone rhinoceros 
There ain't one hell of a lots of us left in this world I stand alone in my concrete cell 
Where people stare and toss me coke cans 
I guess it's better than being poached 
But I'd give my horn just to see my homeland I'm a lone rhinoceros 
There ain't one hell of a lots of us 
I'm a lone rhinoceros 
There ain't one hell of a lots of us left in this world They say I am ugly, call me a beast 
I hear them snicker when I'm half asleep 
Is beauty such a big commodity 
I always heard it was only so deep
