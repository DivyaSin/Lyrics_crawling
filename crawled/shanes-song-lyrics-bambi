All these feelings 
Building up in me 
Driving me insane 
Making me crazy 
And never have i 
Felt so alone 
Where i don't feel the warmth 
Inside my home 
I used to have ur shoulder to lean on 
But somehow 
U pulled it away 
What do i do now 
Then i came to see 
What i didn't want to believe 
That you 
Were never there for me I needed u 
Beside me 
But u just 
Denied me 
Of that feeling 
Or love 
I wanted you to 
Hold me 
But instead u 
Just told me 
U were busy 
So i had enough 
And now i'm gettin up my strength 
Changin my love for u to hate 
And mending up my heart 
So i can move on I'm independent 
Don't need you 
'cause i can see through 
All ur bullshit 
I've had enough of that 
And i don't want to 
Belong to 
Anyone 
Especially u 
When u dont have the decency to call 
Pick me up if i fall 
Or even pretend 
Like u care 
I'm outta here
