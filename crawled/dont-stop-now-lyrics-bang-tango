Get the message 
Get it right 
What you got 
Want to give it a try 
You take it easy 
You make it hard 
One chance for a good, good cause 
She walked up to me and tried to tell me 
That what I'm doing is not so fine 
I'll tell you something baby, where you're 
Headed 
Through that door 
You're gonna do you time 
Get it up, get it out, push it up, spit it out 
It does on and on and it won't stop now 
Get it up, get it out, push it up, spit it out 
It goes on and on and it won't slow (the lyrics have "ston") down 
Get it up, get it out, push it up, spit it out 
It goes on and on 
Don't slow down 
Lock you door 
Lock you door 
Slam it tight 
Hit the floor because I might bite 
You take it easy 
You make it hard 
One chance for a good, good cause 
You crawled up to me and tried to tell me 
That what I'm doing is not so fine 
I'll tell you something baby, start your 
Praying 
Because right here now we're going to 
Draw that line 
Get it up, get it out, push it up, spit it out 
It goes on and on 
Don't slow down 
Get it up, get it out, push it up, spit it out 
It goes on and on 
She walked up to me 
And tried to sell me 
Something baby that you know I can't buy 
Say it right now while you're begging 
There's no second chance 
It's you last try 
Get it up, get it out, push it up, spit it out 
It goes on and on and it won't slow down 
Get it up, get it out, push it up, spit it out 
It goes on and on and it won't slow down 
Get it up, get it out, push it up, spit it out 
It goes on and on 
Don't slow down 
Get it up, get it out, push it up, spit it out
