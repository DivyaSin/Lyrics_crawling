Nobody knows where she came from 
The tall-and-tanned-young-and-lovely girl 
With a voice as light as air 
Nobody knows but no one cares 
'Cause everybody loves her 
When she signs makes you dream a fairy tale With a certain smile She can make you feel so nice 
Saying gently "Goodbye sadness" 
Still will break your heart Listen to her once 
You'll feel lucky she was there 
One note samba would never be the same Where is she now the lovely girl 
With the softest voices you ever heard 
Asking fly me to the moon 
I know I'll find her in the sun of Copacabana 
Meditating 
Her lonely heart is nothing new With a certain smile She can make you feel so nice 
Saying gently "Goodbye sadness" 
Still will break your heart Listen to her once 
You'll feel lucky she was there 
One note samba would never be the same 
Never be the same Listen to her once 
You'll feel lucky she was there 
One note samba would never be Nobody knows where she came from 
The tall-and-tanned-young-and-lovely girl 
With a voice as light as air 
Nobody knows but no one cares 
'Cause everybody loves her 
When she signs makes you dream a fairy tale
