Go tell the sheriff, John Roland Wood's found Jesus 
Now he's living at the foot of the cross 
He testified on the main drag this evening 
Said he's gonna spread the gospel to the lost The meanest sinner to ever live and breathe 
Said he's been clean and sober for a week 
He said his soul is not troubled anymore 
He hocked his gun and gave the money to the Lord Go tell the sheriff, John Roland Wood's found Jesus 
At a tent revival right outside of town 
Oh, what a friend this town has in Jesus 
If you look at what John Roland has tore down Before the spirit touched his soul 
He kept the streets signs full of bullet holes 
Back then when he was raising hell 
You knew he was coming by the blue lights on his tail, look out Go tell the sheriff, John Roland Wood's found Jesus 
Now that water tower must be full of wine 
Let not your weary heart be troubled 
Turn your women and your children back outside What will we do on Friday nights 
Without John Roland shootin' out the lights 
Carry that ol' jukebox away 
He traded be-9 for 'Amazing Grace' Go tell the sheriff, John Roland Wood's found Jesus 
Now he is living at 
I said he's living at the foot of 
He's living at the foot of the cross, oh yeah
