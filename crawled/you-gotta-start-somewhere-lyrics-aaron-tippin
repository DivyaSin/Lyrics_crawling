Ever since that night you walked out 
I just ain't been the same ol' me 
I've barely had the strength 
To leave the couch to turn on my TV But a man can't hide away forever 
And last night I finally told me so 
I knew I had to get out 
But I knew I had to take it slow So I burned down this town 
A honky tonk at a time 
I got loud and checked out 
Every cute little cowgirl I could hold Getting over you is still a long ways away 
I swear 
Last night was one small step 
But you gotta start somewhere Think I feel a little better 
A little more like the man I used to be 
I ain't saying that I'm there yet 
But I can see some possibilities When your motor ain't been fired up lately 
You can't just jam it in gear and go 
I know I'm still not up to speed 
But last night I had to test the road
