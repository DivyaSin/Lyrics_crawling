Check it out y'all... 
This is Aceyalone on the microphone 
and we got my nigga Punish on the beatbox 
and we gonna show you how WE does it... Anywhere you go 
I am going to find you 
And every time you flow 
I'll be right behind you 
Just to let you know and 
constantly remind you 
You can never be as dope as I am 
God-damn Now I know you hate it when the MC ain't fly 
So I come in the party live 
Chopping rappers down to size 
I know em when I see em cause they got that look in their eyes 
Surprise 
Aceyalone has arrived 
They surround around the microphone like shit attracts flies 
I arise 
The Thai gets me high 
I find him, stand right behind him and I spy 
No more than two tries; either freaks it or you die 
I waited; somebody stated "He's intimidated" 
I was faded; I played it like any other brother would've played it 
Nut soon as I grabbed the microphone I went into a frenzy 
Started givin niggaz black eyes like Spuds Mackenzie 
when that bud's in me 
Now one of these niggaz tried to tell me my shit was hopeless 
His homeboy was on the other side sayin "Man your shit's the dopest" 
All of a sudden another rapper pushed his way through the crowd 
Came and stood in front of me and told me he was proud 
Then he bowed, told me that he liked the way I styled 
I thanked him, I smiled 
then I had to be out Anywhere you go 
I am going to find you 
And every time you flow 
I'll be right behind you 
Just to let you know and 
constantly remind you 
You can never be as dope as I am 
God-damn Now I'ma give shout out to all the dope MC's in the world... 
y'all know who you are You know I got the kinda style that everybody yearns 
I mic check; I break a niggaz nectar like Kerns 
Cause you are a worm, you are a germ 
and you are about to be stepped on 
so you should be concerned 
iIf you have a perm then it's permanent 
It's affirmative you will burn 
Make a right turn turn 
then a left turn 
then a you-turn turn 
Come all the way back, return 
Stand stern and maybe you just might learn 
about the firm 
I used to be a sperm -- shoot 
got derm 
Nobody better not squirm 
til my meeting is adjourned 
Okay I'm through 
And I rock from here to Peru 
Vern 
I could've sworn you knew 
that AC's having a rap sale 
you want to buy 1 or 2? 
or 3 or 4 or 5 
or 6 or 7 or 8 
or 9 or 10 or 11 
or 12 or 13 or 14? 
Cause me and the mic are courting 
My circuit breaker's shorting 
My memory is aborting 
I can barely remember this flow 
but wack MC's ya still got another zillion miles or so to go Anywhere you go 
I am going to find you 
And every time you flow 
I'll be right behind you 
Just to let you know and 
constantly remind you 
You can never be as dope as I am 
God-damn They pushed that rapper in front of the train 
Took him to the doctor sewed his arm on again 
Stabbed that rapper right in his heart 
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start 
and then he stopped; he started again 
he forted bounced it and vomited 
Now you know who's the dominant dog 
that got to be given you that rhyme style 
man child, locked in the promised land 
I'ma stand in the middle of an open hand 
that's extensive 
Cause I don't flow religously or relentlessly 
for innocent-minded-ticity 
Okay I win and the battle's like over 
Got a satellite Rover 
with a rocket telescopic sprocket pocket pulley 
and a fully automatic stun gun cause I'm a bully 
My hair was wooly I'm a muillion 
a calmer Jeffrey Dahmer hater 
I'm greater than the latest greatest innovators 
can go to hell, cause I say this so well 
You can whistle my melody or noel 
You're still gonna get the Speak n Spell 
I get my ink from inkwell 
my paper from the trees 
I swell up when I eat MCs 
so eat these 
and stand at attention 
did I forget to mention 
my classes aren't expensive 
That's if you are an uncomprehensive 
Defensive sensitive 
toy rapper 
Little boy rapper 
Momma's wittle wappin man wapper 
Now you got me reachin for my zapper 
I'll cut you off with a clapper 
But that's for old gentlemen 
who drink coffee with cinnamon, it'll take ten of them 
Then again did I mention I'm potent 
Totin holdin reloadin votin 
with my channel changer fool 
and since I don't speak Greek stranger 
I'ma give it to you in layman's terms so you'll learn... Anywhere you go 
I am going to find you 
And every time you flow 
I'll be right behind you 
Just to let you know and 
constantly remind you 
You can never be as dope as I am 
God-damn
