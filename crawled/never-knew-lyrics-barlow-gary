I found the road to nowhere 
The greener grass it turned to stone 
Your shadowed face shines a rainbow now 
The sign I found it pointed home Never knew that I'd miss you this way 
Never knew that pain could survive here inside 
Never knew that I'd miss you this much 
I'm reaching out to touch, I'm calling out for love I only walked to breathe again 
I felt the walls were falling down 
Caught a busy train to freedom 
Now here I stand in this lonely town Never knew that I'd miss you this way 
Never knew that pain could survive here inside 
Never knew that I'd miss you this much 
I'm reaching out to touch, I'm calling out for love
