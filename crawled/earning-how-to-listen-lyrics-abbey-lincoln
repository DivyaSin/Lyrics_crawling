Life is like a song to sing 
with measured beats and phrases 
With bended notes and some repeats 
music through the ages 
that brings the highs, the lows, the swells 
sometimes it's for an ending 
bringing other songs to sing 
ascending, descending Learning how to listen 
how to hear a melody 
how to hear the song I'm singing 
how to feel and let it be 
and listen to the song 
knowing how it goes 
and listen for the melody that flows Music is a lover 
with shiny golden wings 
that whispers in the lovers' ears 
and dances when it sings 
and sings in variations 
on an everlasting theme 
it's either love or sorrow on the scene I'm learning how to listen 
for the songs I name and sign, 
and claim as a possession, 
and say that they are mine. 
'Cause every body knows 
that songs come from out of the blue, 
and I'm learning how to hear 
[the changes too. I'm learning how to listen 
to the rhythm of the night. 
How to keep it simple, 
how to make it sweet and light. 
Smooth and free and easy 
or slammin' in a jam 
and know for just a moment 
the music that I am. I'm learning how to listen, 
how to holler, sing the blues. 
I'm learning how to rise above 
and wear somebody's shoes. 
Learning how to listen 
for the song was given me. 
I'm learning how to listen and be free. I'm learning how to listen, 
how to hear a melody 
how to hear the song I'm singing 
how to feel and let it be, 
and listen to the song 
knowing how it goes 
and listen for the melody that flows 
and listen for the melody that flows.
