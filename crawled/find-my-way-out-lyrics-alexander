Angel can you feel my heart beating all the way home 
Cast the nets, we can't take anymore regrets on board I've got to get out of this storm 
I've got to get out of this storm 
It's swallowed me once before 
I've got to get out of this storm I'll find my way out, my way out 
I'll find my way out, my way out Abandon ship, we're sinking down into loneliness on our own 
Rest your head, We'll sleep down on the sea bed forever we know 
Forever we know I've got to get out of this storm 
I've got to get out of this storm 
It's swallowed me once before 
I've got to get out I'll find my way out, my way out 
I'll find my way out, my way out 
I'll find my way out, my way out 
Of here and I know, that this feelings gotta go I'll find my way out, my way out 
I'll find my way out, my way out 
I'll find my way out, my way out 
Of here and I know, that this feelings gotta go 
Of here and I know, that this feelings gotta go
