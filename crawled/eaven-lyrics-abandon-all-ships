I should have known 
That your wings were sewn 
Fell down from his throne 
Sins heavy as stone 
Youll die alone Ill break from the chains 
Come down from the sky 
Call me insane 
But my life or yours 
Ill break from the chains 
Come down from sky 
But my life or yours 
Id rather fucking die I know you ment well 
But your love is not kind 
I bet burning in hell 
Was not on your mind Fly with me 
To the place where angels go Ill break from the chains 
Come down from the sky 
Call me insane 
But my life or yours 
Ill break from the chains 
Come down from sky 
But my life or yours 
Id rather fucking die Id rather spend and eternity in hell 
Then go to heaven without you I should have known 
That your wings were sewn 
Fell down from his throne 
Sins heavy as stone 
Youll die alone To the place where angela go
