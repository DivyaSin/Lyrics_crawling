(dieter bohlen) 
Producer for bonnie: dieter bohlen Paradise is here my love, with you by my side 
Now until forever, till the end of time 
I wished upon a thousand stars, someday you I'd find 
I'm living for you baby, you'll always be mine 
I m searching for you baby 
Drowning in your love 
No I'll never give it up *oh I climb every mountain 
And I cross every sea 
To lay in your arms for eternity 
Sail every ocean 
To capture your heart 
To be in your arms 
Never to be apart ** I climb every mountain - to be with you 
I cross every sea - to be with you 
I'm here for you darling 
You belong to me Since you won my heart, my love 
I've never been the same 
I need your love to feed it 
Like a flower needs the rain 
Somethings, they will never change 
Babe, you know it's true 
I live for you only, it's all that I can do 
Waiting for you baby 
Hungry for your love 
No I'll never get enough *repeat ** repeat
