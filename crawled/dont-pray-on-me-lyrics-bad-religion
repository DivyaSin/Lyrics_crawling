A grizzly scene on my electron beam 
Told a story about human rights 
So all of Kings horses and all of Kings men 
Had a riot for two days and nights 
Well, the city exploded but the gates wouldn't open 
So the company asked him to quit 
Now everybody's equal 
Just don't measure it Well Hanson did it hester 
And Mark David did it to John 
And maybe Jack dit it to Marilyn 
But he did it to South Vietnam 
For beauty and glory 
For money, love and country 
Now everybody's doing it, 
Don't do that to me A bitter debate and a feminine fate 
Fly in tandem like two precious babes 
While the former gets warmer it's the latter that matters 
Except on the nation's airwaves 
And custodians of public opinion stay back after vainly discussing her rights 
Lay hands off her body 
It's not your fucking life Now I don't know what stopped Jesus Christ 
From turning every hungry stone into bread 
And I don't remember hearing how Moses reacted 
When the innocent first born sons lay dead 
Well I guess God was a lot more demonstrative 
Back when he Flamboyantly parted the sea 
Now everybody's praying 
Don't prey on me
