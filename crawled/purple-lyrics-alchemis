Looking in the corner of a magic round room 
Trying to find the bottom of the top 
From the imbetweenal plane Ultraviolet craniums glowing with seductive scent 
The circus now surrounds me, attractive but obscene 
I do not understand me, can you repeat me please? A strange and distant melody, provoking an absurdity 
Opaque, my existence from the end to the start 
Numbing creation but creatively inspired 
I do not understand me, can you repeat me please? Particles of Edis Saloc 
Taste the thought-provoking breeze 
An interpretation of creation 
Feel the uncontrolled in oscillation 
But a vision of alienation Enter into a labyrinth, a new direction to uphold 
New inputs accepted, then as earing the world still turns 
And Mother Nature will never grow old Purple, angles found in symmetrical visions 
Impossibilities come to life 
Edis Saloc stripped from nature 
Severely severed, placed in a pyramid
