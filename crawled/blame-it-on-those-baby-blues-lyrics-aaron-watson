Now there you go givin' that eye, 
With your hand on my thigh, 
You got me swervin' all over the place. 
You got me wantin' and needin' 
You're the reason for my speedin' 
And you know you can't blame it on the breaks. Blame it on those baby blues 
For lookin' like you do 
Blame it on your slow dancin', county road romancin' 
Blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright 
Tailgate kind of summer night 
Blame it on you for lovin' me so true 
Girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper, and your touch 
Blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much 
Blame it on those baby blues 
But you can't blame me for lovin' you. Yeah when the sun goes down on the sleepy little town 
You turn my world into a country love song. 
Take a good long look in the mirror 
Naw, it couldn't be any clearer 
And you'll see what turns my radio on Blame it on those baby blues 
For lookin' like you do 
Blame it on your slow dancin', county road romancin' 
Blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright 
Tailgate kind of summer night 
Blame it on you for lovin' me so true 
Girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper, and your touch 
Blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much 
Blame it on those baby blues 
But you can't blame me for lovin' The way you love me 
Can't get enough of me 
Rain or shine, all the time, with all your heart and soul. 
I'll be lookin' in your eyes 
By the time the sunrise comes 
Shinin' through your bedroom window. You can blame it on those baby blues 
For lookin' like you do 
Blame it on your slow dancin', county road romancin' 
Blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright 
Tailgate kind of summer night 
Blame it on you for lovin' me so true 
Girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper, and your touch 
Blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much 
Blame it on those baby blues 
But you can't blame me for lovin' you. No, no matter what you do, 
Girl you can't blame me for lovin' you. You can blame it on those baby blues 
For lookin' like you do
