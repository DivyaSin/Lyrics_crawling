I'd sail away just to follow you 
I'd chase the dream across the blue 
'Cause I am rich no matter what I lose 
I'd rather risk it all and find the truth It's all because of our love 
Oh all because of our love 
All because of our love 
It's all because of our love It's all because of our love 
Oh all because of our love 
All because of our love 
It's all because of our love I'm gonna change myself and start anew 
Turn myself into someone new 
If I can't be with the one I choose 
I'd rather leave it all and die with you It's all because of our love 
Oh all because of our love 
All because of our love 
It's all because of our love It's all because of our love 
Oh all because of our love 
All because of our love 
It's all because of our love
