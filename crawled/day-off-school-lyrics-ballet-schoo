Oh don't wake me up 
My bed is so warm 
I'm sleeping It's quarter past eight 
Just ten minutes more 
I need them Outside is so white 
It's not even light 
It's freezing Can't you get up first? 
I think it's your turn 
Yet again Our mom's on the phone 
Can't hear what she's saying 
But hopefully we're taking the day off school (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, ...) This is the dream 
To spend the whole day 
In PJs And breakfast is late 
Cause dad made us wait 
For pancakes Let's turn up a bed 
Into a tent 
And play with Lollypop the Cat (oh Lollypop, Lollypop, Lollypop the Cat) I can't believe 
It's only ten thirty 
It's so much fun taking the day off school Do you wanna watch a video? 
Do you wanna go play in the snow? 
I don't care if it is merely cold 
Dad says we could both wear his big coat Tumbling around in a white heaven 
Strange and quiet, no cars on the road 
In a minute we'll go in for diner 
I like being out here, but it's getting to cold You're my best friend 
You make everything 
As wonderful as taking the day off school
