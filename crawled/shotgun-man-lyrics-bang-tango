Oh, where's my gun? 
I want to have some - fun 
When you look ahead 
That's where I dive right in Don't try to help me 
Don't try to tell me 
Just take a look inside of my head 
Only time can tell If I'm to go to - hell 
When you see my face 
That's where you lose your trace 
Don't try to help me Don't try to tell me 
Just take a look inside 
I'm a shotgun man - shot 
I'm a shotgun man - shot It's a lie good God 
Need my shot 
Shot, shot - shotgun man 
Shotgun man Ready to fire 
Watch you bleed 
Where's my gun? 
Hey, dad too many died Ain't enough 
Shotgun 
Don't try to help me 
Don't try to tell me Just take a look inside of my head 
Shot 
I'm a shotgun man - shot 
I'm a shotgun man - shot I'm a shotgun man 
Well, I'm a shotgun man 
Listen! 
Shotgun, shotgun It'a a lie! 
Good God!
