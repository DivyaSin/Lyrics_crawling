We use to wear rugged boots now it's all tailored suits 
Audemars Piguets for my criminal recruits 
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm and the blues 
Partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news 
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks 
Riding by the rules i'll abide by it soon 
See the situation we sophisticated goons 
Know you live by the gun then you die by it too 
Niggas call me prophecy, swagging and philosophies 
White on white wagon call that motherfucker Socrates 
Rat ass nigga, fighting for a block of cheese 
Catch me out in China stunning yea I'm about my guapanese 
My shoe game serious, so serious,Whaup in these 
Niggas say I'm blessed my bad I forgot to sneeze (achoo) 
There your reasons go bitch 
I got some tissues for your issues tell 'em blow this People money watch, split ahead now 
They countin every day down 
Hittin on me long 
You know your way, where youre headin now? 
Me, I want everything 
It wont take me long 
It wont take me long Roger, roger, tell em roger that 
Its the gold teeth, French braids, call me Project Pat 
With the stalky cap, face a mask on, probly strapped 
Its the rocker cap, turn my swag on, holla back 
Throw a dollar at a biddage, tell er suck my Diddy 
Cuz they hatin on my clitty, cuz we made it when we did it 
Hit it cuz they didnt 
My mama always told me keep your mind on your money 
Boy you better pay attention 
Ride with the pretty nigga, woopty, no chauffeur 
Paint lookin like a drippin smoothy, no coaster 
The game if full of posers, big dog bulldozer 
Flap up on em like toasters, wake them up like Folgers 
Cuz heaven need a villain like hell need a newer idol 
You could flip the crip and call just renew the title 
For now Im pro pimpin like them do what I do 
Smoking killa but my doors still suicidal People money watch, split ahead now 
They countin every day down 
Hittin on me long

Really you know that we dont come how we get down 
Knew that was a Rocky ahead
