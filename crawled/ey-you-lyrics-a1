Hey you, looking around at your friends 
You see something about them has changed 
And nothing's clear 
They're not the same Don't you take it to heart all the same 
You'll see it works out better that way 
Don't be afraid to shout your name Do what you gotta do 
The world is waiting for you 
There ain't nothing to lose 
Everybody today 
Everything is ok 
Come together and say [Chorus] 
It's alright, it's alright 
You don't have to stop the way you're feeling 
Because you've got time to get it right 
Let your mind know where it's leading 
It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright, it's alright Hey you, just be the best you can be 
You'll see the best things in life come for free 
Now it's all clear, no cloudy day If you follow your heart and believe 
You'll be excited by what you'll achieve 
Don't be afraid to find a way Oh, do what you gotta do 
The world is waiting for you 
There ain't nothing to lose 
Everybody today 
If he thinks it's ok 
Come together and say [Chorus] Do what you gotta do 
The world is waiting for you 
There ain't nothing to lose 
Everybody today 
If he thinks it's ok 
Come together and say [Chorus] It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright, it's alright 
You don't have to stop the way you're feeling 
Because you've got time to get it right 
Let your mind know where it's leading 
It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright, it's alright 
It's alright, it's alright
