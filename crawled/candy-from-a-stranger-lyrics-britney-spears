Ya! 
Yeah... Aay, shorty. 
(Britney giggles) You're so sweet Britney: 
Stranger, A stranger 
Candy from a stranger Excuse ma, but you're sick 
sweeter than a Hershey Kiss 
Come, be my desert in this 
I put my spoon in your dip 
Oooh! 
We got one night only 
Hope you brought some jolly ranchers for me 
Then she told me; Britney: 
I don't even know you But here, I got a snicker for you, here! [Chorus:] 
Britney: 
What's in front of me?, I just can't believe 
Oh, you're tempting me 
(Oh oh 'cause you're so sweet) 
It's been too long 
Oh, it feels so wrong 
Danger, Danger, candy from a stranger You don't need to sugar coat it 
I got it, and you know it 
All of the pieces with it 
(mama told me don't) Take candy from strangers 
Candy from strangers 
Candy from a stranger Shorty, have a bite 
I will fill your appetite 
I know your mom said not to 
But, I'll change your life after tonight 
Bet you never tried it, and I guarantee you'll like it 
And I know you can't resist, so don't fight it, don't fight it 
Come give it to me [Chorus] [Bridge] 
Britney: 
A stranger Laze: 
Come get some Britney: 
A stranger Laze: 
Just like that 
A stranger 
Don't be scared, don't be scared [Bridge x2] Mama use to tell me 
Don't take candy from a stranger 
But girl, you look so sweet 
You got me reaching with my fingers 
She said don't take candy from a stranger, 
candy from a stranger, candy from a stange, a stranger [Chorus x2]
