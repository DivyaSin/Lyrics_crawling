Twist my fucking arm, till i've stabbed you in the back. 
The tears you shed are fake, it's all part of your act. 
Muffled by the sounds of pain, 
find bleeding hearts to drown your shame, 
make yourself the victim, spread lies to save your name. 
What did you just say? 
What the fuck did you just say? 
These bleeding hearts, can't drown your shame. 
Faster and faster, your heading for disaster, 
you're bleeding hearts will dry, their sympathy will die. 
Question my convictions, doubt my sincerity, 
what the fuck can i say? 
Fuck you.
