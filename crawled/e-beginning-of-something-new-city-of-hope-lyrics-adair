A taste of earth and blackened breaths. 
Our oxygen is running out. 
It's been years wrapped in flesh 
barely living underground. 
An avalanche of scarlet death 
consuming everything we knew. 
For you I'd go to hell and back. 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do. In your touch salvation lies. 
Your body bending pinhole light. 
So take my hand as we rise 
from the ashes of tonight. 
Escape is ours if we believe 
our love transcends the doom. 
And just like that our hand breaks free 
from the confines of the earth. 
(into daylight) 
Cast away your doubts and fears 
this golden thread will mend your heart. 
In brilliant light we'll spend our years. 
They can never tear us apart. 
Feel the light upon your face 
as we draw closer to the sun. 
We'll live our lives in it's warm embrace. 
Forever has just begun. Cast away your doubts and fears 
this golden thread will mend your heart. 
in this brilliant light, we'll spend our years. 
They can never tear us apart. 
Feel the light upon your face 
as we draw closer to the sun. 
We'll live our lives in it's warm embrace 
forever has just begun. Cast away your doubts and fears 
this golden thread will mend your heart. 
in this brilliant light, we'll spend our years. 
They can never tear us apart. 
Feel the light upon your face 
as we draw closer to the sun. 
We'll live our lives in it's warm embrace 
forever has just begun. Cast away your doubts and fears 
this golden thread will mend your heart. 
in this brilliant light, we'll spend our years. 
They can never tear us apart. 
Feel the light upon your face 
as we draw closer to the sun. 
We'll live our lives in it's warm embrace 
forever has just begun. (sounds like a heart monitor gone flat at the end)
