The gathering now of storms within 
That whip and rip the stead, joined at the head 
Dying to make ready for the deliverance to the land 
The swarming devourers, the murder Here are the fortunes to tell 
Of our demonic dreams, the burnt fires of hell 
Painted in black 
The warmth is seething and moving all through me Total annihilation 
We are your masters now I can see them coming down like rain in the streets 
Soaking into everything 
Like blood through cloth 
Scratching limbs from wing and claw All life will start to slow and freeze into position 
When the murder crows 
With likeness to shades much deeper than dull 
The infinite abyss forever holds Total annihilation 
We are your masters now Crushing your premonition 
Crushing your premonition Towers fall into the fire 
And razored hails of glass and steel 
Brought down by stabs of rage without fear 
Gashed hearts worked deep who refuse to hear Here are the fortunes to tell 
Of our demonic dreams, the burnt fires of hell 
Painted in black 
The warmth is seething and moving all through me Total annihilation 
We are your masters now 
Total annihilation 
We are your masters now
