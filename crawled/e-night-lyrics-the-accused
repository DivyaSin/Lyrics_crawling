Standing on a corner 
In the middle of the night 
His schizophrenic face 
Shrouded in the smoke 
Rising from the sewers 
Beneath the streets 
Cracked lips surrouded teeth 
Yellow and decayed. His schizophrenic face 
Shrouded in the thin haze 
Of hot breath wheezing from 
Dying lungs 
Greasy hair covers 
Wild blood-shot eyes 
Dirty toes poke through 
The ends of weathered 
Combat boots. Somewhere in this city 
An old man's all alone 
Standing on a corner 
In the middle of the night. Reaching in the pocket 
Of his battered overcoat 
Skeletal hand crucified by arthritis 
Clench a half-filled bottle of 
Fortified wine 
A stream of drool 
Runs from the corner of his mouth.
