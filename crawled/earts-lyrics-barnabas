Moving through the hills above a twisted paradise 
The city spreads like scattered jewels across a velvet night 
Streets below are churning, hungry and alive 
Rainbow's end for those who win; others won't survive Stepping from a bus into this dog-eat-kitten world 
Passing through the turnstile, a frightened, lonely girl 
Small town misconceptions of Eden by the sea 
Foggy dreams of youth explode in stark reality 
The grass looked so much greener on the hills beyond her own 
Leaving everything behind, heading out alone Momentary panic rising in the throat 
Never turning back now, never losing hope 
No intimidation, choking back the tears 
Hell has no device against the hearts that feel no fear Captured for awhile in the nightly glitter life 
A less than righteous carnival of dangerous delights 
Going through the motions, playing out each part 
Outside, cool indifference; inside, pleading hearts 
The craving for affection is much stronger when alone 
Character reveals herself when need cuts to the bone Momentary panic rising in the throat 
Never turning back now, never losing hope 
Those who wait in solitude must learn to persevere 
Hell has no device against the hearts that feel no fear Caught up in the magic of a perfect summer's night 
The city spreads like scattered jewels beyond the realms of sight 
Onshore breeze is blowing, warm and whispering 
Heartbeat pound of distant surf completes the fantasy 
The rainbow's end is always near to those with ears to hear 
Hell has no device against the hearts that feel no fear No storm lasts forever, darkness cannot last 
The iron bars of evil are shattering like glass 
The presence of a shadow only means the light is near 
Hell has no device against the hearts that feel no fear
