You can close you eyes and pretend that everything's fine 
but sooner or later you'll open your eyes 
and reality will strike you blind 
They're stealing all our money 
and desroying all our scene 
We're working hard to make them rich 
with their get rich corporate schemes 
We won't submit 
They're full of shit 
I'd rather die 
Then live a lie 
You bust your ass every week 
you think that you are free 
I want to take a fuckin' gun 
and shoot them in the head 
cause I won't rest until the day 
that I look out and see 
the lawyers and the politicians 
all lying around dead 
Punks unite, show some might 
don't go down without a fight 
don't backdown, stand your ground 
Let's go out and burn this town 
we'll skank all night at the sight 
of the city burning bright 
All around you'll hear the sound 
of the town burning down 
Open your eyes, you work for the system 
You're a tool, I can't take the lies 
And if you believe them you're a fool 
Can't you hear the cries 
from the working class 
the ones you rule 
and you cannot hide 
because we'll find you 
It's time for us to fight 
against everything that you stand for 
Time to feel our might 
gonna kick your ass and even the score 
Burn everything in sight 
break all of your windows 
loot your stores 
Gonna start tonight 
We're hard to the core 
It's time for you to pay 
for the rotten shit that you have done 
We won't fade away 
our hate will burn you like the sun 
We will seize the day 
it's time for us to have some fun 
We are here to stay 
until we've fuckin won 
We're running out into the streets 
to pi
