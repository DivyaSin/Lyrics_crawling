[English translate: Earth Summoning Us] to you I now descend, oh you, deluded souls. 
and to purge your sorrow, you forlorn spirits, 
the curse I shall invoke 
the misanthropic curse, with its sordid, purple claws 
to carve your forehead, instead of cattlebrand 
with iron burnt in fire in vain will pride be seethed in veins dried up and scorched 
in death-swallowed eyeballs, on foreheads purple-hued 
by putrid blood that died 
what can I ever chose from your exhausted entity 
no fires free from dying, no undeceiving right 
oh, you dead men walking see, how urns now burst, the ashes resurrect 
alike the past, which murmurs with the battle-cry 
of the roman empire 
see the far-off shadows, they dress in steely armour 
and raise their noble foreheads that gone grey 
great traian and great cesar the rotten thrones are crumbling swept by tempests waters 
the rulers iron scepters, the heavy chain of slaves 
together are now crushed 
the gates of the inferno outrageously wide-opened 
engulfing now by thousands the filthy, depraved breaths 
of tyrants grim who perish oh, holy visionary minds, who set the stars to sing... 
who create another world on this realms of mud and grime 
fools and wise, young and old, sound, soul and light 
all is dust, the world's like this, and so we all are
