Into the night, I long 
Drunk on desire and hope 
Here in the still, ??? 
I've found somewhere to call It's the one thing 
You've been missing If you need love 
Open your heart 
I give you all I got 
And if you need me 
Close your eyes 
I let you touch your dream 
We can do anything 
Eternal ??? 
Give me one night 
With you-ou-ou-ou... I wanna go slow 
You made me wait so long 
It feels like I'm breathing your mind and your body 
Just want me too 
No need to ??? And I don't make rules, no 
Rules are for bored children 
That ??? the real things like me and you If you need love 
Open your heart 
I give you all I got 
And if you need me 
Close your eyes 
I let you touch your dreams 
And I'm doing anything 
Eternal ??? 
Give me one night 
With you-ou-ou-ou...
