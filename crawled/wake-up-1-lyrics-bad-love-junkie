Wake up Wake up 
Peel back your eyes 
Eat this information 
But don't believe the lies It's only in my head 
It's only in my head 
Voices screaming from the top of my lungs 
What was it that they said? Did I miss something? 
A pill is in the hand 
Strange folks all dressed in white 
Hey! I'm just the guitar man It's only in my head 
It's only in my head 
Voices screaming from the top of my lungs 
What was it that they said? Only time will tell 
If I'm well or not 
I ask the doctor when 
He just sighs a lot 
& says someday soon 
Someday soon Wake up wake up wake up 
Peel back your eyes 
The loud speaker talks 
The patient has died It's only in my head 
It's only in my head 
Voices screaming from the top of my lungs 
What was it that they said? 
What was it that I said? 
What was it that I said? 
What was it that I said? 
What was it that I said? 
Wake Up Wake Up
