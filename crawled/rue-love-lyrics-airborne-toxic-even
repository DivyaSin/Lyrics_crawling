My heart, my head 
My head, my head 
This blood, this bed 
This bed, this bed If I can feel the angels falling down around my head 
Their bodies spinning endlessly in circles 'round this bed 
'Cause it's true love, 'cause it's true love 
'Cause it's true love, 'cause it's true love 'Cause it's true love, 'cause it's true love 
'Cause it's true love, 'cause it's true love And you don't know what to do sometimes 
and you're just lost there for days 
And everyone tells you just calm down 
remember what she said And she's standing by the record store 
She's got her whole life in her hands 
She says she's crazy man but I'm crazy too 
And I'm crazy for what we had It was true love, it was true love 
It was true love, it was true love It was true love, it was true love 
It was true love, it was true love It was true love And everyone told me that I was wrong 
But I thought that it wasn't true 
And everyone told me that I was wrong 
But I'm going home with you 
'Cause I was there And I tore myself apart that night 
Just wondering where you had gone 
With the [?] in the alleyway 
And all the angels on your lawn They're standing here in front of me 
You got the whole life in your hands 
I know I'm crazy love, but you're crazy too 
You're the only thing in my prayers 'Cause it's true love, 'cause it's true love 
'Cause it's true love, 'cause it's true love 'Cause it's true love, 'cause it's true love 
'Cause it's true love, 'cause it's true love 'Cause it's true love And everyone told us just go find 
A song 
But they don't know a god damn thing about us 
Or a thing about holding on 
'Cause we were wrong
