We'll get older, 
We'll get bored out of our mind. 
Get cold shoulders, 
Walk a line. We'll get older, 
We'll get bored out of our mind. 
Get cold shoulders, 
Walk a line. We live in the city of norms, 
Spoon-fed from the day that we were born. 
Yet the clown, 
He promissed a balloon 
To get us closer to the moon. 
When there's hunger at the door 
We start heading for the stars 
What we're looking for we can't define, 
Not this time. We'll get older, 
We'll get bored out of our mind. 
Get cold shoulders, 
Walk a line. We'll get older, 
We'll get bored out of our mind. 
Get cold shoulders, 
Walk a line. We wear this city's uniform 
And even the hungry girls can't keep our kicks warm. 
The clown, 
He sold us a balloon 
To get us closer to the moon. 
One day when boredom hits us hard 
We start heading for the stars. 
What we're looking for we can't define, 
Like it was Maria who was always on our mind. We'll get older, 
We'll get bored out of our mind. 
Get cold shoulders, 
Walk a line. We'll get older, 
We'll get bored out of our mind. 
Get cold shoulders, 
Walk a line. We'll get older, 
We'll get bored out of our mind. 
Get cold shoulders, 
Walk a line.
