My mind is razor-sharp 
And I'm wild-cat-mean 
I'd like to shred your face 
A danger to you 
When I feel the urge 
Deep down inside 
I lose my human touch 
I'm like a killing machine I want to resist 
But I can't hold it back 
The beast is unleashed 
It's got to attack 
Again and again the force is too strong 
It's breaching the chains I've got the beast inside 
Don't you trust in me 
I've got the beast inside 
Craving a victim 
It's telling me to kill I look through evil eyes 
Prowling in the streets 
In the dead of night 
I'm a man on the hunt I know my soul is under siege 
Can't somebody stop me now 
Cause I'm losing control I've got the beast inside 
Don't you trust in me 
I know it must have been 
The beast inside 
It's driving me to kill It's gotta be the beast 
The beast 
The beast 
The beast 
The beast 
The beast deep down inside But when the deed is done 
And the pain is gone 
I feel renewed within 
Until the voices return The beast 
The beast 
The beast 
The beast 
The beast 
The beast My mind is razor-sharp 
And I'm wild-cat-mean 
I'd like to shred your face 
I've told you before When I feel the urge 
Deep down inside 
I lose my human touch 
I'm just a killing machine I want to resist 
But I can't hold it back 
The beast is unleashed 
It's got to attack 
Again and again the force is too strong 
It's breaching the chains It's gotta be the beast inside 
Never ever trust in me 
I know there is a beast inside 
Inside in all of us I feel I've got the beast inside 
I'm screaming for help 
From this monster within 
The beast inside 
Take a look in the mirror 
It's staring at you 
Even at you 
The beast inside
