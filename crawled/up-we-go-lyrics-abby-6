Intro 
inhale with your ears 
exhale with your mind 
inhale with your ears 
exhale with your mind 
up we go but we're right here 
down we go but we're right here 
heaven we win but we're right here 
in hell we lose but we're right here 
REPEAT INTRO 
everything's heaving underground you see 
but the music from you rob, dave and steve 
oz went with floyd but i don't know why 
jimmi you're excused while i kiss the sky 
Chorus 
it's gonna rain 
i see the sun again 
that's time to grow my friend 
i know you jones cause i've been there 
the kids are cool cause they don't care 
tarentino showed a soul get saved 
propt to the man for insight he gave 
so up we go but we're right here 
down we go but we're right here 
heaven we win but we're right here 
in hell we lose but we're right here 
Chorus 
REPEAT INTRO
