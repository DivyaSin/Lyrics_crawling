Theres a place on earth 
Where devils build their homes 
They roam around in search 
Of someone whos alone Youve got too much to be living for nothing 
Youve got two hands that are made for working Stop just existing 
And start to live your life Are you a sleepless dreamer? 
Are you discontented with your life? 
Do you have the will to make your dreams come alive? 
Why dont you get up and try? Theres too many people afraid of movement 
Youve got two feet that are made for walking Stop just existing 
And start to live your life Its time to move along 
Start holding on to the rest of your life 
Death and crime and pain and time 
Cant keep you stuck forever Welcome to the motion 
Welcome to assurance 
Welcome to redemption 
Welcome to your future Stop just existing 
And start to live your life
