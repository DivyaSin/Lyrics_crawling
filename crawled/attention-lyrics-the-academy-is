May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room, 
If only, if only for one second. 
Will you hear what I have to say? 
Oh, did I mention when I see you it stings like hell? 
To the fact that we could have something that'll never happen. This table has taken a turn for the worst. 
Rock bottom and over the edge 
Well it's not like it hurts that much anyway. 
Upside down and inside out. 
When I leave here I'm going alone. 
Well it's not like it hurts much anyway. Attention! Attention!

Upside down and inside out. 
When I leave here I'm going alone. 
But I'm dying, I'm dying to touch.
