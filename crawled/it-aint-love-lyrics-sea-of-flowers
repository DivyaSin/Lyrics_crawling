Money, oh money 
Supposed to make the world go around 
Funny, it can be 
What brings us back from heaven to ground And I know I've only my experience 
And my research was not refined 
That what's beating there inside your chest 
It is often the same as the mind's It ain't love, no, it ain't love 
That you find in a man's heart 
It ain't love, no, it ain't love 
That keeps so any of us apart Waiting, oh waiting 
Patiently for something to change 
Hope evaporating 
There's balance coming in the exchange And I know I've only my experience 
And my research was not refined 
That what's beating there inside your chest 
It is often the same as the mind's It ain't love, no, it ain't love 
That you find in a man's heart 
It ain't love, no, it ain't love 
That keeps so any of us apart Paying payback 
For regret, hope and advantages 
Nursing the outcome 
Year on year of bandages It ain't love, no, it ain't love 
That you find in a man's heart 
It ain't love, no, it ain't love 
That keeps so any of us apart
