How bout i move on a streachway 
how bout i take to the moon 
Can no one here whats ringing 
out in the mids of you I try to break this in the moon 
let me just go upon the vally 
How bout a dance in the moon 
then i'll just take it upon the Mayflower float i wanna dance 
with you. Can we just go in the moon light 
how bout i take my crown 
And i just rest upon that bus 69 
i wanna dance in the moon with you I was a happy little school boy 
the wind that robs in the moon 
I came so far from a distant land 
i wanna go out with you. Let me just dance upon the top 
the rupe is singing for you 
I don't no what happen 
slayed up my drops How bout i dance on the moon (Yeah) 
let me take you to the mayflower 
lemme go into the vally too 
how bout i run upon the tree tops Girl i'm dancing on the moon 
in the night that we cared 
We shared a bottle of rum 
i took away from the hills Gir i know what i shared 
the music was rushing 
i'm on my way i'm on my skill I'm dancing on the moon 
I'm dancing on the moon 
I'm dancing on the moon
