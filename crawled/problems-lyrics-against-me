An inventory has been taken of every belonging 
And there's so many values sought in event of emergencies 
The only backup plan in case it doesn't work out 
While reasons flap your hands to a former self 
You know I am becoming a choice, you should make it You're problems 
Problems with everything Sometimes it's like conversations are a waking dream third party perspective 
And all the answers to thyself you can almost hear the sound traveling 
Cause a feeling of anticipation 
When all of the sudden you know what's gonna happen 
Before the paranoids they rebuild your world 
They neither eat nor sleep they are nothing Here in the worst I will become the best of the more, the more problems 
Problems with anything 
No more problems, problems with anything
