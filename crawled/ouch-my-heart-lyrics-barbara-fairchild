Touch my heart feel the hurt it's destroying me 
I've tried but I can't seem to shake his memory 
Touch my heart feel the hurt the pain and misery 
And tell me again what love can do for me If you lived in my world awhile you'd soon forget how to smile 
Cause in my world there's a million ways to cry 
If you had my eyes you could see how someone changed my destiny 
I'm a girl who can't live and yet can't die 
Touch my heart feel the hurt
