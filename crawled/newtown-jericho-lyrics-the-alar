See them run 
Like characters in paintings 
Turners frightening 'scapes 
Industrial inside a nation of no escape 
There's no escape in my frightened face 
As we run run run 
And turn to stone OH LORD hear me now 
The fanfare sounds in a Newtown Jericho 
OH LORD the wailing sound 
Of helpless souls in a Newtown Jericho See them fall 
The rebecca ride at dawn 
Petticoat ghost and tom 
Working to reclaim the land for no reward 
There's no reward my daughters of dawn 
As we run run run 
And turn to stone OH LORD hear me now 
The fanfare sounds in a Newtown Jericho 
OH LORD the wailing sound 
Of helpless souls in a Newtown Jericho I've been down amongst the crying there 
Upon my knees I'm dying 
And Polsen dragged across the city walls 
Upon a wooden horse Horse Horse Horse This is Jericho OH LORD hear me now 
The fanfare sounds in a Newtown Jericho 
OH LORD the wailing sound 
Of helpless souls in a Newtown Jericho Jericho, Jericho 
Jericho, Jericho 
Jericho, Jericho 
Jericho, Jericho Oh lord
