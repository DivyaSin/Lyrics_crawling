I have seen the result of our school system 
I have seem what it does 
I asked some kids about the holocaust 
And they didn't even know what it was 
Didn't that happen in some Time Life books 
I didn't see the movie, I didn't have time to look 
Genocide is the product of every bloody war 
And remembrance is a way to begin 
But don't be so ignorant as to believe 
It can never happen again 
Remember
