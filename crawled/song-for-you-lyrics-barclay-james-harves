As the sounds of the morning 
Roll on out of the night 
The thoughts of a dreamer 
Asking and telling me why 
Lady awaken the morning is taking 
Your bad dreams away from your eyes 
Nothing's forsaken the new day is breaking 
So come now it's time to arise 
As the sounds of the morning 
Rise up out of the blue 
Still a voice keeps on saying 
Hold on, hold on to you 
Lady awaken the morning is taking 
Your bad dreams away from your eyes 
Nothing's forsaken the new day is breaking 
So come now it's time to arise Is it my life, is it my song 
That makes me feel something's wrong? 
You know me well, the tale I tell 
Is only halfway there, 'cause you 
You made me smile when I was down 
And you made me happy, being around 
So I'm always gonna sing for you Is it the time, flying along 
That makes me feel that it's wrong? 
You know me well, the tale I tell 
Is only halfway there, 'cause you 
You made me smile when I was down 
And you made me happy, being around 
So I'm always gonna sing for you
