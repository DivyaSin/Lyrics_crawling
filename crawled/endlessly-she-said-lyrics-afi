Walked into our world and made 
Horrible sounds 
I can still hear them today 
(Bleakly they sing) 
Beautiful now 
For they all passed my love Still each time I always meant 
Every word, every one. 
Though in time they finally bent 
Every word, every one, every word "I will wait for you", she said 
Endlessly 
"I will wait for you", so spoke 
Misery I returned to you but found 
My empty home 
The radio told me to stay 
(As it burned on) 
I sang alone 
Here will I pass, my love Still each time I always meant 
Every word, every one 
Though in time they finally bent 
Every word, every one, every word "I will wait for you", she said 
Endlessly 
"I will wait for you", so spoke 
Misery I have been waiting for you 
Biting as you talk me through 
I have come to relieve you 
Of life and love I will wait for you 
I will wait for you 
I will wait for you I will wait 
I will wait "I will wait for you", she said 
(I will wait) 
Endlessly 
"I will wait for you", so spoke 
(I will wait) 
Misery I will wait for you 
Wait for you 
Endlessly "I will wait for you" 
So spoke 
So spoke 
Misery I will wait straight through 
As I wait for you 
Dear 
Endlessly
