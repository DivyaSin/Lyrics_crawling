Where were you when you left me alone? 
Spent all my time sitting by the phone 
Waiting for you to come around, but once again you let me down 
Oh at the time I was too naive of a dreamer to ever believe in you 
and all the promises you made just fell through I wish I could go back in time 
I wish I could of change your mind 
From all the mistakes you made, but all this wishful thinking isn't gonna change a thing 
So I have to be strong as I find my place in this world without you 
I'll keep moving on cause' I'll never go back in time Where are you now that I'm half grown 
So many years flew by I bet you're feeling alone, 
But you chose to walk away 
Betray your baby girl, 
And push me right out of your world I wish I could go back in time 
I wish I could of change your mind 
From all the mistakes you made, but all this wishful thinking isn't gonna change a thing 
So I have to be strong as I find my place in this world without you 
I'll keep moving on cause' I'll never go back in time I might not have you know but I'm doing just fine 
I'm chasing my dreams 
It's my time to shine I'll never go back in time 
I'll never change your mind 
From all the mistakes you made 
I'll never change a thing, 
But that's just fine 
Because I am strong 
I found my place in this world without you 
I'll keep moving on 
Cause' I'll never go back in time
