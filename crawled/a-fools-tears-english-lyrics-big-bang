GirlI feel so emptysince you left me 
(Wanna see your face my girl) 
it's like... 
i don't even know how to explain 
you see i'm sayin...? Cause I'm so hurt and so angry 
I didn't want to believe it 
Your two eyes and your lips 
Where I was living is telling me to leave you now 
How can you say that to me? 
I was so shocked that I let you leave The memories of my love for you held me 
Once happy words,made me cry 
Even before i had a chance to ask you not to leave 
you already turned and threw everything away 
Even turning back the time that had passed and giving all the pain that i gave you 
If that only meant that you would stay with me 
I'm content with that I'm content 
Forever Even if one day and one month passes,time is pointless 
Even if I listen to your voice without being able to say a word 
Saying that I'll forget you 
How can I do that? 
My so very edgy heart 
Please dont leave me baby The memories of my love for you held me 
Once happy words,made me cry 
Even before i had a chance to ask you not to leave 
you already turned and threw everything away 
Even turning back the time that had passed and giving all the pain that i gave you 
If that only meant that you would stay with me 
I'm content with that I'm content 
Forever A stupid guy with only tears 
Even if i stay like that,its impossible to forget you 
I cant do anything about that 
And every night 
Again tears baby 
Come back to me please Yo..Listen 
Saying you'll forget no way 
I only think of you 
That one picture I took with you 
I cant end it and I look at the picture instead 
If its not you 
I cannot love again 
I dont even want to and I just cant 
It can only be you now 
Please come back here In a multitude of people I was able to protect you 
I can live for you ma baby 
Until now 
My heart lost it's way and the owner of my heart is only you ma lady 
Without you I cant breath 
Come back girl 
I miss you so much 
Cuz' your my love Thank you for making me happy 
Im sorry for not letting you love me 
Facing each other with our hearts and giving them to each other 
Now we cant do anything in this situation 
Even if I die I'll only love you 
Even if I'm sick I'll only wait for you 
You just have to return to me before then 
I only love you,love you 
Forever Come on listen girl... 
You're ma girl... 
And that's my world.... 
Ya baby only one...
