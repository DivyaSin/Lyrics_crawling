Here we go again tonight 
We both know it aint right 
Maybe we just fell in love too soon 
You like to dance, I like to sing 
You want romance, you think its everything 
Maybe we just fell in love too soon Was it just infatuation? 
Did we get caught in the rush? 
One little miscalculation 
We both expected too much Theres what you want and what you get 
Theres satisfaction and theres regret 
Maybe we just fell in love too soon 
Here we are in this great big room 
You want the stars, I want the moon 
Maybe we just fell in love too soon
