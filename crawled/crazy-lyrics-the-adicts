It would be good if we could get out tonight 
It would be great if we could make something happen 
We could run 
We could run 
We could run We could run 
We could run 
We could run 
All night 
We could find we could find a place to hang around No ones man enough (no!) 
No ones bad enough (no!) 
No ones crazy anymore 
No ones crazy anymore It would be wild if we could find a lonely car 
And with six strangers we could change the regular 
We could drive 
We could drive 
We could drive 
We could drive 
We could drive 
We could drive 
(Headlights) 
We could speed we could speed we could speed 
(And take continuous flight?) No ones man enough (no!) 
No ones bad enough (no!) 
No ones crazy anymore 
No ones crazy anymore Lets go crazy! It would be good if we could get out tonight 
It would be great if we could make something happen 
We could run 
We could run 
We could run

We could find we could find we could find 
A place to hang around No ones man enough (no!) 
No ones bad enough (no!) 
No ones crazy anymore!
