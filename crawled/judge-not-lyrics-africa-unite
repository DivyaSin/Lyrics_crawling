(by The Wailers) Don't you look at me so smug 
And say I'm going bad 
Who are you to judge me, and the life I live 
I know that I'm not perfect 
And that I don't claim to be 
So, before you point your finger 
Make sure your hands are clean. Judge not, before you judge yourself 
Judge not, if you're not ready for judgement. The road of life is rocky, and you may stumble too 
So, while you talk about me someone else is judging you. 
Don't you look at me so smug 
And say I'm going bad 
Who are you to judge me, and the life I live 
I know that I'm not perfect 
And that I don't claim to be 
So, before you point your finger 
Make sure your hands are clean.
