I'll leave you now 
In safe hands 
Cool your soul 
It's love still stands But failing that 
Just cool down 
Wouldn't you love to make it 
Is this real or am I just 
Imagining? With wings take flight 
The rose of why 
And with that rose 
The case is closed But I need you now 
To help me somehow 
Well I'm scared to face it 
This final kiss 
But I know I'll remember it You gave your best to me 
Allow yourself to be 
Free It raids your memory 
Still I'm sorry for failing 
A time for change 
Well I need you now 
To help me out 
Well I'm scared to face this 
A final kiss 
But I know you'll remember it
