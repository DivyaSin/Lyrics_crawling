WRITTEN BY KEVIN BACON And if this morning is our last 
How long 'til I will not remember 
Will you become my distant past 
Before July becomes December 
And if I lose your photograph 
How long 'til I will lose your face 
Find some echo of your laugh 
Hiding in some darker place 
And if I give you everything you ask 
Every word of every song 
Will I have nothing left to live for 
When you decide you've stayed too long And if I locked you up inside 
How long 'til you would want another 
And slip away into the night 
Try and find yourself a lover 
And if I gave you everything you'd see 
All my blood and flesh and bones 
Will my spirit still belong to me 
When you decide you've stayed too long 
Yeah will my spirit still belong to me 
When you decide you've stayed too long
