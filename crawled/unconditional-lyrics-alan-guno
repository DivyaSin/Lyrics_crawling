Is that my neighbor whos feeling down? 
Thought I should just do some good and turn his life around 
Offered my hand but saw pain in his eyes 
His voice I heard, three simple words, he asked My brother, why Your empty lies, you use to disapprove 
They never speak Gods truth Will you take my hand without your judgment or your creed 
Will you call me brother without looking down at me 
Can you show our Saviors mercy isnt optional 
Will you show a love thats truly unconditional? I left my neighbor, tears in my eyes 
Why would he choose, dare to accuse my always-giving life 
Had I not offered my hand in his need 
But still he finds, Ive closed my eyes to those that I should see And yet his words now start to ring so true 
Can I believe anew? Will you start a life that celebrates the God of love? 
Will you put away the fears that youve been frightened of? 
Can you show our Saviors call is unmistakable 
All He wants is love thats truly unconditional Would you stand in the way of what you do not understand 
Praise His name with hatred in your hands 
He wont care if you were right 
He wont dwell upon your rules 
All Hell ask is if youve shown compassion to the few? Will you take my hand without your judgment or your creed 
Will you call me brother without looking down at me 
Can you show our Saviors mercy isnt optional 
Will you show a love thats truly unconditional? ( Start a life that celebrates the God of love 
Put away the fears that youve been frightened of 
Show us that our Saviors call is unmistakable 
All He wants is love thats truly unconditional Take my hand without your judgment or your creed 
Call me brother without looking down at me 
And show our Saviors mercy isnt optional 
Now you show a love thats truly unconditional Now you show a love thats truly unconditional
