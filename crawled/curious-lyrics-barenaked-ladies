If I climb a tree 
Just to see what I see 
Does that makes me curious If I make a point 
Of cruising a joint 
Would that make me curious If it is profound 
This just looking around 
Well then jeez-wizz Don't call me crazy 
I've never been lazy 
Curious it is A touch of excess 
With a little finesse 
It's simply luxurious If I confess 
To making this mess 
Would that make you furious But after a while 
You'll be cracking a smile 
Thats when we will see If I may submit 
You have to admit 
You are curious like me They say curiosity was responsible 
For the unfortunate demise 
Of the cat But with more lives to investigate 
What kind of deal is that 
Not bad! A furious son 
Can make for serious fun 
So we wont let that worry us Because the fun is outdone 
By a barrel of one 
If that one is the furriest If curious means 
You trade your routines 
For something free The freedom you feel 
IS the whole part of the deal 
So curious I'll be Curious sir, and curious or sir 
Curoius...curious like... 
Curious like me
