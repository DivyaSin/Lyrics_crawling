Can't find it at the ending 
You'll find it in the journey 
You'll find it the footsteps that you embed Look at the all the angles 
Think of all the answers 
The beauty's in the question 
Live there there instead The whispers of the wind cry 
the rain that wet you will dry 
nothing in our world I can be permanent Our little Iives' are fleeting 
How longs your heart been beating 
your sitting on the fence no time to lament I will live this time 
I will face my fears, and hold back the tides 
I believe in life 
I will live this time I will face the waves 
with my head held high 
I believe in life 
I will live this time Life is just a canvas 
It ain't no paint numbers 
The shades are so much brighter when off the brush Reflections on the surface 
Look to deep you'll notice 
The people in our lives make ripples in us I will live this time 
I'll face my fears, hold back the tides 
I believe in life 
I will live this time ill face the waves with my head held high 
I believe in life 
I will live this time
