Our fires high and the airbags tight 
Food's low but the skies are bright 
Props spinning all through the night 
We're low on cash but seen another target Goggles down and the cannons up 
My blood starts pumping as I drain my cup 
I give the wheel a spin and I turn this girl around 
We're way above ground but we're closed in on our target Flying Jib is filled with air 
East India ships filled with despair 
We even up, her broadsides bare 
Our cannons flair but it's just a show of muscle Steady on, she doesn't need to burn 
She tries to flee and she tries to turn 
Grappling fire, we latch her hull 
She's starting to roll, but we've got her on a leash With a crew of drunken pilots 
We're the only airship pirates 
We're full of hot air and we're starting to rise 
We're the terror of the skies, but a danger to ourselves now Expendable crew starts to reel her in 
Our swords are sharpened and we're ready to sin 
I'm three miles up, we're about to swing aboard 
My tether's made of leather so I'm not about to fall here A swish of air and my boots hit deck 
No cash, no fuel, no not a speck 
Our grape shots made this bird a wreck 
And a glance below deck shows a crew of nuns and orphans With a crew of drunken pilots 
We're the only airship pirates 
We're full of hot air and we're starting to rise 
We're the terror of the skies, but a danger to ourselves
