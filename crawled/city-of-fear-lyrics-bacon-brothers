WRITTEN BY KEVIN BACON, MICHAEL BACON You scared me when I met you 
The way you sparkled in the dark 
I drove around for hours 
But you never showed your heart 
You took me in your arms 
That smelled of oranges and sage 
You tempted me with glory 
Until I was your slave 
Then you took me to the party 
You said you loved to watch me dance 
But you took home the latest thing 
And there was no second chance CHORUS 
Now your mountain's on fire your river's run dry 
I got a burning desire to kiss an angel good bye 
Climbing out of your smokescreen the weather looks clear 
Leave an angel below me in the City of Fear You scare me when I see you 
Because I remember times we had 
How you shook me like a baby 
Who had swallowed something bad 
You scare me because I need you 
Like a roof over my head 
Like a baby needs new shoes 
Mama's milk and daddy's bread 
But you distrust my honesty 
And you distrust my car 
And you don't like the way I look 
When I'm playing my guitar CHORUS Sometimes I'm your lover your white knight your shining star 
Sometimes I'm a dinosaur And I'm sinking in your tar CHORUS
