N how many ways can I still prove that I love you 
In spite of all the crazy tests that you had put me through how else am I to show you that I forgive you 
For countless indiscretions performed in style by you how many times you hope that I would ignore it 
When you commit another crime and kick my love to death now I see that things will have to change, right now 
Oh, things will have to change around here how often do I have to say: not to worry 
When you do something stupid, simply just because you're vain how soon, you think, will come the time when you're sorry 
And you'll be crying after someone who knew you well I still believe although I'm losing my patience 
Oh please don't shout 'cause if you mean it you can whisper too now I see that things will have to... 
Things will have to change right now 
Oh, things will have to change around here what happened to your grand designs 
What happened to "the first in line" 
What happened to "we'll show them how" 
What happened to "we'll lead the crowd" I must, I have to remind you 
I must, I have to remind you 
I must, I have to remind you 
It's not too late to fix your life it's not too late 
There is still time
