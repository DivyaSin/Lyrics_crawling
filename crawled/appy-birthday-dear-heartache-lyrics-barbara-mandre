It's just a year today 
One year since he went away 
So, happy birthday dear heartache 
You're one year old today There'll be the cake tonight 
One candle I'm gonna light 
So, happy birthday dear heartache 
Old love still burns tonight When he walked out, I felt my heart break 
That's when you came to me, dear heartache 
You made my heart your home 
Now look, how big you've grown Looks like each guest is here 
The blues, the memories and the tears 
So, happy birthday dear heartache 
Same time, same place next year
