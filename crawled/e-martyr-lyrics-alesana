Remember why you're here 
Fall for me 
Lay yourself before the demon 
Spread your legs, bite your lip, meet his eye 
Drooling, engorged, wide eyed, shaking, you've got him 
Don't fall for me Don't relent invite him to you 
Guide his hand, take his breath, consume him 
Gasping, lusting, weakened, frozen, you've won 
If you should peek beneath the veil 
Don't be surprised to find me there I'm ashamed, a victim of the curse 
I think I like the fight 
Wrong feels so right, baby 
I'm flirting with lunacy 
Nothing can stop me and my sinful obsession Please don't forget who he is, my 'Bel 
A monster who enjoys the fear 
Never forget what he is, my 'Bel 
A monster who designed the fear 
Listen to me, keep your focus 
Your one true love waits in anguish 
Lick your lips as the sweat drips down 
And taste the torture as you crawl, begging for more, yeah 
I'm ashamed, a victim of the curse
