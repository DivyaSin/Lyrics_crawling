You've got this subtle kind of way 
Of making everything turn grey 
Like a bottle that runs dry 
Before you've even had a drink 
Do you think what you do 
Just might fix the bad in you 
Well you're wrong this time around And oh, oh, oh, oh 
You know you gave me something to believe in 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
You hide behind these battle lines I'm gonna be comeback kid 
And I want to find the words I need to say 
Yeah, I'm gonna survive with my head held high 
And finally walk away 
I'm gonna be comeback kid 
And I want to be the one that's not afraid 
To jump from every sinking ship 
Cause I'm done waiting to be saved Oh, oh, oh, oh 
I'm done waiting 
Oh, oh, oh, oh You've got this subtle kind of way 
About you that pulls me under 
But I won't drown 
Gonna take a whole lot more than that 
To ever bring me down 
I promise that I'll be back 
And I'll be better than before 
What you broke down I'll build back up 
Cause I don't need you anymore And oh, oh, oh, oh 
You know you gave me something to believe in 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
You hide behind these battle lines 
(Repeat) I'm gonna be comeback kid 
And I want to find the words I need to say 
Yeah, I'm gonna survive with my head held high 
And finally walk away 
I'm gonna be comeback kid 
And I want to be the one that's not afraid 
To jump from every sinking ship 
Cause I'm done waiting to be saved Do you think what you do 
Just might fix the bad in you? 
Well you're wrong this time around And oh, oh, oh, oh 
You know you gave me something to believe in 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
You hide behind these battle lines I'm gonna be comeback kid 
And I want to find the words I need to say 
Yeah, I'm gonna survive with my head held high 
And finally walk away 
I'm gonna be comeback kid 
And I want to be the one that's not afraid 
To jump from every sinking ship 
Cause I'm done waiting to be saved I'm done waiting 
I'm done waiting 
I'm done waiting to be saved 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
I'm done waiting to be saved
