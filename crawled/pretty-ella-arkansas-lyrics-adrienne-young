Adrienne Young Pretty Ella Arkansas 
Birthed 9 daughters and a son 
She was a sure shot with a pistol 
And here bare feet loved to run 
There was raven hair and brown skin 
Green eyes and a crooked smile 
There were freckles on her shoulders 
From sun-kissed country miles Well her Papa died in prison 
The day she turned 16 
Set Ella free from a life of sin 
When he got that old TB Ellad never known her Mama 
cept for that picture on the wall 
Oh but she blessed her in her prayers each night 
Knowin someday she would call Pretty Ella Arkansas 
Dangdest thing I ever saw 
Racing with a northbound freight 
Choose your car and jump inside 
Keep the faith and hold on tight 
Everythings gonna be alright 
For pretty Ella Arkansas 
Just keep following the light Was in the heat of that same summer 
When she met her childrens Pa 
At a downtown dance in Hot Springs 
Sweat and rhythm filled the hall 
When Miller Jacobs saw our girl 
He had to blink and rub his eyes 
Thought the whiskey must be playin tricks 
Or there was an angel in disguise Pretty Ella Arkansas 
Dangdest thing I ever saw 
Racing with a northbound freight 
Choose your car and jump inside 
Keep the faith and hold on tight 
Everythings gonna be alright 
For pretty Ella Arkansas

And when they laid herin the ground
