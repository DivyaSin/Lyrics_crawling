To all the men I knew before 
Old love letters in the drawer 
Mean nothing to me no more 
Everything that I possessed 
Brought me joy and happiness 
And everything I worked for I don't need my photographs 
No reminders of the past 
Next to you there's no contest 
Parties and the shallow friends 
Social whirl that never ends Gonna give it up 
Give it all up for your love 
Gonna give it up 
Give it all up for your love How could I know, how could I see 
What life had in store for me 
What does it all mean? 
None of this was ever planned 
But now fate has played her hand 
Dream into reality Now I've got you in my life 
To keep, to keep me warm at night 
You're everything I need and more 
Parties and the shallow friends 
The social whirl that never ends Gonna give it up 
Give it all up for your love 
Gonna give it up 
Give it all up for your love Gonna give it up 
Give it all up for your love 
Gonna give it up 
Give it all up for your love I don't need my photographs 
No reminders of the past 
Next to you there's no contest 
Parties and the shallow friends 
Social whirl that never ends Gonna give it up 
Give it all up for your love 
Gonna give it up 
Give it all up for your love
