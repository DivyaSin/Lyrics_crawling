Far from home Ten thousand meters high life's not complicated 
I guess I'm a lucky guy but still I find no reason 
Why I feel so empty inside 
I guess I'm far away from home tonight, tonight All the places where I have been 
And the rest of this world to be seen 
But I feel that I'm far from home 
And I want to be here on my own All the places where I have been 
And the rest of this world to be seen 
But I feel that I'm far from home 
And I want to be here on my own, far from home Ten thousand meters high life's not complicated 
I guess I'm a lucky guy but still I find no reason 
Why I feel so empty inside 
I guess I'm far away from home tonight 
Why I feel so empty inside? 
I guess I'm far away from home tonight, tonight All the places where I have been 
And the rest of this world to be seen 
But I feel that I'm far from home 
And I want to be here on my own, far from home I guess I'm far away from home tonight, tonight
