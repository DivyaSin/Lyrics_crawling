If I could write a letter to me 
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen 
First I'd prove it's me by saying 
Look under your bed, there's a Skoal can and a Playboy 
No one else would know you hid 
And then I'd say I know it's tough 
When you break up after seven months 
And yeah I know you really liked her 
And it just don't seem fair 
But I'll I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare And oh, you got so much going for you 
Going right 
But I know at seventeen 
It's hard to see past Friday night 
She wasn't right for you 
But still you feel like there's 
A knife sticking out of your back 
And you wondering if you'll survive 
But you'll make it through this and you'll see 
You're still around to write this letter to me At the stop sign at Tomlinson and 8th 
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes 
And when you get a date with Bridget 
Make sure the tank is full 
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool 
Each and every time you have a fight 
Just assume you're wrong and Dad is right 
And you should really thank Ms. Brinkman 
She spent so much extra time 
It like she sees the diamond underneath 
And she's polishing you till you shine And oh you got so much going for you 
Going right 
But I know at seventeen 
It's hard to see past Friday night 
Tonight's the bonfire rally 
But you're staying home instead 
Because if you fail Algebra 
Mom and Dad will kill you dead 
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C 
And you're still around to write this letter to me You got so much up ahead 
You'll make new friends 
You should see your kids and wife 
And I'd end by saying have no fear 
These are nowhere near 
The best years of your life I guess I'll see you in the mirror 
When you're a grown man 
P.S. go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can And oh you got so much going for you 
Going right 
But I know at seventeen 
It's hard to see past Friday night 
I wish you'd study Spanish 
I wish you'd take a typing class 
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be 
I'd say have a little faith and you'll see If I could write a letter to me 
To me
