I'm a lonely man walking lonely streets 
I'm soaked to the skin with the pain of my unease 
From such a strained existence The tension in this world keeps me from sleep 
I'm hungry and cold 
There's a weight hanging over my shoulders 
A rain black cloud of doubt Have I got enough love 
Have I got enough hope? 
Enough strength to face the world each day? 
I know there's an answer somewhere in this night 
I see her each time I look in your eyes I'm walking in a wild place 
I am banging on the gates 
On the other side of the tracks babe 
Hoping that someone's gonna hear me pray Oh there's a dawn chorus breaking out all over the town Will you say you want me, 
Wwill I say I want you? 
Will you say you love me 
When I'm stripped and forced to stand up naked 
And will I still love you The goal that I want can't exist without fire 
And you fire the thoughts that realise all my dreams 
These are a grown man's tears I lost all faith, I lost all hope 
I started drinking, life became a joke 
Something would keep me going. 
I didn't know what it was 
But I saw it each time I looked in your eyes I'm walking in a wild place 
I am banging on the gates 
On the other side of the tracks babe 
Hoping that someone's gonna hear me pray Oh there's a dawn chorus breaking out all over the town Oh my god 
Why do I feel the doubt You give me something I can't live without 
Yet from somewhere there comes an emptiness 
A feeling that I can't suppress Is this the start of the beginning or the point of no return? There's an answer there 
When I look in your eyes I'm walking in a wild place 
I am banging on the gates 
On the other side of the tracks babe 
Where all my doubts are now laid away away away away 
I'm walking in a wild place 
I am banging on the gates 
On the other side of the tracks babe 
Where someone answered my prayers Oh there's a dawn chorus breaking out all over the town (That's too sad)
