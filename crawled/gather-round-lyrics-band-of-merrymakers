The air is full of 
Joy and laughter 
Friends are knockin' 
at the door 
Kindling crackin' 
On the fire 
Who could ever ask for more Oh there's christmas trees 
And christmas lights 
Warming up December nights 
Ohhhh 
Come join the crowd Gather round 
Gather round 
All that matters 
Is the love 
We're feeling now 
Gather round 
Gather round 
Cause were all in this together 
Gather round So the year 
has brought it's sadness 
For every loss 
For every tear 
Hold on tight until it passes 
New beginnings 
and New Years Oh they're caroling 
A christmas song 
you know by heart 
So sing along 
Ohhhh 
So come join the crowd Gather round 
Gather round 
All that matters 
is the love 
we're feeling now 
Gather round 
Gather round 
Cause were all in this together 
Gather round Come gather round 
Come gather round 
Come gather round 
Come gather round 
Come gather round 
Come gather round 
Hey
