All the beautiful strangers 
Who help me through the nights 
And fell down into darkness 
On pillow soft and white All the beautiful strangers 
All in the afternoon 
Who prays my flat little stomach 
And came back to my own All the beautiful strangers 
Who help me through the nights 
And fell down into darkness 
On pillow soft and white They taught me neon's just as nice 
'Cause afternoon sun shines
