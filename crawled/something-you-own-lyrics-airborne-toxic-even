All these buckets of rain 
I've heard enough about 
You say that I lied 
I am a gentlemen 
Didn't I ask for a place I could stay 
Well, what were we both thinking 
the next part just got in the way? 
You were just always talking about Changing 
What if I was the same man 
The same I always was All these things that you say 
Like i'll forget about 
The mind-numbing games that you play 
I am a gentlemen 
Didn't I pay for every laugh every dime, 
Every bit in return 
And then you feed me some lie 
I wont hear one more word about Changing 
Guess what I am the same man same man I've always been Days pass and turn into weeks 
when we don't even speak 
We just lay wide awake 
And pretend we're asleep 
And you go home alone 
And your checking your phone 
And you're looking at me 
Like I'm Something You Own All these buckets of rain 
You cant forget about 
You say I'll never try 
I am a gentlemen 
Didn't I answer every time that you called 
Picked you up when you fall 
But you never listened at all 
You were just always talking about Changing 
Guess what I am the same man, same man Changing guess what I am the same man, same man Changing guess what I am the same man, same man
