If we leave here, will we be the same 
Lost on roads, nowhere behind pain 
Nowhere ahead now, we tattoo, on scar tissue 
We see people, obsessed with issues 
Learn to be strong, alone in the dark 
Lose out on luck, glisten in our eyes 
Where do we go when we die? Lost in the oceans, lost in a glass box 
How to open it, somehow we forgot Time passed near us, beside our season 
Listen to self, listen to our own reason We keep quiet like whispers in the dark 
We let life go to waste as we part We keep quiet like whispers in the dark 
We let life go to waste as we part Lost in the oceans, lost in a glass box 
How to open it, somehow we forgot Time passed near us, beside our season 
Listen to self, listen to our own reason Repeat :
