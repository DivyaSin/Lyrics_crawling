How I feel is how I feel 
How I feel is all alone 
I'm in a room of friends dressed like strangers 
What I want when I want 
I thought I wanted to be free 
But somewhere on my way here it hit me 
At what moment I can't say 
I turned around and you were gone 
I realized that I was wrong 
I need you How I feel is how I feel 
How I feel is out of touch 
I've just got to see you tonight So afraid to open up 
I wont make the same mistake 
Really trying to say is 
I need you How I feel is how I feel 
How I feel is all alone 
I've just got to see you tonight
