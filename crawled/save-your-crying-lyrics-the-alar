You say that there's no place to run to 
Is that any kind of place for you to hide? 
You say no one is telling you the truth anymore 
Then for God's sake who's telling lies? 
Now you might need something to believe in 
Thatl help you to see what is right 
So save it 'til later and later and later again Save all your crying 'til later 
Take a hard, hard look around 
Save all your crying 'til later 
You know it won't fall down If today feels like it never should be 
And you can't get your words out right 
And the pressure is down like a guillotine 
To cut off every road from the light 
Now you might need something to believe in 
Thatl help you to see what is right 
So save it 'til later and later and later again Save all your crying 'til later 
Take a hard, hard look around 
Save all your crying 'til later 
Because it won't fall down Nothing I ever do seems to please you honey 
You always seem to need more than I've got 
But I going to love you 
So save it il later and later and later again Save all your crying 'til later 
Take a hard, hard look around 
Save all your crying 'til later 
Because it won't fall down 
You know it won't fall down 'Cause it won't fall down
