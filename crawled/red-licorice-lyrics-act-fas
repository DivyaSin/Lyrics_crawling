This is it 
We're all going down 
What would be next 
What unsuspecting town 
Trajedies have come and gone 
What horrors lay in the dark 
The echo of another shot 
Another psycho makes his mark *chorus* 
This is when we all fall 
When everyday kids 
Are dying in hs halls 
Children lying dead 
It seems that everyday 
Another hate filled kid 
Another trajedy What a way to end it 
With drug dealers and gangs 
Living amongst us 
Causing violence and hate 
With ignorant parents 
Missing every sign 
Another kid with a gun 
How many more have to die
