I was going blind 
Almost lost my mind 
Letting go what we could share 
I'll love you always 
Conections like ours are not made to fade I thought i could find someone else to mind 
Moving past these routine days 
I'll love you always 
Conections like ours are not made to fade Just the way it is 
Just a song now 
Just the way it is now 
Just the way it is 
Just a song now 
Just the way it is now I thought i could find someone else to mind 
Moving past these routine days 
I'll love you always 
Conections like ours are not made to fade Just the way it is 
Just a song now 
Just the way it is now 
Just the way it is 
Just a song now 
Just the way it is now You were the first, now i believe 
Show me my thirst 
You let me lead 
You had to grow 
I had to go 
Maybe if we lived just at night 
With no expectations 
Shortening our real life 
Was our degradation Just the way it is...now. 
I, i was going blind 
I, almost lost my mind 
I'm letting go what we could share 
I'll love you always 
Conections like ours are not made to...fade away
