*Chorus 
Never in my life have I wanted anyone 
As much as you my love is true 
And I will give up everything in my life 
So you can stay with me (yeaheee) Never in my life have I wanted anyone 
As much as you my love is true 
And I will give up everything in my life 
So you can stay with me (yeaheee) Verse 1 
Everything we do together 
I'm gonna cherish in my heart 'coz I love you and I said so 
I made a promise to myself 
That I'll never let you go 
And I promise I will never hurt you 
Always try to be the one who's right 
But in the end you were right and I was wrong 
'Coz girl I'm gonna miss you 'coz deep inside I really love you *Chorus Verse 2 
I've always tried my best to be there for you 
In your times of need when you was crying all alone girl 
It breaks my heart when I see you cry 
Catching all the tear drops from your eye 
A lovers guide to perfection 
All you have to do is open up and just take your time 
But still I'm gonna miss you 'coz deep inside I really love you *Chorus Bridge 
I'm gonna miss you 
I'm gonna miss you 
Say 
I'm gonna miss you 
I'm gonna miss you 
Say *Chorus Never in my life have I wanted anyone 
As much as you 
And I will give up everything in my life 
So you could stay with me (yeaheee) Never in my life have I wanted anyone 
As much as you 
And I will give up everything in my life 
So you could stay with me (yeaheee) *Chorus (Fade Out)
