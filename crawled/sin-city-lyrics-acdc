Diamonds, and dust 
Poor man last, rich man first 
Lamborghinis, caviar 
Dry martini, Shangi-La I've got a burnin' feelin' 
Deep inside of me 
It's yearnin' 
But I'm gonna set it free I'm goin' in 
To Sin City 
I'm gonna win 
In Sin City Where the lights are bright 
Do the town tonight 
I'm gonna win 
In Sin City 
Oh, let me roll you baby! Ladders and snakes 
Ladders give, snakes take 
Rich man poor man 
Beggar man, thief 
Ain't got a hope in hell 
That's my belief 
Fingers Freddie, Diamond Jim 
They're gettin' ready 
Look out! I'm comin' in! So spin that wheel, cut that pack 
And roll those loaded dice 
Bring on the dancing girls 
And put the champagne on ice I'm goin' in 
To Sin City 
I'm gonna win 
In Sin City Where the lights are bright 
Do the town tonight 
I'm goin' in 
To Sin City
