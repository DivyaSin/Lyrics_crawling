pumping ice in my veins 
warming up my whole heart 
reaching up to my spirit 
forging sick true desires sensing my scratching blades 
sharply cutting hard white ice 
once more rushing in this track 
made of speed and thin air enjoying the nature around me 
being a part of this dream 
sensing the rejoicing glory 
of pure and pristine surroundings I feel Adrenaline 
I sense Adrenaline 
Adrenaline 
in the nature I feel 
Adrenaline 
Adrenaline sliding in a tight white line 
diving into the spheres of speed 
to be faster to feel alive 
and reach a point beyond myself feeling raw basic emotions 
getting power from (the) outside 
speeding down beyond the threes 
to feel moving to feel fast moving fast moving swiftly 
exploring all my unreached limits 
allowing all (the) strenghts of nature 
to freely flow inside my heart I feel Adrenaline 
I sense Adrenaline 
Adrenaline 
in the nature I feel 
Adrenaline 
Adrenaline pumping ice in my veins 
warming up my whole heart 
reaching up to my spirit 
forging sick true desires sensing my scratching blades 
sharply cutting hard white ice 
once more rushing in this track 
made of speed and pure air enjoying the wild around me 
being a part of this dream 
unified to the the nature 
to reach a point beyond myself I feel Adrenaline 
I sense Adrenaline 
Adrenaline 
in the nature I feel 
Adrenaline 
Adrenaline
