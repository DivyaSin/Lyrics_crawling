The battle begins, side by side 
A battle of life and death 
The battle starts 
Mighty men with might swords Kill their enemies 
Screams can be heard 
All over the land 
Carried by the wind Screams can be heard all over the land 
Screams, full of pain and despair This bloody battle 
Takes a very long time 
But the enemies fought 
Until the bitter end in this bloody inferno Raise your mighty swords and fight 
Raise your mighty swords and do as Wotan pleases 
Tyrael, the mighty warrior was exhausted Dein sohn braucht dich 
He longed for his father and his wife 
Ich begehre dich 
Verlass uns bitte nicht Raise your mighty swords and fight 
A battle to the blood, day by day 
A battle to the flesh, day by day Hit by an enemies sword through the heart 
He lay dying on the bloody ground 
And saw his life full of pride passing by 
Carried by the wind The last being he thought of, as dagaz 
Then the virgins led him to his master
