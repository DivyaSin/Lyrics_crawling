In the new 1920 ziegfeld follies world war I tribute number: Eddie: 
Our boys went rat-tat-tat-tat, 
Rat-tat-tat-tat, 
And shot the kaiser where he sat-tat-tat-at. 
With every poppity-pop, 
Some kraut took a drop. 
American boys are all such straight shooters-- 
We'll take care of him, mother, 
When he comes home from the war. 
We'll take care of him, mother, 
We'll do everything that you would do--yeah--and more. 
Rat-tat-tat-tat, 
We'll give their backs a big pat. 
They deserve a future full of joys 
'cause they're our yankee doodle, 
Yankee doodle, 
Yankee doodle, 
Doughboys. 
Company--order--arms--roll call-- 
Company: 
I'm private jones from arkansas, 
I'm private smith from kansas, 
I'm private ryan from maine, 
I'm private burke from wisconsin, 
I'm private o'brien from texas, 
I'm private muntz from michigan, 
Fanny: 
.i'm private schvartz from rock-a-way, 
And I guess you heard reports 
That the kaiser runs a block away 
When they tell him, here comes schvartz, 
'cause ven I get mad, believe it, jack, 
Out from nowhere comes a maniac, 
A kick in the foot, 
A shot in the pants-- 
I wouldn't give a second chance. 
Schvartz from rock-a-way. 
Chorus: 
Private schwartz 
Private schwartz 
Private schwartz from rock-a-way. 
Fanny: 
I met mademoiselle from armentieres 
And my bagels gave a spin (oy, yoy), 
She said, private schvartz, 
Come closer, dear! 
What a tzimmis I got in! 
Ven you're fighting for democracy, 
Call on irving schvartz and company, 
I'm through and through 
Red, white and bluish, 
I talk this way 
Because I'm british. 
Tell far rock-a-way, don't pull the dock away, 
'cause sailing home is general schvartz. 
All: 
Rat-ta ta ta ta tat, 
We'll give their backs a big pat. 
They deserve a great big medal 
And a loud huzzah, 
Over here and over there 
You'll hear 
Rat-tat a tat tat, 
Rat-tat a tat tat, 
Rat tat a tat tat tat, 
That's our yankee doodle, 
Yankee doodle 
Rat tat a tat tat tat 
Hurrah.
