Johnny's pissed of at the institute of social oppression 
he's had enough & he can't take no more 
johnny's so tired of being held down by the system 
the rich get rich and the poor stay poor 
johnny bought a cookbook 
and he locked himself inside his bedroom 
now he's got a back full of pipebombs 
johnny took a gasp as he sliped on his ski-mask 
now he's in the bank and he's singing this song 
i won't be another content slave 
that you opress because i crave 
for the annihilation of your existance 
feel my hate feel my resistance 
and the system has brought to its knees 
then i heard him scream... 
destroy what destroys you
