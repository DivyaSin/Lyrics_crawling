Cold sweat in nightmares 
The desolate one 
Deceived by betrayers 
Alone in a crystal ball All hopes are shattered dreams 
Through the lens of a neon screen 
The hourglass is sifting 
Terminal from the final incision Send signals to space, burned bridges 
Too late, the loner is rising 
Beware, I've nothing left, nothing left A silhouette of disfigured 
Transparent hypocrisies 
A cry through sullen walls 
I laugh with despise Running through the corridor 
I've opened the door 
The hourglass is sifting 
Trying to heal from the final Send signals to space, burned bridges 
Too late, the loner is rising 
Beware, I've nothing left, nothing left Send signals to space, burned bridges 
Too late, the loner is rising 
Beware, I've nothing left, nothing left My lips are cracked from the heat 
In the desert of pain 
The sandstorm cracks my feet 
Getting over the storm The crystal balls open highway 
Has opened the door 
In my climb I'm like a mirror 
Your reflection shatters on you Nothing left
