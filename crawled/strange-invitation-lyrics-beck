I've been drifting along in the same stale old shoes 
Loose ends tyin' a noose in the back of my mind 
If you thought that you were making your way 
To where the puzzles and pagans lay 
I'll put it together, it's a strange invitation When I wake up, someone will sweep up my lazy bones 
And we will rise in the cool of the evening 
I remember the way that you smiled 
When the gravity shackles were wild 
Something is vacant when I think it's all beginning And I've been drifting along in the same stale old shoes 
Loose ends tyin' a noose in the back of my mind 
If you thought that you were making your way 
To where the puzzles and pagans lay 
Put it together, it's a strange invitation It's a strange invitation 
It's a strange invitation 
It's a strange invitation 
It's a strange invitation
