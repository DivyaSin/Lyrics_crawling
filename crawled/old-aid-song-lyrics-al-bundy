We are the old, we've got arthritis, 
our gums are weak (so weak), from gingivitis. We are the old, we've got arthritis, 
wi are the ones who wear fifocals, and have bursitis. There are people, younger, but we heed another call, 
we really need the money, our accountants took it all, 
we sing to you, those who have money, 
once we were cool, but now we just dress funny. 
We need your help, so please please dig deep, 
don't call after ten, 'caus we'll be asleep. 
We have medicare, and anti-gas pills, 
but without your help, we can't pay our alimony bills. We are the old, (the are the old), 
We have arthritis ( they have arthritis), 
once vwe were gods, now golf exites us (golf exite'em).
