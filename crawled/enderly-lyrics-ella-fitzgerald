The evening breeze 
Caressed the trees, tenderly 
The trembling trees 
Embraced the breeze, tenderly Then you and I 
Came wandering by 
And lost in a sigh 
Were we The shore was kissed 
By sea and mist, tenderly 
I can't forget 
How two hearts met 
Breathlessly Your arms opened wide 
And closed me inside 
You took my lips 
You took my love 
So tenderly The evening breeze 
Erased the trees, tenderly 
The trembling trees 
Embraced the breeze, tenderly Then you and I 
Came wandering by 
And lost in a sigh 
Were we The shore was kissed 
By the mist, tenderly 
I can't forget 
How two hearts met 
Tenderly Your arms opened wide 
And closed me inside 
You took my chops 
Way from bops 
Tenderly Tenderly 
Tenderly 
Oh oh 
Oh oh
