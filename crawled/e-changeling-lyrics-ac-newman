It's not war, it's more like a warning 
There with front row tickets to the public burning 
Found in the strip search, the skins have beaten the shirts 
Love will travel, yeah, let's say it will 
We know where it goes, you know the drill 
Get guilty, kid 
Get guilty, go With the same cruel sense of humor that you came with 
With the same cruel sense of humor that you came with Change your mind 
Change your mind She kissed the back of my hand and she smiled 
Walked away whispering into the wild 
Get guilty, kid 
Get guilty, go With the same cruel sense of humor that you came with 
With the same cruel sense of humor that you came with Change your mind 
Change your mind And I will die with my foot in my mouth 
More magnetic if anything because I had to 
Get guilty, kid 
Get guilty, go With the same cruel sense of humor that I came with 
With the same cruel sense of humor that I came with Change your mind 
Change your mind 
Change your mind 
Change your mind
