If I said I loved you 
Would you stay around me 
Or would you run 
Scared of the power 
Love can become 
If I tried to hold you 
Would I reach to find you gone 
Will there be a day 
You'll stare at real love 
And not turn away 
I'll feel the power 
And be blinded by the light 
I can touch the magic 
That waits for us tonight 
But You 
You are afraid 
When we make love It's love that I make 
But You are afraid 
I'll feel the power 
And be blinded by the light 
I can touch the magic 
That waits for us tonight 
But You 
You are afriad 
When we make love 
It's love that I make 
But You are afraid 
'cause You 
You are afraid 
When we make love 
It's love that I make 
But You are afraid 
Afraid
