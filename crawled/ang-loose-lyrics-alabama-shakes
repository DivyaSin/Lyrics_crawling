Dont worry sweet baby! 
Dont you ever worry bout a thing 
Put your worries on the shelf 
learn to love yourself, don't be your 
own worst enemy. 
Chorus: 
Hang loose, hang loose 
Hang loose, hang loose 
Flow with the time and Imma take care of you! Come with me, sweet darling 
I got. a ticket for the plane 
We gonna fly to Wikiki, it just be you and me 
And well let the sun melt our cares away. 
Chorus: 
Hang loose, hang loosele the ocean worry bout being blue 
Hang loose, hang loose 
Flow with the time and Imma take care of you! Alright, we gonna be alright 
Alright, you gonna be alright! I hang loose 
I hang loose 
Hang loose 
I hang loose
