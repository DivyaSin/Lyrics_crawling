I guess I didn't see 
How much she meant to me 
I let opportunity pass me by Been sitting firmly on the fence 
When I came to my sense 
And I let her know just how I feel inside 
Well I guess I took too long Cause she's gone, gone 
Love has a way of moving on Every day and every night 
I'm living the words I write 
And I've been singing a lot of heartbreak songs She couldn't stand the wait 
Now it's too little too late 
My hindsight shows me I was wrong 
Well you don't know what you got Til it's gone, gone 
Love has a way of moving on 
Yeah she's gone, gone 
Love has a way of moving on Well, you don't know what you've got 
Yeah, you don't know what you've got Til it's gone, gone 
Love has a way of moving on 
Yeah, she's gone, gone 
Love has a way of moving on 
Oh, my baby's gone
