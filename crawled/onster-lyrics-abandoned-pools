Everyone's a genius 
Brushing up on irony 
But no, no one's free Everyone's a salesman 
Gushing with sincerity 
Or so so it seems I wanna go another round 
I wanna blow the monster down 
I wanna go another round 
'Cos I am coming up 
I am coming back Everyone's a rock star 
Look how cool and dark you are 
Oh, what's become of me now? We'll bust out the mission 
We'll bust the holier than thee 
Okay then we'll be free I wanna go another round 
I wanna blow the monster down 
I wanna go another round 
'Cos I am coming up 
I am coming back Lay me on the table operate on me 
Spin me like a record scratch 
The needle back and forth I wanna go another round 
I wanna blow the monster down 
I wanna go another round 
'Cos I am coming up 
I am coming back
