Moon in shadows, hiding faces in a blue-eyed dead-end-night 
Broken dreams and colded heart-beats standing tender by my side 
Light is fading into darkness, time to kiss your soul good night 
Waiting for the everlasting, god-allmighty golden light 
Where the sun burns, I will be there, once upon in former time 
All the laughter, all this fighting, seem to be a part of mine People 
Oh you people 
You people here I am 
Take me, keep me, claim me now 
Punish me - I smile somehow 
Yeah, I stay, I'll never look back 
I know how it feels, when red turns to black Stars and stripes behind the window, colourful against the sky 
Streetcars passing towards nowhere, watching me to say good-bye 
Where the sun burns, I will be there, once upon in former time 
All the laughter, all this fighting, seem to be a part of mine I am over, high above 
I'm falling like I felt in love 
I am high, far in the air 
Yeah, I know who will be there
