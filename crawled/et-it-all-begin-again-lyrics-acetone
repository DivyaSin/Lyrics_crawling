I'm thinking of a world, a world of many colors 
I'm thinking of a time, when time was not a fear 
I'm dreaming of the sea, it's cristal clear to me I'm seakin' and i'm tired, I'm shining through the shivers 
From underneath my bed, still smiling at the sun 
I leave my spirit level times upon a devil I'm singing to the sky :
