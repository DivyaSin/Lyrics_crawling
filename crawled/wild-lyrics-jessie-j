If I go hard, let me tell you that it's worth it 
Play the right cards, I ain't afraid to work it 
Brush em right off, when they say I don't deserve it 
Hands on my heart, you keep my fire burning Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name 
Love it when you rock me over every day 
When I think about it I could go insane 
Here we are as beautiful, I'm blown away If this is a dream won't open my eyes 
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive 
I just can't believe that this is my life 
In my fantasy we're running wild If this is a dream won't open my eyes 
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive 
I just can't believe that this is my life 
In my fantasy we're running wild When it get rough, then the rain starts pouring 
I turn up the heat cause the drama ain't important 
Let em all talk talk, I'mma just ignore it 
Hands on my heart, you you keep me moving forward Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name 
Love it when you rock me over every day 
When I think about it I could go insane 
Here we are as beautiful, I'm blown away If this is a dream won't open my eyes 
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive 
I just can't believe that this is my life 
In my fantasy we're running wild If this is a dream won't open my eyes 
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive 
I just can't believe that this is my life 
In my fantasy we're running wild Today I woke up feeling like the mayor 
I spend about an hour looking in the mirror 
As I should, as much as I've been through 
It's a wonder I look this damn good 
I could probably make it out any situation that you try to put me into 
If I swim with the piranhas, guarantee that I'mma probably have a fish dinner 
I meet a young girl with a sexy shape 
Like Jessie J, we escapade 
Where its extra shade, she make me want to give in 
Not take in like collection plates 
Wow, all these wars, bras, cars, wall to wall, was all a mirage 
And I could lose it all tonight just to show the world I could do it twice 
It's my life If this is a dream won't open my eyes 
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive 
I just can't believe that this is my life 
In my fantasy we're running wild If this is a dream won't open my eyes 
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive 
I just can't believe that this is my life 
In my fantasy we're running wild
