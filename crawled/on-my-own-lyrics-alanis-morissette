Why do I feel it's all up to me to see that 
Everything's right and it's how it should be 
Why don't they just leave me alone 
I've got to prove I can 
Little girl with stars in her eyes they've 
Got her all figured out and there's nowhere 
To hide why can't they all see who I am 
When will they understand It may take some time they don't know how 
It feels because they can't read my mind 
They always say I'm too young and they 
Feel they should help me 
But I can make it all alone out here on my own 
Every day I feel so in demand and all I 
Wish I could find is a place I can land 
One day I'll feel comfort inside cause I'll 
Know who I am I can hold the line if I know in the end 
That I won't be left behind I don't regret 
What I've done I don't think you can blame me 
Now I'm standin' all alone out here on my own I'm not thinking 'bout leavin' home 
But I need to be on my own 
Doesn't mean I have a heart of stone 
I won't even ask them why 
I can't ever let them see me cry 
Here I'm standing all alone out here on my own... 
Out here on my own Feeling lost in a world full of lies 
I can't help thinkin' that love is just 
Passin' me by hold on to what I believe 
And keep an open hand Can I have it all if there's no one to 
Turn to when I stumble and fall 
Is there a secret I need because no one 
Has told me - all alone It may take some time cause I know 
How it feels to have a lot on your mind 
I'll never feel all alone 'cause I 
Know that I have me 
Now I can make it all alone out here on my own
