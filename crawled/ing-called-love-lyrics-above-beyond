There was a time 
There was a place 
But there was fear inside 
A witty lie to save my face 
The parachute of pride 
To cross the line takes a tiny step 
But will this spark cause the bridge to burn 
My fear entwined with my regret 
I'll be the path for safe return So here we are 
All just the same 
But you will never know 
My secret plan 
How close we came 
To share another role 
I haven't lost my only chance 
To tell you how I feel inside 
Is it just me 
I'd like to know 
Or are we all just a little blind? There's a thing called love 
That we all forget 
And it's a wasted love 
That we all regret 
You live your life just once 
So don't forget about a thing called love 
Don't forget, forget about a thing called love There's a thing called love 
That we all forget 
And it's a wasted love 
That we all regret 
You live your life just once 
So don't forget about a thing called love 
Don't forget, forget about a thing called love
