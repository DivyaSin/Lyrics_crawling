[Intro] 
Go Grizz 
Ahhhh, ah, ah [Verse 1] 
Nights like this i be cruising 
Seat laid back, windows down 
Got that boom-boom in my system 
Turn it up when i need to vent some 
See that other chick you been chasing 
She cute or whatever 
But i could introduce you to someone much better 
And you know that's me, much better [Pre-Chorus] (2X) 
If you want a bad bitch making money, check 
Need someone to call you up when your lonely, check 
Or put it on you real good when you want it 
Or put it on you real good when you want it [Chorus] 
I can love you right 
I'm not the jealous type, but boy i can treat you right 
Much better, much better. much better than she can 
Much better, much better, much better than she can 
But i'm not jealous cause i can treat you better [Verse 2] 
I see you going real hard, i see you giving her all 
But let me tell you all that she doing 
I can do it ten times over let me show ya 
That bitch ain't got nothing on me 
Please believe i aim to please 
Ain't no other chick gone outshow me (ah, ah, ahhhh) 
Your bitch can't outshow me [Pre Chorus] (2x)
