I know she's a tracker 
Any style that would back her 
They say she's a chooser 
But I just can't refuse her 
She was just there, but then she can't be here no more And as my mind unwheels 
I feel the freeze down in my knees 
But just before she leaves, she receives She's been down in the dunes 
And she's dealt with the goons 
Now she drinks from a bitter cup 
I'm trying to get her to give it up 
She was just here, I fear she can't be there no more It's long, long when she's gone 
I get weary holding on 
Now I'm coldly fading fast 
I don't think I'm gonna last very much longer
