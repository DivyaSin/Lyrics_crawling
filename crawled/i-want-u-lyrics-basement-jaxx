I don't know 
If I can give you anything to make you feel right 
I can but try but 
I can't stand the madness in my head the whole night through I've been thinking, I've been sinking 
Lost on Mars, got no paddle 
Not a super-catch, ain't no model 
Hardly seem to count, I'm just an ordinary bod Down didididi 
Down didididi 
Down Down 
Down didididi 
Down didididi I want you 
And everything you say just makes me want you 
And every single day I just want you in every single way 
And I'm just lost I don't know 
If I can give you anything to make you feel right 
I can but try but 
I can't stand the madness in my head the whole night through I've been thinking, I've been sinking 
Lost on Mars, got no paddle 
Not a super-catch, ain't no model 
Hardly seem to count, I'm just an ordinary bod Down didididi 
Down didididi 
Down Down 
Down didididi 
Down didididi I want you 
And everything you say just makes me want you 
And every single day and I just want you in every single way 
And I'm just lost I want you 
And everything you say just makes me want you 
And every single day and I just want you in every single way 
And I'm just lost
