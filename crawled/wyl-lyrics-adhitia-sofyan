A man will climb the highest mountain 
Fly to the moon and come back home 
But I cannot live without your love 
I stand up high in the pouring rain 
Have flashing thunder on my head 
But I still will not live without your love 
Everybody can laugh at my face 
Till Their jaws touched the ground 
I will be counting the days till I can run to you 
Rainfall will through and my work here is done 
And I'll come home to you 
A man swims the deepest ocean 
Some will sail around the world 
But I cannot live without your love 
I'll stand alone on a cemetery 
Search the world of the undead 
But still I will not live without your love 
I give a little more 
I walk a little further 
Fly a little higher 
To get to you
