Hey baby, but I got someone an' you got someone too 
Hey baby, but I don't know what we're gonna do 
How can somethin' wrong feel so right? 
C'mon baby hold on tight Before the night is over 
We gonna get what we desire 
Remember what I told ya 
This could set our hearts on fire Hey baby, we're old enough to know that it's a sin 
Hey baby, oh the door is open, slide on in 
Yea, this feels too good to be true 
I'll tell you what I wanna do Before the night is over 
We gonna get what we desire 
Remember what I told ya 
This could set our hearts on fire Before the night is over 
We gonna get what we desire 
Remember what I told ya 
This could set our hearts on fire Yeah! Before the night is over 
We gonna get what we desire 
Remember what I told ya 
This could set our hearts on fire Before the night is over

Before the night is over I don't wanna tell a lie 
This is somethin' we can't hide
