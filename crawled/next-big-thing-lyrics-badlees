The kings of America were falling out of fashion 
The system systematically was shooting out their lights 
Driven to the level of paparazzi comers 
They bid the public an ugly goodnight Well, the shaved and depraved 
The concealed and the well-healed 
The maintained and the drained 
The walking dead and the well-read All have a stake in the model and the make 
Of the latest star attractions CHORUS Can you tell us who's the next big thing 
Can you tell us who's the next big thing 
We know they ain't gonna last 
But it's always a blast to devour every second The girl in the pressure cooker's losing her mystique now 
The brains at The Star say she's dying by degrees 
With tales of self abuse and a criminal citation 
Her sun is setting in the Hollywood sea Well, the ares and the ain'ts 
The gratified and the fried 
The diseased and the pleased 
The endowed and the street crowd All want a piece of the latest release 
To stroke the head of their condition CHORUS
