Dark clouds above your head 
All I see is blue sky 
Love's shining light on me 
Let me see through your eyes 
I never needed someone else 
It's too revealing 
It'll only try to pull yourself 
in believing Don't you wanna know 
How I feel 
Don't you wanna know 
How I feel Love lets you down again 
But I made my own choice 
Can't seem to find your way 
When you speak with my voice 
Everything's wrong that could be right 
I was so excited 
Don't be afraid, of all your light 
Just fight it
