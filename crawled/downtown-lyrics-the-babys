If you want to get in touch with me 
If you want to chance the US mail 
I can show you things you've never seen 
I can tell you girl it never fails 
Let me take you 
Where a million (can't decipher?) will chime for you 
And the music flashes through the air 
There is nowhere else for us to be 
Come on baby let me take you there 
Let me take you around 
Get your feet off the ground 
No way we won't be found 
Yeah, let me take you Downtown 
Come on, come on 
Come on, come on 
I can hear my heart beat faster now 
I can feel yours too babe 
Take my hand and I will show you 
Do anything you want to do 
Let me take you 
We can stay out till the morning light 
Out in the street. out in the night 
I got a pocket full of money 
And it's bound to be alright 
Let me take you around 
Get your feet off the ground 
No way, we can't be found 
Yeah, let me take you Downtown 
Come on, come on 
Come on, come on 
We'll take your Daddy's car 
Drive it into town 
Put on your best dress girl 
I said come on out 
Come on babe 
Come on out, come on 
I'm gonna take you 
I can hear my heart beat faster now 
I can feel yours too babe 
Take my hand and I will show you 
Do anything you want to do 
Let me take you around 
Get your feet off the ground 
No way, we won't be found 
Yeah, come on I'll take you Downtown 
Come on, come on 
I'm gonna take you around 
Get your feet off the ground 
I'm gonna take you..
