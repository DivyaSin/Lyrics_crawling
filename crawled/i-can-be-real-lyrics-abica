Help me now and tell me what to do 
I can't believe what was never true 
I can't pretend that I wasn't fucking there 
And I know you don't believe that I didn't even care 
It's the best kept secret for the few that need it 
The broken tries led to lies now you can believe it 
Come and take back all that you've been hanging on 
You'll be done being numb take a chance and come on like Chorus 
Tell me what you got I need I'll let it come take care of me 
Blackened eyes it tastes like nothing but I'm finally feeling something 
Take it in and uhh ya it feels so right 
I can become something I can feel so real like you tonight No you don't need to know, don't need to care 
You can be here but you're never really there 
Take it from me this ain't where you want to be 
Deny all the lies and you'll finally be free 
I see you looking now 
I see you wanna know how 
I can show I can lead but make sure that it's what you need 
Ya I know what it's like that's why I'm trying to help 
I got a bag full of colors that I'm keeping for myself 
You see the blank stare in my cold eyes 
Till I take a taste and I'm dazed in a real high, alive 
I feel it creeping slow 
I feel it start to flow 
The only problem is the trip you get you'll never know Tell me what you got I need I'll let it come take care of me 
Blackened eyes it tastes like nothing but I'm finally feeling something 
Take it in and uhh ya it feels so right 
I can become something I can feel so real like you tonight I can feel so real like you tonight 
I can feel so real like you tonight 
I can feel so real like you tonight 
I can feel so real like you tonight 
I still feel alone when you're next to me 
Till I take this pill it's testing me 
It could make me hurt, take the best of me 
Or it could feel so good like ecstasy 
Or it could feel so good like ecstasy 
Or it could feel so good like ecstasy I can feel something 
I finally feel something 
I finally feel 
I'm finally real Tell me what you got I need I'll let it come take care of me 
Blackened eyes it tastes like nothing but I'm finally feeling something 
Take it in and uhh ya it feels so right 
I can become something I can feel so real like you tonight It's one of those trips it won't let go 
Got a razor and a mirror, tears and a throat 
Everything that's made me numb has returned 
All the scars in my head turns to fire and it burns 
Tell me what you got I need I'll let it come destroy me 
I said it's what I needed and it is if it stops 
And I said I need to feel like I'm real but I'm not 
And I know it's what I needed and I hope it never stops 
And I know I want to feel like I'm real but I'm not 
Stop. And let me off or just let go 
Is it worth being real I still don't know 
But I'll tell you what I got I just don't need 
So I'll always take chance it sets me free just
