Blood for the scars and the stars 
And the stripes in my hand 
And they've been telling me we're lost 
Double crossed, that I don't understand 
But when everyone's running, is when I will stand 
We'll be together, until the end We're undivided 
We're bound by a thousand days 
We're undivided 
We belong each and every way 
If they could just see us 
No daylight between us 
That'll never change (that'll never change) 
When everyone's left you 
Whatever you've been through 
I will remain (I will remain) 
We're undivided Pushed to the edge, words were said 
Only healing remains 
And I know you know me best, all my joy all my 
Flaws, all my pain 
One in a million, through thick and thin 
This is a lifetime, we're choosing to spend We're undivided 
We're bound by a thousand days 
We're undivided 
We belong each and every way 
If they could just see us 
No daylight between us 
That'll never change (that'll never change) 
When everyone's left you 
Whatever you've been through 
I will remain (I will remain) 
We're undivided It's you and I here 
I'm never gonna let you go (never gonna let you go) 
It's you and I here I love you more than you'll ever knkow We're undivided 
We're bound by a thousand days 
We're undivided 
We belong each and every way 
If they could just see us 
No daylight between us 
That'll never change (that'll never change) 
When everyone's left you 
Whatever you've been through 
I will remain (I will remain) 
We're undivided
