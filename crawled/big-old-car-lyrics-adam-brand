This big old car, gonna take us home 
This big old car, gonna take us home 
Gonna take us home to what we know so well 
This big old car gonna take us home Gonna take us all the way to Brisbane 
All the way to Cairns 
Back across to Katherine 
To the Fitzroy River sands 
Gonna see the Indian Ocean 
And we'll turn around and then 
This big old car's gonna take us home again Ain't got no rattle free transmission 
Ain't no good around the town 
There's no fitted air conditioning 
We just roll the windows down 
And throw another tape in 
And turn it up and pray 
This big old car gonna take us all the way This big old car gonna take us home 
This big old car gonna take us home 
Gonna take us home to what we know so well 
This big old car gonna take us home 
This big old car gonna take us home 
Gonna take us all the way and back 
However far we roam 
Take us all the way to 
Chroma plated big V8'd heaven 
This big old car's gonna take us home again
