She got a nasty reputation and a talent for sin 
She's the kinda trouble i'd like to be in 
I wanna be a lover - I wanna be a slave 
But she's the kinda women makes me wanna misbehave 
So give it what you want boy - let's make it understood 
That if ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good She says there'll be no lying - no foolin' around 
No seven day weekends - 
no nights on the town 
Well that's the way I want it - 
that's the way it's gotta be 
If you're looking for trouble better get it from me 
So get on your knees boy and do what you should 
If ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good No she makes the laws - 
she calls the shots 
Do what she wants if you want what she's got 
Can't have it both ways - you gotta chose 
She can give you the rhythm or she can give you the blues 
Oh, if you want sugar better bring it on home 
Better keep it in the kitchen 'cause that's where it belongs 
You gotta make her happy boy 
Just take it from me 
Or you'll never get none of that tlc 
If you're tryin' to get lucky 
- better knock on wood 
If ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good I love the way ya look tonight 
With your hair hangin' down on your shoulders 
N' I love the way ya dance your slow sweet tango 
The way ya wanna do everything but talk 
And how ya stare at me with those undress me eyes 
Your breath on my body makes me warm inside Let's make out - let's do something amazing 
Let's do something that's all the way 
'cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch 
your body 
Now I never want to let your body go... Let's make a night - to remember 
From January - to December 
Let's make love - to excite us 
A memory - to ignite us 
Let's make honey baby - soft and tender 
Let's make sugar darlin' - sweet surrender 
Let's make a night - to remember - all life long I love the way ya move tonight 
Beads of sweat drippin' down your skin 
Me lying here - n' you lyin' there 
Our shadows on the wall and our hands everywhere Let's make out - let's do something amazing 
Let's do something that's all the way 
'cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch 
your body 
Now I never want to let your body go... Let's make a night - to remember 
From January - to December 
Let's make love - to excite us 
A memory - to ignite us 
Let's make honey baby - soft and tender 
Let's make sugar darlin' - sweet surrender 
Let's make a night - to remember - all life long I think about ya all the time 
Can't you see you drive me outta my mind 
Well I'm never holdin' back again 
Ya I never want this night to end 
'cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch 
your body 
Now I never want to let your body go...
