Love starts with a toothbrush 
A Bic razor and a Dixie cup 
A little splash of aftershave 
Before you leave for that first date 
I see stars in both your eyes 
After that long kiss goodnight Forever starts with a suitcase 
Sneaking out the window to get away 
To the car parked by the curb 
Gassed up for Gatlinburg 
A little chapel and a couple of rings 
Will get you two toothbrushes by the bathroom sink Everything that's anything 
Starts out as a little thing 
Just needs a little time and room to grow 
Step by step, day by day 
It all adds up along the way 
And the next thing that you know Life starts with a little house 
A corner lot on the edge of town 
A weed eater and a picket fence 
You think it's good as the getting gets 
Then she wakes up feeling bad 
You both wonder what's up with that Everything that's anything 
Starts out as a little thing 
Just needs a little time and room to grow 
Step by step, day by day 
It all adds up along the way 
And the next thing that you know One night around eight o'clock 
You scrub him down and you dry him off 
You pick him up and put his little feet 
On the stool by the bathroom sink 
You grab the crest and a Dixie cup 
It all hits you as he opens up 
Love starts with a toothbrush
