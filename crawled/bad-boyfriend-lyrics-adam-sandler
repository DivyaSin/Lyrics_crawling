Why don't you pick up after you're done? 
I'm not your slave, I'm not your mother 
I'm not your maid, I mean I've got a life too 
So fuck you Why can't you be nicer to my friend? They're gonna be here soon 
Last time they were here you just sat in the bedroom 
Friday you went out with your fat friend Lou, fuck you 
Why don't you ever ask about my Chinese cooking class? 
I only took it 'cause you like moo shu, fuck you I'm sorry honey, about the way I've been acting lately, fuck you 
Don't be like that, we'll visit your mom 
When I get some time off, fuck you 
I was at work, I wasn't at bar, fuck you I had the beer at work, for God's sake, fuck you 
By the way, would it be cool to go golfing tomorrow? Fuck you 
I was just kidding, I wanna hang out with you Why don't you ever take me to a play or a museum? 
There's an art gallery two blocks away and we've never been there 
We always do what you wanna do, fuck you 
You didn't notice I got new throw pillows for the sofa 
You didn't notice I had the kitchen painted blue Why don't you notice all those guys looking at me? 
You take me for granted 
Do you know there's a guy at work that always asks me out to lunch? 
I always try to look my best and you should too, fuck you Why won't I ever get out of this relationship? 
You're such a jerk, the only thing you do right is 
Tell me that you love me well, I guess I love you too 
But fuck you, seriously
