Hot right now (x4) See I'm hot right now 
Picture of the sun, see I'm hot right now Hot right now, hot right now, hot right now 
Hot right- hot right- hot right now 
Hot right now, hot right now, hot right now Get it while it's hot, get it- get it while it's hot (x4) I'm gon' get it while it's hot 'cause I don't like it cold 
I'm a valley boy rappin' so I change the mode 
Really not clueless just a cool negro 
Truth be told I'm a- I'm rap fo' sho' 
Sick and tired of hearin' 'bout all this global warmin' 
The reason why it's hot 'cause I came and stormed in 
Come get it or not is what I try to inform them 
Can't walk in these shoes 'cause my Vans're smolderin' 15 minutes is it fresh or off? 
All the fame you get if the pressure's off 
Hot 16's teen dreams and schemes 
Buku blogs fiends mucho blowin' steam 
Yes man I'm O.G. in the scene 
A long term success Imma be in the green 
It ain't buzz 
See what I mean? I get love 
Two different things but only one is enough I'm on another Fahrenheit, tearin' mics 
200 degrees burn MC's like kerosene
