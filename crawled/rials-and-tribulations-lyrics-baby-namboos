You're like the missing piece 
Of a day's old puzzle 
Try to shut me up 
I won't wear your muzzle 
Nobody's got my back 
I keep it our visual 
It's the only way, seems you wanna ridicule 
Trials and tribulations 
Cross the border through the nations 
With your juvenile intentions 
Things like our idle expectations 
Could you blame us like the famous 
We just wanna live like you too 
Do what you did to get you through Devious intentions but its a money making habit 
Just a hand to hand transaction 
So you might as well just grab it 
Station to station 'cause the city never sleeps 
Your rhythm driven hard, skips a beat The weekend's like some kind of Mecca 
Slow to come round those lips so wait quicker 
48 hours there ain't nothin' much better to do 
Than to mess up and get back together 
You drink your poison for personal pleasure 
Anticipation to arouse your own pleasure 
But my force remains the same 
Over a billion in making change ( Aurora Borealis Scatting ) The weekend's like some kind of Mecca 
Slow to come round those lips so wait quicker 
48 hours and nothin' much better to do 
Than to mess up and get back together 
You drink your poison for personal pleasure 
Anticipation to arouse your own pleasure 
But my force remains the same 
Over a billion in making change ( Aurora Borealis Scatting ) Well introducing myself well I'm just too much 
The MC on the mic with the magical touch 
Can turn silver into gold, fat into grass 
When I rock the microphone 
I'm bound to pass 
I got no oral levels, but massive degrees 
The reason for that is plain and easy 
'Cause when I went to school 
They said I was the weapon 
They stand up in the place with the D on my cap 
Yes sir 
Right about now you're shaking out the original- 
Willy Wee 
It goes Don't wanna be a hit or part of your clique 
About the present situation 
Seems that some are in a mission 
Tricky you got 
You gotta drink to drive 
You gotta go a lot 
Don't wanna drink from your trough 
To the top, but nothing less 
While you'd be bidding in your staple nest 
You're just bugging so why don't you give it a rest Don't wanna be a hit or part of your clique
