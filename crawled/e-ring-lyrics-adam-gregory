She stares at that ring on her finger 
With a far away look in her eyes 
She thinks of the memories that linger 
Of the good days that quickly flew by And she remembers the day 
When a young man would say 
That he'd found the love of his life 
She gave him her hand and he placed on a band 
And asked her if she'd be his wife And some may value its silver 
And some may value its gold 
But she knows no greater value 
Than the memories it holds She added a stone when the children were born 
And her husband now looks down from above 
She's lived a good life as a mother and wife 
And the ring is a symbol of love
