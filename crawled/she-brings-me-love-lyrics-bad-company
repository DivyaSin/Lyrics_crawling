Sometimes I get a feeling, 
Deep in my soul 
Sometimes I get a feeling, 
I just can't control Sometimes I get a feeling, 
Deep in my heart 
It's such a feeling that I know we'll never part [Chorus] 
She brings me love, love, I know it's all that I need. Sometimes I get a feeling, 
Deep in my bones 
Sometimes I get a feeling, 
Won't leave me alone Sometimes I get a feeling, 
Deep in, side 
It's such a feeling that my love I can't hide [Chorus:Repeat x2]
