Grew up in America in a little white house 
Drove my parents crazy - so they threw me out 
I thought I was a decent child 
But I guess I got a little too wild I've been through good times 
I've been through bad times 
But wouldn't change nothing - no I wanna hear some rock n' roll 
I'm an American man 
I wanna party all nite 
Till the crows come home 
I'm an American man 
I wanna find someone to love 
I'm an American man 
Gonna be somebody you can be proud of 
I'm an American man Got and old blue chevy and I fixed it up 
Went down to the city and got ripped off 
Gonna save my money 
Gonna get me a job 
Find a woman 
Then get back on the top (Pr-Refro)
