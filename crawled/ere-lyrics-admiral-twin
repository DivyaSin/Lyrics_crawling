I first met my girlfriend in the park one April day 
she was sitting underneath my favorite tree 
I had to say "you can't sit there" 
She laughed at me you know I couldn't help but like her 
told her so 
and then I guess I must've closed my eyes and kissed her 
looked again 
still there 
How did she get here? 
Why today appear? 
How can she be here? 
Minutes stretched to days to months 
we never left that spot 
I swear they had to mow around us 
carved our names into the tree and pledged that we'd be there 
One day we're talking 
suddenly she's got to play a game of hide and seek 
I close my eyes and count to ten 
look again 
she's gone 
Someone tell me please 
how long must I wait for her to be a good friend to her now? 
I can only count so high; the numbers just run out 
but I won't stop until they do 
Looked high and low, looked all around but couldn't find her 
climbed a tree--nothing to see but people looking at me funny 
called her name 
I swear I spent the next three years just trying to find her 
thought I saw her once or twice but I'm not sure 
one thing I know though: 
when she goes 
she's gone 
How can I be there 
when I can't find her anywhere? 
How can I be 
unless she is 
why should I be 
there.
