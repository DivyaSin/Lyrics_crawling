I must leave but will not 
Fear clutters thought 
Without I am alone 
Learn from what is known 
I see you within a dream 
All to dark to be seen 
In the past we have talked through friendship 
I'm living thought 
Why must it happens to us 
Our future will be small 
But not enough 
To make us part is what you sealed inside my heart 
It's coming down again 
So hard to breath with these blindfolded eyes 
I find myself facind reality 
You're not alone 
I'm still your friend 
Stand right behind you until the fucking end.
