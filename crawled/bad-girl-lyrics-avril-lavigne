Just lay your head in daddy's lap, you're a bad girl Bad girl (1-2-3-4) Hey, hey 
I let you walk all over me, me 
You know that I'm a little tease, tease 
But I wanna play there please, please You know you know you know I'm crazy 
I just wanna be your baby 
You can fuck me and then play me 
You love and you can hate me Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me Try me because I said so 
Struck me within my ego 
I've been a bad girl, don't you know? 
(Don't tell me what's your deal) 
Come get it now or never 
I'll let you do whatever 
I'll be your bad girl, bad girl 
(1-2-3-4) Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me Baby, you know I want a little taste, taste 
So let me take you all the way way

Before the bad girl! One night, you won't forget the rest of your life 
So come on over to the wild side 
Buckle up and baby hold on tight Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me 
We both know that love is wasting so fast Try me because I said so 
Struck me within my ego 
I've been a bad girl, don't you know? 
(Don't tell me what's your deal) 
Come get it now or never 
I'll let you do whatever 
I'll be your bad girl, bad girl
