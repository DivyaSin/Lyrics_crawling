What do you get for your anger 
And what do you get for your pain 
Its how you live this life in danger 
Your always on the go 
Still only scars remain 
Well its been so long since I have tried 
Yea its been so long since I have cried 
So life goes on 
Yea its been so long 
Yea its been so long sice I've felt the pain 
Well I'm movin east bound on the west bound train 
So life goes on 
Its been so long 
I try to do what is right now 
I don't try to do what is wrong 
The lies of guilt are comin out now 
And I sit here alone 
And sing another song 
Just take a look in the miror 
And tell me what do you see 
Down play the croud to the guily 
And make believe, and make believe you don't need me
