Oh yeah 
Whoa oh (Leondre:) 
There's this girl I know, she feels unknown 
Just wanna have attention, cries on her own 
Got nobody to go to she feels so scared 
Doesn't wanna go to school, cries in her bed 
She got a couple friends they think she's okay 
Inside the pain haunts her, day by day 
She still hasn't given up, she doesn't see the point 
She just wants happiness but emotions disappoint 
She blames herself, it drives her mad 
For every single little trouble that she's ever had 
The pain she endures you can see it through her shirt 
Bearing the scars of society's burns (Charlie:) 
No more pain 
No more tears 
There's no need to cry no more there's nothing left to fear 
No more pain 
No more tears 
You don't need to lie no more cause' now you know we're here (Leondre:) 
She hides herself, no one hears her cries 
If only you could see the world through her eyes 
All she wanted, is one little friend 
To stick by her til the very end 
She didn't ask for a lot, in fact nothing at all 
Yeah she was still hit around and called a fool 
She didn't wanna fight 
She just wanted some love 
When she was lonely just one hug 
And to feel like she was accepted 
Instead of pushed around, left out and rejected 
You gotta stay strong nothing lasts forever 
You are never alone, we'll do this together (Charlie:) 
No more pain 
No more tears 
There's no need to cry no more there's nothing left to fear 
No more pain 
No more tears 
You don't need to lie no more cause' now you know we're here (Leondre:) 
She can't take it no more 
She's taken enough 
She's been strong for so long but she ain't that tough 
Scared of letting go but no one seems to care 
(Charlie: Yeah) 
Scared to carry on cause' there's no one there 
A frustrated girl, bearing the scars 
Fighting her fears behind spiritual bars 
One day this girl, I saw her face 
She messed it with a smile (I could tell it was fake) 
She broke down in tears, said I saved her life 
Crying, she asked, "Can I be your wife?" 
I answered, "Hey there girl, tell me what is wrong" 
She told me everything so I dedicate this song (Charlie:) 
No more pain (don't cry) 
No more tears (no more tears running down your face) 
There's no need to cry no more there's nothing left to fear (no more pain) 
No more pain 
No more tears 
You don't need to lie no more cause' now you know we're here Ooooooo 
No more, 
Ooh ooh
