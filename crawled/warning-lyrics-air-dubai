And it feels like I can't go 
Move on to another chick no 
Hoes don't front when you settle in close 
Messing with a heart that ain't ever been broke 
Let it burn hot without letting it smoke 
Pieces hope she gets blowed 
Leaking those secrets, but put the past away 
I never let it drown what we have today 
And I rock, when I rock & roll 
Make it slap when I've got to go 
To the spot when it's hot & cold 
And I'm tryna move on but I've got to know 
When I'm living a lie killing the vibe 
Never gone back but I'm willing to try 
Stick to the party, drinks when it all seems bad 
When I make a big deal out of small things She's the bell of the ball, cream of the crop 
No wonder you never forgot her 
And all the drinks are flowing 
Not a good time to phone the bell of the ball, cream of the crop 
Mirrors all over the wall 
And now all the lights are flashing 
And all of the people dancing, I can't let go 
It's never been easy for me 
I can't let go, it's never been easy for me 
Baby that's just a warning Whoa now I'm faded 
Took shots never learned what to say when 
Drink more so I won't have to feel shit 
But it all comes back in the a.m. 
Yeah drunk girl look good 
She in Brooklyn now getting more hood 
Out in L.A. Now with the porn star 
In her blue on black Cadillac car 
Word, vintage drunk text to an ex 
And past chicks hard to get past 
When the drinks are endless 
Hard to get back when the high is spaceship 
You a cold girl right 
How could I blame you 
Out in the city of lights I figured in time 
The city would change you She's the bell of the ball, cream of the crop 
No wonder you never forgot her 
And all the drinks are flowing 
Not a good time to phone the bell of the ball, cream of the crop 
Mirrors all over the wall 
And now all the lights are flashing 
And all of the people dancing, I can't let go 
It's never been easy for me 
I can't let go, it's never been easy for me 
Baby that's just a warning It's just a warning 
It's just a warning 
It's just a warning 
It's just a warning She's the bell of the ball, cream of the crop 
No wonder you never forgot her 
And all the drinks are flowing 
Not a good time to phone the bell of the ball, cream of the crop 
Mirrors all over the wall 
And now all the lights are flashing 
And all of the people dancing, I can't let go 
It's never been easy for me 
I can't let go, it's never been easy for me 
Baby that's just a warning
