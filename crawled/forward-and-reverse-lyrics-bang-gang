You were like a glimpse on to the stars 
As we were dancing forward and reverse 
One whole day 
Under heavy rain 
Don't ever say 
That we weren't happy then You were like a glimpse on to the stars 
As we were dancing forward and reverse 
One whole day 
Under heavy rain 
Don't ever say 
That we weren't happy then I miss the times 
When everything was coming our way 
I wish those times 
Would brig us back together some day You were like a glimpse on to the stars 
As we were dancing forward and reverse 
One whole day
