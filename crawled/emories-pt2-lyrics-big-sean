Real shit Sometimes I dream bigger than I live 
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit 
So goin' and light it 
Roll it up, ignite it 
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it 
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin 
They saying sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moon walking 
And my middle name Michael ho 
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival 
But it's cool because I got the title ho 
See I just want my fantasies in real life 
You got everything tell me what it feel like 
Muthafuck the radio if I can't hear mine 
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines 
Is you feeling me? 
If not you feel my energy 
See I know I'ma make it, but even if I don't 
Don't feel bad 'cause honestly all the times that I had 
Those will be the best memories Let's reminisce 
(Be the best memories) 
Over the good times and the bad 
(I hope that you remember me) 
Reflect on everything we missed 
Cause you know we'll never get it back 
(These will be the best memories) 
Whoa the memories, 
Whoa the memories Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love 
Or lose your girlfriend to groupie love 
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs 
That's what happens when they need connections and you to plug 
How many trends you gotta set before you considered great 
How many missed calls before you considered fake 
How many dreams before its considered fate 
I'm eating in a world where I'm considered bait 
A workaholic addicted to bills 
People addicted to me 'cause they addicted to real 
My best friend got addicted to pills 
I can't look at him in his eyes, 
You don't know how that shit feels mentally! 
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory" 
I'm praying that he make it, wishing we could go back 
'Cause honestly all the times that we had 
Those be the best memories Let's reminisce 
(Be the best memories) 
Over the good times and the bad 
(I hope that you remember me) 
Reflect on everything we missed 
Cause you know we'll never get it back 
(These will be the best memories) 
Whoa the memories, 
Whoa the memories Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed 
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash 
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh 
I'm stressing over little shit 
When I should be happy I can 
They say my music beating, 'cause I follow my heart 
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts 
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase 
Houses bigger than a palace 
But she a queen, so she deserve it 
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track 
But they just hurdles 
I'm marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle 
Man, I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle 
Fast forward a few years later 
Now we the fucking winner's circle 
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan' 
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom 
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect 
But I already dreamed it 
So it felt like I rehearsed it 
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed 
Sad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purses 
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse 
Life out of a hearse 
And if I die first, I have the memories Let's reminisce 
(Be the best memories) 
Over the good times and the bad 
(I hope that you remember me) 
Reflect on everything we missed 
Cause you know we'll never get it back 
Whoa the memories 
Whoa the memories Let's reminisce 
On the good times and the bad 
Reflect on everything we missed 
Cause you know we'll never get it back 
Whoa the memories 
Whoa the memories yeah
