One, Two, Three, Four Life is turned down upside down 
But then maybe 
It's just been put back the right way round 
All your dreams realized 
There's a fire in your eyes 
And despite of its size 
You soon realize that it's alright Tonight, feels right Now there's a cross 
That nobody should really have to bear 
But then maybe 
That's just when life's treating you fair 
There are lessons you learn 
When you've waited your turn 
And things didn't turn out 
Quite the way that you dreamt about 
But it still feels right Tonight, feels right But it still feels right
