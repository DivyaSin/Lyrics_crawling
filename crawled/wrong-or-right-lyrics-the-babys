Does it feel wrong or right 
When he loves you babe 
Do you turn out your light 
When he loves you babe 
Well he takes you babe 
Ah when he loves you babe 
My whole world comes a part 
When he loves you babe 
In the day and the night 
How I want you babe 
Though I put up a fight 
I still need you babe 
Oh how I need you babe 
Oh when he takes you babe 
My whole world comes apart 
When he loves you babe 
Oh yeah 
I'm the kid with the broken heart 
I'm the kid you nearly fooled 
You've broken all the rules 
And hey babe that isn't cool 
In my days and your nights 
How I want you babe 
It's so wrong it could be right 
How I need you babe 
Well when he takes you babe 
Ah when I love you babe 
My whole world comes apart
