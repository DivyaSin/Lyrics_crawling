(Hum) Sweet memories, sweet memories (hum) My world is like a river, as dark as it is deep 
Night after night, the past slips in and gathers all my sleep 
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me 
Filled only by the fleeting moments of his memory Sweet memories, sweet sweet memories, oh yeah (hum) 
He slipped into the silence of my dreams last night 
Wondering from room to room, just turning on each light 
His laughter spills like water from the river to the sea 
I'm swept away from the sadness, clinging to his memory Oh-sweet sweet memories, sweet memories, oh yes (hum)
