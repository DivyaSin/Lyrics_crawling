I've got myself to blame for this 
I've tried to compensate for everything I'm not, 
And every face forgotten. 
You felt the sun warming your bed 
You looked so quintessential dressed against that cross, 
In the face of what was lost. 
Still I'm not asking much of me, 
And you're ignoring the matter You'll shut me up and bleed me dry. 
Cheap champagne and a complicated lifestyle 
If nothing else matters, then 
I will die trying, 
Thinking about you and I. Three years on Friday since we met 
You felt that existential kiss upon your neck. 
How could we forget that? 
Still I'm through acting like this feels right, 
And that nothing else matters. You'll shut me up and bleed me dry. 
Cheap champagne and a complicated lifestyle 
If nothing else matters, then 
I will die trying, 
Thinking about you and I. It's on yourself and no one else. 
But without hindsight 
I guess it serves me right. You'll shut me up and bleed me dry. 
Cheap champagne and a disappearing lifeline. 
If nothing else matters 
Then I will die trying 
Thinking about you and I. Shut me up and bleed me dry 
Its only a matter of time 
Cheap champagne and a complicated lifestyle 
It's only a matter of time.
