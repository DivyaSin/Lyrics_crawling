Must've been forces 
That took me on them wild courses 
Who knows how many poses 
That I've been in 
But them the main closest 
Hark! it gives meaning mine 
I cannot really post this 
Ah feel the signs 
I worried bout rain 
And I worried bout lightning 
But I watched them off 
To the light of the morning 
Marking the slope 
Slung low in the highlands 
Where the days have no numbers 
If it's harmed, it's harmed me, it'll harm, I let it in Oh, the old modus 
Out to be leading live 
Said, comes the old ponens 
Demit to strive 
A word about Gnosis 
It ain't gonna buy the groceries 
Or middle-out locusts 
Or weigh to find 
I hurry bout shame 
And I worry bout a worn path 
And I wander off 
Just to come back home 
Turning to waltz 
Hold high in the lowlands 
Cause the days have no numbers 
It harms me, it harms me, it harms like a lamb So I can depose this 
Partial to the bleeding vines 
Suppose you can't hold shit 
How high I've been 
What a river don't know is 
To climb out and heed a line 
To slow among roses 
Or stay behind I've been to that grove 
Where no matter the source is 
And I walked it off how long I'd last 
Sore-ring to cope 
Whole band on the canyon 
Cause the days have no numbers 
Well it harms, it harms me, it harms, I'll let it in
