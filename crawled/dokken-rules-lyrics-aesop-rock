(Aesop Rock) 
I spell 666 star six nine click 
Give his telephone a Viking funeral, bye bitch 
Treble hook two birds, cheap thrills, free meal 
Vacate Jellystone Park with your brie wheel (Rob Sonic) 
Now he sell Laker ___________________________________? 
Half his life was likely to be Nikes on the L-train 
Gnawin' on his dog toy, pocket full of deer blood 
The only thing that's stoppin' him was Dokken in his earbuds (Aesop Rock) 
Up around noon 
Found everything he loved crushed down to a cube 
The new Kowloon chowline, two leads routing medicine and gruel 
One is hemorrhaging money, the other jettisoning fuel 
Identical water-separated pools 
It was clever 
But it wasn't ever neighborhood-degenerate approved 
In swooped jukebox Fonzie, promptly 
Bolts on his neck, one tubesock wonky (Rob Sonic) 
16-panel head mutton chop and Ambulax 
Double pits to chesty got the ESPY on a camel's back 
Handle that Huffy wit' a timely parry 
And get all up in your kitchen, money, Guy Fieri There is a wildly elusive moment of bliss 
In the spaces between being told you are shit 
I would openly suggest identifying the closest 
And collectivly agreeing to meet if the sky opens Ma'am? x 16 I'd like to speak to a supervisor (Rob Sonic) 
Back alley brawl over party guests who want a 
Steak tartare but we're hardly pet food 
Charlie check booth, Brody's right 
You're gonna need a bigger boat and a Holy Diver (Aesop Rock) 
Aggravated people driving lemons over limits 
With a neck bop stemming and a cartoon physics 
Smart move taught never broadcast holes in his armor 
End up another poached foriegner (Rob Sonic) 
Handcuffed down to a toothless tease 
Who got an X-marked mouth and a hooch machine 
With eyes that tell the story of the woods that fetter 
And a chest that sells the ending when it's pushed together Been through the desert on a horse that's nameless 
Now I'm driving through the city in the Porsche naked 
Shores invaded by the new marines 
That tear the roof off this mother like Buford T (Aesop Rock) 
Untrained pet with a pen name 
Chest pain, bet he outlive his own endgame, anyway 
Step around the rhythm of the red rain 
Getaway car horn, stand by, tenth frame (Rob Sonic) 
Spare me the dramatics to ratchets, smile purdy (pretty) 
Flashlight strapped to the calf of a wild turkey 
Package of mild jerky, captain to aisle 30 
There's a man with a mask an an app that can dial Fergie Sir? x 16 I'd like to speak to a supervisor
