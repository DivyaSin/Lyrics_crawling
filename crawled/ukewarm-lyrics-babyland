The coil of the spring 
Has tighented too tight 
It's awkward and tense 
And it no longer fits me 
Disappointment and stress 
Has drained me away 
I can't think anymore 
It leaves me lukewarm 
The intention was here 
Along with a purpose 
Then came the worry 
(Now I'm all nervous) 
I want it complete 
But it all falls apart 
It's never enough 
And it's always too much 
I don't want it no more 
It left me lukewarm.
