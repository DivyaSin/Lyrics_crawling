Repo Man 
Randy Bachman - Michael Saxell He'll come to your city 
He'll come to your town 
If you owe somebody money 
He'll be comin' around 
You say it's complicated, there's a slight delay 
He says you're obligated and you have to pay He's the repo man 
Ya baby, he's the repo man He'll take your tv and remote control 
Junior's new computer, man he'll take your soul 
Your little girl's bracelet, your best guitar 
Your house in the country and your wife's new car He's the repo man 
Ye, He's the repo man 
He's taking everything he can 
He's the repo man Nothings sacred when the payment's due 
He's gotta have some money and he's gotta have it fast 
And he's coming after you, what can you do He'll take away your kitchen and all of your tools 
He'll get a great big truck and tow your swimming pool 
He'll come for your iphone or a barbie doll 
He'll even come, for a pencil, man, nothing's tool small He's the repo man 
Ye, He's the repo man 
He's taking everything he can 
He's the repo man Run, run, run just as fast as you can 
But you'll never get away from the repo man 
Run, run, run just as fast as you can 
But you'll never get away from the repo man 
Na-na 
You'll never get away from the repo man 
Na-na 
You'll never get away from the repo man He's the repo man 
Ye, He's the repo man 
He's taking everything he can 
Baby he's the repo man 
Watch out Comin' get you 
Take everything man
