Suppression has just begun 
You never thought I was the only one 
It's all so clear 
but not obvious enough 
to think of our little problems we've got Wanted to spare you the truth 
took always care of you 
and always showed consideration for you 
It's exhausting to tell you these lies 
You're not worth it anymore 
It'll be better to leave in spite 
and reach another shore And I want, want, 
Want something more to life 
It might be something else to dive in 
Won't let you waste my time 
It might be the best to erase you from inside (There must be something more to life inside) From breaking it all apart 
you sold your pride even your priceless thoughts 
It comes to an end 
but we don't reach anything 
Nothing more to pretend 
'cause right now I'm leaving It's exhausting to tell... And I want, want...
