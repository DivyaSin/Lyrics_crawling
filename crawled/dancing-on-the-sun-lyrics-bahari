We know the road ahead is long 
We'll only make it if we're strong 
The world we know now, the world we know now 
In time will be gone, in time will be gone 
One day we'll be dancing on the sun Two tone vans, I pray for a car 
Slip and slide in the backyard People all over the world 
Let's agree to disagree 
You do you, let me do me We know the road ahead is long 
We'll only make it if we're strong 
The world we know now, the world we know now 
In time will be gone, in time will be gone 
One day we'll be dancing on the sun Burgers off, Ray-Bans on 
Staying out 'til the break of dawn People all over the world 
Let's agree to disagree 
You do you, let me do me We know the road ahead is long 
We'll only make it if we're strong 
The world we know now, the world we know now 
In time will be gone, in time will be gone 
One day we'll be dancing on the sun Until that day comes 
We'll be running on the wind 
Blowing like a breeze 
While somebody's dancing 
Until that day comes 
We'll keep on taking chances 
Following the sound 
While we're dancing on the sun We know the road ahead is long 
We'll only make it if we're strong 
The world we know now, the world we know now 
In time will be gone, in time will be gone 
One day we'll be dancing on the sun On the sun, on the sun 
One day we'll be dancing 
One day we'll be dancing 
One day we'll be 
One day we'll be 
One day we'll be dancing on the sun 
On the sun, on the sun 
One day we'll be dancing on the sun
