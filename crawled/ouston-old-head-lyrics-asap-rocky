I been tryna make my ends meet So I can cop that Bathing Ape, or Jeremy Scott, or 10.DEEP Bottles full of rozay ridin in the Benz Jeep Blowin money fast now im finna think Im Big Meech I met with my old head we sat for a while We rolled a couple swishers we chat for a while I said Im just on my grind I come to Houston all the time He said whats been goin down in your New York state of mind Fiine there are bad days you feel like givin up Like how you gon eat when this gig is up When the chips is down and the jig is up But I dont give a fuck roll another swisher up Cause I just came here down south so I could get these pounds out And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a town house And my beats bangin kickin harder than a roundhouse I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out
