I don't get your drift and I don't catch your bait. 
I need to get my thoughts down, but it's getting late. 
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground. 
But the show is so unprepared now. My place's so messed up and I'm feelin' blue. 
Should stay clear and focused, better things to do. 
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on frank 
and i must put that cheque in the bank. Try to put me in a room Distractionless. 
Everything, anything to spare me from work. 
And In the studio, I will find a book 
All the time is all you got 
to Tempt me to look. always got something to do, someone to be seein' 
somewhere to be drinking, I'm a weak human being 
miss an opportunity, shout 'till you go blue 
unless I wanna do it, your words go through. Need to buy some smokes, can't put it off any longer. 
Words don't appeal, the pressure i feel is growing stronger. 
Maybe when i'm all grown up, i will get it through 
but right now I've got stuff to do. Try to put me in a room Distractionless. 
Everything, anything to spare me from work. 
And In the studio, I will find a book 
All the time is all you got 
to Tempt me to look. Gotta get this song done, before I leave tonight 
but my hair just does it's own thing and I gotta feel alright 
I gotta write a chorus, but words allude me now 
I have to get this done before i get dressed some how. and anyways I'll be there to meet you at the station 
guilty cos i should be home, damn procrastination. 
So when you see me later, wont tell you how it's going 
cos now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing! Try to put me in a room Distractionless. 
Everything, anything to spare me from work.
