Live on a subway "Graffiti hall" 
Said it one more time 
Taking time to save my soul 
Still alive, in a bar maid 
Said it weren't my time 
Paid my dues they say belong 
Ahh, ahh, somthin's wrong with the picture now 
Ahh, ahh, the words don't seem to fit 
Ahh, ahh, somethin's wrong with the picture now 
Blood will spill 
Everybody round town 
Ride the Jack 
You ride the Jack 
Said it weren't my time 
Nothin' to do but lay low 
I know, I know, I know 
Said it weren't my time 
Set my dues, its eerie (oh) 
Ahh, ahh, somthin's wrong with the picture now 
Ahh, ahh, the words don't seem to fit 
Ahh, ahh, somethin's wrong with the picture now 
Blood will spill 
Everybody round town 
Rides the Jack 
You ride the Jack 
Ahh, ahh, somthin's wrong with the picture now 
Ahh, ahh, the words don't seem to fit 
Ahh, ahh, somethin's wrong with the picture now 
Blood will spill 
Everybody round this town 
Rides the Jack 
You ride the Jack 
You ride the Jack 
You ride the Jack
