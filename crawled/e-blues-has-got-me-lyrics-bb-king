The blues has got me 
And there is teardrops in my eyes 
Oh, the blues has got me 
There is teardrops in my eyes 
Yes, dark is the night 
Since my baby said goodbye Oh, how I've suffered 
Since my baby wnet away 
Yes, how I've suffered 
Since my baby wnet away 
Yes, I've got that feeling 
That my baby's gone to stay Take me back, darling 
Forgive me for the wrongs I've done 
Ah, take me back, darling 
Forgive me for the wrongs I've done 
Now I know that I love you 
And you're the only one Talk to me baby 
Call me on the telephone 
Yes, talk to me baby 
Call me on the telephone 
Well, the blues has got me 
And I want my baby home
