There will never come a day 
You'd ever hear me say 
That I want and need to be without you 
I want to give my all 
Baby just hold me, simply control me 
'Cause your arms, they keep away the lonelies 
When I look into your eyes 
Then I realize 
That all I need is you in my life 
All I need is you in my life 'Cause I've never felt this way about lovin' 
Never felt so good 
Never felt this way about lovin' 
It feels so good How it takes my breath 
Starts a burning in my chest 
Make me weak, when I think about you 
Makes me want to give my all 
Life wouldn't mean a thing 
Not a happy song to sing 
Just emptiness if I had to live without you 
When I look into your eyes 
Then I realize 
That all I need is you in my life 
All I need is you in my life 'Cause I've never felt this way about lovin' 
Never felt so good 
Never felt this way about lovin' 
It feels so good 'Cause I've never felt this way about lovin' 
Never felt so good 
Never felt this way about lovin' 
It feels so good 'Cause I've never felt this way about lovin' 
Never felt so good 
Never felt this way about lovin' 
It feels so good
