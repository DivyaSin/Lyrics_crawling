Time for gathering 
Beware of the barriers they are weak 
Blinded we were led astray 
Behold as the truth of might returns Manipulation open your eyes and see your failure 
The whirlwinds of my destiny 
Blackened might 
The eternity has no throne for you You pretended to be a God 
You carved lies into minds now the lies shall die with you 
I will show you the face of a God 
The wary lust for torture roars inside of me Now you will die 
The whirlwinds of your destiny 
Feel the blade of fire 
As it cuts your mortal soul
