Open your ears and up a seat for the tale of the ballydowse. 
just what they are might well be you when 
the tell reaches your house 
between way past plenty and a need no one should know 
they were born and raised unsettled 
within sight of high and low 
equal blessings, hardhsips, toes, and 
fingers, opened eyes returned and lingered 
to the ones who got picked last 
to the dancers never asked 
to the darkened half of the heart of man 
that leaves his brother trapped underbred and under way we are leaping to 
the fray throwing for the lovely underdogs 
underbrush and underbelly flags flying 
willy-nilly we'll undermine the greedy and the cruel. 
come along all are welcome let 
man's barriers be broken, from silver 
spoons to empty pockets all 
raise your glass and raise your voices ain't 
against then be for us 
no paradise we'll reap but we'll go down 
plowing just the same so you sat and heard the tell, if you're 
leaving just as well 
too many living on the fences as it is 
but if your heart volunteers to the crying 
and the cheers 
let the dead bury the dead and come along 
equal blessing, hardships, crying, and singing 
you'll get back just like you're giving 
to the ones who got picked last 
to the dancers never asked 
if you got ears then hear if you don't forget we asked
