The streets from this blue window that I'm seeing through 
They shine with all the rain that's falling down 
It's late, put on your coat, the freeway is nearby 
I guess I'd better run you back to town 
They still go round my head, all those things you just said 
But I find that I still can't believe [CHORUS:] 
Oh girl it is the last time, you will no longer be mine 
It is the last time we will love 
Girl, it is the last time, it is the last time we will love 
Oh girl I'll tell the porter to pick up your case 
This old motel don't have much anyhow 
There's no more to be said so I'll go get the car 
Could be there will be no hearts breaking now 
Yes I heard what you said, if you must leave, go right ahead 
But it still seems so crazy to me [CHORUS:] (Solo) 
Yes I heard what you said, if you must leave, go right ahead 
But it still seems so crazy to me 
Oh girl it is the last time, you will no longer be mine 
It is the last time we will love 
(repeats 2x) 
I heard what you said, go right ahead 
Baby it's the last time, no longer will you be mine 
Babe it's the last time we'll love 
Oh girl it is the last time, you will no longer be mine 
It is the last time we will love, baby, baby, yeah 
It is the last time, no longer will you be mine 
It is the last time we'll love... (to fade)
