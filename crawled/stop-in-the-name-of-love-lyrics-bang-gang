Baby, baby 
I'm aware of where you go 
Each time you leave my door 
I watch you walk down the street 
Knowing your other love you'll meet 
But this time before you run to her 
Leaving me alone to cry 
(Think it over) After i've been good to you ? 
(Think it over) After i've been sweet to you ? Stop! In the name of love 
Before you break my heart 
Stop! In the name of love 
Before you break my heart 
Think it over 
Think it over I've known of your 
Your secluded nights 
I've even seen her 
Maybe once or twice 
But is her sweet expression 
Worth more than my love and affection ? 
This time before you leave my arms 
And rush of to her charms 
(Think it over) Haven't I been good to you ? 
(Think it over) Haven't I been sweet to you ? Stop! In the name of love 
Before you break my heart 
Stop! In the name of love 
Before you break my heart 
Think it over 
Think it over I've tried so hard, hard to be patient 
Hoping you'd stop this infatuation 
But each time that you are together 
I'm so afraid that I'm losing you forever Stop! In the name of love 
Before you break my heart 
X 3 Baby, think it over 
Think it over, baby 
Ooh, think it over baby...
