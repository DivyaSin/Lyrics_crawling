We will make this promise 
On the memories we've made 
A friendship born in heaven 
Will last though all our days A part of me goes with you 
Even if you journey far 
You'll never be forgotten 
No matter where you are Across the miles, please remember 
When I can't be there 
I will send my heart to you 
Upon the wings of prayer Across the miles, may God keep you 
Through the tears and smiles 
For His love will reach across the miles May your life be a blessing 
May all your dreams come true 
May the Lord be with you 
In everything you do In all of your tomorrows 
Wherever life may lead 
This bond will go unbroken 
When you know someone believes Across the miles, please remember 
When I can't be there 
I will send my heart to you 
Upon the wings of prayer Across the miles, may God keep you 
Through the tears and smiles 
For His love will reach across the miles 
His love will reach across the miles
