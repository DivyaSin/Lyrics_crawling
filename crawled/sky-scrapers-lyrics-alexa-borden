You found me 
And left the flowers in between. 
The sky scrapers 
Scraping up the sky could see 
That you knocked me down. Warm concrete flamed 
Beneath the sunsets 
As we danced through this town. Oh I know when you were searching 
that you didn't really seek. 
Coz for some strange change in the universe. 
You want me, yeah you want me. Clear waters are 
Drowning out the river bed. 
Our sand castles 
Sliding back with all the rest. 
As we sit here in bliss. Inside your mind is 
just a fairytale. 
With you is home. Oh I know when you were searching 
that you didn't really seek. 
Coz for some strange change in the universe. 
You want me, yeah you want me. I'm a blade of grass beneath your feet, 
A blossom on the tree, 
I"m a small speck in the universe. 
And you want me. Oh I know when you were searching 
that you didn't really seek. 
Coz for some strange change in the universe. 
You want me, yeah you want me.
