I'm tired of living in your constellation 
Most of your friends, they still don't know my name 
I've never been good at orbiting 
And everything you say is Greek to me 
So why don't I blow the lid off this can of worms? 
I think there might be a prize at the bottom 
It's a Cracker Jack deal 
I'll be free and you'll be rid of me 
Everything's gold on the surface of the moment 
But I take my coffee much blacker than you ever will 
And when my day comes crashing down 
At 3 a.m., without a sound 
You're fast asleep...but I'm dying. You're making me laugh 
But I don't want to laugh anymore 
People laugh when they don't really know the score 
And laughing is just one step away 
From crying...and I don't want to do that today 
A bit of a piece of a fragment of you is enough 
I can file it away with the last six months 
In a tattered envelope 
Stuck away in a book that I never read 
Everything's gold on the surface of the moment 
But I take my coffee much blacker than you ever will 
And when my day comes crashing down 
At 3 a.m., without a sound 
You're fast asleep...but I'm dying. I had a dream last night 'bout an angel 
She was laughing at me, but so sweetly 
Then she kicked me out the door 
I fell out of bed and now my ribs are sore 
Everything's gold on the surface of the moment 
But I take my coffee much blacker than you ever will 
And when my day comes crashing down 
At 3 a.m., without a sound 
You're fast asleep, but I'm dying 
You're doing fine, but I'm dying.
