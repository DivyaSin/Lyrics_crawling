If I had my way I would not be here 
Not for one day, my leaving is clear 
I've had my share of heartache and pain 
For happiness I'm searching in vain 
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain For all of my life, the times they've been bad 
And hard luck and strife, they're all I've ever had I've had my share of heartache and pain 
For happiness I'm searching in vain 
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain I've just got to be free 
God in heaven, help me If I had my way I would not, would not be here 
No, not for one day, my leaving, my leaving is clear I've had my share of heartache and pain 
For happiness I'm searching in vain 
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain 
Help me! 
I've had my share of heartache and pain 
For happiness I'm searching in vain 
I've got to get rid of my ball and CHAIN!
