[Hook] 
Streets show no love 
Same ones you call broke be the same ones plotting on the low 
Streets show no love 
Same bitch that you fuck be the same one that go set you up 
Streets show no love 
Better watch what you say, better yet, better watch where you step 
Streets show no love 
Ride for your niggas but you ain't down to die for your niggas 
Streets show no love [Verse 1] 
Better pour some Henny for my niggas 
Streets took away too many of my niggas 
I ain't tryna be next, gimme a tech and a vest 
A lot of hate on the West, a lot of shit I regret 
Shaking hands with you fuck niggas that plotting on my downfall 
Should have seen me 'fore I got the fuck from round y'all 
Keep the circle nice and small like it need to be 
I never let a nigga trace the lean to me 
Ain't gon' have my daughter crying, I ain't tryna be your IG 
Watching every move, they try to get my nigga YG 
These boys wanna take you away 
My jeweler's working hard, tryna work you away 
Fuck the eye centre charge too 
Straight up, and fuck Donald Trump too 
Better let the homies down for the one time 
We ain't tryna be no victim of no gun crime [Hook] 
Streets show no love 
Same ones you call broke be the same ones plotting on the low 
Streets show no love 
Same bitch that you fuck be the same one that go set you up 
Streets show no love 
Better watch what you say, better yet, better watch where you step 
Streets show no love 
Ride for your niggas but you ain't down to die for your niggas 
Streets show no love [Verse 2] 
Gangster Gibb with the shit bitch 
I'm on that team with a brick bitch 
I'm a doggy, whip it up like biscuit 
Should but my face on the package like Uncle Ben shit 
Bow Wow, puppy chow 
Black [?], how you like me now? 
White china but it brown when I bust it down 
Turn myself into the California plug 
Yeah we niggas ship 100 pounds 
6 in the morning, police at my bitch door 
Margielas squeaking cause my bathroom sizzle 
I hustle with my niggas since Super Nintendo 
I can't take a call from 'em cause them niggas a snitch though 
Where you feast where the killers eat 
You could never show you niggas where your kids sleep 
Bitches hit you with the keep a nigga baby 
Just to get a cheque about your rap 
They think I could never care about her [Hook] 
Streets show no love 
Same ones you call broke be the same ones plotting on the low 
Streets show no love 
Same bitch that you fuck be the same one that go set you up 
Streets show no love 
Better watch what you say, better yet, better watch where you step 
Streets show no love 
Ride for your niggas but you ain't down to die for your niggas 
Streets show no love [Verse 3] 
Damn, my niggas thug in these streets 
Lost a couple of my brothers to these streets, they don't show no love 
I promise not to show no fear 
I'm out the window with the nana, long block on steer 
Yeah, I swear it's been a hell of a year 
Telling real niggas can't fuck with you squares 
You can tell I'm in the field cause we comfortable there 
My [?] on dope, that's why I'm [?] 
Put blue cook in the air 
Count blue sheets, make it harder to stare 
Scared money don't make money, take a risk 
I used to break at homes, now I play for pitching 
Pops get moms down at 86 
87, I was born to this gangster shit 
Me and my day ones, we was taking trips 
Back then was taking murder was the main shit [Hook] 
Streets show no love 
Same ones you call broke be the same ones plotting on the low 
Streets show no love 
Same bitch that you fuck be the same one that go set you up 
Streets show no love 
Better watch what you say, better yet, better watch where you step 
Streets show no love 
Ride for your niggas but you ain't down to die for your niggas 
Streets show no love
