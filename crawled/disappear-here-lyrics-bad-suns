I really thought you'd be home by now 
I guess I was wrong again 
I used to think I could go somewhere 
Turns out I'm ill-prepared I kiss the bend of the canyon road where 
I find your ghost again 
You found the sky through the moonroof topless 
You were so happy then I'm right, I'm wrong 
I'm everything but sure 
My blazing head, my freezing heart 
Your five words walk out the door Would you run after me? 
I feel I've stood here once before 
Would you run after me? 
Would you run or do we disappear? 
Oh, disappear here 
Would you run after me? 
Would you run or do we disappear here? Now you say, "I see your face every turn I make 
I find no comfort there" 
I add, "I hear your voice with every mistake 
It's like you're always here" I'm right, I'm wrong 
I'm everything but sure 
So we fight until dawn 
When five words walk out the door Would you run after me? 
I feel I've stood here once before 
Would you run after me? 
Would you run or do we disappear? 
Oh, disappear here 
Would you run after me? 
Would you run or do we disappear here? Go, go 
No stay, no go, go 
No stay, no go, go 
No stay, no go, go Would you run after me? 
I feel I've stood here once before 
Would you run after me or disappear here? 
Oh, disappear here, disappear here 
Oh, disappear here, disappear here 
Oh, disappear here, disappear here 
Oh, disappear here
