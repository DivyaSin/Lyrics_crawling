Woo, oh, oh, oh 
(The longest) 
For the longest time 
(Time) Woo, oh, oh, oh 
(The longest) For the longest If you said goodbye to me tonight 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
There would still be music left to write 
Oh, oh, oh What else could I do? 
I'm so inspired by you 
That hasn't happened for the longest time Once I thought my innocence was gone 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Now I know that happiness goes on 
Ah, ah, ah I'll take my chances 
I forgot how nice romance is 
I haven't been there for the longest time Woo, oh, oh, oh 
(The longest) 
For the longest time 
(Time) Woo, oh, oh, oh 
(The longest) 
For the longest I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
And the greatest miracle of all 
Ah, ah, ah 
Is how I need you 
And how you needed me too 
That hasn't happened for the longest time Maybe this won't last very long 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
But you feel so right 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
And I could be wrong 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
Maybe I've been hoping too hard 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
But I've gone this far 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
And it's more than I hoped for Who knows how much further we'll go on 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone 
Ah, ah, ah I'll take my chances 
Ah, ah, ah 
I forgot how nice romance is 
I haven't been there for the longest time I had second thoughts at the start 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
I said to myself 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
Hold on to your heart 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
Now I know the woman that you are 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
You're wonderful so far 
(Pam, pam, pam, pah, uh, ah) 
And it's more than I hoped for I don't care what consequence it brings 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
I have been a fool for lesser things 
Ah, ah, ah 
I want you so bad 
Ah, ah, ah 
I think you ought to know that 
Ah, ah, ah 
I intend to hold you for the longest time Woo, oh, oh, oh 
(The longest) 
For the longest time Woo, oh, oh, oh 
(The longest) 
For the longest time Woo, oh, oh, oh (The longest time) 
(The longest) 
For the longest time Woo, oh, oh, oh 
(The longest) 
For the longest time
