The world goes round 
No one knows what it all means 
You're still out there 
Looking for a brand new scene 
And I'm still here 
Never have been hard to find 
When new gets old 
I'll be playing on your mind 
When it all comes down, look for me 
I'll still be around 
When it all comes down, look for me 
I'll still be around 
The day will come when there's nothing new to see 
And then you'll know here is where you want to be 
You know my song used to take your heart away 
That same old feel is gonna bring you back to stay 
When it all comes down, look for me 
I'll still be around 
When it all comes down, look for me 
I'll still be around
