Love soft as an easy chair 
Love fresh as the morning air 
One love that is shared by two 
I have found with you Hey 
Like a rose under the April snow, oh yeah oh yeah 
I was always certain love would grow, oh 
Love ageless and evergreen (ever, ever, green and seldom seen) 
Seldom seen by two You and I will make each night a first 
Everyday a new beginning oh 
Everyday a beginning 
Darling do you know you make my spirits rise 
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed 
Ooh they warm and excite us oh 
'Cause we have the brightest love Two lives that shine as one 
Morning glory and midnight sun 
(Time) Time we've learned to sail above oh oh 
(Time) Time won't change the meaning of one love 
Ageless and ever (ever, ever) 
Evergreen (evergreen)
