Thought each life time, run rivers to cross 
What if there's no life line and you're sinking or lost 
Just believe in your direction 
Let your heart explore 
Cause you can't reach new horizons 
Standing on the shore There are mountains, we need to climb 
But the mountains standing in the way are only in our minds 
And the risk of all 
So just listen to the voice that says 
I'll catch you if you fall On the other side of doubt is faith 
On the other side of pain lies strength 
The journey may seem endless 
And You know the road is rough 
But on the other side of fear, is love For such a long time I put my dreams aside 
The tides of change felt dangerous 
The mountains seemed too high 
But my dreams were slowly fading 
As time went quickly by 
So I held me breath with every step 
Never knowing I would find On the other side of doubt is faith 
On the other side of pain lies strength 
The journey may seem endless 
And You know the road is rough 
But on the other side of fear, is love On the other side of doubt is faith 
On the other side of pain lies strength 
The journey may seem endless 
And You know the road is rough 
But on the other side of fear, is love
