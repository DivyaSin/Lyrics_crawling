(RM)Wherever you're living 
Whatever place anyone's living 
I've been running again for a long time 
And I'll be riding 
And I'll be dying in ma city 
I don't know what to say 
I can't say it even if it kills me 
Even if you give me million dollars to go live elsewhere 
Ah, no thanks 
Ilsan, the place I want to be buried even when I die 
It's a city of the flower, city of Moon 
From my teens at La Festa Western Dom 
The educational institute area that raised me in my childhood 
(SUGA)The place I like the best in the world 
Nature and city with buildings 
I prefer Lake Park over Han River 
It's small but it's embrace is warmer 
When I feel like I've lost myself 
You find my old and faded-self in that place 
Do you remember 
Your fragrant again everything 
Yo ma summer, autumn, winter and every spring 
It's ocean of Busan (V)say la la la la la 
Below the blue sky this sky line (V)say la la la la la 
Uncles put your hands up 
Aunts move your hands 
Come to ma city 
Come to ma city 
I hope you look around well 
Habitual party 
City that has raised me 
That's right babe babe 
This is my city 
Ma city (city) welcome to my city 
I've been running again for a long time 
And I'll be riding 
And I'll be dying in ma city 
I'm from Jeollanamdo Gwangju babe 
If my footsteps take me to the mountain it's the summit of 
Mudeungsan Mountain babe 
My life is hot it's the heat of the south 
I won't give up the rule of fighting off heat with heat 
I put on gear and start the engine, madly bounce 
I dreamt of becoming a singer only with dancing 
Now in reality I run on stage to my heart's content 
You've seen it I've put in my passion 
I, Gwangju Hoshigi move around the eight provinces of Korea 
If you want to see me the time is 7 O'clock so gather 
Everyone dial 062-518 
It's ocean of Busan say la la la 
Below the blue sky this sky line 
Uncles put your hands up 
Aunts move your hands 
Come to ma city 
I was born and raised in Daegu 
It's pretty difficult to receive blood transfusion, the blue blood in the body 
You might think isn't this son of a bitch tired of talking about Daegu in every album 
I'm a D-boy yeah I'm D-boy 
Honestly there aren't many things to boast about Daegu 
My birth itself is Daegu's boast 
Yeah? Oh yeah 
There's nothing to brag about so this is something to boast about, isn't it? 
Ayo "That guy is the most successful person from Daegu" 
Watch closely because that's what I'm going to be hearing 
I'm the boast of Daegu 
New generation, the new issue 
The past of Daegu as well as the present and the future
