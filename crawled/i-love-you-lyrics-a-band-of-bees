You wouldn 't walk away 
If my stories they weren 't true I love you It 's only make believe 
It 's something that I do I love you Baby there 's no lies 
I wouldn 't make you cry I love you You 're charming in my thoughts 
With the magic that you brought I love you (repeat) You wouldn 't walk away 
If my stories they weren 't true I love you It 's only make believe 
It 's something that I do I love you Baby there 's no lies 
I wouldn 't make you cry I love you You're all I'm dreaming of 
You're the one and only love I love you
