Life was like a moonless night, 
Shrouded in the stars, 
Beauty can be such a fright, 
But now you're in my arms. [Chorus:] 
You are my life now 
Can't you see 
I'd cross oceans 
I'd swim seas 
To be with you 
That's enough for me. Your face is like a poison, 
Intoxicating me, 
How can we live forever, 
When our love can never be. [Chorus:] 
You are my life now 
Can't you see 
I'd cross oceans 
I'd swim seas 
To be with you 
That's enough for me.
