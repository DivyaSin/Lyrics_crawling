Your heart feels heavy now 
The mist keeps rolling down 
You never got that lucky break 
They owe you they owe you. Your friends have all left town 
Your dreams are starting to drown 
And you forgot that easy way 
They showed you they showed you. You are the one to blame 
Living in total shame 
Like the invisible man 
You gotta stop as soon as you can. For all these excuses hear me well 
You're making excuses as you go to hell 
And while it seduces you're losing your chance 
Stop making excuses just get up and dance. For all these excuses hear me well 
You're making excuses as you go to hell 
And while it seduces you're losing your chance 
Stop making excuses just get up and dance Just get up and dance When there are things you've gotta get out 
Open the window and shout 
You're gonna make your own luck 
And show them you show them. And while it all feels clearer now 
You gotta kill that sacred cow 
You gotta find the sun 
And start growing and glowing. You are the one to blame 
Living in total shame 
Like the invisible man 
You gotta stop as soon as you can. For all these excuses hear me well 
You're making excuses as you go to hell 
And while it seduces you're losing your chance 
Stop making excuses just get up and dance. For all these excuses hear me well 
You're making excuses as you go to hell 
And while it seduces you're losing your chance 
Stop making excuses just get up and dance.
