Shirley temple on ice 
She makes it just right 
That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice 
Her body's so tight up under that light 
I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
She got me wantin' her 
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
She got me day dreamin' 
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
Yes, I'm day dreamin' 
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
She got me day dreamin' 
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
Yes, I'm day dreamin' 
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) Come on and let's all dance until the break of dawn 
You got me fienin' on you and it's all so strong 
You got me movin' so close, you wrap me like a ghost 
Like a spell on me and I just can't let go 5 foot 8, on a lake, what a date 
She fell for the hook and the bait 
I took her to the yacht, for shrimp and steak 
Then I took her to the gym, so she could get in shape 
What a night, no more drama, just late night thrills 
Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz 
Fillin' out stacks of bills, jaguar like Jacksonville 
Breakin' these hoes like Jacks and Jill Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
She got me wantin' her 
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
She got me day dreamin' 
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
Yes, I'm day dreamin' 
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
She got me day dreamin' 
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
Yes, I'm day dreamin' 
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) Come on and let's all dance until the break of dawn 
You got me fienin' on you and it's all so strong 
You got me movin' so close, you wrap me like a ghost 
Like a spell on me and I just can't let go I'm lookin' at the most beautiful thang in the world 
Her body so perfect and spinnin' like a cinnamon swirl 
She looks like a fairy tale, but yet feels so natural 
This one's a beast, but way too wonderful to be compared to an animal Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
She got me wantin' her 
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
She got me day dreamin' 
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
Yes, I'm day dreamin'
