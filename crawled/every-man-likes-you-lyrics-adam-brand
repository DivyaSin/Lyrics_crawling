Some men like the horses 
Some men like to drink 
Some men like to scratch their chins and 
Sit around and think 
Some men like the pulpit 
Some men like the pew 
But every man, every man likes you Some men like the money 
Some men like the fame 
Some men like little letters 
Following their name 
Different strokes for different blokes 
Until you come in view 
Cause every man, every man likes you When we're walking down the street 
You're turning every head 
Girl your skirts are way to short 
And your lipstick's way too red 
I don't like it, but I love it 
Tell me what's a boy to do 
Cause every man, every man likes you Some men like a red head 
Some men like brunettes 
Some are fond of a golden blonde 
And some could not care less 
That all goes out the window 
When you walk into the room 
Cause every man, every man likes you
