Performed by az yet Last night, you were so into it 
You told me secrets that 
You never told a soul 
You were so nervous and 
Yet oh so comfortable 
As we explored your image of love I drank your wine as you taste mine 
I kissed your lips you felt my body slip 
Into your soul 
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful Last night I was inside of you 
Last night while making love to you 
I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains and the rivers 
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you Last night there was no believing it 
It was so special 
And so very innocent 
We talked of memories 
Our favorite fantasies 
As we explored our visions of love Deep in the night 
Right by the fireside 
You felt my candlelight in your soul 
You felt incredible 
I started to explode 
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful Hook Sunlight, red roses 
The scent of you it calms the heart 
The sight of you I fall apart 
Moonlight, the things we noticed 
Oh we're in love 
That's when it comes 
And I'm so, I'm so in love Hook repeat
