Everything was wasted, tasted, face it kid 
You were never what they wanted 
I'm a bird, I'm a tree, I'm a fish outside 
The city is a breast dangling from the sky 
Oh my feet go where we show the logo 
My shadow tags on behind Oh the world was never meant to be the Brooklyn Bridge 
Arcades and soda and tulips 
Chimneys and houses and old things 
Computers and loving the cold things 
Oh my feet go when we show the logo 
My shadow tags on behind Oh time is an angry train of commuters 
Love is a golden bag of computers 
I know that everyone's got something that they do 
But I don't wanna be obsolete to you 
Oh I don't want to carry my bag on one shoulder for you Oh why is once never enough? 
Why do I have to cum sticky stuff? 
I know that everyone's got something that they do 
But I don't wanna be obsolete to you 
Oh I don't want to carry my bag on one shoulder for you
