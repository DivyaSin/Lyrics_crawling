[Verse 1] 
I'm a motherfucking paradox, no I'm not... 
Joking, I was hoping I'd provoke some thoughts 
Not the kind that choke on cock, or smoke on rocks with broken hearts 
Wrote this while you toke some pot, I over spoke, unorthodox 
I know of God, he told me I'd be born of flaws and bored of y'all 
And probably would have raised me if there wasn't space on Noah's Ark 
Golden ox, knew you were a bitch before I'd heard of dogs 
Dropping bombs no Boku Haram, lock your arms and don't applaud 
I don't recall you going off, i'm going in, Macaulay Culkin 
Y'all insulting me just by the sound of all the shit you dropping 
Niggas think they flawless, they just talking like some local artists 
Hopeless niggas hold up, watch me blow up as you hold that thought... [Verse 2] 
It's some reckless shit, how I've been killing sentences since Genesis 
Send em in, if you find a synonym to my sentiment 
Y'all challenged on some cinnamon? Need Adderall & Ritalin? 
I'm spazzing, this could pass up all your tantrums, it's an anthem 
Going H.A.M, you see the passion, been right here but feel the absence 
Making classics single handed, causing damage, rapping is my second language 
This is second nature, Damn it, just a branch of talent 
Woe is thee, This shit is fucking poetry, I'm Edgar Allan 
Poe. Never let it go, damn I'm so fucking cold 
And all I've ever been is who I'm told and not supposed to be 
Jodeci. Nigga yeah I'm back and I ain't suppose to be 
4th degree. Burned your heat, you had your chance to work with me 
Like okay, see... I could have shocked the world before like OKC 
Planting seeds, Plotting, planning things this planet hasn't seen 
Platinum album, Damn it, give me 2 years and it's happening 
...It has to be... 
If y'all can't even talk to me, then this just what it's got to be 
Hope to God that y'all got the balls enough to respond to this 
Modest but i'm honest, so yo flawless Inc. I'm, talking beef 
No need for apologies, I'm counting down, you've got a week...
