This is for my people 
oh My JahJah people 
The conguering Lion I don't want to live in the past 
So I'm looking 4 a brighter day 
My homeland is right there behind the horizon 
God almighty watch me sameway 
Someone is judging my spirituality 
Laughing at my meditation 
Don't be afraid of diversity 
There is no confliction 
Blessed shall be the one who live in love, respect and dedication 
Blessed shall be the one who live in love 2x 
Love you King Selassie 
Promise you I'll keep your crown 
Love you King selassie 
No man will bring me down Live in love and life shall bloom 
God is waiting there 
Don't be scared of where you're going 
'cause you don't leave nowhere 
Simple people with simple life 
We don't seek perfection 
For many years we've been living in 
one life of illusion 2x 
Love you King Selassie 
Promise you I'll keep yoy crown 
Love you King Selassie 
No man will bring me down (Grazie a Daniele per questo testo)
