(L-Burna) 
Livin' legends in your presence, learn the lessons we stressin' 
It's all platinum, we make it happen 
Livin' legends in your presence, learn the lessons we stressin' 
It's all platinum, we make it happen 
Look here, playa I make this money 
Nah, this money ain't make me 
And you better believe that you outta your mind 
Thinkin' you gon' try to play me 
Lately Layzie been grindin' 
Member that thug about perfect timin' 
Dropin' that heat that you keep rewindin' 
Comin' outta the cut, look who's shinin' 
L Burna, L Dog, lil' Lightnin's a go-getter 
Still claimin' St. Clair wig splitters 
Ain't wastin' no time with them bullshitters 
I'm a heavy hitter, and the game don't wait 
So I gotta get down for my thang 
Let the whole world know who run this thang 
Bone Thugs, and it just don't change 
I'm the crook that wrote the book 
Showed y'all niggas how to really get it off the hook 
Better do your thang, and I'ma do my thang 
Better open your eyes and just look 
You'll see me ballin' on you bitches 
Livin' life flawless with the riches 
Mo Thugs'll kick the real shit 
Can I get a witness, can I get a witness, can I get a witness? 
Nigga, Little Lay'll get a broad 
to make all of these ballers in the club wanna shake it 
Back it on up to the zipper and break it 
Til the thugs on the floor can't take this 
Show me love, pump your fists 
And when it get like this it's crackin' 
For all the G's in the house, better chief tonight 
Y'all already know what's happenin' (Chorus - 4X) 
There they go, there they go 
Wanna let then nigggas know 
They don't wanna fuck with me (Aaron Hall) 
While I'm locked up on the Island with no gat 
And all I had was my hands to make it happen 
In the back room, watchin' a bout while I'm workin' out 
Lord, I wanna be back on top and that's without a doubt 
Beiginning, who started this fly shit 
All y'all niggas tryin' to copy, just get off my dick 
Run around with my own shit 
With my name tatooed on the 
And I thought that's so elaborate (Chorus - 4X) 
There they go, there they go 
Wanna let then nigggas know 
They don't wanna fuck with me (L-Burna) 
Thugs up, bustas down lay it down 
Better hit the ground, it's a stick up on the industry 
And y'all better not make a sound 
All the exects gimme my check 
No disrespect, but I leave you wet 
Better yet, nigga snatch your life and I won't think twice 
And I go on to do what's next 
If I have to flex 
Well anyway, little Lay really been got plenty pay 
I got a AK to keep thieves away 
Gotta thank the Lord that I can breathe today 
Cause in a major way I done done it 
This is my mission, believe that I run it 
When I wanna get blunted, don't front it 
Take a little hit 
Nigga, that's the bomb shit 
To the real OGs that'll pimp that game 
Eazy-E in loving memory wherever you at, hope you feelin' me 
I played the hand that was dealt to me 
Nigga, shell out the heat so I'ma cut up the flames 
Put it on down, burn up the gauge 
Y'all know these rap folks murder a thang 
I never heard of you lames 
Eat deeez nuts! 
Be real with the homies when I'm out on the streets 
I keep it real with the homies smashin' beats 
Po po's wanna be after me 
But they can't capture me, I'm too real for 'em 
Nowcan ya feel it, feel it? 
Nigga, is you wit' it, wit' it? 
Now, can you dig it, dig it? 
L Burna and Aaron Hall (Chorus - 4X) 
There they go, there they go 
Wanna let then nigggas know 
They don't wanna fuck with me (Aaron Hall) 
Pimps should know you never play a nigga for a ho 
Pimps should know you never play a nigga for a ho
