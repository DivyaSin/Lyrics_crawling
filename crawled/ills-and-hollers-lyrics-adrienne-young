Hills and Hollers 
Adrienne Young / Mark D. Sanders Well I feel like a stranger in my own hometown 
Theres traffic in the air where there used to be the sound 
Of tall trees growin and kids runnin wild 
Or maybe I was lookin through the eyes of a child 
But I swear There used to be 
Hills and hollers here 
Wild turkey and the white tailed deer 
Creeks runnin crystal clear 
Water on its way to the Gulf of Mexico 
Moonshine on the mountaintop 
Daddy sawin fiddle like he never gonna stop 
Lord, if these hills could talk 
Theyd say sing me a song that goes 
Oh, mama leave the light on 
Oh, shine like the sun on the shadows of history They laid the first paved road back in 45 
Now you gotta have wheels if youre gonna survive 
Black top over gravel 
Gravel over mud 
Seems the oil in our veins runs thicker than the blood 
But I swear
