We're sipping daisies sweet things 
and playing for thin dimes 
and that old whisper river 
is a hopscotch back in time 
but now the time has lost its mind 
so we'll just sing and watch it all unwind We're shooting nonsense cap guns 
I'm aiming for your eye 
and that odd look you give me 
is a heartbeat back in time 
but now the time has lost its mind 
so we'll just sing and watch it all unwind We cast in mystic footprints 
on sand, our highway lines 
and every street we walk here 
is a wander back in time 
but now the time has lost its mind 
so we'll just sing and watch it all unwind We're winking riddle word games 
I'm biding for a rhyme 
and every sign we find here 
is an arrow back in time 
but now the time has lost its mind 
so we'll just sing and watch the sea rise 
and the broken watch rewind
