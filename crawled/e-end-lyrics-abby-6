take your best blow teacher 
on what's right to say 
deal em real slow teacher 
so they forget to pray 
let's pray 
Chorus 
lets let get right down to the bone 
we can't get any deeper now 
do we know how far we are from home 
can't get any farther now 
are we going to be alone with our friends 
i guessi see it now 
we all must sit here and wait till the end 
the end, the end, the end 
make 'em like snow preacher 
see a brighter day not grey 
but where are we gonen go preacher 
when there is no way, no way 
Chorus
