Here we are again and you sure look fine 
You smile at me and the sparks just fly 
I can't understand why this is taking so long 
Somebody must have really done you wrong 'Cause everytime I reach for you, 
You hold back and I'm so confused 
How can you pull away from something so strong 
Somebody must have really done you wrong He hurt you bad, and your heart still aches 
But why should we pay for his mistakes 
Ohhh why 
I don't know what he did but he's long gone 
Well he must have really done you wrong 'Cause everytime I reach for you, 
You hold back and I'm so confused 
How can you pull away from something so strong 
Somebody must have really done you wrong I wanna tear down the walls that you built up 
And baby open your heart to all my love everytime I reach for you, 
You hold back and I'm so confused 
How can you pull away from something so strong 
Somebody must have really, really 
Somebody must have really done you wrong somebody must have really done you wrong 
Somebody must have really done you wrong 
Done you wrong, really, really, really done you wrong
