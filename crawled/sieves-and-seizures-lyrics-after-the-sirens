I've been tearing at this gauze over my eyes 
and clanging cymbals till I couldn't hear 
your screaming anymore. I used to speak in the tongues of angels, 
all I ever say now is goodbye. And I'll set myself on fire as a beacon 
through the shadow that my life has been 
but I would only smolder 
because I would not burn for anyone 
when I had the chance. I used to speak in the tongues of angels, 
all I ever say now is goodbye.
