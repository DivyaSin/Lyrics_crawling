6:30, mama gets you outta bed 
You e-mail what you're gonna wear to your girlfriend 
You skip breakfast, forget your backpack 
When you're halfway, you run back You're a Daddy's angel, with a halo 
Everybody's lookin' at you more like J. Lo 
But there's so much more to you So put me to the test 
I don't hafta guess 
What you want to know now, baby? [Chorus] 
When it comes to you 
I know everything and anything 
What you like to do, what you like to wear 
What you're putting in your hair 
I know you smile when you get mad 
I know The Green Mile makes you sad 
I'll stop for now 
But I ain't through, no 
When it comes to you Now, you're middle name is August 
But I remember 
You were born in November 
You lived in Jersey 
But you're from Ontario 
Your twin sisters like to talk in stereo We got so much in common 
? 
But there's so much more we can do So put me to the test 
I don't even have to sweat 
What you want to know now, baby? [Chorus] Yeah, when it comes to you I want you to know, baby, I've been studyin' 
Pullin' all-nighters when I could've been partyin' 
I can't fail, it's in the details 
Understandin' all that which is female Some guys don't ever see what they're missin' 
Talkin' about their tales, when they should be listenin' 
I pay attention, to the things you say to me 
When it comes to you, it's in my memory [Chorus:Repeat x2] When it comes to you 
When it comes to you
