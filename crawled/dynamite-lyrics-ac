They say every picture tells a story 
A moment frozen in time 
Well I gotta picture of my baby 
That is etched into my mind Her image is burned into my brain 
She is never out of my sight 
She's got the fuel to feed that flame 
She blows my mind like dynamite Every time I close my eyes 
I can see her there 
I fantasize. I'm mesmerized 
By her piercing stare Her image is burned into my brain 
She is never out of my sight 
She's got the fuel to feed that flame 
She blows my mind like dynamite Her lips are parted like she's about to speak 
I can hear her say my name 
My heart is racing and my knees are weak 
Her beauty makes me insane Her image is burned into my brain 
She is never out of my sight 
She's got the fuel to feed that flame 
She blows my mind like dynamite Her image is burned into my brain 
She is never out of my sight 
She's got the fuel to feed that flame 
She blows my mind like dynamite Dynamite 
Dynamite Her image is burned into my brain 
She's my dynamite 
She's got the fuel to feed that flame 
She blows my mind like dynamite Her image is burned into my brain 
She is never out of my sight 
She's got the fuel to feed that flame 
She blows my mind like dynamite Her image is burned into my brain 
She is never out of my sight 
She's got the fuel to feed that flame 
She blows my mind like dynamite
