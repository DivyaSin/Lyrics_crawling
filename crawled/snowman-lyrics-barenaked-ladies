Made of snow, I don't know 
How I fit in 
To and fro, people go 
I stand and grin 
Way to go, even though 
I can't begin 
Made of snow, I don't know 
How I fit in Ever cold, love untold 
I don't belong 
Have and hold, so we're told 
I think they're wrong 
Heart of gold 
Growing old just like the song Ever cold, love untold 
I don't belong Button eyes, lullabies 
I melt away 
Criticized, compromised 
White turns to grey I'm paralyzed, otherwise 
I'd leave today Button eyes, lullabies 
I melt away Made of snow, I don't know 
How I fit in 
Ever cold, love untold 
I don't fit in Button eyes, lullabies 
I don't fit in 
Made of snow, I don't know 
How I fit in
