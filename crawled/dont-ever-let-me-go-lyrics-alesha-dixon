In life the things that we try don't work the first time 
It's okay, you've gotta start again and rewind the tape, babe 
Get paid, yeah you made a mistake, but you're telling the story 
It's okay, take a break 'cause tomorrow's a brand new day So I'm looking high in every place 
And following everything within my heart 
I thought I could make a difference 
I feel like I am falling from the start Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go It's hard to say this but I feel I've fallen down 
Fallen down, fallen down 
It's hard to say this babe, feel the time has come around 
Waited too long, waited far too long Looking high in every place 
And following everything within my heart 
I thought I could make a difference 
I feel like I am falling from the start Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go And I'm just cool, so cool 
Just the way I like it 
Cool, yes so cool Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go 
Don't baby ever let me go
