Wake up, months of change have fucked me up I got the brakes 
I got the brakes Your laughter takes me from disaster to tears 
Are washed away, on holiday (Come on) Jamaica, oo I'm gonna take you away 
On holiday, on holiday 
Our problems, time will have to solve them someday 
On holiday, on holiday Warm sun tells me that its more fun to stay 
On holiday, on holiday
