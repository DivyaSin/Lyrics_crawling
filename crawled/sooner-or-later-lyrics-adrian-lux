Pray for the lonely view 
And we pray for solitude 
Take cover in my arms 
Away from everyone You'll be safe from dangers tonight 
Wait for an oasis to arrive Hold on, don't stray 
Sooner or later, all those scars will fade 
Sooner or later, Ooh-- Hold on-- 
Sooner or later, hold on-- Stay warm in the coldest June 
We face the darkest truth 
Take comfort in this calm 
A long way from where we've come We'll be safe from dangers tonight 
Pray for the oasis to arrive Hold on, don't stray 
Sooner or later, all those scars will fade 
Sooner or later, Ooh-- Hold on-- 
Sooner or later, hold on-- Sooner or later, ooh-- 
Sooner or later
