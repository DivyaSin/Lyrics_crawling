If I had a love that was so true 
Then I wouldn't have to make do 
With the half a love that I have found 
That is tearin' me down to the ground Don't let me down, don't let me down 
Don't let me down, tell me love can be found If I had a love that was so real 
And who would know the way I feel 
I want all your love today 
Just to keep me from fading away Don't let me down, don't let me down 
Don't let me down, tell me love can be found
