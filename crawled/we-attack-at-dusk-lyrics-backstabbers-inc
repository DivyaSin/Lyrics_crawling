I don't think I've had the chance to tell you. But I see charred smoking bodies stacked high in these cities set on fire. Blame yourself. Blame your desires. Blame your thirst for power. There are no leaders, only actors given scripts to read from, handed to them by screen writers who moonlight as patriots. When in actuality they are just mice afraid of getting stepped on, in this glorified battle of good vs. evil. Let this be a warning. While you are sleeping we will be walking these streets hunting for these throats that need to be silenced. We all have lists, and they all begin with the names of every smiling politician. We are a threat. This is a promise.
