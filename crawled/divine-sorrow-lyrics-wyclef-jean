Dearie blossom 
I've gone down to old rock bottom 
Now I know the love in my heart was true! 
Divine sorrow 
I thank you for the joy that follow 
Back then my friend 
If only you knew 
It is harder when you love beyond belief 
But I'm a fool to let you go 
So this is for you my love! We will never, we will never have a change of mind 
We belong together! 
We will never, we will never be the weary kind 
We sing our sorrows away! 
We sing our sorrows away! 
We sing our sorrows away! Divine blessing 
I wish I would've heard your lesson 
Now I know your words were my only truth! 
I'm just venting 
Or maybe I'm done confessing 
Back then my friend 
If only you knew 
It is harder when you love beyond belief 
But I'm a fool to let you go 
So this is for you my love! We will never, we will never have a change of mind 
We belong together! 
We will never, we will never be the weary kind 
We sing our sorrows away!
