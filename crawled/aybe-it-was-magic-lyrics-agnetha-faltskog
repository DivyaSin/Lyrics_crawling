There were good times 
I still remember when I made you smile 
When life was easy 
We'd coexist in a comfortable style And there were feelings 
I was inclined to believe they would never fade 
It's so funny 
How things don't always work that way There was something in the air 
Maybe it was magic 
And there was something in your voice 
When you used to call my name 
And there are moments in my life 
That I can still remember 
And there are places in my heart 
That I cannot forget And there was music 
We danced in the sunlight and glittered like gold 
Life was free then 
With time on our side we would never grow old
