Yeah yeah yeah 
We got my man Extra P in the house 
But me and my man Akinyele 
You know we goin Worldwide this tour 
'Cause yo you know how that go 
We gon' get together y'all, word up 
That's how we gon' bring it to you 
We gon' go all around the world 
Get this money, and do what we got to do 
Word up, my man Rhasaan in the house 
We gon' bring it to y'all like this, word up 
Just give it to 'em Ak uhh I been in and out all areas 
And all you true hip-hop fans, you know the Ak's takin care of ya 
Slap your ass with real rap 
I keep it underground, like subways, so I can stay on track 
I'm not a carpenter, but I'll cut the rug 
Think you can hang with Ak? Ha, that's your brain on drugs 
Smack fire out your ass like a flag from Backdraft 
Didn't peep the movie, you don't know the half 
Schoolin' MC's until they start learnin' 
We don't gotta be Mississippi to watch the Ak start Burning 
I kick that shit that's known to hit 
So much rap lines, you might fuck around and hang clothes on it 
But yo it ain't no thing in it, your static-free rhymes 
That you kick, need to be kicked, cause it doesn't got no cling in it 
Then you turn around and start singin' it 
Hard Akinyele be brought, so I'm here to start bringin' it 
First cannibalistic rhymer, eatin' bitch niggaz 
By the statistics, like, Jeffery Dahmer's 
Huh, scrapin' you like a sculpture, murder you for the vulture 
My dozen dirty, my brains be donated to agri-culture 
So come on and face it, my skills are like medicine nigga 
You just don't want to taste it 
You best to slide to the side, another corner of the map 
'Cause this here is worldwide [Repeat x4] 
Worldwide yeah yeah Put them tired rhymes to bed, and loosen up your laces 
Your shoes are too tight, and now it's goin to your head 
Me you feel you can pull with 
Remember that I'm not a matador, so get off that bull-shit 
I put rappers and singers in they place 
A real rudeboy with the raz', I write it all over your face 
Leavin' you bloodier than a MaxiPad 
Crayola crayons, they'd have to Color Me Badd 
So play like a midget and forget it 
'Cause I put oil to the fire, like an arsonist 
When it comes time to set it 
I get more run than an athletic 
Sharp as a hyper-dermic 
Lyrics are flavored up like a dia-betic 
I recoups, and they try to step to this 
Nowadays I probably have as much kids as Jerry Lewis 
My rhymes drip like a razor, punch like Joe Frazier 
I don't sell shoes, because I don't believe in favors 
Ducks better break North, before I start 
Baggin' that ass, like a motherfuckin' washcloth 
Winnin' battles cause I'm a hip-hop soldier 
Act like you know, and fuck what your girl told ya 
No bluff, for years I've been in this 
A nine to five employee don't got shit on me 
'Cause I done stepped to nuff rapper business 
Beggin' for for-giveness 
Channel 7 news and people from Jehovah done witnesses 
The whole Akinyele vibe 
You know what I'm sayin kid, this here is worldwide [Reapeat x4] 
Worldwide yeah yeah Ak not catchin' wreck, come the fuck on 
Ring the alarm, I drop bombs like the Guard in Vietnam 
I kick that shit, niggaz dream to write 
My brain so hot that it ignites, but you can't see the light 
Fast rappers can't speed by this, you better slow down 
Because I'm puttin' the brakes on your ass like Midas 
Nope, it don't matter what type of slang you drop 
I give you rope and you still can't hang with the Ak 
For years I put ears through therapy 
Watch a episode of Cheers before you come try the beer with me 
I graduated from lobbies, bangin' on walls for a hobby 
I battle anybody, even a dead body 
I got rhymes that would attack ya 
So you better watch your back, or fuckin' hire a chiropractor 
Ain't nuthin change from before, slap niggaz with mani-cures 
Stomp you down, after a pedi-cure 
Here's another lesson, I'm not a quiz 
So that talk about me not gettin' biz that's out of the question 
It's a Ak, jam, god damn don't get slammed 
You catch the backhand, word to my dead man 
You best to rest if you want peace 
'Cause like a hooker from up the street, I'm down for beef 
I'm hotter than a sauna again the drama is rugged 
Word to Sinead O'Connor, I be tearin' shit up 
'Cause I sprayin' immaculate, like a Mac-11 I take you to London, worldwide 
I take you to Europe, worldwide 
Come back to Queens, worldwide 
I take you to Russia, worldwide 
I take it to the North pole, worldwide 
I bring it back to Queens 
I give it to 'em, worldwide 
I take it to the West Indies 
I give it to 'em, worldwide 
I take you to India 
I give it to 'em, worldwide 
I bring it back to Queens 
I give it to 'em, worldwide 
I take it to Germany 
I give it to' em, worldwide 
I take it to
