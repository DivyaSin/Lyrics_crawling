And I have become, much less 
Wide-eyed for your, indiscretion 
And I can't understand, why you've chosen me 
To keep those dreadful stories, friendly And your eyes are darker when 
The sun hits your brow 
You were young once, but you're older now 
You are older now Standing in the shadow of what 
You were waiting for 
Standing in the shadow of what 
You were waiting for Will your faith be rewarded? 
And will you ever see? 
How can I know where you are, love 
When you're right beside me 
When you're right beside me Standing in the shadow of what 
You were waiting for 
Standing in the shadow of what 
You were waiting for You are older now [Repeat x4]
