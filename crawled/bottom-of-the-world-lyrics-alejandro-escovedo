Austin's changed, it's true 
Show me what hasn't 
Tonight the TV's throwing colors on the wall 
As watches cities of the world reduced to ashes 
From where I sit, at the bottom of the world 
Oh, there used to be a phone booth 
Down here on every corner 
He used to call me up just to say my name 
But now anybody get is a busy signal 
No I can't call home, from the bottom of the world 
She said, hey paper boy 
Don't you think it's time you delivered 
I said say the word, your wish is my command You may think you know all there is to know about me 
You might think the beast is in the cage 
But everything you see is just an illusion 
It's about to get real, at the bottom of the world 
Oh, hey little boy, little boy you look a little frightened 
For these awful kind of streets for walking alone 
So why don't you get yourself home back to Houston 
I don't think you're ready, for the bottom of the world 
No I don't think you're ready, for the bottom of the world.
