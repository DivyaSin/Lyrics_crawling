I don't know if You can hear me 
Or if You're even there 
I don't know if You will listen 
To a humble prayer 
They tell me I am just an outcast 
I shouldn't speak to You 
Still, I see your face and wonder 
Were You once an outcast, too? God help the outcasts 
Hungry from birth 
Show them the mercy 
They don't find on earth 
The lost and forgotten 
They look to You still 
God help the outcasts 
Or nobody will I ask for nothing 
I can get by 
But I know so many 
Less lucky than I 
God help the outcasts 
The poor and down trod 
I thought we all were 
The children of God I don't know if there's a reason 
Why some are blessed, some not 
Why the few You seem to favor 
They fear us 
Flee us 
Try not to see us
