Always though there was time 
To sit, relax and talk 
But now its you who Ill never find 
No more talk, just lonely walks 
I was stubborn and its too late 
To tell you how much I care 
I cure God and the rule of fate 
It proves again that life isnt fair (Chorus) 
Wish I could go back in time 
Undo the deed, undo the crime 
Wish I could take away the pain 
Wasnt time to go and end the game We laughed and played pretend 
We were the stars of the show 
But this is a dream, I wish would end 
The star had faded and lost its glow 
You werent perfect but proud 
If you wished you could touch the sky 
Rules were things you wouldnt allow 
And you werent one to say goodbye. (Chorus) x2 
Wish I could go back in time 
Undo the deed, undo the crime 
Wish I could take away the pain 
Wasnt time to go and end the game I dont understand why you were chosen 
I dont think its fair 
Our relationship is frozen 
How I wish I couldve been there (Chorus) x2 
Wish I could go back in time 
Undo the deed, undo the crime 
Wish I could take away the pain 
Wasnt time to go and end the game
