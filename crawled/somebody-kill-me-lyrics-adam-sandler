Ok, I just want to warn you that when I wrote this song I was listening to the Cure a lot. [Sung] 
You don't know how much I need you. 
While you're near me I don't feel blue. 
And when we kiss I know that you need me too. 
Can't believe I found a love that's so pure and true. But it all was bullshit. 
It was a goddam joke. 
And when I think of you Linda, 
I hope you fucking choke. I hope you're glad with what you've done to me. 
I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy. 
You left me here all alone, tears running constantly. Oh somebody kill me please, 
somebody kill me plee-ase, 
I'm on my knees, 
pretty pretty please kill me. I want to die. 
Put a bullet in my head. [Spoken] 
Kid: You're going to the mental institution.
