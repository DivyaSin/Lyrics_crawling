the sunlight has a sister and she's beating down your door, 
and you need to breathe like you did never breathe before, 
you're going home, you're rag and bone, and you're singing from the shallows and you're in up to your knees, 
can't see the surface, can't remember how to breathe, 
so you're going home, you're on your own, you tried to stand up tall so you would never have to kneel, 
but now you've got a wound that you don't ever want to heal, 
so you're going home, you're skin and bone, you're godless and you're loveless, don't believe in anything, 
but you can walk on water, you can shout and you can sing, 
you're going home, all on your own, a final drop of water, 
a trick of the light, 
turns you round you start again, 
the lamb was led to slaughter, 
it didn't put up a fight, 
'cos it believes the afterlife is something that is real, a final drop of water, 
a trick of the light, 
turns you round you start again, 
the lamb was led to slaughter, 
it didn't put up a fight, 
it turns around and starts again, the final drop of water, 
a trick of the light, 
turns you round you start again, 
a lost and lonely daughter, 
slips into the night, 
she turns around and starts again, turn around and start again, 
turn around and start again, 
turn around and start again.
