What do you know about love 
Only that you live without it 
It chewed you up and spit you out What do you know about life 
Maybe you read a few books 
And maybe you'd skip through a chapter or two 
Cause you haven't got a clue What do you know about anything 
You always talk a big game 
But in the end you'll only complain 
Cause that's all you know about Love is the greatest happiness 
And it's something you missed
