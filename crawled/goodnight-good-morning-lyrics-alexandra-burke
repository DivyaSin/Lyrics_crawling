This beat is crazy 
This club amazing 
This is where I'm gonna be 
I'm on the floor don't worry me And this guy is crazy 
His frame amazing 
I got my sin all over him 
As we dance erotically His body interlocks with mine 
Sends chills all up and down my spine 
And I pull him close and whisper in his ear Oh, I said What will it be 
For you and me 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? What will it be 
For you and me 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? I feel so crazy 
She feels amazing 
Ooh the way she's touching me 
I can't imagine what it would be Her body interlocked with mine 
Sends chills all up and down her spine 
She pulls me closer and whispers in my ear Oh, she said When will it be 
For you and me 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? 
Is it good night? 
Or is it good morning? What will it be 
For you and me
