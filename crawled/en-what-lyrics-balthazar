If someone told you there is 
No way to get way out of this 
Then what? 
And if you're keeping this heart 
From coming completely apart 
Then what? 
And if the rich are begging for more 
On the doorsteps of the poor 
Then what? 
Then what is it I've got If someone told you there is 
No way to get way out of this 
Then what? 
Oh girl, and if you're the last thing 
that's keeping this heart from coming completely apart 
Then what? 
And if in the warmth and the rhythm of your skin 
I lost everything I could win 
Then what? 
Then what is it I've got. I used to think that I used to think I had it all 
But that was long before I knew 
What a girl like you could do 
I used to think that I used to think I had it all 
But that was long before I knew 
What a girl like you could do And if your eyes that draw you in 
Don't reveal anything 
And if the salt that lay thin 
On the sweat on your skin 
Retreated deep in 
To your body again 
Well what is it it then? 
What is it then? 
Of what is it I've got?
