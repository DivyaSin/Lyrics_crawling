Woke up to the music of your heart 
Saying I, I 
Caught up in the wishing that it lasts 
Saying ah, ah Only you ever make me scared 
'Cause only you can take me there So wherever you go 
I'm your shadow 
Desert to ice flow 
I will follow 
Wherever you go 
I'm your shadow 
I'm your shadow There beneath your body when it wakes 
Saying ah, ah 
Hiding under every step you take 
Saying ah, ah Only you ever make me care 
'Cause only you ever made me dare So wherever you go 
I'm your shadow 
Desert to ice flow 
I will follow 
Wherever you go 
I'm your shadow 
I'm your shadow 
I'm your shadow I know, I know, I know 
Everywhere you move 
You stay, you go, you change 
I am bound to you So wherever you go 
I'm your shadow 
Desert to ice flow 
I will follow 
Wherever you go 
I'm your shadow 
So wherever you go 
I'm your shadow 
Desert to ice flow 
I will follow 
Wherever you go 
I'm your shadow 
I'm your shadow
