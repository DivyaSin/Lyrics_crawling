Mary, Mary, quite contrary 
Where's your white wine, silver, and gold 
Is it locked now in your mansion 
Having pity on the eye's of the poor 
Now in weary halls of the cathedral 
Mary tries to pray for her soul 
She doesn't know the price of her penance 
She find's herself now very old 
And she goes 
Oh baby, just one more time 
Will you please give me 
Some piece of mine 
In the moonlight, in the moonlight 
In the room with barred up windows 
Mary tries to count her gold 
She doesn't know the price 
Of her wealth now 
She finds herself, very old 
And she goes 
Mary, Mary where have you gone too 
Where's your white wine, silver and gold 
Is it locked now in your mansion 
Having pity on your soul.
