Janie got a present late one Christmas day 
Immaculate conception one could hardly say 
She took her little baby and all her daddy's cash 
The guilt stayed forever but the money didn't last CHORUS Tell me no more secrets 
Tell me no more lies 
When the road you thought you were on 
Ain't the road to paradise She said, "What's so lonely about being alone 
I've got this little boy that I can call my own" 
"Tomorrow," she said, "we're gonna start a new life" 
She stared out the window and she turned out the light CHORUS Paradise 
It's funny it ain't much like... 
Leave that girl alone to live her life 
She's been around enough to know what's wrong or right You don't gotta tell her 
You don't gotta tell her it's alright Janie got pregnant she was the queen of our class 
Hot little romance but it didn't last 
Last time I saw her it was Thanksgiving day 
She was trading in her food stamps at the IGA CHORUS
