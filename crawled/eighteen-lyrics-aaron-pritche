That's a death defying walk she's got 
Dancing to the parking lot, oh eighteen 
What she does to T-shirts 
So good make my eyes hurt, oh eighteen Somebody ought to write a song about it, so I did 
It makes me wish I was a kid again, eighteen 
We were made out of asbestos 
Dairy Queen for breakfast at eighteen, eighteen Rock and roll was king 
And cars were everything at eighteen, eighteen 
Nobody could have told us anything and if they tried 
It gave us something to fight about, eighteen Blue jeans, young hearts knockin' out 
Big dreams, you and me work 
We're burning like gasoline 
It's amazing that we ever lived past, eighteen Shooting city limit signs 
Chasing girls and wasting time, oh eighteen 
Pretending we were tough 
Telling stories we made up, oh eighteen Dressing like the pictures 
Hanging in our bedroom 
We tore out of a magazine, eighteen Blue jeans, young hearts knockin' out 
Big dreams, you and me work 
We're burning like gasoline 
It's amazing that we ever lived past, eighteen, eighteen, eighteen Cruisin' in convertibles 
Completely indestructible 
We were hookin' up and hangin' out 
Believing what we sang about, eighteen Kroeger on a Friday night 
Making circles out of headlights 
Yeah, it felt so good being alive, eighteen
