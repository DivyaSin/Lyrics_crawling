Every year I feel the same 
I hate the man and lose the game 
Now I find myself on top 
Nowhere to start, don't wanna stop I love these lovely nights out on the club 
Working late, it never stops 
I'll be your electric shock 
And with a song I'll have your heart unlocked If I'm on the radio, radio, would you still love me so? 
Or would you turn me off your stereo, stereo? 
Will you be at the show screaming one last song tonight? Wake up kid, let's look for gold 
This year's the year that I've been sold 
I signed my name and sold my soul 
I took the risk, don't wanna know If I'm on the radio, radio would you still love me so? 
Or would you turn me off your stereo, stereo? 
Will you be at the show screaming one last song tonight? Radio, radio, would you still love me so? 
Or would you turn me off your stereo, stereo? 
Will you be at the show screaming one last song tonight? 
One last song tonight I wish I could live like this forever 
And sing my days and days away There's always the choice beside me of leaving this underground 
And if I pack up my bags around me 
Will you be filled with hate or struck with love? 
Love, love, love, love Radio, radio, would you still love me so? 
Or would you turn me off your stereo, stereo? 
Will you be at the show screaming one last song tonight? 
Radio, radio, one last song tonight 
Radio, radio, radio, radio, one last song tonight Every year I feel the same 
I hate the man and lose the game 
Now I find myself on top 
Nowhere to start, don't wanna stop
