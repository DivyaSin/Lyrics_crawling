The hands are folded but the souls out of reach 
A veil of sadness is covering me 
Unholy thoughts fill the void in my head 
If lies we're tears I'd forgive you instead 
The heart is hard 
The heart is hard 
So it wont break You could admit to past mistakes 
I could accept it all with grace 
Become a hero save the day 
And absolve you from all blame 
But faded years now laid to waste 
Can not erase the damage done 
No hero here will save the day 
When there's nothing left to say 
And nothing left to save I fight for air as you float over me 
I'm holding on but you're already free 
Unholy thoughts fill this void in my head 
The door is shut and nothing is said 
My heart is hard 
My heart is hard 
So it wont break
