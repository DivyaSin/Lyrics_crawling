I've been so lost, too uncertain 
Down the long road, walked on 
Got the feeling deep inside me 
I've waited so long The mountain we're climbing 
We're reaching so high 
We're looking for someone 
And wondering why It's hurting too much 
And we're searching so far 
Hoping for love to go on 
When the best has gone I was fallen and forgotten 
Found the answer on the winds of time 
Only heartache here tomorrow 
If there is no one to open up your life Took me so long 
I know just where I'm going 
Took me so long 
Know that you're the one 
Took me so long 
You're lighting up the fire in my heart And the mountains we climb 
Seem to go higher 
Look for someone 
And we're wondering why It's hurting too much 
And we're searching so far 
Hoping for love 
Waited so long Took me so long 
I know just where I'm going 
Took me so long 
Know that you're the one 
Took me so long 
You're lighting up the fire in my heart If I had to spend my life 
With someone else 
I would rather be here 
On my own But it's all right 
We will live and learn 
Long as we have love 
We can never be alone So long 
I know just where I'm going 
Took me so long 
Know that you're the one 
Took me so long 
You're lighting up the fire in my heart Took me so long 
I know just where I'm going 
Took me so long 
Know that you're the one 
Took me so long 
You're lighting up the fire in my heart
