On my black horse I ride 
Towards the end of time 
By the christians you were sentenced and died 
Burned at the stake to redeem your crime As the autumn leaf in the purling rill 
My people followed their lie 
But for you sake my queen 
I'll scournfully watch them die My utter denial of their god 
Makes me divine 
Their death will be 
The ultimate revenge of mine
