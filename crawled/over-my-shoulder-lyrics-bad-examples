I wait by my pillow for your footsteps 
Echoing up to my door 
Afraid that you`ll think I'll be waiting 
I get up and I lock the door 
I get up and I lock the door 
I'm waiting for summer 
But winter keeps on whispering in my ear 
I say I don`t love you 
But sometimes I wish that you were here [Chorus] 
And I got a feeling our love is over 
But I keep on looking over my shoulder My stereo calls me 
But all of the records have been played before 
Dreaming of loving you 
Waking and I don`t love you anymore [Chorus] So many nights together 
Now I'm here alone 
I wait for you one last time 
But I know that we can`t go back [Chorus] I wake in the darkness 
But the footsteps are in my imagination 
My TV's white hissing 
Has replaced all my midnight animation 
And I got a feeling our love is over 
But I keep on looking over my shoulder I keep on looking over my shoulder, 
I got a feeling our love is over 
But I keep on looking over my shoulder
