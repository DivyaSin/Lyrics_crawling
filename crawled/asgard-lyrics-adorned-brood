Magic is in the air as many miracles 
As many Gods there in this land 
Asgard, land of the Gods 
I saw the path to him, there's no turning back 
My entrance in this world was beautiful Valhalla the holy land 
Hall of the proud warriors 
Place of Wotan's throne, am I good enough? 
Ruled by the one eyed, old man Murderers and scum will go to hell 
A woman who rules her, Reich by herself 
As the loneliest majesty 
Her face, half woman half beast Helheim the unholy land 
A hall of pain far away from light 
No turning back 
Where ever lasting darkness rules Asgard, the land of the Gods 
Hall of the proud warrior 
Place of Wotan's home, am I good enough? 
Ruled by the one eyed old man My power becomes bigger and bigger 
Magic lives in me, forever and ever 
Don't you ever forget what's been told 
Or die, die by my hand
