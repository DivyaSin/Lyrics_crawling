I heard the news 
That you went that day 
And the tears welled up in my eyes 
I think of you almost every night 
Like the stars that live in the sky I'll see you again 
I know I will 
But until that day I'll be waiting for you 
Across the rainbow bridge 
Where the sun shines everyday 
No tears are allowed 
Across the rainbow bridge 
Your love will take me away I think of you almost every day 
No words can make stay 
Stay here and be still 
You're young and strong 
And full of life 
Your face like a child 
And full of will I'll see you again 
I know I will 
But until that day I'll be waiting for you 
Across the rainbow bridge 
Where the sun shines everyday 
No tears are allowed 
Across the rainbow bridge 
Your love will take me away I'll see you again 
I know I will 
But until that day I'll be waiting for you 
Across the rainbow bridge 
Where the sun shines everyday 
No tears are allowed 
Across the rainbow bridge 
Your love will take me away
