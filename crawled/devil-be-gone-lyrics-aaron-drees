I'm standing at the gates of hell 
And I do believe that my freedom was easily deceived. 
I'm Waiting for our time to expire la la la la la la la and I do belong to my devil She wears a black thong. I know something you should know 
I came around the bend to poke her in the nose. 
And you will find out the hard way that I will never change, and I'll always be strange yeah We are imperfectly alright, she said 
We are imperfectly alright alright Living on the end of your string 
Now I am a slave till death do us part controlling my brain. 
She told me that a deal is a deal 
Now I do belong to my devil she sings me a song. I've seen something that you should believe I came around that bend to poke her in the knee. 
And she will find out when we fight that I will never change and she'll always be right yeah she said We are perfectly alright she said 
We are perfectly alright I'm standing at the gates of hell la la la la la la la 
And I do believe that my freedom was easily deceived. 
Waiting for our time to expire 
And I do belong to my devil she wears a black thong. 
Yeah yeah yeah
