Yeah yeah everything's real! [Chorus] 
I got all my life to live 
And I got so much love to give 
But I gotta survive, and make papes outta state 
I'm ready to make papes outta state, man 
I got all my life to live 
And I got so much love to give 
But I gotta survive, and make papes outta state 
I'm ready to make papes outta state Ak to the Nel to the LE, I'm tryin' hard as hell 
To pick my future before my future picks me 
Twenty-one years of AGE, not with minimum wage 
Don't ever seem like I'ma get paid rhymin' on the stage 
College, I always dreamt of tryin it; the only problem here 
I don't seem to meet financial aid requirements 
Locked writin' rhymes in the crib when would I get out? 
Seems like I'm pushin' yo a hip-hop bid 
At home the vibes don't feel right 
My parents keep lookin' at me as if I'm some type of parasite 
My moms separated from her spouse 
The oldest of two kids, it's my job to play man of the house 
That means gettin' off my ass, makin' immediate cash 
That broke shit, save it for an orthopedic cast 
I get road maps, learned the interstate 
Shit I'm headed out state to make papes man [Chorus] I'm ready to get up on a scam trip 
The I-95 outta state to make the damn loot flip! 
First I need a crackhead with a credit card 
So he can head uptown and purchase me a rented car 
Just make sure that it's black 
And take off the rear view mirrors cause it ain't no lookin' back 
I'm goin' one deep, in the driver's seat 
Throwin' the vegetarian book cause I'm ready for beef 
I got a three-hundred and fifty-seven, faren-degrees-heit 
Of heat, better known as a burner on the street 
Cool, I got the keys to the CAR 
Accelerate on the gas, and have the rubber burn up 
On the TAR, I'm out to get money real far 
I hear my moms voice, {singing} "I'm wishin on a star!!" 
But I got to go far ma! {sing} "But I could wonder where you are!" 
On the streets just deliverin' packages 
So I can just relax and get some type of livin' 
Think that it is when it isn't 
Easy to see a family, suffer from povery, as bein given 
Man, like heck, and when I get back 
I'ma rip up them welfare checks 
I got a new nine to five mom, so don't wait up late 
My job's located outta state [Chorus] I reached my destiny and my goal 
I done flashed right past the dumb-ass highway patrol 
If everything goes well I'm in it to win it 
I'm tryin' to find a hotel so I can rest up for a minute 
A round of crackheads gonna show me -- neighborhood clowns 
Fear me up and down cause they really don't know me 
But all my hits, I see them scopin' out the clip 
They want to get open, I can let shit rip! 
Whatever is broke got to be fixed, twenty dimes and nicks 
Step into my house made of bricks 
My man gave me work, home on credit 
You think that I'm comin' back? Tch, black he can forget it 
'Cause I got moves to bake, no time to be fake 
Bad enough gotta watch out for a snake called Jake 
Money nonstop, kept in the hush 
At twelve o'clock, I'ma catch, huh, the midnight bus 
And watch the dough flow like water 
I'm not Taco Bell but hell I'ma make a run for the border 
I feel odd, like a extraterrestrial left alone 
A calling card number, so I could phone home 
To let my people know my mission went great 
On my great escape to outta state Rest in peace to my little brother Donnie Boy 
Rest in peace to my man Rakim 
Rest in peace to my man, named Understanding 
Rest in peace, umm, to Atiba 
Rest in peace to my man Wilson from Exena Street 
Rest in peace, to all my other peeps 
Also rest in peace, to my man T-Bone 
You know I ain't forget you 
Yeah yeah, and I'm and I'm and I'm 
And I'm and I'm out!!
