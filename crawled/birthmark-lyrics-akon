Yea yea 
Oh oh 
Yea yea 
Oh oh 
Yea I made the mark on February 1st 
Between me and you you can call it birth 
The beginning of our universe 
Remind me of Alicia keys verse 
I'm falling for you 
I wish I had an opportunity to not do 
What I did to hurt you 
Now I'm here living with regrets I know that it was my fault, 
I know that I got caught, 
So please don't loose your thoughts 
Of me loving you and you loving me 
I'm on the highway swerving 
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n 
Looking at the calendar getting nervous 
Just a few more days to the first soul This the day it all began 
One place that it came together 
More than a ring or a tattoo 
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you 
So let's get on an airplane 
Go back to where we began 
To that point which is days apart 
That stamp right next to your heart 
To your heart Get the calendar go to August 3rd first words 
Stay we heard our first words 
First argument gotta let it go 
Cause it could possibly affect what our future holds 
Flipping pages now famous thinking back I aint seen you in ages 
Wishing that I could of made it less painless 
Brings me back right back to the same as I know that it was my fault, 
I know that I got caught, 
So please don't loose your thoughts 
Of me loving you and you loving me 
I'm on the highway swerving 
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n 
Looking at the calendar getting nervous 
Just a few more days to the first soul This the day it all began 
One place that it came together 
More than a ring or a tattoo 
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you 
So let's get on an airplane 
Go back to where we began 
To that point which is days apart 
That stamp right next to your heart 
To your heart January February March April May 
June July August is just another day, 
September October November trying to find a way 
In December to mark my calendar to meet again 
If only we can go to that place where me and you know, 
There's no faith fronting cheating even lying, 
The time has come where we stand face to face This the day it all began 
One place that it came together 
More than a ring or a tattoo 
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you 
So let's get on an airplane 
Go back to where we began 
To that point which is days apart 
That stamp right next to your heart 
To your heart That step right next to your heart To your heart That step right next to your heart
