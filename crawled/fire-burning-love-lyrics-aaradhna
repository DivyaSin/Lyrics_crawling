If you ask me 
What our love's all about 
I would say our love is like a flower 
With the petals pulled out No one to try to put us down baby 
Because I love you too much and 
You love me too but 
There's just some problems that we gotta work through time There's not much time 
We gotta get it together today 
Because tomorrow man, you never know Can we get it back like 
Get back the fire 
Burning love again Can we get it back like 
Get back the fire 
Burning love again Bittersweet memories 
Of how we used to be 
I know right now we're still together 
But the fire and passion is gone It's killing me 
Every day 
Because our love ain't the same 
And every night I pray please God don't take my baby away Oh time 
There's not much time 
We gotta get it together today 
Because tomorrow man, you never know Can we get it back like 
Get back the fire 
Burning love again Can we get it back like 
Get back the fire 
Burning love again You used to hold me real close 
And I didn't let go of you, just held on tight 
But nowadays it feels like slowly 
Your love is fading far away You used to hold me real close 
And I didn't let go of you, just held on tight 
But nowadays it feels like slowly 
Your love is fading far away Fire burning love
