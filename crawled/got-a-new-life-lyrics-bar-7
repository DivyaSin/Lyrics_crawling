Found my love, I found diamond rings 
Found my love, I gave my everything 
Found my love, travelled across the land 
Through the hail and the snow and the drivin' rain Found my love, what did I care? 
One love I wish I could forget 
Oh Lord, now, what it's doin' to me 
No more I think it's drivin' me crazy 
When nothin' can save me 
I never thought I'd find me another love 
Then I opened my eyes and there she was 
I got another life today 
I got another life today 
A new chance for the new romance 
New eyes, new nose 
And everything smellin' like roses 
I got another life today 
I got another life today 
You're everything I needed 
Yeah, you shook my world 
You're just what I been lookin' for 
Yeah, you're just what I been lookin' for 
Yeah, you're just what I been lookin' for Too long, I lost everything I had 
All my life I was longin', I was feeling sad 
Didn't know what I was goin' to do 
Lo and behold that's when, a, I met you 
We turned it all around from a crate of blue 
And I'm feeling more like me and all because of you 
Oh Lord, now what ya doin' to me? 
Give me more I think you're drivin' me crazy 
When nothin' can save me 
I never thought I'd find me another love 
And then I opened my eyes and there she was 
I got another life today 
I got another life today 
A new chance for the new romance 
New eyes, new nose 
And everything smellin' like roses 
I got another life today 
I got another life today 
You're everything I needed 
Yeah, you shook my world 
You're just what I been lookin' for 
Yeah, you're just what I been lookin' for 
Yeah, you're just what I been lookin' for And I loved and a-lovin' till I loved too much 
And I gave it everything until my love lost its touch 
Till there was nothin' left worth savin' Oh, and I know that everything I need to make me feel complete 
Can't you make up and be lovin' me? 
I guess I'm fallin'. Now what I'm tryin' to say I got another life today

A new chance for the new romance 
New eyes, new nose 
And everything smellin' like roses 
I got another life today

And everything that I need 
And you're hungry for love I got all you can eat
