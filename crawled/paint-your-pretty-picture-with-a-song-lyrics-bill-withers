I will lay around sometimes and show some sadness, 
For people whom I've known that now are gone, 
And, I will cry to show you, try to show you, when I'm happy 
And, when things are going wrong. I will try my best to be there when you need me, 
And give you strength when you need someone that's strong, 
And I'll sit and cry with you, my dear, if need be, 
And, I'll PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song. I will PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song, 
I will PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song, 
Tell you tales of life as I see it, 
And I'll PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song. (I said) I'm gonna try my best to be there when you need me, 
And I'm gonna give you strength when you need someone strong, 
And I'll sit cry with you my dear, if need be, 
And, I'll PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song (I said) I'm gonna PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song, 
I am gonna PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song, 
Tell you tales of life as I see it, 
And I'll PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song. (I said) I'm gonna PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song, with a song, with a song, 
I am gonna paint you babe, PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song, 
Tell you tales of life as I see it, 
And I'll paint your pretty picture with a song, I'll paint your pretty picture, I'll PAINT YOUR PRETTY PICTURE with a song. REPEAT Chorus/ Ritard Ending, last note up the octave
