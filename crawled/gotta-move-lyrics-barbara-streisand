Gotta Move 
Gotta get out 
Gotta leave this place 
Gotta find some place Some other place, some brand new place 
Some place where each face that I see 
Wont be staring back at me, 
Telling me what to be and how to be it. 
Some place where I can just be me. Gotta move 
Gotta get out 
Gotta leave this town 
Gotta find some town Some big new town 
Some bright new town 
Some new town with new places new lights 
And most of all some new, new faces 
Gotta find a man, a new man A man who wont worry bout where I go, 
A man who wont ask how I learned what I know. 
A man who will know that youve got to be free, 
A man who will know when to just let me be. Gotta move 
Gotta get out 
Gotta change my life 
Gotta find my life 
Ill find me a place in some new town 
And baby when I find me that new place 
Baby I, Gotta leave this town 
Gotta leave this place 
Gotta find a new man 
Gotta move
