He lost it all, he's homeless now 
Walking on Sunset Boulevard alone 
No place to go 
That's when I asked him what you're smiling for? 
He said I'm on this road, tryina catch tomorrow 
And every night she walks the streets 
With a little red dress looking for some love 
She's out to look 
But if you'll ask her what you're smiling for? 
She'd say I'm on this road, tryina catch tomorrow Oooh oh oh oooh oh oh 
I'm on this road, tryina catch tomorrow 
Oooh oh oh oooh oh oh 
I said I'm on this road, tryina catch tomorrow On great Aunt Osh she realized 
Everything she loved even goal 
All she got is a soul 
But if I'd ask her what you're smiling for? 
She'd say I'm on this road, tryina catch tomorrow 
Saw a bold miracle walking hand in hand 
No future at all 
Am in the cold 
Don't dare to ask them what you're crying for? 
I know I'm on this road tryina catch tomorrow Oooh oh oh oooh oh oh 
I'm on this road, tryina catch tomorrow 
Oooh oh oh oooh oh oh 
I'm on this road, tryina catch tomorrow
