She's a tramp and he's a loser 
In a smoky bar from kafka's darkest dreams 
And the critics know what crap is hip to swallow 
It's all high volume 
Her leather comes off in the back room 
And a million screaming morons call it art 
So much fun is not fun any longer 
It's all high volume High volume 
As if I was the one to say 
If it's right or if it's wrong 
Close your eyes until it goes away 
Turn it up until you hear the song 
She's as sweet as skin, as deep as candy 
But if it sells they'll never wonder why 
'til the posers and the preachers mate like mongrels 
It's all high volume High volume 
High volume
