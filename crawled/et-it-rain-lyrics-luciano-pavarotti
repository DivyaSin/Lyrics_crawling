Last night I had a dream that there would be a morning after 
Long days, sunshine, and peace 
Long nights of love, forgiveness, and laughter 
Maybe it was just a dream but it could be reality 
Children are like planting seeds, youve got to let their flowers grow 
Dont you know F che piova, (Let it rain) 
F che il cielo mi lavi il dolor (Let heaven wash away my pain) 
F che piova (Let it rain) 
che sia la pace il nome d'amor (That peace would be the name of love) Through the rain I saw a child just like my child 
Someones son or daughter 
I watched as they played for a while 
I wanted to cry, those babies just smiled 
Maybe it was just a dream, but it should be reality 
A child is just Gods sign that peace and love are seeds to make 
tomorrow grow F che piova, (Let it rain) 
F che il cielo mi lavi il dolor (Let heaven wash away my pain) 
F che piova (Let it rain) 
che sia la pace il nome d'amor (That peace would be the name of love) Go on, weve tried war 
No one wants peace more 
Than the children who ask their dads why F che piova, (Let it rain) 
F che il cielo mi lavi il dolor (Let heaven wash away my pain) 
F che piova (Let it rain) 
che sia la pace il nome d'amor (That peace would be the name of love)
