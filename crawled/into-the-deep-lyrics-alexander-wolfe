i hope i leave something behind, 
an open door, a broken line, 
'cos all i've seen is sacrifice, 
and sunburnt fields through open eyes, you're gonna leave all of this behind, 
into the deep with a fist of light, 
you're gonna be alright, i hope i leave something behind, 
an open door, a broken line, you're gonna leave all of this behind, 
into the deep with a fist of light, 
you're gonna be alright.
