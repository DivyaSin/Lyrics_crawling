I saw you 
Angels came to light your path 
I heard you keep their wings 
Pressed under glass Now how am I so enthralled 
That I might die? 
I saw you sweetly smile 
And say, do try, do try Anything 
I'd tear out my eyes for you, my dear 
Anything 
To see everything that you do I saw you so bereft, so pale and weak 
When I looked through 
You and I declined to speak 
I won't say Anything 
I'd tear out my eyes for you, my dear 
Anything 
To see everything that you do, I do Anything 
I'd tear out my soul for you, my dear, oh my dear 
Anything 
To feel everything as you do, I do 
Anything, anything Leave me, leave me to grieve 
That nothing's lost, nothing's lost 
Leave me but when you leave 
Know nothing's lost, nothing's lost Anything 
I'd tear out my eyes for you, my dear 
Anything 
To see everything that you do, I do Anything 
I'd tear out my soul for you, my dear, oh my dear 
Anything 
To feel everything as you do, I do, I do
