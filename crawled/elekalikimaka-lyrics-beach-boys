It's been my secret passion to try it 
To spend my Christmas surfin', I can't deny it 
I wanna spend my Christmas on the Kona coast in Hawaii For years I saved my pennies and planned it 
The great Pacific Ocean, we'll span it 
I wanna spend Christmas where I dig it the most, in Hawaii Go to Hawaii, Melekalikimaka is Merry Christmas in Hawaii talk-a 
And at Lahaina we'll count the shooting stars 
And it will be just you and me in Hawaii The sun tanned beauties are everywhere 
If you're comin' to the islands then you might stare 
And find a girl waiting for you there in Hawaii Kani and Wahini and the Haoles, too 
Wish a Melekalikimaka to you 
They're the friendliest people anywhere in Hawaii Go to Hawaii, Melekalikimaka is how they say it in island talk-a 
The island flower fragrance in the air 
We'll write a card and underneath the mango trees 
We'll say, "Wish you were here with us in Hawaii" Winter in the sun and surf'd sure be nice 
In a south sea garden paradise 
I wanna spend Christmas where I dig it the most, in Hawaii Honolulu, Waikiki 
Do you wanna come along with me? 
Waimia up to Hanalai 
I'd love to take you to the islands today
