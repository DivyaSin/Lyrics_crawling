My eyes were ignited by your beauty 
And my lips were excited to say 
What my heart was shouting out so deep inside me 
Well that was then, heres how theyd say it today Youre fucking Beautiful and when I kiss your lips 
I hear those fucking angels sing a hymn to youre grace 
Youre fucking beautiful and when I look into youre eyes 
Well I see everything on your whole fucking face If I were a wise man Id have the words Id have the wit 
At last I am no wise man, in fact I dont know shit 
Except youre fucking beautiful and when I hold 
You close it feels like fucking paradise come true 
And with your charms here in my arms Id be 
Content my fucking life with fucking you Fucking beautiful, fucking wonderful, fucking paradise 
Youre fucking beautiful, I hear fucking angels sing 
My hearts gonna fucking ache, so give me a fucking break 
And be my fucking turtle dove
