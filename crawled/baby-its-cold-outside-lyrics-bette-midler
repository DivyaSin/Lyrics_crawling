I really can't stay 
But baby, it's cold outside 
I got to go 'way 
But baby, it's cold outside This evening has been 
Been hopin' that you'd drop in 
So very nice 
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice My mother will start to worry 
Beautiful, what's your hurry? 
My father will be pacing the floor 
Listen to that fireplace roar So really I'd better scurry 
Beautiful, please don't hurry 
Well, maybe just a half a drink more 
Put some records on while I pour You know the neighbors might think 
But baby, it's bad out there 
Er, what's in this drink? 
No cabs to be had out there I wish I knew how 
Your eyes are like starlight now 
To break this spell 
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell I ought to say no, no, no sir 
Mind if I move in closer? 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
What's the sense in hurtin' my pride? I really can't stay 
Baby, don't hold out 
Ahh, but it's cold outside 
Baby, it's cold outside 
Ahh, but it's cold outside 
Baby, it's cold outside
