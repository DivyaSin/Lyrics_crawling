Excuse me 
I need a little more money 
Just a drink to score 
But I can tell you honey 
I need a hundred more 
I gotta give myself 
What I'm looking for 
Gotta feed my head now, one's for all 
With two scary Bloody Marys and a Thunderball, baby 
It's gonna be alright now, baby 
It's gonna be alright, I'm doing fine 
I said one, two, three and a little bit more 
Oh, my God, I can't, can't find the door 
I can't find the door 
I can't find the door 
I can't find the door 
I can't stand straight 
But I can think right 
With my Frisco San Fransisco I'm still growing up 
Mature all the way to the Lucifer cup, baby 
It's gonna be alright now, baby 
It's gonna be alright, I'm doing fine 
I said one, two, three and a little bit more 
Oh, my God, I can't, can't find the door 
I can't find the door 
I can't find the door 
I can't find the door 
I ain't want no Soda 
And no female Ginger Ale 
'Cause I need special treatment so I can go home 
Maybe I'll make it to the five o' clock loan, man 
It's gonna be alright now, baby 
It's gonna be alright, I'm doing fine 
I said one, two, three and a little bit more 
Oh, my God, I can't, can't find the door 
I can't find the door 
I can't find the door 
I said one, two, three and a little bit more 
Oh, my God 
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine 
Where's the door? 
Wait a minute honey 
Oh, my God, yeah
