Well we're all half-crazy 
And half clear as a bell 
Half believer, half goin' to hell 
Half goin' to hell 
Half goin' to hell Well we're all half Rama 
And half Bonnie and Clyde 
Half devoted, half buried alive 
Half buried alive 
Half buried alive Shine 
On the one you love Holy pony 
Lord, Lord, Lord, what have I done 
A cloud of hornets blackened the sun 
Blackened the sun 
Blackened the sun
