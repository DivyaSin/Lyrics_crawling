I guess what I'm trying to say is, 
Every day is like a different flavor 
I know it can be superficial 
But in the end, there's more that I discover 
I'll it break down, what I'm saying 
Cos one day you're high 
And then the next you're low 
It's like a merry-go-round 
Wherever you go, you're gonna ride it 
Anything is possible, I'm feeling good 
Oh its what I do if it's all the music's gonna give me Oh its superficial 
But underneath it all, it can be so wonderful 
It feels like I'm on a high 
But underneath it all, its superficial, yeah I don't wanna sound ungrateful 
I wouldn't change it cos I love what I do 
There's a lot of incomplications 
I'm getting out the way 
But I always fall through 
Cos one day you're high 
And then the next you're low 
You gotta work it out, what living is all about 
Cos anything is possible, we're feeling good 
Cos we do it just for you 
We're getting back what we've given Oh its superficial 
But underneath it all, it can be so wonderful 
It feels like I'm on a high 
But underneath it all, its superficial, yeah You got me dazed and confused 
I'm loving all that I do 
Otherwise I wouldn't pursue 
Cos I always live by the truth 
And now I ? 
Cos I'm living by the rhythm and the blues 
I'm gonna tell you about how I made it through 
? 
Connected physically 
A mental stimulation, ya feeling me 
Once, twice, and then comes the trilogy 
For better or worse, they're still selling me 
How ya like the way it sounds? 
The way that the beat goes down 
? 
Cos the rest is superficial 
Don't believe the hype Oh its superficial 
But underneath it all, it can be so wonderful 
It feels like I'm on a high 
But underneath it all, its superficial, yeah
