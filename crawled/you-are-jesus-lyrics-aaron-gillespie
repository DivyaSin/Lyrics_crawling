It doesn't matter who I was 
It doesn't matter where I've been 
Your grace is all I am chasing 
It doesn't matter when I wake 
It doesn't matter when I sleep 
Your arms are open for me I am complete cause you say I could 
I am may clean into the round will stay 
You are Jesus 
You are Jesus 
You are everything I need 
You are holy I am dirty 
In You I am clean 
You are Jesus You get my brain and it's moving backward 
You hear my voice when I am screaming 
You feel my pain so long ago 
Your just follow me I am complete cause you say I could 
I am may clean into the round will stay 
You are Jesus 
You are Jesus 
You are everything I need 
You are holy I am dirty 
In You I am clean 
You are Jesus
