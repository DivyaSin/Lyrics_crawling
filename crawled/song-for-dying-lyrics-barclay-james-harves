Two of them watched in the dawn's early light 
And two of them died in the morning 
Search not your soul if you want to be right 
But two of them died in the morning It's not for you, we cry 
No, not for those who die 
It is only for their sons 
Forget the lives of others who are gone Two and by two in the dawn's early light 
All went to die in the morning 
Search not your souls for the truth and the right 
For all went to die in the morning light It's not for you we cry, no, not for those who die 
It is only for their sons 
Forget the lives of others who are gone 
Forget the lives of others who are gone 
Forget the lives of others who are gone It's not for you we cry, no, not for those who die 
It is only for their sons 
Forget the lives of others who are gone 
Forget the lives of others who are gone Forget the lives of others who are gone 
Forget the lives of others who are gone 
Forget the lives of others who are gone Forget the lives of others who are gone 
Forget the lives of others who are gone 
Forget the lives of others who are gone
