Picture me in a hospital 
The blood runs red and the bags are full of... 
Oh it's terrible, makes me powerful 
On and on there's still a song for me 
I'm still around to sing it Each man has a secret 
To hide away 
And never say, never know, and so it goes Picture me in a hospital 
The blood runs cold and hall are full of 
Undesirables preaching parables 
False alarm there's still a charm for me 
Just wait and see If each man had his freedom 
And it was ours to say 
How to behave, ho who's to say So picture me in a hospital 
Blood runs raw and the bags are full of 
You're terrible and I'm invincible 
Picture me in a hospital 
The blood runs red and the bags are full of 
It's hysterical, and it makes me powerful False alarm there's still a song for me 
I'm just about around to sing it 
There's still a chance for me 
And I'm still here singing And so it goes 
On and on and on and so it goes And so it goes
