Not one more word tonight 
between here and there 
Well put a distance the size of the ocean 
so now his heart can beat a skipping rythm 
As the cadence carries me 
I almost drift away 
far enough to forget 
but when it comes you cannot hesitate 
and when found i will write 
on account and seal it in an envelope 
addresed to your last known residence Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaoooooooooooooooo and we sink and we drown 
and what is lost can never be found 
well these arms they'd swim, 
until the lungs pulled in 
when panic was lost in a deep understanding 
that you will see what is wrong with everything 
what is wrong with you and me 
that make all the right reasons to fuck it up 
your gonna fuck it up Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaoooooooooooooooo
