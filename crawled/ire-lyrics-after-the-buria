we feel so much better here below 
down here where the eyes are yellow and gold 
we rot inside out, we crack and flake 
nothing is better than deep down below my whole mouth brimming of leaves, submerged and gasping for air let the earth swallow me whole 
fertile graves bury me engulf my bones 
eyes full of stone as they close 
intertwine with the sediment as we sink into the mire 
oh I sense a confused declaration we beat the horse with a sort of unknown conviction 
and nothing ever matters, we sink into the mire so I lay here tangled in vines and a mouth brimming with leaves 
theres nothing to eat but she fertilizes me we feel so much better here below 
down here where the eyes are yellow and gold 
we rot inside out, we crack and flake 
nothing is better than deep down below Do you know what it's like to be inside separate from life 
a shallow grave for benevolence 
submerged we grasp for light but none that truly exists 
better then, nothing now, You feel the earth surround you as you fall 
inside a new life animates itself we feel so much better here below 
down here where the eyes are yellow and gold 
we rot inside out, we crack and flake 
nothing is better than deep down below 
we feel so much better here below 
down here where the eyes are blank and cold 
we rot inside out, we fast decay 
nothing is better than deep down below
