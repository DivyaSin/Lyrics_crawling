Charlie: You don't know what I've been through 
I can teach something that I never knew 
Take a seat and take some time 
Let me tell you what I've been through 
They didn't know we'd come this far 
Now they're looking at our Battle Scars 
Half the lies you heard ain't true 
So let me tell you what I've been through Leondre: I have a dream to be the one 
To be the one I want to see up on the screen 
And when my son sees me 
I want to be the one the he wants to be 
And honestly I'm scared 
My life is like a pier 
People walk all over me 
The waves are closing in you see 
Relying on fate 
But what if I wait maybe a day 
But what if I'm late 
I miss my ride to take me where I'm meant to go 
Or take me home 
Why do i have these emotion? 
I don't want 
Please take them 
I'm stuck inside a hole with nowhere to go 
And I really hate them 
DAMN! 
Do I have that much of an impact? 
My rhymes did that? 
Sometimes I wanna quit ant hit back 
But what is there to fear? 
Why I'm I even here? 
Is there someone out there 
Cause there's no one I can hear Charlie: You don't know what I've been through 
I can teach you something that I never knew 
Take a seat and take some time 
Let me tell you what I've been through 
They didn't know we'd come this far 
Now they're looking at our Battle Scars 
Half the lies you heard ain't true 
So let me tell you what I've been through Leondre: It's hard looking back 
But I feel the times right 
I ventured to the dark but i wanna see the light 
I'll lay my scars in front of you 
And show you what they done to me 
I wouldn't change what happened 
They have made who I am 
DAMN! 
I want to hit back 
I want to hit it out the park 
But I don't have a bat 
Am I out of my depth? 
Am I out of my league? 
Tell where exit is cause I wanna to leave 
I'm terrified to what's at the middle of this maze 
If there is a god 
Please take from my this place 
What's the mean of existence? 
Am i stuck inside the game? 
What will happened when I die? 
Will my story be replay? 
I feel a void inside me that not a thing can fill 
Sometimes I wanna cry, die, even want to kill 
What's up with these emotion? 
I don't wanna feel at all Charlie: You don't know what I've been through 
I can teach you something that I never knew
