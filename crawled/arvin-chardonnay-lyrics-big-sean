Early in the morning 
When she's all alone 
I'mma take my time 
Do it how we want it 
Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
Yeaaah She love the way I'm doing it 
So GOOD she wont put my tattoo on it 
Bottom line is, you the finest 
Gave you a new name (whats that, whats that?) 
My b*tch 
Hold up, hol' up, woah there 
Lets capture this moment if I hit it then I own it 
Mari Want it every mornin' 
And Patronin' girl, we grownin' 
Waddup, the p*ssy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on 
Street lights on? 
You know I got it going til it's [Chorus] 
Early in the morning 
When she's all alone 
I'mma take my time 
Do it how we want it 
Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
Just let the song play (And ima give it to you) 
The long way (And ima give it to you) 
The strong way (you got it all day) 
It's our day (it like the strong way) 
It's our way (I picked a long day) 
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay [Kanye West] 
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
Talk to the, talk to the hand 
(b*tch)You talking to a grown ass man 
It's like, way way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak 
(There goes the bed sheets) 
Err'ybody rip the swag off 
'Fore I rip the tag off 
Why my pants sag off, cause I'm rappin' my ass off 
Flow so ugly, money so handsome 
This the f-cking anthem, get it, the f-cking anthem [Chorus] [Kanye West] 
I don't really wanna uhh talk too much sh*t 
But you love it when I talk like I lost it 
And I love how you look when ya blazin' 
And I swear you turn at least half asian 
And we 'bout to have a liason 
She cool, give head with her shades on 
You should just go and throw a cape on 
And it's just so amazing 
So amazing 
So amazing [Big Sean] 
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop, that shit look like I'm speed racing 
Leave em with me, it'll boost your reputation 
Westside is where I'm stationed 
Spend all night, just champagne tasting 
Aint no rest girl, lets just pace it til its... [Chorus] And this was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
