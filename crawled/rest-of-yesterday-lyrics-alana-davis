The laws of reason tend to leave me cold 
Ignore every season every season still I grow old and cold 
I've contained my future by holding on to the past 
And I blame my teachers for letting me too fast 
And I wonder now can I survive between wired awake and half alive 
When I can't succeed I can only try to validate each day 
And I'm losing though I'm using my best 
And I'm choosing to destroy all the rest of yesterday 
They'll suck you in with I believe in yous 
And let you think it's your gifts that make them choose you 
Now I discover the catch about being real 
It can make liars out of lovers who can't handle what you feel 
And I work so hard just to keep it clean 
I do unto others you know what I mean 
I got a backstage pass to my next dream that says I'm not alone 
And I'm losing though I'm using my best 
And I'm choosing to destroy all the rest of yesterday, 
All the rest of my yesterday
