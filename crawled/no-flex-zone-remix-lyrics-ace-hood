(Hook) 
No flex zone, no flex zone 
They know betta, they know betta 
No flex zone, no flex zone 
They know betta, they know betta (Verse) 
Wanna go deddle, and I go dizzle 
I treat these hoes special, now yo hoe jealous 
Frank hoes got 7, they 10s are betta 
I'mma transetter, I'mma goldgetter 
Attention err'body, I'm gettin' sick and tired of gettin' modest 
I'm gettin' plenty money, now they think I'm Illuminati 
I'm the reason why they own a new Bugatti 
I'm the one who give the flow to the game 
Rap game, it will neva be the same 
I done burf you niggas and then nervous you niggas 
I'm the reason why you eva had a name 
I'm the one who runnin' thangs in the south 
You don't run a damn thing but yo mouth 
Niggas talkin' outta terms till I pull up with the burn 
Now the souls outside of yo house 
Man, see me ride round the city with the top down 
Bad bitches all out of heads down 
Turnt for a nigga whole throat 
And I'mma come and get it like a rebound 
Bust it one time like a Greyhound 
Ass in the air with ya face down 
All this money on the floor, all this money on the table 
It so much you would think Floyd Mayround 
Why the broke boys always wanna flex? 
Be the main ones, scare me with the checks 
Niggas ball for a minute, blowin' bands on them bitches 
Now they missin' tryna car you collect 
Howl, you's a fraud, nigga, I'm at yo bottle 
U a thot, bitch, you ain't no model 
It's a no flex zone, couple gold chains on 
I look like I just hit the lotto 
Whole minute gone with a foreign bitch tourin' 
Heard ya new shit, ah, bored 
I'm in the studio, cookin' that greatness 
Take time, have a lil bit of patience 
I'm the one, no Neo with the Matrix 
No flex, we the best hood nation 
These niggas wanna claim they run it 
Thou trippin' like ya took a vacation 
Shout to boy AC and my dawg Chew-Chew 
Where the lil homie project baby? 
Dane gank I see ya poppin' no caracida 
Lot of deal, deer feel with my Haitians 
Brower (Hook) 
No flex zone, no flex zone 
They know betta, they know betta 
No flex zone, no flex zone 
They know better, they know better 
Won a gold medal 
And a gold bezel 
I treat it so special 
Now your ho jealous 
Freak Hoes, got several 
They tens or better 
I'm a trendsetter 
I'm a go-getter (Verse) 
Young niggas got get to the money 
Five chains so they look at me funny 
Showed up with the juice and the troops 
Roll a seven every time I shoot 
She said why you have so many condoms with you 
I said I'm a player to be honest with you 
Hublot, (Whoo!) so shiny 
Mind you my crew right behind me 
Went shopping, could've bought an island 
Talking money when I'm with Italians 
Spilling purple on the red carpet 
And I'm flyer than a nigga on a hang glider 
Four five six seven chains on 
Just stay in your lane ho 
Don't you like these A wangs 
Don't you like these gold fangs? 
You a well known flexer 
I'm a young trendsetter 
These hoes they reckless 
They slick, they messy 
Three hoes freak dancing 
On the loud, singing acapella 
Chain clang like heavy metal 
Slim killed the haters, god bless em
