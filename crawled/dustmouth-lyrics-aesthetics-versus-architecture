To all my friends who never looked back at me 
I hope you see me in every fucking nose bleed 
I wasn't ready for what was thrown my way 
Thrown my way 
None of my friends have died yet 
Who's to say if that's for the best? 
Who's to say? 
And I have way too much time to think of this 
And it is keeping me up at night 
Dustmouth, keep fucking lying to yourself 
But I for one, have fucking had it 
I wasn't ready for what was thrown my way 
Thrown my way 
Liar! Liar! Sip it right through your nose 
while those pills stick in your fucking throat. 
Do you feel the roof of your mouth collapse? 
You fucking joke 
They always say, live life with no regrets 
But, if you regret nothing, then what have you learned 
To all those I called my friends: 
Fuck you 
And fuck your drugs 
You all wasted my time 
And your life 
To all my friends who never looked back at me 
I hope you see me in every fucking nose bleed
