Darkness is definitely fallin' 
Movin' so slow I'm barely crawlin' Here I sit, dirt on my hands 
Lyin' way, out in the Shadowlands Leave my bed and here I lie 
Try to hold my head up high 
Lyin' to myself sometimes 
Bad decisions, but I now won't cry Been down a long and twisted avenue 
Sencin' myself at a record low 
Do anything just to get ahead 
Now it's all quiet here in this Shadowland In my Shadowland, I've done things I know were wrong 
Proved down deep were all alone 
Sold my pride for a song 
Lost my way but I'll go on and I'll go on, on Here I sit, dirt on my hands 
The only way out in this Shadowland In this Shadowland 
I looked around for beautiful things 
'Cause success I've found out of hallow end Not so sure for what I stand 
All quiet here in the Shadowlands 
Quiet here in the Shadowlands 
Ohhh in the Shadowlands 
Hey, in the Shadowlands Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
