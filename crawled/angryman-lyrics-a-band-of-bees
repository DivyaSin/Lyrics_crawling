Built my walls long and low 
Knuckles crack and lillies grow 
Have a baby hold her up let her know 
Leave the airport to the airplanes Leave the taxis to the runways 
Silvers high up on the landing 
Tastes like early morning 
May you never lose your temper Heavy father heavy son 
Angryman 
That's the hurt that's in your head 
That's the man that you just met May not be a brighter day 
But there'll be one on the way 
An angry man needs attention
