You say it's wrong 
But I say alright 
Alright is wrong 
Or might is right Everything is fucked so bad 
So messed up so sad 
You ain't feeling so fine 
When there's too much speed along the line And there's freak confusions in your bed 
And you got triple sixes in your head So get dead on an anything-can-happen-day 
Baby, get dead, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah I walk on by 
I need a higher 
Place to go away 
On an anything-can-happen-day There's freak confusions in your bed 
And you got triple sixes in your head So get dead on an anything-can-happen-day 
Baby, get dead, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah I said, get dead See what I hear 
Feel what I fear 
So what's new, what you trying to do 
I make no deals with you Get dead on an anything-can-happen-day 
Baby, get dead, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah I said, get dead 
Get dead 
Baby, get dead 
Get dead
