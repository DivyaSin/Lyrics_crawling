Even the bad times are good when you're around 
Darlin', you kiss away all my blues 
Even the hard times are easy to face 
'Cause I know that your love will come through You light up my flame, then you drive me insane 
There ain't nothing that you cannot do 
Then you rip up my heart, you just tear it apart 
As I shoot all my love into you Lovin' is easy with both eyes closed 
You know that's the best way to feel it 
Lovin' is easy with both eyes closed 
Just get a hold and watch how it grows Even the bad times are good when you're around 
Darlin', you kiss away all my blues 
Even the hard times are easy to face 
'Cause I know that your love will come through You tear up my soul and then fill up the whole 
Of your being, your love, your desire 
Then you grab for my heart you just tear it apart 
As I shoot all my love in your fire Lovin' is easy with both eyes closed 
You know that's the best way to feel it 
Lovin' is easy with both eyes closed 
Just get a hold and watch how it grows Lovin' is easy with both eyes closed 
You know that's the best way to feel it 
Lovin' is easy with both eyes closed 
Just get a hold and watch how it grows
