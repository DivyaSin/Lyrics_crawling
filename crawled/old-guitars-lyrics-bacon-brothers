She gave me an old guitar 
She said teach yourself to play 
You've been lookin' kind of bored 
Maybe this will fill your day 
She went out and I stayed in 
And I struggled with that thing 
She went west and I stayed east 
And I tried my best to sing 
And I sang Sam and Dave 
Catch that wave 
The Boss and Buddy Holly 
And every happy song I sang 
Sounded melancholy 
I learned C and G 
and D and E 
and F and F sharp minor 
And in my mind when she walked out 
I'd gone to Carolina 
And I went 
do do do, do do do do, do do do, do do do do 
do do do, do do do do, do do do, do do do do Hearts can break just like a string 
Old guitars can't fix a thing 
I Put that Martin in it's case 
With the memory of her face 
Where it stayed to gather dust 
And I waited for someone to trust 
Couldn't stand to twist and shout 
Not too much to sing about 
No more Dave ClarkFive, Four Seasons 
Three Dog Night, Too Hot to Handle 
When even Mozart leaves me cold 
Brahms and Bach and Handel 
Creedance, Creech and Croce 
Couldn't get my heart a pumpin' 
Jimmy Smack would not come back 
Jack Flash wasn't jumpin' 
no more 
do do do, do do do do, do do do do do do do 
do do do, do do do do, do do do do do do do Fifteen years have come and gone 
And my wife hands me this old axe 
She said I wanna hear you play 
Watch your face as you relax 
You've got six more shiny strings 
And you've got me alone tonight 
Stroke that neck and of me 
Hold that guitar nice and tight 
And I sang Don and Phil 
Fool on the hill 
The Band and Van and Lyle 
But every sad sad song I sang 
I sang with a smile 
I learned Marvin Gay 
Dock of the Bay 
The Spinners and The Blue Notes 
Goffin King and Boyce and Hart 
Even some that I wrote 
And I went 
do do do, do do do do, do do do do do do do 
do do do, do do do do, do do do do do do do I feel fine, Patsy Kline 
The king and Sting and Bonnie 
Maybe we could harmonize 
Just like June and Johnny 
Zimmerman, the Glimmer Twins 
And both the Neils, Young and Diamond 
Monkeys Turtles, Drifters, Coasters, 
Jackson and the Osmonds 
One more time 
do do do, do do do do, do do do do do do do 
do do do, do do do do, do do do do do do do
