Steam rising off of the river at the break of day 
Light creeping into room 218 at the Beaujolais 
Left you crawling across the floor 
Head ringing, your eyes so sore 
Bloodshot, drowning while you down another bottle away The ashtray is overflowing, it's full of gray days 
The devil that you knew one time may be the devil you save 
Get up and find your shoes 
There are some things that you just don't lose 
The street's been a-creeping with the barefooting blues for days Call me from the Second Line 
Pour us up some cheap French wine 
Pick up your feet, leave your blues fading to gray 
Come on now cut your soul loose, the Second Line's dancing away There's a crowd down under the window in a big parade 
They got a brass band dancing in front, oh umbrellas they wave 
They gonna shake it 'til the sun come down 
They just laid old Moses deep in the ground 
Get yourself together, walk yourself right out of your grave
