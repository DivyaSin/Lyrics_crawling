I feel and I smell and I taste and I see 
Experiences they dub reality 
I'm living life's journey the best that I can 
But sometimes I find I don't know where I am I often perceive the world out of context 
The more that I wonder the more I'm perplexed 
So I look to balance and self-harmony 
While I'm in life and life's in me I am a being who is unique 
What I discover depends what I seek 
I with to travel without to within 
To discover existence outside of my skin I feel and I smell and I taste and I see 
Experiences they dub reality 
I'm living life's journey the best that I can 
But sometimes I find I don't know where I am I often perceive the world out of context 
The more that I wonder the more I'm perplexed 
So I look to balance and self-harmony 
While I'm in life and lives in me I feel, smell, taste and I see 
Experience called reality 
And I live the best that I can
