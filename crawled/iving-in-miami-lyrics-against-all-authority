He didn't fit in he always felt rejected 
His father hit him and made him feel defective 
He got a bottle 
It seemed to take the pain away 
He's only 15 and he don't know any other way 
Always searching, never felt like he belonged 
Always hurting, always told that he was wrong 
He left home, the streets looked safer 
All alone except a quart of Schaffer 
All alone and nowhere to go 
He feels at home at the punk rock show 
And when he's hanging out with his crew 
He's living on the streets of Miami 
He'd rather die than go home to his family 
And that's what he'll do 
He doesn't want your pity 
Miami can be a cruel city 
He's always ready for a fight 
He doesn't want your sorrow 
Don't wanna think about tomorrow 
He only wants to make it through the night
