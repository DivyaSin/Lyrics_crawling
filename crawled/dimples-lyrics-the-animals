I love the way you walk 
Said I'm crazy 'bout your walk 
I love the way you talk 
When you're talkin' that talk 
I love the way you walk 
You're my baby 
Got my eyes on you 
I see you everyday 
In your neighborhood 
I see you everyday 
And you sure look good 
I see you everyday 
You're my baby 
Got my eyes on you 
I see you everyday 
In your neighborhood 
I see you everyday 
Woman, you sure look good 
I see you everyday 
Walkin' up and down the street 
You got on your high-heeled sneakers baby 
You sure look neat 
I said I see you everyday, little baby 
I got my eyes on you 
You got the dimples in your jaw 
You're my baby 
I got my eyes on you
