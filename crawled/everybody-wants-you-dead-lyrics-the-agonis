You did me wrong! Yeah, you screwed me 
But guess what! I win, you lose 
How funny, what you show when youve got nothing to prove 
Everybody wants you? Everybody wants you dead 
But I want you right here 
To see your face when youve got no one left Sticky fingers touch the treetops... 
Could we collapse them with one slip? 
Can you really swear by a reality where miles are measured by inch? 
Tonight we are two, dipping toes in flooding puddles 
Programmed romance makes us shudder, pictures never grow old 
Obviously dusting powdery days off your skin, 
Familiar eyes are rabid, transplanted to a strangers skull How am I to keep you happy, healthy and strong 
when you harbor such infection, such scar tissue in your bones 
I didnt think dysplasia would so affect it 
You know, tonight there is a crime to commit Im thinking it through Im convinced its true 
Youre the beach of my attention but the tide is coming in 
Will you buckle down like barnacles, a one-time contagion? Will you passively wade away like layers of pollution? 
Or will you still be holding your breath when tides go out again? 
What happened to what you thought of me? 
I shattered all the imagery 
The pretense was a forgery I really am what I present You know, tonight theres a crime to commit 
and Im the criminal, victim and punishment
