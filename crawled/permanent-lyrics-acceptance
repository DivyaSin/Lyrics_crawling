Sometime ago, 
I keep losing track over again, 
All these promises won't turn golden until you Touch them It's permanent, 
Nothing is permanent 
It's permanent, 
We'll be watching your back following Indecision's lasting for years, 
Indecision's lasting for years. Sometime ago, 
Memories in my head are starting again, 
Speak it fast don't move in slow, 
Running through the country maybe they will find me. It's permanent, 
Nothing is permanent 
It's permanent, 
We'll be watching your back, 
We'll be watching your back 
Following indecision's lasting for year 
Indecision's lasting for years 
Like a river in Arizona dried up before you were born
