Well I feel like I've come to the end of a long long road 
My body's tired and my mind's got no place to go 
The end of the line's where I'm at, 'cause there's nothing left to be 
Just a burnt out case, God, the leper and me 
Well I feel like I've come to the end of a long long day 
The victim of a life that I tried to give away 
A prisoner of the isles where there's nothing left to be 
Just a burnt out case, God, the leper and me Well I feel like I've come to the end of a long long road 
My body's tired and my mind's got no place to go 
The end of the line's where I'm at, 'cause there's nothing left to be 
Just a burnt out case, God, the leper and me
