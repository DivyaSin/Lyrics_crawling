The beginning, the beginning of time Rivers keep rolling 
They run to the sea 
Since the beginning of time The birds that keep on a-flying 
Where no man can be 
Since the beginning of time Oh, my darling, let me tell you now 
Long ago and far away 
With just a hand full of faith 
In seven days, in seven nights 
He built the world that we live in today And so it was written 
You were made for me 
Since the beginning... of time And I just wonder do I have time enough to say 
I just want to say that I 
I thank the heaven above for making me 
My destiny, my love 
Hmmm and you're mine 
Baby, you're mine 
I wonder have I told you you're mine 
Baby, I said you're mine 
Let me tell you 
Ah said since the beginning of time !
