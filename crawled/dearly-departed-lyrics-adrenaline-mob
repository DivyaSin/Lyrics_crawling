I gave you everything 
Took you under my wing 
With open arms brought you in the family 
You took the life from me 
Now your my enemy 
Soon to be a memory 
Of the dearly departed We were the best of friends 
Thought it would never end 
I curse the day they said you're selling me out 
Now everybody's hurt 
You're singing like a bird 
Spilling all your guts like a dirty rat When it's time to die 
You can cry your heart out when you're lying face down 
The chords they never lie 
Don't tell me that you're sorry 
'Cause no-one else is sorrier than me Whatever happened to the person I once knew 
You always had my back when all the bullets were flying 
You know we had it all but I would take the fall 
And never turn my back on the ones who love me When it's time to die 
You can cry your heart out when you're lying face down 
The chords they never lie 
Don't tell me that you're sorry 
'Cause no-one else is sorrier than me GUITAR SOLO When it's time to die 
You can cry your heart out when you're lying face down 
The chords they never lie 
Don't tell me that you're sorry 
'Cause no-one else is sorrier than me No-one's sorrier than me 
No-one's sorrier than me 
No-one's sorrier than me
