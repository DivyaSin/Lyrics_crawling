Got any plans for the weekend 
Cause I've got an idea 
Lets do something we ain't done in a couple years 
Lets roll out on the highway and we'll wave the world goodbye 
Well come on baby how bout we just drive Just drive and get away 
Just drive and run away 
Cause I love you right beside me 
And the way it makes me feel 
When I've got one hand on your leg 
And one hand on the wheel 
And we just drive Well pack a bag with some simple things 
Cause you won't need much 
Just a pair of faded jeans 
I love it when you wear that stuff 
You can let you hair down 
We can loose all track of time 
Come on baby how bout we just drive Let's just disappear together 
And leave it all behind
