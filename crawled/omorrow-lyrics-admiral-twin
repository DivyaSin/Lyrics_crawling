We slipped up tripping 
Over words we shouldn't say 
But then tomorrow 
We'll start over anyway 
Tonight close your eyes 
Give up the fight tonight Tomorrow 
Let's start over 
Tomorrow 
Let's start over 
With our eyes half closed 
Just in case tomorrow never shows If life's a stage 
Then we auditioned 
For a play we didn't get 
Though this one's tragic 
The last act's not over yet 
Take five, forget your lines 
Let's rewrite tonight Tomorrow 
We'll start over 
Tomorrow 
We'll start over 
With our fingers crossed 
Just in case tomorrow never shows
