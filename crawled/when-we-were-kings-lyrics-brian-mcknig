In every heart, there is a drum that beats 
Steady and strong, it does not know defeat 
I feel it pound, and know the sound 
Of true beliefs 
In every soul, there is a memory 
Of standing tall, the proudest we could be 
I cannot fall, for I recall 
We were born in majesty And when the long fight, has been fought and won 
We'll stand in the sun [Chorus] 
And we will raise out hands 
And we will touch the sky 
Together we will dance in robes of gold 
And we will leave the world remembering 
When we were kings, when we were kings Now is the time, here is the mountain top 
When one man climbs, the rest are lifted up 
With every step we're closer yet 
To a higher destiny And when we reach out to claim the thrown 
Every man will know [Chorus] Do you remember 
When we were kings 
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee 
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee And when the long fight, has been fought and won 
We'll stand in the sun [Chorus]
