For everything you've got to 
give away there's something else 
something that should remain And all the roads you have to 
walk alone are so much more 
more than you just thought For all the time you had to wait 
there's always love one dream away Sometimes the night is coming 
just to spend with you all time 
you know the light's inside There's no use in looking 
back to what you've left behind 
the best you kept outside For all the things you knew too late 
there's always love one dream away And all the roads you have to 
walk alone are so much more 
more than you just thought And all the doors you could not 
open before, now they seem 
to offer you everything For all the time you had to wait 
there's always love one dream away
