I'm sorry darling but I was miles away from here 
(And didn't listen) 
But don't worry, I'm with you 
'Cause nowhere else I would rather be 
Couldn't live without you 
Wouldn't do without you near me I'm so happy where I am 
But too much of a good thing 
Never hurt anybody 
So let's leave this noisy town 
And move out to tread on enchanted ground 
I've got to get things ready 
Don't delay it any longer And find a little house in a valley Where the sun's always smiling A perfect place for you and me 
Miles away Now you see the reason 
Why I'm drifting miles away 
(But now without you) 
Just imagine a great big world 
Only waiting for us to discover it 
I'm getting so impatient 
Our life could be even better In our little house in a valley 
Where the sun's always smiling Where we got some more space to breathe 
Miles away When the world gets too much 
We'll hide 
So no one can find us there 
(Says answering machine) "Phone again leave your name 
Don't disturb our little home miles away" Let's find a little house in a valley 
Where the sun's always smiling My neighbors are Jeff and Jill Miles away, somewhere 
Miles away
