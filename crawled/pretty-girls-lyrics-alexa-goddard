Yeah (Verse 1) 
I can do it, do it good 
He like my body, he like my look 
Coz them girls don't dress like my clic do 
We got them jez, got them chains like them girls do 
Yea he want it, he want it bad 
I see you looking, uh I guess you're mad 
Coz you standing in line with your ID 
The bouncer told us come in, yup they with me (Rift) 
Thou shall be good, thou shall be sweet 
But that ain't my life now that ain't for me shut upp 
We walked up in this party like we own the whole room 
Them girls might try to do it they can't do it like we do 
Coz we them (Chorus) 
Pretty girls dressed up like tom boys 
Blonde hair don't care on some black one 
Gold watch, gold chain and some camouflage 
Oh yea we them girls, oh yea we them girls 
We them girls getting in with no ID 
In the four door jeep playing VID 
Bandannas on our heads like its 93 
Oh yea we them girls, oh yea we them girls Yea we them, Yea we them (Verse 2) 
No worries, no sleep, the party stop, soon as we leave 
It's 3am just waiting for the sun to rise 
Yea its gonna be one of those kinda nights 
A couple texts but no regrets, might throw some back 
Might call my ex. Living life to the fullest fill up the glass 
Coz bad girls finish first good girls last (Rift x1) (Chorus x1) 
(Rift x1) (Chorus x1)
