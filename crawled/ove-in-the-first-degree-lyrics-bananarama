Last night I was dreaming 
I was locked in a prison cell 
When I woke up I was screaming 
Calling out your name Whoa and the judge and the jury 
They all put the blame on me 
They wouldn't go for my story 
They wouldn't hear my plea Only you can set me free 
'Cause I'm guilty 
Guilty as a girl can be 
Come on baby can't you see 
I stand accused of love in the first degree 
Guilty 
Of love in the first degree Someday I believe it 
You will come to my rescue 
Unchain my heart you're keeping 
And let me start anew, ooh 
The hours pass so slowly 
Since they've thrown away the key 
Can't you see that I'm lonely 
Won't you help me please Only you can set me free 
'Cause I'm guilty 
Guilty as a girl can be 
Come on baby can't you see 
I stand accused of love in the first degree 
Guilty 
Of love in the first degree Guilty of love, guilty of love in 
Guilty of love, guilty of love in 
Guilty, 
Of love in the first degree Whoa and the judge and the jury 
They all put the blame on me 
They wouldn't go for my story 
They wouldn't hear my plea Only you can set me free 
'Cause I'm guilty 
Guilty as a girl can be 
Come on baby can't you see 
I stand accused of love in the first degree 
Guilty 
Of love in the first degree Only you can set me free 
'Cause I'm guilty 
Guilty as a girl can be 
Come on baby can't you see 
I stand accused of love in the first degree 
Guilty 
Of love in the first degree Only you can set me free 
'Cause I'm guilty 
Guilty as a girl can be 
Come on baby can't you see 
I stand accused of love in the first degree 
Guilty 
Of love in the first degree
