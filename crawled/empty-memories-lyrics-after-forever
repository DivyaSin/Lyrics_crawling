Here, here in this heart it's cold 
Cold as stone 
Must welcome these memories 
As shallow as my eyes have slowly become Hearts, frail heart left broken 
Cold and known for its bitter agony 
Here are the memories as empty as my life has slowly become 
Sting, crush and bite in my soul 
My heart bleeds Times changed forever that night 
Leaving only empty memories 
Empty memories won't heal the pain We know only sorrow 
There's no future in tomorrow 
All our hopes were buried too young 
For the years that should have followed We know only hatred 
There's no future in our anguish 
For all hope is buried with life 
And reprisal will be ours It's empty 
We're empty 
They're empty memories Here, here in this heart 
Cold as stone, for no feelings there to warm 
It is as empty as our dreams and hopes 
Now our future is gone 
It stings and bites in my soul 
My heart bleeds Times changed forever that night 
Leaving only empty memories 
Time was changed forever that night Leaving me, no, no, no, alone with empty memories 
Empty memories 
Empty memories
