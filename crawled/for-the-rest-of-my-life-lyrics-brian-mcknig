Star light, star bright, 
Have you ever felt the way I feel tonight? 
Sparkle in your eyes, as the diamond shines, 
Guaranteeing that you'll always be mine. Let me tell you, for the rest of my life I'll be true. 
Here to tell you this evening, 
And the rest of my days and nights belong to you. 
You can believe that there ain't nothing in this world that I'd rather do. 
Now and forever my heart belongs to you. 
Now and forever, for the rest of my life I love you. And it's alright, go ahead and cry, 
I'm so happy now that I could die. 
(I understand your tears) 
And you touched my soul, 
More than you know. 
So afraid that you would tell me. Let me tell you, for the rest of my life I'll be true. 
Here to tell you this evening, 
And the rest of my days and nights belong to you. 
You can believe that there ain't nothing in this world that I'd rather do. 
Now and forever my heart belongs to you. 
Now and forever, for the rest of my life I love you. The countdown has begun until the day, 
And I know that we're gonna be together come what may, 
And if you want me and need to always be there, 
Constantly, patiently, taking good care, 
I'll be there, you'll know I'll be there. For the rest of my life I'll be true. 
And the rest of my days and nights belong to you. 
You can believe that there's nothing in this world that I'd rather do. 
Now and forever my heart belongs to you. 
Now and forever, for the rest of my life I love you. 
I love you.
