Bed of roses 
By bonnie hayes 
From the album "bette of roses" Long, long ago, where the tall grass grows 
And the still air is sweet with summer flowers; 
In the shade by the stream I would lie awake and dream, 
And in dreaming I would while away the hours. Long, long gone yesterday, 
And the castle and the prince and the God to whom I prayed. 
Well, I made, and I'm gonna lie in this bed of roses. 
I'm tired of trying to be free. 
Gonna lay down like a sigh in my bed of roses. 
Bed of roses I believed my life would be. Well, I wasted years, 
All the useless, bitter tears. 
If I'd known I'd have stopped it at the start. 
I knew life was long, 
And I knew life could go wrong, 
But I never knew my life would break my heart. Dreams die harder than pride. 
I have learned my lesson well. 
I will put them both aside. 
'cause I made and I'm gonna lie in this bed of roses. 
I'm tired and I'm dying to be free. 
Gonna lay down like a sigh in my bed of roses. 
Bed of roses I believed my life would be. Roses die, and all the fairy tales are lies, 
And I guess that's just too bad for poor old me. 
'cause I made, and I'm gonna lie in my bed of roses. 
Bed of roses I believed my life would be. 
Bed of roses I believed my life would be.
