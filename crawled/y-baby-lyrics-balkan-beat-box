She's my baby 
I got how it all should be 
I am home now When I go it's never far 
The Road is long 
I am home now I got my name 
And I got my fame 
But I say again 
I am home now She's not maybe 
She's the one 
The one for me 
I am home now When you know 
There is no more doubt 
If she's around 
I am home now I got my days 
And I got my ways 
But I say again 
I am home now
