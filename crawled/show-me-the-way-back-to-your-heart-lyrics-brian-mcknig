I remember days and nights were never cold 
Had you in my life I had you there to hold 
And I remember love warm as a summer day 
But I lost you 
And I lost my way 
Now I'm in the rain 
Begging you please please 
Baby won't you show me the way back to your heart 
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far 
Lead me back to the road 
That leads back to your arms 
Every night another lonely street 
I walk down alone 
Searching for a light 
Your light to lead me home 
Leave a candle in the window 
And let it shine for me 
Take my hand and take these tears away 
I can't take the pain 
I'm on my knees begging you please 
Chorus 
Take my hand 
Take me in your arms 
I'm out in the dark 
Down on my knees, begging you please 
Chorus
