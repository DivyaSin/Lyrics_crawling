i see a fire in the distance mother 
my love i see those rising flames 
are those the sabbath candles glowing 
no my love, but you will rest the same 
i haven't seen you since the separation 
i watched you pushed along by the crowd 
on the train you swore we'd stick together 
still i look for you even now a million judenkinder, the dulling of the stars 
barefoot across the crystal nacht but we 
can't get thru the bars 
where are you now does heaven pay the price 
can the one who wipes your tears away 
make faith from this ice unbar the door for i must come in 
the kingdom of memory, burrows of the night 
i'm no survivor i was not yet born 
but i'm drawn like a sacred rite 
the past it belongs to you 
frozen forever like that lone tattoo 
silent before you i can be your tears 
but i'm locked outside by six million years your memories our shield, we will not forget 
we will not forget... 
schreibt und forschreibt for us 
we will not forget 
to our hearts we'll clutch each name 
we will not forget
