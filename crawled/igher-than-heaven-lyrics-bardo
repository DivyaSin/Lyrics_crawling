You take me higher 
You take me higher 
You take me higher than I've ever been before 
When I was down (down) 
You always gave me the faith 
You stuck around (round) 
Gave me the strength to move on 
I have no doubt 
I'm gonna hold my head high 
This time around 
I'll keep my feet on the ground With you I'm complete 
Feels so right don't ask me why 
(Feels so right don't ask me why) 
No one can change me 
You're the one that takes me higher (oh yeah) [Chorus] 
Give me love 
Get me up 
Give me all that I need 
You're taking me higher than heaven 
Bring me joy to my life 
With sweet harmony 
You're taking me higher than heaven Now I'm no fool and everyone don't play by the rules 
I've learned to fight for what I want out of life 
Can't fault the way (you helped me day after day) 
Your voice of love takes me higher and higher Without you with me 
There's no way I could survive 
(There's no way I could survive) 
My smile is honest 
'Cause I'm on a spiritual high (oh) [Chorus] Shaking me making me taking me 
Higher and higher than heaven 
Higher than heaven 
Shaking me making me taking me 
Higher and higher than heaven (oh) 
Higher than heaven 
It feels like I'm in paradise [Chorus: x2]
