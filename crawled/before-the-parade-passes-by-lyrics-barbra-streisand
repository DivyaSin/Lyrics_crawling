Before the parade passes by 
I'm gonna go and taste Saturday's high life 
Before the parade passes by 
I'm going to get some life back into my life I'm ready to move out in front 
I've had enough of just passing by life 
With the rest of them 
With the best of them 
I can hold my head up high I've got to go again 
I've got to drive again 
I've got to feel my heart coming alive again 
Before the parade passes by Look at the crowd up ahead 
Listen and heard that brass harmony growing 
Look at the crowd up ahead 
Pardon me if my old spirits showing 
All of those lights over there 
Seems to be telling me where I'm going When the whistles blow 
And the cymbals crash 
And the sparklers light the sky 
I'm going to raise the roof 
I'm going to carry on 
Give me an old trombone 
Give me an old baton 
Before the parade passes by Before the parade passes by 
Listen and hear that brass harmony growing 
Before the parade passes by 
I'm going to get some life back into my life 
I'm ready to move out in front 
I've had enough of just passing by life When the whistles blow 
And the symbols crash 
And the sparklers light the sky 
I'm going to raise the roof 
I'm going to carry on 
Give me an old trombone 
Give me an old baton
