A gift, a gift Strong, that's what they say 
I'm only complacent 
And I will admit to the crime 
Of being too blind, feeling too certain 
That you'll always be on my side I often forget your love is a gift 
A gift, I take it for granted 
I know you don't have to be here 
You don't have to love me 
Yet you do, you still do 
Ah, ah, ah yes, you still do Weak, when on my own 
Confess I'm pathetic 
Befriended by panic and cold 
And then you arrive, my torment relenting 
Again I appear to be strong That's what they say 
I'm only complacent 
And I will admit to the crime 
Of being too blind, feeling too certain 
That you'll always be on my side I often forget your love is a gift 
A gift, I take it for granted 
I know you don't have to be here 
You don't have to love me 
Yet you do, you still do 
Ah, ah, ah yes, you still do I often forget your love is a gift 
A gift, I take it for granted 
I know you don't have to be here 
You don't have to love me 
Yet you do I often forget your love is a gift, a gift 
Trusts and lets me breathe 
Repairs every cut and sting 
I often forget your love is a gift, a gift 
A gift, your love as a gift You don't have to be here 
You don't have to love me 
I know you don't have to love me 
And be here with me You are a gift 
I often forget your love is a gift, a gift 
I take it for granted and 
How can I forget your love is a gift 
And you do
