I am nothing 
I feel nothing 
Over and done 
Watch me come undone 
Numb, a feeling 
Without feeling 
No more pain 
No mercy remains Do you understand? 
Can you really hear me? 
My eyes are blind, they can't see 
What's in store for me 
Here I've been praying 
And God knows I'm still searching 
For what I need, rather than 
What I may desire Stuck in the position you left me in 
Feel the blood freezing within 
Nothing hurts me anymore 
Well, I saw my whole life falling down 
Closing darkness all around 
I guess there's nothing here for me 
Anymore I am nothing 
I feel nothing 
In soul, in mind 
Now I leave it all behind
