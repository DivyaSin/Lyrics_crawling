I don't think I ever wanted to take your time I don't think it ever crossed my mind 
That you would be more to me than just a lover 
'Cause I was doing fine on my own 
Wasn't really lonely, just alone 
But at least I knew where I was and what 
I wanted, but now 
I don't know how you got me, babe So open wide 
And I don't know how to tell you, babe 
The way it feels inside 
I know I have a feeling that you 
You could hold me longer 
We get stronger every day 
And I don't know what you've done to me I'm so turned around I can barely see 
The way that I'm supposed to be 
I'm so wrapped up in what I think you think of me 
I don't know how you got this far How am I supposed to live a life? 
Burdened by the thought of you, my love 
How will I ever be all right? 
La la la 
Every time I look into your eyes I can feel the pressure start to rise 
Pulling me into you and what you'll show me 
Well, I believe that love can conquer all 
But is it really love that makes you fall 
Or just the fantasy of understanding? 
I don't know how you're gonna save the rest of my heart I don't know how I'd stop you, baby, or how I'd even start 
I know I have a feeling that you 
Are something to discover 
The lover that you are 
And I don't know how you got through I'm not the kind of girl you're supposed to get to 
I've been hurt before; I don't want it anymore 
I'm safer in my solitude 
I don't know how you got this far How am I supposed to live a life 
Burdened by the thought of you, my love? 
How will I ever be all right? 
La la la 
I don't know how you got through But, just like a child, I run to you 
And I don't know what else to say 
Nobody soothes me the way that you do
