waking up and it seems like forever 
I thought we were in this together 
so lie to me again 
and say the words that I need to hear 
to keep your own conscience clear you never give me anything to go on 
so please let go of this string that I'm on 
cause my face is numb from hitting the ground 
this dirt is so hard to breathe 
is that all you think of me I swear I'd kick in your chest if I could 
climb through it 
into your heart 
where I know I should be forever 
but you don't seem to care so I'll stick this gun up to my face 
and make a bet on my life 
that's how little faith I have in you and me 
another day spinning down the drain 
and you left the taste of your indifference 
once again it says this flesh is a waste 
burn it to the ground
