and i'm sinking in emancipation 
but i know that it shows that i'm atching you 
turning on 
turning on 
and i'm feeling the liberation 
till the dawn, till the dawn, and i'm inside you 
turning on 
turning on take you down till you get there 
mistaken journey we're on 
come on my lover and bite me 
keep me high until dawn and i'm racing toward exploitation 
holding on, holding on till we see we're now 
turning on 
turning on 
and i'm getting so saturated 
and i long, and i long to be tasting you 
turning on 
turning on and i hope that we play now 
in your immaculate lair 
do a dare if you fear me 
and you're craving the dare 
do you like to be hunted 
by a snake in the grass 
and now you're spinning around 
you'll be delivered at last your turn on 
your turn on 
your turn on 
you're turning on 
you're turning on 
you're turning on 
turning on turn on 
turn on 
turn on 
you turn on 
you turn on, yeah
