If I, if I never show ya everything 
Everything you need to see 
And if I, and if I never told ya 
Just what you mean to me And if you have, and if you have a question 
After all that we've been through 
That you're the air that I breathe 
Every song that I sing, the reason for all I do Remember what I'm telling you now 
Baby, it's you, it's you, oh, yeah You are all I ever wanted 
I knew right from the start 
You're all I've ever needed 
You came and opened up my heart And how'd you managed to do 
The very thing so many others could not do 
I have sunshine on a cloudy day 
And it's all because of you, oh If I never show ya everything 
Everything you need to see 
And if I, and if I never told ya 
Just what you mean to me And if, and if, and if you have a question 
No question, no question 
After all that we've been through, oh You're the air that I breathe 
You're every song that I sing 
The reason for all I do You are my only, I never leave you lonely 
There are so many words that I'd like to say 
But they just might get in the way 
So I gotta show you so that you can remember Remember, remember 
When I'm wiping happy tears from your eyes 
I know you'll remember, remember 
Happy mornings turn to happy days and happy nights I know you'll remember, remember 
For those times that I might not be there 
I know you'll remember, remember 
When our children say I love you, mum and dad, it's true Yesterday, today, forever, I know, baby, it's you, ooh 
It's you, ooh, oh, it's you
