Thus all fairy stories end only an actress would pretend 
Affairs of state are her latest play, eight shows a week, two matinees 
My how the worm begins to turn, when will the chorus girl ever learn? 
My how the worm begins to turn, when will the chorus girl ever learn? The chorus girl hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear 
She won't go scrambling over the backs of the poor to be accepted 
By making donations just large enough to the correct charity 
She won't be president of your wonderful societies of philanthropy 
Even if you asked her to be as you should have asked her to be The actress hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear 
She won't join your clubs, she won't dance in your halls 
She won't help the hungry once a month at your tombolas 
She'll simply take control as you disappear Forgive my intrusion but fine as those sentiments sound 
Little has changed for us peasants down here on the ground 
I hate to sound childish, ungrateful, I don't like to moan 
But do you now represent anyone's cause but your own? 
Everything done will be justified by my foundation
