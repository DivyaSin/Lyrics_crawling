you don't know 
but i'm after you 
you watch me as 
i come for you 
right now i feel 
so vindictive ties that bind 
won't disguise 
things that we can't change 
if i decide to redefine myself 
my head won't hang low 
for anyone, feeling better off 
than the way i feel so vindictive 
so vindictive you can't see 
but i'm watching you 
i think of things 
i'm gonna do to you 
right now i feel 
so vindictive so vindictive 
so vindictive ties that bind 
won't disguise 
things that we can't change 
if i decide to redefine myself 
my head won't hang low 
for anyone, feeling better off 
than the way i feel i'm feeling so down 
down 
i'm feeling so down 
down 
you're dragging me down 
down 
you're dragging me down 
down 
i'm bringing you down 
you know i will bring you down ties that bind 
won't disguise 
things that we can't change 
if i decide to realign myself 
from all that i know 
or anyone, feeling better off 
than the way i feel 
you're after me 
i'm after you 
ideal simplicity for 
implementing a change 
if i decide to redefine myself 
my head won't hang low 
for anyone, feeling better off 
than the way i feel
