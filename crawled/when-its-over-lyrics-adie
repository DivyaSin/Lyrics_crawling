It's finally calming down 
I've found the motion of life that spins around 
Grows dim as I enter in 
A trail of tears sing Your embrace 
The scars of death and life we face 
But I know, I'll be with You soon And when it's over, when it's over 
I'll finally fall down at Your feet 
And feel Your open arms take hold of me 
And when it's over, when it's over 
I'll finally touch Your wounded hands 
And see the beauty of what You have planned Revealing grace's final call 
I can't comprehend at all 
My hope will be completed 
Seeing You with eyes unveiled 
Knowing without You I'd have failed 
I'll wait, come soon, I'm waiting And when it's over, when it's over 
I'll finally fall down at Your feet 
And feel Your open arms take hold of me 
And when it's over, when it's over 
I'll finally touch Your wounded hands 
And see the beauty of what You have planned My anticipation turns into desperation 
When I think of when I will be with You, my Jesus When it's over and when it's over 
I'll finally fall down at Your feet 
And feel Your open arms take hold of me 
And when it's over, when it's over 
I'll finally touch Your wounded hands 
And see the beauty of what You have planned And when it's over, when it's over 
I'll finally fall down at Your feet 
And feel Your open arms take hold of me
