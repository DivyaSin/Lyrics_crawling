have you ever had a ride in a light blue car? 
have you ever stopped to think 
who's the slave and who's the master? 
have you ever had trouble with your 
automobile? 
have you ever had to 
push push push push? cartrouble 
you might have seen them very busy at the 
weekends licking and polishing the beep- 
beeps into 
shape and then its proudly up the M.1. M.2. 
M.3. 
and keep your feet off the upholstery Ronnie 
cartrouble oh yeah 
and remember this:- 
you don't need anything after an icecream 
I used to sit at home silently and wonder 
why all the preference is polishing the 
chrome 
while all the mothers and the sisters and the 
babies 
sit and rot at home 
cartrouble oh yeah 
and remember this 
you don't need anything after an icecream
