Thou shalt never love another 
And stand by me all the while 
Take happiness with the heartache 
And go through love wearing a smile 
Oh, how happy we will be 
If we keep the Ten Commandments Of Love 
Oh love Thou shalt always have faith in me 
In everything I say and do 
Love with all your heart and soul 
Until our life on earth is through 
Oh how happy we will be 
If we keep the Ten Commandments Of Love Love, oh sweet love 
It's oh, oh so grand 
You will find since the beginning of time 
It has proved throughout all the land So come to me when I am lonely 
Kiss me when you hold me tight 
Treat me sweet and gentle 
When we say good night 
Oh, how happy we will be 
If we keep the Ten Commandments Of Love 
Oh, love 
Oh, how happy we will be 
If we keep the Ten Commandments Of Love 
The Ten Commandments Of Love
