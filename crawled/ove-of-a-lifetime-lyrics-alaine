[Intro:] 
When I close my eyes (close my eyes) 
I see you, 
Running through my mind I feel you, (my mind) 
I breathe you 
Oh, how I need you [Chorus:] 
Finally we found the love of a lifetime 
And I can see my whole future in your eyes 
I don't believe when they say love is blind 
I can see clearly baby, you and me, 
We found the love of a lifetime [Verse 1:] 
Forever is not enough time to spend with you 
I wanna love you longer 
Cause baby with every single thing you do 
I wanna love you stronger 
Searching for love all my life 
Now that I found you 
I realize, 
Baby with you I'm alive 
So alive [Chorus:] 
Finally we found the love of a lifetime 
And I can see my whole future in your eyes 
I don't believe when they say love is blind 
I can see clearly baby, you and me, 
We found the love of a lifetime [Verse 2:] 
And it's incredible how you know me each and every way 
So unforgetable that the we feel it can never change 
All that I need and adore 
All I been asking, all I been longing for 
This is it, I'm sure 
I'm so sure [[Chorus:] 
Finally we found the love of a lifetime 
And I can see my whole future in your eyes 
I don't believe when they say love is blind 
I can see clearly baby, you and me, 
We found the love of a lifetime [Verse 3:] 
A lifetime of me holding you so close I breathe you in 
My fantasy turn real and I'll be loving you until 
Forever's gone away and starts over again 
Our love will remain [Chorus:] 
Finally we found the love of a lifetime 
And I can see my whole future in your eyes 
I don't believe when they say love is blind 
I can see clearly baby, you and me, 
We found the love of a lifetime [Verse 1:] 
Forever is not enough time to spend with you 
I wanna love you longer 
Cause baby with every single thing you do 
I wanna love you stronger 
Searching for love all my life 
Now that I found you 
I realize, baby with you I'm alive 
So alive [Chorus:] 
Finally we found the love of a lifetime 
And I can see my whole future in your eyes 
I don't believe when they say love is blind 
I can see clearly baby, you and me, 
We found the love of alifetime
