There's a letter in a shoe box 
In a dresser she keeps locked 
But she's never read it all the way through 
It was the last one he wrote her 
She was sure it was over 
From all that he told her in the first line or two He said times are hard now 
Got some things left to sort out 
And a man in his freedom don't easily part 
That's where she stopped reading 
Her soul was bleeding 
So she choose her weapon and went for his heart With paper and pen she got her last words in 
I never loved you was the lie she wrote him 
He couldn't believe the reply he received 
What a sad tragedy for good love to end 
Who needs a knife when you can take someone's life 
With paper and pen Well, they say he went crazy 
In just a few days he 
He got on the bottle and went out of his mind 
To this day she don't know 
In the letter that he wrote 
He asked for her hand in the very last line With paper and pen she got her last words in 
I never loved you was the lie she wrote him 
He couldn't believe the reply he received 
What a sad tragedy for good love to end 
Who needs a knife when you can take someone's life 
With paper and pen Oh, who needs a knife when you can take someone's life 
With paper and pen
