Someday someone somewhere somehow 
Is going to make you understand 
These words will drill into your head 
You undergo the process then 
You will do anything they say 
They will have power over you 
You will not question their authority 
You know what they can do [Chorus] 
I shake my head I don't know what to say 
I see my chance to turn and walk away 
I will not be a part of this romance 
I just can't take that chance 
Because I see my opportunity to shout 
The last goodbye I bet you never did expect 
To have a big important name 
They all will have exquisite taste 
But everyone will look the same 
You will be quickly photographed 
You will be shot from every side 
They'll teach you what you need to learn 
Then they will take you for a ride [Chorus]
