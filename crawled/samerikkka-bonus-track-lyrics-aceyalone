All right 
Yo, this song came about one time when 
I- I was- I was on a plane back, going back to Los Angeles 
Coming from somewhere else 
And I sat next to this lady and she was telling me something 
I don't remember it verbatim, 
But I do remember some of the things she said 
It was like this Life as we know it is about to change 
I smell it within the air 
The weather is getting strange 
Drugged up, sedated and 
Numb from the pain 
The sickness in America has spread to her brain 
She is no longer fit to make good decisions 
She is completely blind and void of any vision 
She parties hard and she keeps her conscious mind imprisoned 
Therefore she's headed for the ultimate collision 
She can no longer hide the scars on her face 
The innocence now gone is hard to replace 
She has no shame, no remorse or any grace 
She embraces the devil and she hates over race 
Ms. America, the beautiful the free 
Fallen within the cracks, I wish that you could see 
She buried her misery, within society 
It's obvious, you have no regard for me Caught up in the belly of America 
Lost, in the stomach of America 
Broken down, in the bowels of America 
Sinking, in the garbage of America 
Stuffed, in the brain of America 
Suffering, in the body of America 
Lying, in the wicked spirit of America 
Dying, in the old soul of America Ms. America, you've been a very bad girl 
You nearly disgraced humanity in the eyes of the world 
Vanity has took you over, you're not deserving 
The mirror image of your reflection is quite disturbing 
She makes so many promises she couldn't keep 
She neglected to mother her young, so they don't sleep 
They scream out for justice, and then they weep 
When out to blame Ms. America, that's what you reap 
The audacity of your inventions to rule us all 
The tragedy of your intentions to fool us all 
You should have gave into nature and to the law 
It's only a matter of time before you fall 
The things you should of worked out in your first colony 
Victim of your own advice and your psychology 
You've destroyed all morale and the ecology 
I'm sorry, but I don't accept your apology Caught up in the belly of America 
Lost, in the stomach of America 
Broken down, in the bowels of America 
Sinking, in the garbage of America 
Stuffed, in the brain of America 
Suffering, in the body of America 
Lying, in the wicked spirit of America 
Dying, in the old soul of America Homeless America, so much attraction 
Has yet to take ability for her actions 
We work around within the system and make adaptations 
You can let freedom ring, within your faction 
How can people still be hungry, when there's a surplus? 
Suffering within your home, you've made them worthless 
Damn near police the state, you make us nervous 
Even though some conform and join your service 
You're presidency's the biggest joke, but we're the laugh 
Always smell the gun smoke, on your behalf 
I think I should send a telegraph to your staff 
America you're down and dirty, you need a bath 
So tell your secret agents, don't be paranoid 
This wasn't taught by Socrates or Sigmund Freud 
This is simply gods work, you can't avoid 
Ever nation ever built has been destroyed Caught up in the belly of America 
Lost, in the stomach of America 
Broken down, in the bowels of America 
Sinking, in the garbage of America 
Stuffed, in the brain of America 
Suffering, in the body of America 
Trying, in the good ol' spirit of America 
Dying, in the old soul of America
