Good times are worth more than money any day 
That's what I always say 
Good friends are worth more than money in the bank 
That's what I always say 
That's what I always say 
Got a letter, made me lose heart 
Gonna have to make a new start 
I know whatever happens now 
Don't worry, friends'll chip in 
What's owed will be forgiven 
I know whatever happens now 
Worry about tomorrow 
Ain't gonna change a thing Today You are to me 
Last Friday night down at the road house 
Booth in the back, they sat alone 
Holding hands like two young lovers 
Her hair was grey, his hair was gone She said to him 
"I'm getting older 
A pretty girl, no more to be 
Heaven knows 
I'm not a treasure" 
He softly said "You are to me" "You are to me a girl in spring time 
The one I met so long ago 
A moment captured for a lifetime 
That's what I see you are to me" He said to her "My work is done now 
And all that's left are memories 
Heaven knows, I'm not important" 
She softly said "You are to me" "You are to me a boy in spring time 
The one I met so long ago 
A moment captured for a lifetime 
That's what I see you are to me 
Last Friday night down at the road house
