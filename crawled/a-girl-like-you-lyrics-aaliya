[Chorus: x2] 
I'm looking for a girl like you (well here I go) 
I hope, I hope to me you won't lie to (well tell me more) 
I'm looking for a guy like you(yeah you know me) 
(i hope) I hope you feel it in your needs. When I first saw you (first saw you). 
That's when I knew, I really knew, I wanted to get close to you. 
I'm watching, clocking you. 
I just spend my days, wondering when I will see your face, 
Boy I just want to see your face, and hear you say [Chorus: x2] It would not be too hard, 
If you want my heart, just say you love me (i'm lovin every inch) 
No one in the world could tell us apart, 
I'll be your lady(well can I have a pinch?) 
So what you say?(what do I say?) 
Baby tell me what's your name(treach you want to play?) 
It'll be ok [Chorus: x2] [Treach] 
Oh baby I could touch ya, 
You kiss me right 
Be your lover, undercover, get a woman wit [Aaliyah] 
I want to get to know, a little more about you. 
And then you smile (and then what follows?) 
Our love is pouring down (like there ain't no tomorrow) 
Baby can we talk (my heart ain't hollow) about us? 
And then you smile (and then what follows?) 
Our love is pouring down (like there ain't no tomorrow) 
Baby can we talk (my heart ain't hollow) about us? [Chorus: x2]
