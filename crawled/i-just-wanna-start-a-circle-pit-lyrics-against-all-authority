Circle pit, circle pit, circle pit [x3] 
It's building up inside (It's building up inside) I tried so hard its tearing me apart. 
the pressure's building up inside me everyday. 
And I can see it welling up in you. You feel it too. 
We're both afraid to say it. 
No matter how hard you try it just feels like you do not fit, 
in this world that wants you to submit. 
It tries to break you down. (break you down) 
There's something that I found buried deep within 
this sound that seems to make it go away. 
It's something they can't see and just between 
me and you it scares them when we don't obey. 
So we move in unison. To the sound that sets us free from you (from you). 
They're scared of what you'll turn into. 
Once you step inside this circle of friends they're through. I just wanna start a circle pit. 
Right here right now I'm sick of it. [x3]
