Don't call me daddy, only she can do that 
Ok, me and yo mama be fuckin, boy you ain't about that 
You seen her lookin all mad, ain't time for ya nap? 
You wake up, I'm back, eating up all your snacks 
Don't ask for help with your math (stupid) 
Ain't my fault, you can't add 
Don't be out here fake cryin, lyin 
Up in the keyhole straight spying 
Only knock the door if you're dyin 
I wish I could stay here forever (I love it)

I'm even cheating on my whip, I got a side Benz 
But she made me wanna cut off all my side friends (I love you, baby) 
A nigga be tryna taste her, take her 
They rape her, stand out the daycare sit there and wait there 
Fuck, I can't even trust the neighbors, damn (what you lookin' at?)

Eat all this ass, quit tastin' it I got yo mama all in my line 
Bullets all in my 9 
Rollie tell the time 
She ain't yours, she ain't mine 
Throw a hundred every time 
I think my coupe just lost its mind 
Put yo mama on that trippy shit, sippin' lean, snorting lines 
Overseas like bonjour 
Last ten years I've been on tour 
And I still got that old money 
I touch more green than a lawnmower 
With a ratchet bitch, you laid up 
I'm on my tour bus fucking mamas getting paid up 
I take that bitch to my mansion 
And a nigga can't pay her to leave 
Yo mama a great head doctor, with no PhD 
My pockets stuffed with that dough 
I made it all in the streets 
I might just go to the club, and throw it all on a freak 
Yo mama
