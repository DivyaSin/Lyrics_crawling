My knowledge and logic 
fills my mind with fear 
thoughtless exploitation 
the deadline draws near... I behold the desolation 
before my eyes 
evolution's denaturalization 
the black rain falling from the skies 
my mind's visions 
our verdict of posterity 
the presage of evil 
obscured thoughts of what shall be Extinction... We lwave this place 
to pass it on 
in years to come 
will all be done? The home of life 
we consume 
man's ignorance 
will seal his doom... Darkness engraved my mind 
thoughts pass through my head 
visions of ravaged landscapes 
where the living are outnumbered by the dead 
a place ridden with diseases 
where forest rivers glow 
anial moribund species 
still the seeds of death we sow In years to come My reflections are odious 
when thinking about the daily regression 
we're approaching our termins 
as we proceed with our contamination 
we defile our soul 
with the knowledge of what awaits 
this mortal coil 
is all too late?
