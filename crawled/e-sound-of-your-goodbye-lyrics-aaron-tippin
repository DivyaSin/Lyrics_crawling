Girl, Ive got scars and Ive seen stars 
From men nearly twice my size 
Yeah, lifes sticks and stones have broke a few bones 
But Ive always survived So when I take a look at all Ive took 
It dont seem right to me 
How a little bitty woman with just a few words 
Come bring me to my knees Sticks and stones, wouldnt hurt a bit 
Compared to the cold, cruel words that just left your lips Id rather you pick up a rock, a stick full of thorns 
Rear back and let em fly 
Cause those sticks wouldnt cut, stones hurt as much 
As the sound of your goodbye Yeah, I know Im the reason for youre leavin 
Im to blame sure enough 
Its like you say there aint a woman made 
That can live without true love So if its too late to set things straight 
And theres no forgivin me 
Then dont say nothin, just pick you up somethin 
Thatll end this misery Sticks and stones wouldnt hurt a bit 
Compared to the cold, cruel words that just left your lips Id rather you pick up a rock, a stick full of thorns 
Rear back and let em fly 
Cause those sticks wouldnt cut, stones hurt as much 
As the sound of your goodbye
