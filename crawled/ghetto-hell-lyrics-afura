Cradled in the womb of the metropolis, dodging hell swarm 
Vision of going to heaven, nothing can stop this 
Although I'm optimistic, balance it with being realistic 
Is paradise is part of the plan or scribbled in some book and shit It all goes down as rain drops on my neighborhood 
Love my hood and motherfucker this ain't good 
Crack heads selling dope to dope heads 
On blocks that's rented by house niggaz That's all getting rich off of the bloodshed 
And as I experience, none the lesser 
And it's high and it's high as I got off of the reefers 
The balance levels of horror, yo, ain't never disappear I know, you know 
It's like we livin' in hell in the ghetto 
I know, you know 
Babies is dying in the ghetto I know, you know 
Mothers are crying in the ghetto 
I know, you know 
It's like we livin' in hell in the ghetto 
I know, you know 
Like that, like that, like that I put the pedal to the metal, heavy metal in the ghetto 
I ain't got to raise it, cause hell is the grimy ghetto 
I guess that's the catalyst for so many fantasies 
We can fantasize and happen to be surrounded by misery The daughters and sisters, the little bitties 
Princess inside ya beautiful 
But mommy can't afford the sparkles and dresses 
As a matter of fact, kids around here 
Need to be walking with a vest on 'Cause the quietest streets around here, can be a war zone 
And I'm in such disgust, 'cause the police 
Instead of protectin' and serving, they serving us They brutalizin' and battering, as a matter of fact 
They play ghetto, officers, I see them laughing 
Trynna pick up girls in uniform 
Hanging out them college dorms, we need some inform 
Why is he a ghetto? 'Cause society divided by nothing but money, hello I know, you know 
It's like we livin' in hell in the ghetto 
I know, you know 
Babies is dying in the ghetto I know, you know 
Mothers are crying in the ghetto 
I know, you know 
It's like we livin' in hell in the ghetto 
I know, you know 
Like that, like that, like that From city to city, all over the globe 
So many poverty stricken lives, the facts'll make ya heads explode 
Cities and families, all over, global overload 
From Brownsville to Russia, through Somalia, through Croatia Lyrics are live, fight to survive, it's a horror ride 
Demons coming for your hide but there's no where to run 
Straight up, and there's no where to hide 
Guess what, 'cause negative situation is winning by a landslide 
And if you living this life, there's the worst schools 
And the worst doctors, guess what? Society got ya I know, you know 
It's like we livin' in hell in the ghetto 
I know, you know 
Babies is dying in the ghetto I know, you know 
Mothers are crying in the ghetto 
I know, you know 
It's like we livin' in hell in the ghetto 
I know, you know
