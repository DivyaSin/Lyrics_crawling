Single Mothers (are the Heroes of the Modern World) This is a message to the children 
Of the Vanishing Man 
Its time to live your life as free of all the hate you can Somebody left you. But they left you in the loving arms 
Of somebody you probably dont appreciate at all Single Mothers (are the Heroes of the Modern World) Shes not a model or an actress or a big athlete 
Shes winning races none of them could even quite compete it might get tough at times 
Wonderin how and why 
Scrapin up the pennies til payday Single Mothers (are the Heroes of the Modern World) There is no big reward, academy awards
