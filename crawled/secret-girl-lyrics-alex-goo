I barely even know your name 
But i want you 
I want it bad, want it bad 
I've got a crazy mind 
I cant fight it 
I get that all the time, all the time So here goes my open letter to you 
Cause I've been watching you from across the country 
If I could be your star-crossed 
More than friend 
Yeah I would be so good to you, good to you And here goes my voice 
I'll sing it out 
I wanna get so lost with you 
In the here and now 
And there's nothing else 
I want to say 
Cause I'm losing my mind for you 
So won't you be my secret girl 
(oh-oh-ooh) 
You could be my secret girl 
(oh-oh-ooh) 
yeah you could be my secret girl And if you look to the sky tonight 
You will see 
I'm sending you a song 
Hope I'm singing it right 
(You are) 
You could even be my my heartbreak 
I don't mind 
Don't wanna keep you far 
Been so far all my life I've been watching ya, watching ya, girl 
You're so pretty when you smile at the world 
You leave me weak in the knees 
Never fell this far 
For somebody I've never met before 
With you I can tell And here goes my voice 
I'll sing it out 
I wanna get so lost with you 
In the here and now 
And there's nothing else 
I want to say 
Cause I'm losing my mind for you 
So wont you be my secret girl 
(oh-oh-ooh) 
You could be my secret girl 
(oh-oh-ooh) 
Yeah you could be my secret girl 
(oh-oh-ooh) 
You could be my secret girl 
And well live in a secret world 
In a secret world I wanna be there, where you are 
If I could only get that far, with you 
(oh-oh-ooh) (oooh) (oh-oh-ooh) (oooh) And here goes my voice 
I'm singing to you 
I know that I have finally found 
What I've gotta do 
And there's nothing else 
That I can say 
Cause I'm losing my mind for you 
So won't you be my secret 
Cause I want it bad 
I want it bad 
You could be my secret girl 
(oh-oh-ooh)
