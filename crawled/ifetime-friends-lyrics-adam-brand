Left my home long ago 
To travel up the Tanami Road 
So many young fellas were like me 
Head full of ideas and pretty keen 
I didn't think that anyone would remember me for very long Lifetime friends are with you 'till the end 
They're the ones that know you the best 
You laugh about how you were so young and proud 
You do that when you've made a lifetime friend Somehow through the years 
Some people that you meet stay near 
And even if you're far away 
They ring you up just to say 
Well how are you goin' 
When you comin' back this way I got a call from you this afternoon 
It's been years since I spoke to you 
We might of had our blues in the past 
But somehow our friendship seems to last 
We pick up the conversation 
Like we just left it yesterday 
Pretty good hey Neither was my head 
It must be intervention or it must be divine 
Could be kindness week 
Or it could be the wine Now I pray that you will say yes tonight 
'Cause I'm gonna ask if you will be mine
