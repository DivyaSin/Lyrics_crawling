A creature made of sunshine 
her eyes were like the sky 
rabbit howls like something old 
as we twitch to a lullaby 
the scalpel shines in god's sunshine 
the streetlights whisper pain 
down here near the poison stream 
our god has gone insane she smiles like a child with flowers in her hair 
with blood on her hands 
into the sun she stares 
she feels it die 
I heard her cry she smiles like a child with flowers in her hair 
with blood on her hands 
into the sun she stares 
she feels it die 
I heard her cry... 
like the scream of the butterfly sunshine in the house of flames 
she loves it where she gets it 
but it's never felt the same 
surgery, in the house of dissection 
when your candle burns out..I Will resurrect you 
she runs 
through fields of daisies 
yeah, it's just a shame that they eat their own babies 
who cares cause the air is free 
when you get there will you kiss the dead for me? There's blood on the moon and the summer is cold 
There's blood in the room but that's gettin' old 
There's blood on my face sittin' on a dead shore 
A highway of emptiness and I'm gettin' bored there's blood on the moon as we plan our escape 
the goddess in bloom 
handcuffed and raped 
there's blood in the bathtub baby 
murdered the king 
there's blood on the moon 
there's blood on just about everything sunshine in the house of flames 
she loves it where she gets it 
but it's never felt the same 
surgery, in the house of dissection 
when your candle burns out..I will resurrect you 
she runs 
through fields of daisies 
yeah, it's just a shame that they eat their own babies 
who cares cos the air is free 
when you get there will you kiss the dead for me? Something cold is forced inside her a tear spills down her cheek 
Stillborn songs of a dead dreamer, hymns of the needle freak 
With sunlight in her hair she smiles like she don't care her dreams are 
liquid blue I cut myself again and again to remind myself of you she smiles like a child with flowers in her hair 
with blood on her hands 
into the sun she stares 
she feels it die 
I heard her cry she smiles like a child with flowers in her hair 
with blood on her hands 
into the sun she stares 
she feels it die 
I heard her cry like the scream of the butterfly 
like the scream of the butterfly Yea Yea Yeaaaaaa!!! like the scream of the butterfly 
like the scream of the butterfly Yeaaaaaa!!! like the scream of the butterfly 
like the scream of the butterfly Yeaaaaaa!!!
