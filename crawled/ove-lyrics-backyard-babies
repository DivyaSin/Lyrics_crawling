Days go by with cigarettes 
And someone put a coin in a wishing well 
Lookin at you makes me weak inside 
I can't stand seeing you with somebody else Someday when I'm in love 
Heaven can wait for me All I can see is your pretty face 
You lookin like a cover of a magazine 
Why am I slave under the female sex 
I don't want to waste my time again Someday I'm in love 
When I've been drinkin a lot of wine 
I'm in love 
Feels like heaven can wait for me It can wait for me 
And you know why And I've tried everything to cure my soul 
Going down in hell with a bottle of you 
Nothing can change the way I feel for her 
The devil in the glass is telling me what to do Someday I'm in love 
When I've been drinkin a lot of wine 
I'm in love 
Feels like heaven can wait for me It can wait 
Sticks and stones can't break my bones 
But you can always hurt me inside Come on and love me inside 
But I'm still waitin Days go by with cigarettes 
And someone put a coin in a wishing well 
Why am I slave under the female sex 
I don't want to waste my time again Maybe someday when I'm in love 
Heaven can wait for me I'm in love 
When I've been drinkin a lot of wine 
I'm in love 
Feels like heaven can wait for me I'm in love 
Everything to kill my soul 
I'm in love 
But I don't want to waste my time Days go by with cigarettes 
And someone put a coin in a wishing well
