For now the kids are secular 
But every road leads to a church 
They grow them here 
The virtuous 
Mutinous by any means Rebellious, reformed then upright 
It's cold in Adelaide tonight 
These streets are bright 
Hotel bound in the small bus 
My first whiskey in two years plus 
It can't mask the weird vibe 
This Sunday night 
Passing red cars head to light Hey mom, hey dad 
Hey mom, I'm rad 
I'm coming clean and it's a mess In cheap hotels they find their dreams 
They caffeinate amphetamines 
In naive green 
Designer blue 
In small black prints he's minor news
