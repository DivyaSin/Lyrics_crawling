All the women in the factory 
When their faces blow a fuse it's a miracle 
I have to feed them facts to be alone 
Magnifico! Oh, fellas and umbrellas in the middle of the night 
What you gonna do when the menanites bite? 
Lock lips in the teddy boys cheverolet 
Dutch tips and you're punked in the alleyway Novotel, the phone's tapped anyway 
Novotel, I need something of my own 
No dice, I feed them facts to be alone and alone and alone, yeah Smoke crack like guys at (?) 
Faux black delayed reaction of 
Sure enough she's snuggling up to me 
I've got to feed them facts She never listened when I tell her that I wanna go 
She should have come when I invited you to see my show

I've got to break for the holiday Down in the factory 
I've got to bring them back to me

I have to feed them facts to be alone

I've got to feed them facts to be alone and alone and alone, yeah
