when you smile 
I smile with you 
when you cry 
i feel it too 
hear my soul 
my heart callin'out you be my eyes when i can't see 
be my voice when i can't speak 
be my light when darkness creeps on me oh.. sajna sajna sajna re 
i just sajna sajna sajna re 
sajna sajna sajna re 
i just sajna sajna sajna re to the stars that shines so bright 
across the sky 
across the night 
making ways to be right by your side oh.. sajna sajna sajna re 
i just sajna sajna sajna re 
sajna sajna sajna re 
i just sajna sajna sajna re save me 
when my dream catches fire 
save me 
be my only desire 
wake me 
when the pain is over 
take me now 
take me now 
take me now when you smile 
i smile with you 
when you cry 
i feel it too 
hear my sool 
my heart callin'out to you hold me close 
don't let me go 
hold me tight 
don't you say no 
save the love we have for evermore be my eyes when i can't see 
be my voice when i can't speak 
be my light when darkness creeps on me to the stars that shines so bright 
across the sky 
across the night 
making ways to be right by your side
