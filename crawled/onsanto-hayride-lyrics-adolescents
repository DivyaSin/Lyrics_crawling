Magic kingdom, right at Main 
Shattered link, food chain 
Tomorrowland in a plastic can 
Monsanto: your house of the future In a working class Alabama town 
Childhood leukemia found 
Mercury poisons the stream 
Monsanto 
Amber waves of greed 
Poison the well 
In greed we trust 
Against the grain Minnesota genocide 
Birth defects, pesticide 
Roundup spray, village green 
Monsanto Big business muscles flex 
Blind eyed FDA inspects 
Par for the course no one suspects 
Monsanto: your house of the future You'll seed your fields 
How we tell you to 
You'll feed your cows 
What we sell to you 
Inject growth hormone 
Into the seed you sow 
You'll eat and feed and seed 
But never know 
How far the tentacles reach 
From the greed that feeds inside 
How far the invasion sweeps 
Monsanto 
Grab your girl and climb aboard 
Monsanto hayride 
Plant the seed, breed the greed Plant the seed Monsanto brings Magic kingdom, right at Main 
Shattered link, food chain 
Tomorrowland in a plastic can 
Monsanto Close your eyes, ignore the lies 
Bastard's creed no one denies 
Systemic failure demands supply 
Monsanto: your house of the future You'll seal your fate 
How we want you to 
You'll feed your children 
Our frankenfood 
The future's now 
Reap what we sow 
Mutate the future 
And we'll watch you grow
