Lately I've got this funny feeling 
Something don't feel the same 
But he's telling me I'm the one to blame 
Yes, I know he still gives me good loving 
But when he is deep inside 
There's somebody else in his eyes Don't waste your time 
But it gets so hard to know 
Just Walk away 
You say that I gotta let go 
Seen it a million times before 
You shouldn't take his shh no more Can't waste my time 
It's not hard to know 
I should walk away 
Girl, you gotta let him go 
Seen it a million times before 
I shouldn't take his shh no more Girl, it goes much deeper than what you're thinking 
When something don't feel the same 
You better believe his love has changed 
From what you're telling me, any fool can see 
He's got a love on the side 
Stop making truth out of his lies Don't waste your time 
But it gets so hard to know 
Just walk away 
You say that I gotta let go 
Seen it a million times before 
You shouldn't take his shh no more Can't waste my time 
It's not hard to know 
I should walk away 
Girl, you gotta let him go 
Seen it a million times before 
I shouldn't take his shh no more What's the point of love if you've got no trust 
What's the point of stayin' when you've seen enough 
Why should you keep giving what he don't deserve 
This is a lesson I'm not sure I want to learn Can't waste my time 
It's not hard to know 
I should walk away 
Girl, you gotta let him go 
Seen it a million times before 
I shouldn't take his shh no more
