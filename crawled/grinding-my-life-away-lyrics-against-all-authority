Flesh peelin' 
Soul stealin' 
It's taking everything I've got 
Not to crack right through your skull 
Have my fill 
Leave you to rot 
As we roll through the night 
Casting shadows 
Taking bites 
Out of a city that's dead as us. We feed tonight 
(we feed tonight) 
We feed tonight 
(we feed tonight) 
We feed tonight 
We feed tonight 
I hold you down and I take a bite 
Don't try to fight it 
It's an urge i must obey 
(grinding my life away) 
Grinding my life away 
(grinding my life away) 
Grinding my life away 
(grinding my life away) 
Grinding my life away 
(grinding my life away) Blood streaming 
Wheels screaming 
Trucks bark like the hounds of hell 
And i can smell your fear 
As we smear whats in you 
On these city walls 
I watch you crawl 
I hear you draw your last breath 
I taste the pus 
In the city that is dead as us 
It's as dead as us We feed tonight 
(we feed tonight) 
We feed tonight 
(we feed tonight) 
We feed tonight 
We feed tonight 
I hold you down and I take a bite 
Don't try to fight it 
It's an urge I must obey 
(grinding my life away) 
Grinding my life away 
(grinding my life away) 
Grinding my life away 
(grinding my life away) 
Grinding my life away 
(grinding my life away) We disturb 
Destroying curbs 
These boneless ones will never stray 
We feast upon the fallen 
And we feel ourselves decay 
As we roll through the night 
Casting shadows taking bites 
Out of a city that is dead as us We feed tonight 
(we feed tonight) 
We feed tonight 
(we feed tonight) 
We feed tonight 
We feed tonight 
I hold you down and I take a bite 
Don't try to fight it 
It's an urge I must obey 
(grinding my life away) 
Grinding my life away 
(grinding my life away) 
Grinding my life away 
(grinding my life away) 
Grinding my life away 
(grinding my life away)
