Once again I said my goodbyes to those I love most 
My heart feels that familiar pain as I long for home 
'Cause this road is hard when I feel so far God I'm crying out tonight 
'Cause I've given You my life 
But I'm tired and I'm missing what's behind 
So once more here's my life On the day that You called my name, all that I knew changed 
I found when I said yes, that I'd never be the same 
Though the call is hard, You are worth it all God I'm crying out tonight 
'Cause I've given You my life 
But I'm tired and I'm missing what's behind 
So once more Even when the tears are falling 
When I find I fear the calling 
You remind me words you've spoken over my life 
Promises I've yet to see, You comfort me God I'm crying out tonight 
'Cause I've given You my life 
But I'm tired and I'm missing what's behind 
So once more God I'm crying out tonight 
'Cause I've given You my life 
But I'm tired and I'm missing what's behind 
So once more here's my life, here's my life
