I like to remember you the way you look this very moment 
But now wee past it and I memorizing that you were in it 
Someone has to make the move to say good-bye so say good-bye 
It over now, it over now, it over now ... 
Your eyes are still off-center on your face, it strange to mention 
It been a year or so since Ie been aware of your imperfections 
I can imagine loving someone else but I will work it out 
It over now, it over now, it over now ... 
Wel make the same mistakes again wee got our methods down 
It over now, it over now, it over now ... When I was seventeen I felt emotions unknown to mankind 
The love I had, the pain I felt began when it was mine 
Now as the end approaches I roll my eyes No, not again. 
It over now, it over now, it over now ... And if you change your mind just call me 
And if you change your mind Il be here 
Youe got about a week or so until forever disappears ... I like to remember you the way you looked the day we met 
But as youe walking out the door I starting to forget 
Il always love you until someone else gets my attention 
It over now, it over now, it over now ... 
Wel make the same mistakes again wee got our methods down 
It over now, it over now, it over now ...
