[Verse 1:] ~Bashy~ 
Look, 
Its Like I Love It When I See Rich Black Men Like Diddy And Nelly, 
But Was Even Happier When I See Dizzie Rascal Gettin Albums Deals Gets His Face On The Telly. 
Personally, When He Won His Mercury, 
I Thought Well Done. 
He's A Black Boy Who's Just Like Me So Like, 
His Respect Is Due Certainly. 
And When 679 Signed Kano, 
I Don't Know Him, 
But i Thought Ok Though, 
That's Good For Him, 
Another Black Boy That's Gonna Make Dough All Legal. 
Hang Tight Lethal, 
He Made 'Pow', and, 
He Brought In A Few More Black People. 
I Rate That Highly, 
That's Why, No Matter What We Had I Still Got To Shout Out Wiley. 
He Built A Scene. 
Amongst Us Black Young Boys He Built A Dream, 
Like Mega-Man Did With So Solid. 
To That Crew Right There We Owe Homage. 
When They Won The Brits I Was Like Brapp, 
Black Boys Up In This Bitch, 
When I See Defoe On The Pitch I'm Like Brapp, 
Black Boys Up In This Bitch Oh. 
[Chorus:] ~Bashy~ 
Black Boys, Black Boys, 
Yeah We're All Black Boys, 
And One Day We're Gonna Be Black Men, 
And One Day We Might Have Black Boys And We Gotta Teach Them To Be Black Men. (Repeat) 
[Loick Essien:] 
Ooh Child, Things Are Gonna Get Easier, Ooh Child, Things Will Get Brighter. 
[Verse 2:] ~Bashy~ 
Yo Look, 
No We Ain't Hooligans, 
Just Young And Talented Nubians, 
With Potential And Promise, 
Innovative Young Masterminds Like Shaun Wallace. 
We Need Role Models, 
So Youngers Know What Success Is. 
That's Why I Feel Boom Inside When I See A Black Man Like Tim Campbell Can Win The Apprentice. 
But When Swiss Made Cry, 
I Ain't Gonna Lie I Could Of Cried. 
Look What Happened To The Mother Land Didn't Wanna See Blacks The Same As Another Man.
