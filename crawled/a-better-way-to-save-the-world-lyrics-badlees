You stand on your platform and present your views 
You hand out your opinion like it's the daily news 
While you're checkin' your look in the mirror 
From your head down to your shoes 
But you don't know 
A better way....a better way to save the world 
You are not my conscience and you are not my keeper 
I ain't no saint, I ain't no saviour, but brother you ain't either 
So let's leave the judgements up to Jesus and St. Peter 
'Cause you don't know 
A better way....a better way to save the world 
So before you accuse me take a look at yourself 
You're just as lost and confused as everybody else 
And a man never looks behind a door he hasn't stood behind himself 
And you don't know 
A better way....a better way to save the world
