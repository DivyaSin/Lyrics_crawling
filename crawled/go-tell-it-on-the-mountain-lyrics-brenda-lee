[Chorus] 
Go, tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go, tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ is born Down in a lowly manger 
The humble Christ was born 
And God sent us salvation 
That blessed Christmas morn [Chorus] While shepherds kept their watch 
Over silent flocks by night 
Behold throughout the Heavens 
There shone a holy light [Chorus: x2] That Jesus Christ is born
