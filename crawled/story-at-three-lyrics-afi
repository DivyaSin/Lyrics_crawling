Again and again they blend into one, my 
Father the morning pushes through my moonlight love, so what's sleep 
(Sleep) 
Sleep 
(Whoa) 
I'm tired, so tired, so tired 
But it seems that there's someone here with me We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awaiting 
(Deathless ones) 
We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awaiting 
(Deathless ones) A story at three with the shrillest of cries, my 
Mind fights with the sparkles in the corner of my eyes, so what's sleep 
(Sleep) 
Sleep 
(Whoa) 
I'm tired, so tired, so tired 
But it seems that there's someone here with me We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awaiting 
(Deathless ones) 
We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awaiting 
(Deathless ones) We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awaiting 
(Deathless ones) 
We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awaiting 
(The deathless ones) I hear the mourning choir 
Sing to me 
Their elegy 
I hear the mourning choir 
Sing to me 
Their elegy (Sing to me) 
I hear the mourning choir 
(So beautiful) 
(Sing to me) 
Their elegy 
(Beauty) 
(Sing to me) 
I hear the mourning choir 
(Ah, they sing to me) 
(Sing to me) 
Their elegy 
(Requiem) 
I hear the mourning choir 
Sing to me 
Their elegy We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awaiting 
(Deathless ones) 
We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awaiting 
(Deathless ones) We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awaiting 
(Deathless ones) 
We are the wakeful, wry and watchful, we're awating 
(The deathless ones)
