Oh no, no! Please don't tell me nothing. 
Oh no, no! Why did you close the door? 
You said you love me girl. I see you clear. 
I know this can't be real. 
And then you fool around. 
My heart is really what you want to steal. I was trapped in your emotion. 
But I never had the notion. 
I was the victim of your love! 
Breakin' down. 
I was the victim of your love! 
Blind and deaf. 
I was the victim of your love! 
I was breakin down. 
I was the victim of your love! 
Blind and deaf. 
Oh no, no! And when you hold me tight. 
Your love is all so warm and feels so right. 
I touch your fingertips. 
So come on girl. 
Let me kiss your lips. Let me be! Let me be!
