We die alone 
But, live amongst men 
Keep quiet 
If you wish to stay alive 
No one is safe here 
No even us 
My whole life I've lived in constant fear of myself 
My mind is my worst enemy 
My mind is my worst enemy 
Mountains around us will fall 
When I close eyes 
I can't seem to stop this 
I just want out 
I am trapped by my thoughts 
They have a hold of me 
I can't seem to stop this 
I just want out 
And now I've become an unmanned vessel 
Can I be renewed? 
What would it do anyway? 
I'm not above being under you again 
We die alone 
But live amongst men 
We hope the best 
And a piece of mind 
Give me the chance and I swear I'll fix everything 
I'm done running 
I am forever 
Steady as the traffic goes 
Your hands still stain my body 
You're under my eyes 
Every single window pane refuses to bare my face 
I have no soul 
I think I've had too much wine I'm beginning to think that you're mine 
I think I've had too much wine I'm beginning to think that you're mine 
Whoa ohhh you're not mine 
Whoa ohhh you're not mine 
I think I've had too much wine I'm beginning to think that you're mine 
We're all just trapped in our selves 
We're all just trapped in our selves 
We're all just trapped in our selves 
We're all just trapped in our selves 
My mind destroyed you but I swear it will be perfect again 
My mind destroyed you but I swear it will be perfect again 
It will be perfect again 
It will be perfect again 
It will be perfect again 
It will be perfect again 
My mind destroyed you but I swear it will be perfect again 
My mind destroyed you but I swear it will be perfect again
