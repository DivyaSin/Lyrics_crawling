[Verse 1 - Ace Hood] 
They told me "Where you getting money? Boy them niggas hate" 
Taught to trust nobody other than my .38 
Fuck a nigga, petty weight 
It's just me and all this money I'll be okay 
Hustle hard, each and every day 
Thinking of a master plan, accumulating cake 
Very rapid pace, motherfucker bang 
IRS be watching, stash it in the safe 
Never trust a nigga, even in his face 
Catch him stealing from me, that's another case 
Prices on your head, show up to your weight 
Cold blooded killer, one more to the face 
Don't nobody side, fuck who got away 
Happy Meal clips, have a nice day 
Money is the motive, nothing mediocre 
Keep that pussy popping, like a canned soda 
Let her ride the dick, come and be my chauffeur 
Heavy money piles, I need a bulldozer 
So keep away the hate, I can't stand the odor 
I'm just getting started, Indy try and told them [Chorus - Ace Hood] 
They told me "Were you getting money? Boy them niggas hate" 
Me and Ballgreezy get this shit by any way 
Real niggas, fuck with us 
We'll be bucking in this bitch until they come get us 
Turn up 
Turn up 
Turn up 
Turn up 
Turn up 
Turn up 
I wish a nigga would 
Turn up 
Turn up 
Turn up 
Turn up 
Turn up 
Turn up 
The whole hood want him [Verse 2 - Ballgreezy] 
Fuck the other side, bitch I'm going ham 
Pocket full of bands, so rock your head, yeah! 
Coconut, and it taste good, Ballgreezy and Ace Hood 
Big pistols, and blowing reefer 
Up in this bitch, because my face good 
Me and my niggas make movies 
Going down about my foolish 
Hell naw, you can't hit the weed 
Or make the drink, bitch keep it moving 
Around here, it's G-code 
Ask around, the streets know 
Love fucking them freak hoes 
With a fat ass and a deep throat 
My outfit, is so shaw 
My shoe game, is so hard 
Stomp with the groupies 
Sitting nigga that's your hoe job 
The music all the way turned up 
Rosay getting poured up 
My cellphone keep blowing up 
By the bad bitch that I'm going to fuck 
My shades on, and they real dawg 
My ice shining real hard 
Niggas acting real hard, that beef shit, and we'll solve 
Pop up with that loose shit, thinking that I ain't going to do shit 
Thinking I ain't going to shoot shit 
Won't give a fuck about who hit [Chorus] [Verse 3 - Ace Hood] 
Okay, I'm gone off of tequila 
Hopping out of that Regal 
24's on my whip 
Toasting my neck colder than freezers 
I'm turned up with my top down 
Bad bitch and she turn around 
Ass fat and I dick her down 
Fuck her free like I'm sights or sounds 
And bitch I'm heavy balling 
Nicknamed Mister Spalding 
Momma told me kill them, dead man walking 
Riding with that reefer, rip through any carcass 
It's We the Best forever, bitch I'm just now getting started 
Hold up [Chorus]
