You say I'm tough - instead I say I'm strong 
You say I'm much too cool - well I say that you're wrong 
It turns you off - because I got it goin' on 
I say you got to try to do better than that Be original - individual 
If you want it, just stay on it - we can play it like that 
You and me - yes it could be 
If you try it, you might like it can we play it 
We can play it like that Play it like that 
Wont you play it, right play it right 
Play it like that - I can take it like that 
'Cos, however you want it I can give it to you back 
If you try it you might like it - can we play it 
We can play it like that You say I'm never home - where should I be 
I say that kind of life - it ain't down with me 
So what you gonna do - what you gonna say 
If you're not willing or able you can get out of my way Be original - individual 
If you want it, just stay on it - we can play it like that 
You and me - yes it could be 
If you try it, you might like it can we play it 
We can play it like that CHORUS Come go with me and I'll show you how good it could be 
Boy, you could be giving it to me 
Every minute, every hour - endlessly....... CHORUS AND AD-LIB TO FADE
