she was a fast machine 
she kept the motor clean 
she was the bast damn woman that i'd ever seen 
she had the sightless eyes 
tellin me no lies 
knocking me out with those american thighs 
takin more than her share 
had me fighting for air 
she told me to come but i was already there 
coz the walls start shaking 
the earth was quaking 
my mind was aching 
and we were making it you 
(chorus) 
you shook me all ight long 
yeah you 
shook me all night long working double time 
on the seduction line 
she was one of a kind,shes just mine all mine 
she wanted no applause 
just another course 
she made a meal out of me and came back for more 
had to cool down 
to take another round 
now im back in the ring to take another swing 
cause the walls was shaking 
the earth was quakin 
my mind was achin 
and we were making it you 
(chorus) 
shook me all night long 
yeah you

an knocked me out and then you 
shook me all night long 
had me shakin and then you 
shook me all night looong 
well you took me
