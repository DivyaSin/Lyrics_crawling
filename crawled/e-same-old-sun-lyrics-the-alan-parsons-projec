Tell me what to do, now the light in my life is gone from me 
Is it always the same, is the night never ending 
Tell me what to do all the hopes and the dreams went wrong for me 
There's a smile on my face but I'm only pretending Taking my life one day at a time 
'Cause I can't think what else to do 
Taking some time to make up my mind 
When there's no one to ask but you The same old sun would shine in the morning 
The same bright eyes would welcome me home 
And the moon would rise way over my head 
And get through the night alone And the same old sun would shine in the morning 
The same bright stars would welcome me home 
And the clouds would rise way over my head 
I'll get through the night on my own Tell me what to do now there's nobody watching over me 
If I seem to be calm well, it's all an illusion 
Tell me what to do when the fear of the night comes over me 
There's a smile on my face just to hide the confusion Taking my life one day at a time 
'Cause I can't think what else to do 
Taking some time to make up my mind 
When there's no one to ask but you The same old sun would shine in the morning 
And the same bright eyes would welcome me home 
And the moon would rise way over my head 
I'll get through the night alone And the same old sun would shine in the morning 
The same bright stars would welcome me home 
And the clouds would rise way over my head 
I'll get through my life on my own, on my own 
On my own, on my own
