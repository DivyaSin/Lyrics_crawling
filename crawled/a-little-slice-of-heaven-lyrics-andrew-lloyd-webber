Hurry up! 
You won't believe it 
Take a look what's over here! 
Who imagined just how big the place would be 
The man called Mr Y put it up in just a year 
It's a little slice of heaven by the sea Look, there's restaurants 
A midway 
A gigantic concert hall 
The biggest fun house ever seen 
A volcano that erupts each day at three 
Wonders brought from round the world 
The season's just begun and Mr Y has got it all 
Crystal fountains, grand pavilions 
Hell, it hust have cost him millions 
It's a little slice of heaven by the sea Over here! The sights, the sounds 
The lights, the smells 
The wonder wheels, the carousels 
The gardens and arcades 
The marble collonades The rides (the rides), the shows (the shows) 
The games (the games) of chance 
The rush (the rush), the whirl (the whirl) 
The sheer (the sheer) romance And the rumours 
What about 'em 
Things so odd you daren't doubt 'em 
Freaks and monsters, abhorrations 
With mechanical creations And the genius who designed it wears a mask 
A mask, a mask But what's behind it? 
What's behind it? 
What's behind it? 
What's behind it? 
What's behind it? (instrumental) Fancy ballrooms 
Altered spaces 
Shoot the shoots and 
Steeple chases A casino, a museum 
Look, a Roman Colosseum 
And a concert hall that's bigger than the Met What's inside it? 
What's inside it? 
What's inside it? 
What's inside it?
