i am hear to bring fear into your life like the icy north wind i live i will be there i will tease you endlessly no matter where you run you will know my name you are bound by might you will feel the pain i will feel you with terror i will hunt you with delight you'll be trapped in my cold embrace you will feel the fear you will know i'll be stalking you i will tease you endlessly you are bound by might as my prey you will feed my infinite hunger you will know my name i will gaze into your eyes and devour you in bliss i will shred your existence beyond panic - you will - die
