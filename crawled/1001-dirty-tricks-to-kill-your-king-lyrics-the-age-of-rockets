A new moon: fragile as glass same as the last 
A new night: waits for you now, in back of your house. what's better than being the first? And armies of the dead will fade 
in rear view mirrors display 
the city lights will never love you back 
And if the firmament above 
should crash his weight upon the earth 
well, we wont go without a fight what's better than being the first?
