Perfect eyes in the moonlight shining 
Trading glances on the boulevard 
My shadow melts to a thousand pieces 
Catch my breath just to hear you now Its getting late and the streets are lonely 
Your in my heart am I on your mind 
In the skies dance your reflections 
You reach out itll all be fine Will you mend my broken wings 
You perfect stranger 
When the sky turns cold with midnight 
Youre the sunrise to the sea 
Perfect stranger After hours and countless seconds 
I cant find the words to say 
Darlin your all Im after 
You fill the spaces breaking me Will you mend my broken wings 
You perfect stranger 
When the sky turns cold with midnight 
Youre the sunrise to the sea 
Perfect stranger Will you mend my broken wings 
You perfect stranger 
When the sky turns cold with midnight 
Youre the sunrise to the sea 
Will you mend my broken wings 
You perfect stranger 
When the sky turns cold with midnight 
Youre the sunrise to the sea 
Perfect stranger 
My perfect stranger
