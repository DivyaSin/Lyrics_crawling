I woke up this morning smelling like lemons 
Salt on the back of my hands 
Mouth was so dry 
I couldn't even spit My eyes felt 
like they were full of sand 
I called Troy Jenkins to see if he survived 
My head pounding like a stone 
He started reeling off things I did last night 
And I cried out over the phone I did what? I smooched who? 
Oh tell me the boss wasn't there 
And that I caused quite a scene 
When I stripped off my jeans 
And did a slide in my underwear 
I did what? I mooned who? 
Oh this time I guess I crossed the line 
There'll be hell to pay 
But what can I say 
I must've had a real good time Troy laughed and said some guy named Red's 
Been looking for you all night 
And oh by the way his girl said to say 
"Just come back any old time" 
Then he went down the list of the things I'd done 
As I listened in misery I was thinking real hard 
about leaving town And changing my identity Chores 
What can I say I had a bad day 
I guess I just lost my mind 
It's all just a blur 
But one things for sure 
I must've had a real good time
