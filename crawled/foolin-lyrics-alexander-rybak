Nobody knows the way I'm feeling 
I try to scream instead I smile 
The world is strange 
I must be dreaming 
How can I stop this just for a while 
The morning rain will soon be falling 
But I don't care cause I've already cried 
Can't see the meaning of this 
But one things certain 
I'm afraid I'm losing my mind 
Somebody else will be her boyfriend 
Somebody else will have her heart 
But still I love her so 
How could I let her go 
I was fooling myself The sky is blue and birds are singing 
The sun does shine 
And kids are playing games 
What have I done 
What was I thinking 
The only thing to do is hide in shame 
Somebody else will be her boyfriend 
Somebody else will have her heart 
But still I love her so 
How could I let her go 
I was fooling myself Somebody else will be her boyfriend 
Somebody else will have her heart 
But I still need her so 
How could I let her go 
I was fooling myself 
I was fooling myself
