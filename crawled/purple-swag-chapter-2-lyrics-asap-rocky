[Verse 1: Spaceghostpurp] 
Back in this bitch motherfucker, yeah it's me 
Spaceghost Purrp and I put your bitch to sleep 
Me and my twin at it again with this flow 
Sipping on gin, living in sin, lean in the trunk 
RIP to Screw, rest in peace to Pimp C 
Shout out to the H and that fucking SUC 
My fucking brain is purple nigga 
[Hook:] 
Everything is purple (Swag) 
[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky] 
It be that pretty motherfucker sipping that throwed 
Gripping my pistol, my chrome 
Hate and I'll hit you [?] 
Spit it and flip it like Bone 
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch 
Only Harlem nigga on his Bone shit 
Tripping fo's since back in '06 
Won't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch 
Two middle fingers to the show, bitch 
Cause they selfish in the show biz 
Cause they shelf kids and it's hopeless 
Career dying quicker than a cold fish 
I be the fly young fella 
Maison Martin Margiela 
Bitches Cinderellas under my umbrella, I go and tell her 
[Hook] 
[Verse 3: ASAP Nast] 
All hell here, bitches Satan talking 
Told her to take it off, give me the D, she take the offense 
Skinny nigga balling, trip but never fallin 
Who said to make it rain? Bitch I make it pouring 
I'm a take a [?], go study my nature 
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature 
Fuck what you saying, away 
A hater don't faze a gangster 
Brought up in danger, all about paper 
Smoking on purple, bitch I'm dangerous 
Nasty, crazy 
Ninety's baby, Mama I made it 
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement 
Hoes get caught in amazement 
I'm stuck in my ways, so fuck 'em up, fuck 'em and duck 'em for days 
What more can I say? I'm chasing this paper 
That's purple, nigga
