Lyrics: jones 
Music: jones Lyrics: Standing in the eden garden 
Lying in the shade 
Sidewinder in the dirt 
Grass cutting king of spades 
Sidewinder 
Adam was combing hair 
Eden was bearing fruit (chorus): 
Passion was in pain 
Now the politics beware 
Pandora's open box 
Lock lay broken on the stairs 
Eyes are open 
Mouths are choking 
The glass is broken bare 
She said to me 
Eyes that glow are yellow gold 
Don't cross that sidewinder in the road Smoke in the flower pots 
Evening comes and leaves a blot 
Lying to the leaving love 
Planted from the jah above 
Sidewinder 
Took a bite, bit her lip 
Water running on the trip (chorus) Joker's wild, eve is heavy 
Adam got his lid flipped 
Naked bones bright and white 
Fruit was juicy, tree was stripped 
Sidewinder 
Fig leaf and fidgety 
Better days on adam's eve (chorus)
