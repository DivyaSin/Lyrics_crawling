Bed, bed I couldn't go to bed 
My head's too light to try to set it down 
Sleep, sleep I couldn't sleep tonight 
Not for all the jewels in the crown I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night 
And still have begged for more 
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things 
I've never done before I'll never know what made it so exciting 
Why all at once my heart took flight 
I only know when he began to dance with me 
I could have danced, danced, danced all night It's after three now 
Don't you agree now? 
She ought to be in bed I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night 
And still have begged for more 
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things 
I've never done before I'll never know what made it so exciting 
Why all at once my heart took flight 
I only know when he began to dance with me 
I could have danced, danced, danced all night I understand dear 
It's all been grand dear 
But now it's time to sleep I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night 
And still have begged for more 
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things 
I've never done before I'll never know what made it so exciting 
Why all at once my heart took flight 
I only know when he began to dance with me 
I could have danced, danced, danced all night
