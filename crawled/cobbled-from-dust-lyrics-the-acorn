Here it is against my belly 
the sum of all your solid parts 
I soak you up and let you fuel my follies 
the same events were caused long ago. I watch you bite my legs off 
I humbly dropped my gloves off to fight; 
that's sane? 
You can't understand the clouds above your head 
but they stir your heart. Here again, a simple verse 
It echoes love on through the wind and wires 
Or the ring of the phone 
We're destined to get swallowed whole 
So I'd rather not stay home tonight 
Cause what we want is here 
In the face of the fight 
Yeah what we want is here 
In the face of the fight.
