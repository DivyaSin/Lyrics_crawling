Have you felt the pain of a love so deep 
You think your heart might break? 
Has someone touched your soul so deep inside? 
Did you feel your whole world stop 
The moment that you looked into their eyes? 
Oh, do you know what it's like? Do you know the way it feels when you love someone so bad? 
You can't think of nothing else but the touch of their hand 
And you wanna walk away but no you know you can't 
Do you know the way it feels? Have you had those nights when you can't sleep 
'Cause that picture of their face is all you see 
You know you need that love like you need air 
And you find it hard to breathe 
Sometimes when you just never sleep and then 
Oh, you know it's just not fair Do you know the way it feels when you love someone so bad? 
You can't think of nothing else but the touch of their hand 
And you wanna walk away but no you know you can't 
Do you know the way it feels? Do you have a clue what I'm going through? 
Do you know what it's like when you feel like 
You're just about to lose your mind, baby? Do you know the way it feels when you love someone so bad? 
You can't think of nothing else but the touch of their hand 
And you wanna walk away but no you know you can't Do you know the way it feels when you love someone so bad? 
You can't think of nothing else but the touch of your hand 
And when I wanna walk away but no you know I can't 
Do you know the way it feels, way it feels?
