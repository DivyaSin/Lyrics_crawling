She was my friend when I needed a friend 
He was a man who said our love would never end 
When things went wrong she'd tell us both to try again 
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for And there were times when she was feeling down 
One of us would always come around 
And try to share some other happiness we found 
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for I suppose I should have seen what was happening to me 
And I guess I should have known there wasn't love enough for three 
And now there's only me So I'm alone like I never thought I'd be 
I trusted her just as far as I could see 
And she stole his love away from me 
If that's what friends are for 
I don't need them anymore
