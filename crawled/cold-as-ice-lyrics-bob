[Verse 1] 
Well me and her were the 2 
me and her were together like glue 
but we lived packed in a shack 
like the old lady who lived in a shoe 
and we ain't really know what to do 
'till one day she got her a job at WaMu 
I said baby if you been thinkin' what I thinkin', 
then all of our problems are through 
so we got together with the crew 
and planned everything with the T 
we got gloves and guns and bags and masks 
and anything we would need 
so we scoped out the facility 
really waited a couple of weeks. 
'till it was time to kick in the door 
everyone down its a robbery [Chorus X2] 
You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice) 
you're willing to sacrifice our love 
and now you got me (Froze) 
I said you got me (froze) 
because you're so c-cold 
you left me cold tonight [Verse 2] 
So I went to my girl and said "quit playin' and give me the cash" 
but nobody suspected a thing 
it was quite a spectacular act 
so we get to the safe out of everyone's sight 
so I take off my mask and ask 
"did your partner remember to cut the line for the panic button in the back?" 
and she paused 
the look she had on her face was cold as ice 
before she could she could say the next word I heard the sirens pull out outside 
so I tried to grab her and run, she pulled away and said she would be fine 
she was on the clock so I guess nobody would think she was in on the crime [Chorus X2] 
You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice) 
you're willing to sacrifice our love 
and now you got me (Froze) 
I said you got me (froze) 
because you're so c-cold 
you left me cold tonight [Verse 3] 
So I realized it was over 
when the SWAT team kicked in the door 
so I dropped my gun and the cash, and then I got bummed rushed to the floor 
and they took me into the station 
and they started the interrogation 
and I said, "I ain't sayin' a word 'till I get appropriate representation" 
so as I get escorted out, to my surprise what do I see 
that's my baby sittin' in cuffs 
tellin' the officers everything 
ans I stand there in amazement 
trying to find an explanation 
and the cops come in and restrain me 
and they mase me and the taze me 
I said, "baby why baby what did I do to forsake you 
how can you turn your back on me you're selfish I hate you 
all I ever wanted to do love you 
were you fakin'?" 
so I snatched the gun from my officer 
and I cocked it and I aimed it 
and said, "this is for all the pain you done 
put me through you're ungrateful how could you 
all I wanted to do was save you" 
and here I am day 55 
with 55 hundred to go 
when you love a girl who is as cold as ice 
eventually you'll get froze [Chorus X2] 
You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice) 
you're willing to sacrifice our love 
and now you got me (Froze) 
I said you got me (froze) 
because you're so c-cold 
you left me cold tonight [Bridge] 
32 degrees below zero 
you're like 31 flavors you're oh so cold 
feels like 30 straight days of falling snow 
I'm so cold and alone, alone 
you're like 32 degrees below zero 
or like 31 flavors you're oh so cold 
feels like 30 straight days of falling snow 
I'm so cold and alone, alone 
you left me cold tonight [Chorus X2] 
You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice) 
you're willing to sacrifice our love 
and now you got me (Froze) 
I said you got me (froze) 
because you're so c-cold 
you left me cold tonight
