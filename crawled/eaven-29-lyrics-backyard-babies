Someone put me on a plane 
Goodbye, farewell, adios my friends 
I need a holiday 
S.a.s. is takin' off again CHORUS: I want to have my fun 
Where the nights are long 
We want to go away 
Where the sun will always shine 
We're in heaven 2.9 Or just put me on a train 
Goodbye, farewell, adios my friends 
Tell her I said 'Hey' 
And I might not come home again CHORUS: A London queen 
Tokyo teen 
A Frisco fag in the disco scene 
A New York doll 
And the Berlin boys Can I ride in your car 
Goodbye, farewell, adios my friends 
Vacations at the jet set sunset bay 
My girls are drivin' me insane CHORUS: We're in heaven 2.9 
Ohoohoh We're in heaven 2.9 
Ohoohoh We're in heaven 2.9 
Ohoohoh
