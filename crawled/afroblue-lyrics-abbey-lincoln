Dream of a land my soul is from 
I hear a hand stroke on a drum 
Shades of delight, cocoa hue 
Rich as the night afro blue Elegant boy, beautiful girl 
Dancing for joy delicate whirl 
Shades of delight, cocoa hue 
Rich as the night afro blue Two young lovers face to face 
With undulating grace 
They gently sway, then slip away 
To some secluded place 
Shades of delight, cocoa hue 
Rich as the night afro blue Whispering trees, echo their sighs 
Passionate pleas, tender replies 
Shades of delight, cocoa hue 
Rich as the night afro blue Lovers in flight upward they glide 
Burst at the height slowly subside 
Shades of delight, cocoa hue 
Rich as the night afro blue And my slumbering fantasy assumes reality 
Until it seems it's not a dream the two are you and me 
Shades of delight, cocoa hue 
Rich as the night afro blue
