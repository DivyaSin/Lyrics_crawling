Look at the two of you dancing that way 
Lost in the moment and each other's face 
So much in love, you're alone in this place 
Like there's nobody else in the world I was enough for her not long ago 
I was her number one, she told me so 
And she still means the world to me 
Just so you know 
So be careful when you hold my girl 
Time changes everything, life must go on 
And I'm not gonna stand in your way I loved her first 
I held her first 
And a place in my heart will always be hers 
From the first breath she breathed 
When she first smiled at me 
I knew the love of a father runs deep 
And I prayed that she'd find you someday 
But it's still hard to give her away 
I loved her first How could that beautiful woman with you 
Be that same freckled face kid that I knew? 
The one that I read all those fairy tales to 
And tucked into bed all those nights 
And I knew the first time I saw you with her 
It was only a matter of time I loved her first 
I held her first 
And a place in my heart will always be hers 
From the first breath she breathed 
When she first smiled at me 
I knew the love of a father runs deep 
And I prayed that she'd find you someday 
But it's still hard to give her away 
I loved her first From the first breath she breathed 
When she first smiled at me 
I knew the love of a father runs deep 
Someday you might know what I'm going through 
When a miracle smiles up at you 
Yeah, I loved her first
