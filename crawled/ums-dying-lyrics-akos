Blessed be the snow 
That's falling 
Virgin white 
Is covering everything 
Blessed be the Sun 
That's hiding 
Not shedding light 
On the face of suffering 
Oooh, Mum's dying 
Oooh, Mum's dying 
Make no move 
Make no sound 
She's flying 
Heavenbound 
And all that will be left behind 
Is that peace of mind 
That speech beyond words 
That mysterious beautiful bird 
Oooh, Mum's dying 
Oooh, Mum's dying
