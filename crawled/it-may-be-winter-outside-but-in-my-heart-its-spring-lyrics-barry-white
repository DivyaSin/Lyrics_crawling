When the temperature dips 
I miss my baby's arms 
His tender finger tips 
Knows just how to keep me warm It may be zero degrees 
With the snow falling down 
But I've got warm and tender love 
Just as long as he's around [Chorus] 
It may be winter outside 
But in my heart it's spring 
How much joy and pleasure, baby 
Can one guy bring me Winter nights can be awful cold 
Without someone to hold 
But when I have him next to me 
Baby, I'm in ecstasy [Chorus] Throughout my life 
I've had my share of guys 
But he's been the only one 
Who can make my temperature rise Things are just not the same 
When he's not by my side 
But yet, I shouldn't complain 
But be waiting with my arms open wide [Chorus: x3]
