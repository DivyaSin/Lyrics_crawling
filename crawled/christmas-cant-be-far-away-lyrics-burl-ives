A neighbor tipped his hat to me this mornin' 
The landlord even smiled and said good day 
And I want you to know that a stranger said hello 
Christmas can't be far away Old tight wad down the street is a buying candy 
To pass out to the neighbor kids at play 
The town is on the go and the weather man says snow 
Christmas can't be far away The small fry on our block have all been saving 
And now their hiding things and looking sly 
Mum will get that doodad she's been craving 
And dad will get his usual Christmas tie Both young and old are planning sweet surprises 
They'll soon be tied with ribbons bright and gay 
Good will is in the air and you feel it everywhere 
Christmas can't be far away
