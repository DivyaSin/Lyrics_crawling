It's a void that I can't fill 
An empty space, I can't replace 
With anything at all The lights are all burnt out 
And smoke will drive the swimmers down 
There's no one left at all You've done enough, he's still alive 
He's breathing on his own 
I leave everything I have You've done enough, he's still alive 
And he's breathing on his own 
And he's breathing on his own There's chaos everywhere 
And panic written on the air 
That everyone is breathing And crushing light of day 
The pain will never wash away 
The fear will never leave You've done enough, he's still alive 
And he's breathing on his own 
I leave everything I have You've done enough, he's still alive 
And he's breathing on his own 
And he's breathing on his own And God save our souls 
How tables have turned and broke One more like this could be the end 
They say they told us all along 
But we were busy getting laid One more like this will be the end 
And we've known it all along 
We've known it all along
