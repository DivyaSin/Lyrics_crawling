little creeper in the shade under my brain 
in caterpillars hundredth eye under mushroom clouds in the rain, child 
i wrote your name in sparrows blood upon your madhouse wall 
i drug my belly cross the river bed of skulls 
to sing ya'll a song that crawls 
that song that crawls 
aw, that song that crawls 
when i spoke your name out loud again, 
i wondered when 
you'd bring the rain back to me? 
i'm wondering 
had we ever really lived at all? 
when they closed the coffin lid on 
the tombstone king...pierce my eyelids again 
aw,that song that crawls 
aw,that song that crawls
