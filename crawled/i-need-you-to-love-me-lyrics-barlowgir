Why, why are you still with me? 
Didn't you see what I've done? 
In my shame I want to run and hide myself 
But it's here I see the truth 
I don't deserve you But I need you to love me, and I 
I won't keep my heart from you this time 
So I'll stop this pretending that I can 
Somehow deserve what I already have 
I need you to love me I, I have wasted so much time 
Pushing you away from me 
I just never saw how much you could cherish me 
Cuz you're a God who has all things 
And still you want me But I need you to love me, and I 
I won't keep my heart from you this time 
So I'll stop this pretending that I can 
Somehow deserve what I already have 
I need you to love me Your love makes me forget what I have been 
Your love makes me see who I really am 
Your love makes me forget what I have been But I need you to love me, and I 
I won't keep my heart from you this time 
So I'll stop this pretending that I can 
Somehow deserve what I already have 
I need you to love me
