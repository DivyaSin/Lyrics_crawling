Why won't you love me? I can't love you 
If you won't let me next to you, it's true, it's true 
And how can I kiss you if my lips 
Don't reach through the phone, I'm home all alone Why won't you love me? Won't you cry and if you won't anymore 
You don't phone for me to come 
And why should I die for you, I won't be 'round to see you frown 
When they put me down in the ground
