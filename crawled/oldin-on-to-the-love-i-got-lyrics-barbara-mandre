I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got 
In a hundred million years, I'll never stop 
'Cause there's nothing in the world 
That could keep me from loving you Well, I'm living when I'm loving 
And I'm loving every time I'm with you 
Just like walking in the sunshine 
Lord, you make me feel so fine And as long as we're leaving 
And loving the way we want to 
I know I'm gonna be 
The best loved woman alive I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got 
I couldn't care less if they like it or not 
As long as you're satisfied 
With the things I do I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got 
In a hundred million years, I'll never stop 
'Cause there's nothing in the world 
That could keep me from loving you Thrills I feel, I know are real 
When you touch me 
And I wake up every morning 
With your arms wrapped around me tight And the feeling I feel 
Is exactly the way it should be 
'Cause the love we've got 
Keeps growing every day and night I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got 
I couldn't care less if they like it or not 
As long as you're satisfied 
With the things I do I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got 
In a hundred million years, I'll never stop 
'Cause there's nothing in the world 
That could keep me from loving you No, there's nothing in the world 
That could keep me from loving you
