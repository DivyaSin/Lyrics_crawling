water, father 
water is faster 
it puts prize on the mind 
father my fever 
humble not dry 
somewhere my rainbow longs for my day 
nowhere is night time 
please go away 
water wash her away from my mind 
father leave her 
see what we will find 
somewhere sunshine leaves me ok 
nowhere the moon rails 
please go away
