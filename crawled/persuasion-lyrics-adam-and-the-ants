She's rich, she's powerful 
She doesn't want to be a man 
(Do, do, do, do, do) 
She takes me as she finds me 
Like only a woman can, yeah, ah She's tough, but vulnerable 
I'd say adoring 
I'd like to say we're perfect 
But you know that would be boring Clap your hands, pretty baby clap your hands 
It's gonna take a little 
(Oh) 
Oh, oh, oh, persuasion 
Do, do, do, do, do, persuasion 
Oh, oh, oh, persuasion 
You know what I mean now Adore that shape 
I really really don't know why 
But as long as I live 
I just can't help but try Please don't say you love me 
You saw us in a crystal 
Every time you do that 
I'm reaching for my pistol Clap your hands, pretty baby clap your hands 
It's gonna take a little 
(Oh) 
Oh, oh, oh, persuasion 
Do, do, do, do, do, persuasion 
Oh, oh, oh, persuasion 
You know what I mean now Less about yesterday, more about forever 
Keep it nice and simple, try not to be clever 
It's nice to be right but on this occasion 
Less about perhaps, more about persuasion! Oh, oh, oh, persuasion 
Do, do, do, do, do, persuasion 
Oh, oh, oh, persuasion 
You know what I mean now
