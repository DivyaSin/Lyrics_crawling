I don't wanna hear the noises on tv 
I don't want the salesmen coming after me 
I don't wanna live in my father's house no more 
I don't want it faster, I don't want it free 
I don't wanna show you what they done to me 
I don't wanna live in my father's house no more 
I don't wanna choose black or blue 
I don't wanna see what they done to you 
I don't wanna live in my father's house no more Because the tide is high 
And it's rising still 
And I don't wanna see it at my windowsill Don't wanna give 'em my name and address 
Don't wanna see what happens next 
Don't wanna live in my father's house no more 
Don't wanna live with my father's debt 
You can't forgive what you can't forget 
Don't wanna live in my father's house no more 
Don't wanna fight in a holy war 
Don't want the salesmen knocking at my door 
I don't wanna live in america no more 
Because the tide is high 
And it's rising still 
And I don't wanna see it at my windowsill I don't wanna see it at my windowsill 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill Mtv, what have you done to me? 
Save my soul, set me free! 
Set me free! what have you done to me? 
I can't breathe! I can't see! 
World war iii 
When are you coming for me? 
Been kicking up sparks 
We set the flames free 
The windows are locked now 
So what'll it be? 
A house on fire, a rising sea? Why is the night so still? 
Why did I take the pill? 
Because I don't wanna see it at my windowsill! I don't wanna see it at my windowsill! 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill! 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill! 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill! 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill! 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill! 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill! 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill! 
I don't wanna see it at my windowsill!
