Written by Michael Bacon "No one asked me, but that's my advice. Thanks to that soul-clapping audience of Yale Rep on 12/8/00." MB My friend Steve he wears his heart on his sleeve 
All the girls seem to leave him lonely 
Well, I'm a nice guy with a shoulder to cry on 
With one bit of advice only 
You gotta inch your way, working every day 
Showing her all your love 
Lighten her load but keep it on the road and you'll grow it 
So don't you blow it Take another baby step, up the mountain of love 
It's a long, long ways and so high up above 
Hold her hand so tightly and up, up you will climb 
That wonderful mountain of love, one baby step at a time Icarus standing on the shore with his dad, saying that he wants to fly 
Dad says son I can hook up the wings if you promise not to go too high 
But he forgot what he said and he lost his head 
He headed straight for the sun 
That sealed his fate, he was a little too late for returning 
Now he's burning Take another baby step, up the mountain of love 
It's a long, long ways and so high up above 
Hold her hand so tightly and up, up you will climb 
That wonderful mountain of love, one baby step at a time Keep a walking. Little bitty steps are gonna work it brother 
Keep a walking right on 
Putting one foot in front of the other, take it Take another baby step, up the mountain of love 
It's a long, long ways and so high up above 
Hold her hand so tightly and up, up you will climb 
That wonderful mountain of love, one baby step at a time
