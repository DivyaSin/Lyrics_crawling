Have always had big toes. 
With smells emanating 
that drift up into your nose. 
And the people in my family, 
have questionable hygiene. 
I think it all comes from, watching too much Mr Bean. 
But there's nothing to compa 
re, 
With my Grandad's Steely Hair. 
Its thick and wiry, and looks like a rug, 
And you always find one or two in your mug. 
He's hairy but I love him, 
My hairy Grandad.
