Driving down the interstate 
Running thirty minutes late 
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own 
Some foreign car drivin' dude with a road rage attitude 
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone 
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong 
He flipped me the bird an' then he was gone Some beach 
Somewhere 
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair 
Palm trees are growing and warm breezes blowing 
I picture myself right there 
On some beach, somewhere I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot 
Just big enough I could park my old truck 
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car 
I stopped and I waited for him to back up 
But from out of no where a Mercedes Benz 
Came cruisin' up and whipped right in Some beach 
Somewhere 
There's no where to go when you got all day to get there 
There's cold margaritas and hot Senoritas smiling with long dark hair 
On some beach 
Somewhere I sat in that waiting room 
It seemed like all afternoon 
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you 
You're not gonna feel a thing we'll give you some Novocaine 
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two 
Then he stuck that needle down deep in my gum 
And he started drilling before I was numb Some beach 
Somewhere 
There's a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere 
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing 
In the salty evenin' air 
On some beach 
Somewhere 
On some beach, somewhere
