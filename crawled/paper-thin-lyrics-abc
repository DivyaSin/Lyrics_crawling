Rick and wealthy canvas 
Clustered up in jewels 
Finding all your heavyweights 
Are featherweights and fools Broken all your promises 
Broken all your paper plates 
Clustered in gold 
Crusted in gold Heavy and hollow 
Look at the shape we're in 
Find us here 
Paper thin 
Heavy and humble 
Look at the shape we're in 
Find us here 
Paper thin In origami cities 
In nations built on sand 
Love got bent right outta shape 
Things got outta hand Polystyrene skylines 
Papier mache smiles 
Rusted and bruised 
Tarnished and frail Heavy and hollow 
Look at the shape we're in 
Find us here 
Paper thin 
Heavy and humble 
Look at the shape we're in 
Find us here 
Paper thin, paper thin, paper thin... Stars scrape the moon 
And the moon scrapes the sky 
We stand beneath 
Wondering why Stars scrape the moon 
And the moon scrapes the sky 
We stand beneath 
Wondering why, wondering why Paper buys the men 
The men that make to bomb 
The bomb that makes this world 
Paper thin! Money markets crumble 
Gentle as a drum 
But if you see me stumble, I'm 
Paper thin! Life is but a fragile thing 
So delicate and pure 
An accolade bestowed on us 
Paper thin So contemplate the skull 
The skull beneath the skin 
One day we all die, we're 
Paper thin! Bury your destruction 
In your last battle hymn 
The barriers between us, make 'em all 
Paper thin! Paper thin! 
Paper thin! Paper thin! Underneath the paper moon 
The sky is paper thin 
Torn into a thousand shreds 
So let the solar system in Rick and wealthy canvas 
Clustered up in jewels 
Finding all your heavyweights 
Are featherweights and fools In origami cities 
In nations built on sand 
Love got bent right outta shape 
Nothing ends as planned And it's all - Paper thin 
Paper thin. Paper thin
