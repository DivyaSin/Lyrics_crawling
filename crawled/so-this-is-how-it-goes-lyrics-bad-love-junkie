Woke up on the floor today 
Aching head and loss of time 
An empty bottle next to me 
I remember that you left 
I just can't remember why And so this Is how it goes 
For the guy who couldn't lose 
Sinking to the bottom of an ocean of tears 
& so this is how it goes 
For the guy who couldn't lose 
It just goes to show 
You never know 
You really never know Tonight I'm going out with friends 
I'll perform my stupids tricks 
They'll say I'm better off alone 
Have another drink on me 
Fill me in what did I miss? And so this Is how it goes 
For the guy who couldn't lose 
Sinking to the bottom of an ocean of tears 
& so this is how it goes 
For the guy who couldn't lose 
It just goes to show 
You never know 
You really never know
