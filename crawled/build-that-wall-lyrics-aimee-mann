She's been a long time on the phone 
Courtin' disaster in an undertone 
She's feelin' nostalgic 
And feelin' that fall 
How could anyone ever fight it? 
Who could ever expect to fight it 
When she builds that wall Maybe it's one where time will tell 
Maybe it's one where it's just fare thee well 
I hear her comin' 
As she walks down the hall 
How could anyone ever fight it? 
Who could ever expect to fight it 
When she builds that wall I know the choice is made 
I can tell I said 
By your guilty face 
And I never was one to fight it 
How does anyone ever fight it? 
(Ooh ooh oo oo oo ooh) 
How does anyone ever fight? You couldn't pin this one on me 
You knew my thoughts so far as I can see 
Ohh I say it's hopeless 
But you make the call 
'Cause I never was one to fight it 
And if given the chance I guess 
I'll learn to build that wall
