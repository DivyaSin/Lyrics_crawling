Am I the luckiest boy? 
Are you the luckiest? The only lonely girl tonight? Come on. Come back. Make me feel that 
Come on. Come back. Make me feel... feel. This is the luckiest day of our lives 
This is the luckiest. How did you not survive? 
If I played the game the wrong way would you help me understand? 
If you hold those cards in arm I can't see the other hand 
You got some crazy plans Can I be anyone this time? 
Can I be anyone or has it passed its prime? So Come on. Come back. Make me feel that 
Come on. Come back. Make me feel... This is the luckiest day of our lives 
This is the luckiest. How did you not survive? 
If I played the game the wrong way would you help me understand? 
If you hold them all with one arm I can't see the other hand 
Wake me if you can How was I to know that you'd come and go? 
Now I can see it was only in my dreams 
Then I see the sky and thank god I'm alive. 
Alive.... This is the luckiest day of our lives 
This is the luckiest. How did you not survive? 
Now, I know I played the wrong way but I still can't understand? 
If you hold them all with one arm I can't see the other hand 
So, cancel all your plans And spend this luckiest day 
And spend this luckiest day 
And spend this luckiest day with me. This is the luckiest day 
This is the luckiest day 
This is the luckiest day of our lives.
