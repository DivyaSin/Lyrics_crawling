One cup of coffee, then I'll go; 
Though I just dropped by to let you know 
That I'm leaving you tomorrow; 
I'll cause you no more sorrow: 
One cup of coffee, then I'll go. I brought the money like the lawyer said to do, 
But it won't replace the 'eartache I caused you; 
It won't take the place of lovin' you, I know, 
So one cup of coffee, then I'll go.

Tell the kids I came last night 
And kissed them while they slept; 
Make my coffee sweet and warm 
Just the way you used to lie in my arms. I brought the money like the lawyer said to do, 
But it won't replace the 'eartache I caused you; 
It won't take the place of lovin' you, I know, 
So one cup of coffee, then I'll go; 
One cup of coffee, then I'll go; 
One cup of coffee, then I'll go.
