Don't let them break you. 
Don't let them tell you who you are. 
Doesn't matter where you come from, 
You'll always have a floor to sleep on. 
And you have your bamboo bones, 
Nervous energy, 
Blind ambition, 
Skin of your teeth. 
Push back, push back, push back, 
With every word and every breath. What God doesn't give to you, 
You've got to go and get for yourself. I'm embarrassed to admit it, 
I've got no grip. 
I'm leading with my jaw, 
Can you see it from the distance? 
Does it look ridiculous? 
I guess that's just what I have to live with. 
Still I have a mind to think, 
Knees to break, 
You standing beside me. 
I'm going to push back, push back, push back, 
With every word and every breath. What God doesn't give to you, 
You've got to go and get for yourself.
