Broken when I'm kneeling 
I find in my hidden shelter 
With You, raw and pure is treasure 
I know deep within Your presence, oh Lord And this hopefulness You give me 
Oh, nothing can compare And as the world will change 
You'll always be the same 
And the days will fade away 
But You remain the same Broken when I realize 
That You love me in my weakness 
And You have given more in my life 
And I'm humbled by Your kindness, oh Lord And this hopefulness You give me 
Oh, nothing can compare And as the world will change 
You'll always be the same 
And the days will fade away 
But You remain the same And You will always be the same And as the world will change 
You'll always be the same 
And the days will fade away 
But You remain the same And as the world will change 
You'll always be the same 
And the days will fade away 
But You remain the same Hello, hello
