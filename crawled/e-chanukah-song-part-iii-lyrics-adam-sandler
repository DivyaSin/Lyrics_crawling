Put on your yarmulke 
Here comes Chanukah 
Once again it's onaka 
The miracle of Chanukah Chanukah is the festival of lights 
One day of presents, hell no, we get eight crazy nights 
But if you still feel like the only kid in two without a Christmas tree 
I guess my first two songs didn't do it for you, so here comes number three Ross and Phoebe from Friends say the Chanukah blessing 
So does Lenny's pal Squiggy and Will & Grace's Debra Messing 
Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon never mix meat with dairy 
Maybe they shoulda called that show "Little Kosher House on the Prairie" 
We got Jerry Lewis, Ben Stiller, and Jack Black 
Tom Arnold converted to Judaism, but you guys can have him back We may not get to kiss underneath the mistletoe 
But we can do it all night long with Deuce Bigalow, I'm Jewish Put on your yarmulke, here comes Chanukah The guy in Willie Nelson's band who plays harmonica celebrates Chanukah Osama bin Laden, not a big fan of the Jews 
Well maybe that's 'cause he lost a figure skating match 
to gold medalist Sarah Hughes, her mama's Jewish 
Houdini and David Blaine escape straightjackets with such precision 
But the one thing they could not get out of - their painful circumcisions As for half-Jewish actors, Sean Penn is quite the great one 
And Marlon Brando, not a Jew at all, but it looks to me like he ate one 
Gwenyth Paltrow's half-Jewish, but a full time Oscar winner 
Jennifer Conelly's half-Jewish too, and I'd like to put some more in her There's Lou Reed, Perry Ferrell, Beck, and Paula Abdul 
Joey Ramone invented punk rock music, but first came Hebrew School Natalie Portmonika, it's time to celebrate Chanukah 
I hope I get an abtronika, on this joyful, toyful Chanukah 
So get a high colonika, and soil your Long Johnikas 
If you really, really wannaka 
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah
