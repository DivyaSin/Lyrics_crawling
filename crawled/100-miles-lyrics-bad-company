Hey little girl, I love you so 
I'd walk a 100 miles to let you know Hey little baby, your eyes sure shine 
When your hand reaches out and touches mine 'Cos you're my baby, you're my baby, my little girl Hey little girl, let me kiss your lips 
Let me feel you thrill to my fingertips 
Hey little baby, let me take your hand 
Let me lead you to the promised land 'Cos you're my baby, you're my baby, my little girl Hey little girl, I love you so 
I'd walk a 100 miles to let you know 
Hey little girl, I love you so 
I'd walk a 100 miles to let you know
