The day it stops, you'll know I'm not your lover anymore 
I'll crack a smile, with different eyes than I did for you before Change my name and meet me at the door 
Where I won't recognise me anymore 
If it's what you want then I will go 
And cease to be the person that you know Centuries since you have been carried through my door 
But here I'll stay where I was made, so far from where you are In Amsterdam, Dad ain't dead 
So I'm going back to where I'm myself Change my name and meet me at the door 
Where I won't recognise me anymore 
If it's what you want then I will go 
And cease to be the person that you know I don't want some stranger in my arms 
So I stopped searching since you came along 
I thought you said that we would retire 
But now I face a self that must expire
