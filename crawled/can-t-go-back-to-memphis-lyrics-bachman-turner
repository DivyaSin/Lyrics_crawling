Can't Go Back To Memphis 
Randy Bachman Low down dealin's in Memphis 
A card game in a back room 
I was lookin' at my last dollar 
Hopin' lady luck would come by soon I played out on the east side 
Till I heard my reputation was in doubt 
It was starting to look like a bad ride 
It looked like time for gettin' out They raised the betting limit 
The cards were falling fast 
I bet away my future, 
I already lost my past Now I can't go back to Memphis 
I played out every game 
I can't go back to Memphis 
Everybody knows my name 
Too many people wanna even out the score 
And I can't go back to Memphis no more I did my best to beat the system 
But the system put me back in my palace 
They maintained a delicate balance 
Where no one got in nobody's face 
I was tryin' to make a dollar 
Just survivin' in the street 
I fought the gangs, I fought the law 
But they both had me beat Now I can't go back to Memphis 
I played out every game 
I can't go back to Memphis 
Everybody knows my name 
Too many people wanna even out the score 
And I can't go back to Memphis no more I can't go back to Memphis 
I can't go back to Memphis No, no, I can't go back to Memphis 
No, no, no, no I can't go back to Memphis 
No, no, no, no 
Too many people wanna even out the score 
And I can't go back to Memphis no more
