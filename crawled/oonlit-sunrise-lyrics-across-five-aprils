I'm serious this time I don't want her to leave my sight ever again. And it's only been ten minutes... The candles are smoking now I guess they decided to give up on giving light. The couch still warm from where we were when we said good night. Two words that make me hurt worse than anything else you say. I'll trade anything else for this feeling when you say to me... Goodnight... been ten minutes... The candles are smoking now I guess they decided to give up on giving light. The couch still warm from where we were when we said good night. While the tide comes in tonight stay with me for once instead. We'll make this starlight perfect. And as the night bleeds into day. We'll watch the moon set on the sun-rise you'll look at me and say. This is the last night we'll have to say good-bye and drive away.
