Is it not enough for you to be alive 
Did you have to create God to survive 
This is all we have and all we have is everywhere 
There are so many stars 
The church and state are lethal killers If this is all we have 
Life seems so much better 
Life seems so much deeper than before Does it make you feel much better to stay unaware 
Are you living for a heaven that might not be there 
This is all we have and all we have is everywhere 
There are so many stars 
The church and state are lethal killers If this is all we have 
Life seems so much better 
Life seems so much deeper 
And now I'm sure that this is all we have 
Life seems so much better 
Life seems so much deeper than before This is all we have 
And all we have is everywhere 
This is all we have to be alive 
(Is it not enough for you) 
And all we have is everywhere 
(To be alive) This is all we have 
And all we have is everywhere 
This is all we have 
(Did you have to create God?) 
And all we have is everywhere 
(To survive) This is all we have 
And all we have is everywhere 
There are so many stars 
The church and state of lethal killers If this is all we have 
Life seems so much better 
Life seems so much deeper 
And now I'm sure that this is all we have 
Life seems so much better 
Life seems so much deeper than before
