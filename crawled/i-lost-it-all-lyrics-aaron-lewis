When I die I'll go to Heaven 
Because I spent my time in Hell 
I've never claimed to know the answers 
But I've faked it pretty well And I've walked straight through the valley 
Full of shadows and of death 
And I've learned a lot of lessons 
But they haven't killed me yet And I lost it all, I tried to make it through my pain 
And I lost it all, and it'll never be the same 
And right now the only thing that's left, is sadness and the shame 
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same 
I lost it all Now I've heard so many stories 
Full of sadness and regret 
And I've learned a lot of answers 
To the things I didn't get But I lost it all, I tried to make it through my pain 
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same 
And right now the only thing that's left, is sadness and the shame 
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same 
I lost it all Now somewhere in the darkness 
There shines a little light 
A chance for me to be forgiven 
But I couldn't get it right I lost it all, I tried to make it through my pain 
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same 
'Cause right now the only thing that's left, is sadness and the shame 
I lost it all, and it'll never be the same 
'Cause I lost it all 
I lost it all So if I die I'll go the Heaven 
Because I spent my time in Hell 
I never claimed to know the answers 
But I've faked it pretty well
