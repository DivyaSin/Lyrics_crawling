Tommy used to work on the docks 
The Union went on strike 
He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough Gina works the diner all day 
Working for her man, she brings home her pay for love 
She brings home her pay for love You know we've got to hold on to what we've got 
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not 
We've got each other and that's a lot for love, for love Woah, we're half way there, woah, livin' on a prayer 
Won't you take my hand and we'll make it, I swear 
Woah, livin' on a prayer Tommy's got his six string in hock 
Now he's holding in 
What he used to make talk, so tough 
He'd used to make it talk, it so tough Gina dreams of running away 
When she cries every night 
Tommy whispers, it's okay, it's okay, baby it's okay Say we've got to hold on to what we've got 
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not 
We've got each other and that's a lot, for love, just give it a shot Woah, we're half way there, woah, livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear 
Woah, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer We've got to hold on ready or not 
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got Woah, we're half way there, livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear 
Woah, livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear 
Take my hand, I'll take your hand
