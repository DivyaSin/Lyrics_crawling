Twilight 
I fall in the Harbor 
Twilight 
I fall in the hills 
But here in the city 
That never sleeps 
I can fall 
Through one's fingers When the swan 
Flies to heaven 
Soaring through 
The utmost fear 
There's a feeling 
That lingers in the afterwards 
Will you ever return 
Will you ever return 
Will you ever return Twilight 
Twilight 
Twilight Twilight 
I sit at all tables 
With my candles 
And angels besides 
And I shall wait forever 
As the day turns to night 
Swallowed in the shadows that glow 
Swallowed in the shadows that glow 
Swallowed in the shadows that glow When I sought out a light 
And I knew darkness swallowed 
I beseech, come to me 
All alone, come to me Twilight
