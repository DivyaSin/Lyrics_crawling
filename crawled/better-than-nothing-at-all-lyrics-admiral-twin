I'm a bitter pill on your tongue, but I tell you 
I'm better than nothing at all 
I go down as smooth as a nail or a memory 
Drowning in alcohol You're afraid of the outside 
You're afraid of the outside creeping in 
You don't really want me, but you'd better believe I'm the ghost in your closet when you turn the lights out 
I'm rattling 'round through your bones 
I know all your secret designs and amusements 
I'm listening on the phone You're afraid of the outside 
You're afraid of the outside creeping in 
You don't really want me, but you'd better believe 
I'm better than nothing at all 
I'm better than nothing at all I'm the rock at the bottom of where you are falling 
And when we kiss you'll be there 
I'm the thorn in your side when you're trying to be cool 
(But nobody really cares) You're afraid of the outside 
You're afraid of the outside creeping in 
You don't really want me, but you'd better believe 
I'm better than nothing at all 
I'm better than nothing at all 
I'm better than nothing at all Does it matter much that I'm such a pariah? 
You're tired and bored with yourself 
We could be a royal couple of nothings 
'Cause nothing suits you well You're afraid of the outside 
You're afraid of the outside creeping in 
You don't really want me, but you'd better believe 
I'm better than nothing at all 
I'm better than nothing at all 
I'm better than nothing at all 
I'm better than nothing at all
