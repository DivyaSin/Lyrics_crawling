Like a candle burnin' bright 
Love is glowing in your eyes 
A flame to light our way 
That burns brighter every day 
Now I have you 
Nobody loves me like you do Like a leaf upon the wind 
I could find no place to land 
I dreamed the hours away 
And wondered every day 
Do dreams come true? 
Nobody loves me like you do What if I never met you? 
Where would I be right now? 
Funny how life just falls 
In place somehow You touched my heart in places 
That I never even knew 
Nobody loves me like you do I was words without a tune 
I was a song still unsung 
A poem with no rhyme 
A dancer out of time 
But now there's you 
Nobody loves me like you do What if I never met you? 
Where would I be right now? 
Funny how life just falls 
In place somehow You touched my heart in places 
That I never even knew 
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me 
Nobody loves me like you do 
Nobody loves me like you do
