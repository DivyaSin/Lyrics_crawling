Busy hanging curtains 
Children in the way 
Woh! That's what the future holds with me 
Don't you want to stay? Better talk to Billy 
His doggie died today 
Woh! That's what the future holds with me 
Don't you want to stay? Chorus: 
Don't you won't to stay? 
Woh! Don't you want to stay? 
That's what the future holds with me 
Don't you want to stay? Sundays in the meadow 
See the children play 
Who! That's what the future holds with me 
Don't you want to stay?
