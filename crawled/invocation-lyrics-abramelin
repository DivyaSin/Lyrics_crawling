Long has thou dwelt in darkness 
Incarcerated, bitter, alone 
A ghoulish shade of decay 
The merciful earth should always hide [Unverified] Freedom shall be yours though master 
For soon the rite shall commence 
The brilliant moons stares in anticipation 
For she knows of the terror to come I stand at the cliff's edge, alone in the night 
The hour draws near as the planets align 
The ocean blazes in the spectral moonlight 
Distant peels of thunder sound from a far horizon I raise my hands to the sky above 
The power surges, raging through my body 
I invoke you, I scream your name 
My muscles spasm and I fall to the ground My thoughts become confused 
The cold hand of fear clutches at my soul 
This is not what I wanted 
No banishing to send you back [Unverified] Scrambling madly through the blackness 
Regurgitated from the depths of hate 
Your awesome manifestation leaves me aghast 
Appearing in all your putrid glory Retribution time for me is now 
As it is for mankind unbeknownst 
A world annihilated by 
The opening of the master's eye
