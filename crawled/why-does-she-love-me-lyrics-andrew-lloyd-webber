One more 
Oh, buddy, don't you think you've had enough? 
It's practically morning already 
One more, I said 
Alright, alright My shift is over anyway, so let's settle the bill, okay? 
Jeez, you're in a bad way ain't you? 
Worse than most that end up here 
Here's the morning shift, maybe he'll know what to do with you Yes, what to do with me 
That's the question, isn't it? 
That's always been the question 
Ever since the beginning She looks for sympathy 
I give her sorrow 
She asks for honesty 
I've none to borrow She needs my tender kiss 
She begs it off me 
I give her ugliness 
Why does she love me? She yearns for higher things 
Things I can't give her 
The rush that music brings 
I can't deliver And even when she sings 
And soars above me 
I try to clip her wings 
Why does she love me? One more drink, sir 
That's what I need 
Don't you think, sir? 
Leave the hurt behind Do you hear me? 
Another drink She wants the man I was 
Husband and father 
At least, she thinks she does 
She needn't bother Beneath this mask I wear 
There's nothing of me 
Just horror, shame, despair 
Why does she love me? How 'bout you, sir? 
Tell me what am I to do, sir? 
Leave the hurt behind Morning, Bernie, coffee please 
Hurry up before I freeze 
I'll just take it black Mother said, I'd find you here 
Miss Giry 
Do you know where you are? 
Hell, I imagine Around here they call it suicide hall 
It's where people end up 
When they don't know where else to go The hopeless, the desperate 
The good place to step off the side 
Of the pier and quietly vanish 
You seem to be a regular 
Me? 
I come here to swim This town is coarse and cold and mean 
It's hard to keep your conscience clean 
Faceless in the crowd 
Anything's allowed And so I come at dawn each day 
Come to wash it all away 
Sink into the sea, blue and cool and kind 
Let it set me free, let the past unwind 
Leave the hurt behind You should never have come to America 
It's not a place for people like you and Christine 
It's too easy to forget who you are and where you belong 
That's why Mother says you must leave here 
Now, take your wife and the boy and go Leave? 
What about tonight? 
The concert, the money? 
Am I to just run away from him? 
When the sun rises tomorrow 
We can all start again, clean Sail across the sea 
Put us out of mind 
Close your eyes and flee 
Let yourself stay blind 
Leave this place behind
