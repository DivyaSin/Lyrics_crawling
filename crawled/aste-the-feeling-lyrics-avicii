It feels good, in my heart, in my soul, 
When you're right here beside me 
I don't ever want this day to end We can watch the waves, have a Coke 
And you sit here beside me 
Take a little long my heart again 
So we can feel whatever you feel 
Together be real, together and No one can stop me when I taste that feeling 
Nothing could ever bring me down 
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling 
Nothing could ever bring me down You make it easier to sing it 
You make it easier to sing it Feels good as we stand on the shore 
And now our hearts are jumping 
Grab another Coke and let's dive in 
Oh, my love, there's a song in my soul 
When you are around me 
You make it easier to sing it 
So we can feel whatever you feel 
Together be real, together at No one can stop me when I taste that feeling 
Nothing could ever bring me down 
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling 
Nothing could ever bring me down With every fading sunset 
We see the stars aligned 
We make the simple moments last for a lifetime 
So, we can feel forever 
You and me, together 
We stay free forever 
And be real together No one can stop me when I taste that feeling 
Nothing could ever bring me down 
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling 
Nothing could ever bring me down 
You make it easier to sing it 
You make it easier to sing it
