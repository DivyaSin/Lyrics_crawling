Fool in an apple tree, far from reality 
Writing a symphony for you, but I know 
Somewhere in central park, choirs of dogsll bark 
Harmony in the dark, for you Stilettos in the streetll tap a rhythm for two 
And coppers on the beatll drum debut avenue 
The wind thats whirling down the block 
Is humming rhapsody in blue for you, just you Fool in a paradise, takes off a bad disguise 
No need to analyze for you, but I know 
Down by the theatre lights, lovers whove lost the right 
Sing away lonely nights for you Stilettos in the streetll tap a rhythm for two 
And coppers on the beatll drum debut avenue 
The wind thats whirling down the block 
Is humming rhapsody in blue for you, just you Thunder, lightning in the skies that makes him wonder, 
Who could hypnotize him under too, for you, but I know Fool in a dream machine, wondering where hes been 
He only dreams a dream for you, but I know 
Pigeons that fly around, are dancing to the sound 
Of an orchestra underground for you Stilettos in the streetll tap a rhythm for two 
And coppers on the beatll drum debut avenue 
The wind thats whirling down the block 
Is humming rhapsody in blue for you, just you, just you, for you
