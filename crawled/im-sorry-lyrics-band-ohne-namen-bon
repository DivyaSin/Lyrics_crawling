lyrics: G. Gross, C. Capek 
music: G. Gross, C. Capek, G. Raschke I'm sorry about the man on the street with no place to sleep, 
Beggin' for small change and something to eat, 
And I'm sorry about the people who walk by with shame in their eyes, 
And still they're too greedy to spare one dime. I'm sorry about the people who think that they deserve more than others, 
That their life is worth more than others', 
I'm sorry for the kids looking for someone to help them 
And not just to yell at them. And I'm sorry that life isn't always what we ask for 
And I'm sorry that some always have less an some have more, 
I'm sorry about the feelings I hurt in you, 
But feelings just change. Refrain: 
And in the end (oh, I'm sorry) 
Why can't it just be the way that we want it to be 
In the end (oh, I'm sorry) 
Why can't we all stand up and all hold hands 
(I'm sorry) 
Why can't it just be the way that we want it to be 
In the end (oh, I'm sorry) I'm sorry about the kids whose parents have gone 
And now we tell them, find your own way and just hold on, 
I'm sorry about these endless discussions about war, 
Skin color, sex, religion and more, I'm sorry about the way we treat each other sometimes, 
Or is it too much to ask that we help people and be kind? 
Sorry that the weather's not always right 
We deserve bright sunshine in our souls and our lives Sorry that life isn't always what we ask for 
And I'm sorry that some always have less an some have more, 
I'm sorry about the feelings I hurt in you, 
But feelings just change. Refrain 2 x
