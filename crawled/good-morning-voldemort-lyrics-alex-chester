Oh, oh, oh, woke up today ready to say that I'm all yours. 
Oh, oh, your battling someone who I can't beat but you will defeat that boy with the scar and we will go far, put a dark mark in the sky above. Oh, oh, oh, then I will be with the man and the snake that I love. 
CHORUS: Good morning Voldemort! The sun rises with the dark lord. How I wish you will rise for me, so just fulfill that prophesy. Good morning Voldemort! 
And when you put an end to this war, this girl's gonna wake up to see Voldemort and Me. Oh, oh, oh, you set me free when I used to be in Azkaban. 
Oh, oh, oh, if you don't love me that would be worse than the killing curse. When you split your soul, but I'll make you whole, and find all the pieces and you will see. 
Oh, oh, that I'll be your horcrux, so stick your soul inside of me. CHORUS: Good morning Voldemort! Your not Tom Riddle anymore. I lose the breath that's in my lungs, when you start speaking parceltongue. Good morning Voldemort! Now that Snape has dispatched Dumbledore, this girl's gonna wake up to see, Voldemort and me. BRIDGE: For you I would go above and beyond. You know I would love to hold your wand. We'll be together, I'm sure of that now, and we're gonna make that unbreakable vow. So, oh, oh, say you'll be mine, and my heart will fly like a hippogriff. Oh, oh, the mirror of Erised shows me you, and it shows me too. I promise you this, that a dementor's kiss would just send me running into your arms. Oh, oh, oh, I'd feel so safe like I'm under your patrons charm. CHORUS: I love you Voldemort! Though you are rotten to the core, my love is never witherin', for the true error of Slytherin. I promise Voldemort! I'll be your servant for ever more. I hope that you'll service me, when we're married we'll be Voldemort and me! 
Voldemort and me! 
Voldemort and meee-ee-ee-ee!
