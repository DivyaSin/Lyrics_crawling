Last night he called from Dallas he was havin' a beer at the Crystal Palace 
He said honey you won't be alone for long 
I got to make just one more stop to pick up a ring in Little Rock 
And I'm gonna head this semi straight for home 
Fourteen wheels a whinin' four big headlights shinin' 
Him and that semi been away too long 
Hope he don't get stop from speedin' cause I've got everything he's needin' 
Waitin' for him right here at home 
He's got that big ole engine singin' singin' my favorite song 
And I know he's headin' my way rollin' down the highway 
Tonight my baby's comin' home 
[ guitar ] 
Ten thousand miles I've missed him it's been a week since I kissed him 
And forty truckstops since I held him tight 
A million chicks and he can get 'em they want to make love and he won't let 'em 
The only thing he wants he'll get tonight 
He's got that big ole engine singin'... 
And I know he's headin' my way rollin' down the highway 
Tonight my baby's comin' home 
And I know he's headin' my way rollin' down the highway 
Tonight my baby's comin' home
