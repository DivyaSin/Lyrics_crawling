September girls 
Do so much 
And for so long 
'Till we touched 
I love you, boy 
Never mind 
I've been crying 
All the time December boys got it bad 
December boys got it bad September girls 
I don't know why 
How can I deny 
What's inside 
Even though I 
Keep away 
They will love 
All our days December boys got it bad 
December boys got it bad
