How will you 
people live without me? 
Who will bring you joy 
when I'm gone? 
'Cause I'm one funny man 
I bring the comedy 
I am the one you go to, 
to get cheered up 
Put in my movies 
Escape, if you will 
To a land of loveliness 
He doesn't have patience 
He hates so many people 
He's mad when others do well 
He hates himself 
Fuck George Simmons 
He has a medium-sized penis 
He fucked so many girls 
And yet no one remembers 
When he's done fucking them 
The girl just 
lays there and says 
I should have fucked 
Jean-Claude Van Damme instead of you 
Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah! 
George Simmons 
soon will be gone 
And he will not 
miss you people at all. 
Our relationship has 
always been strained. 
You always wanted too much 
from me, and I'm very mad at you. 
Leave me alone. 
Don't visit my grave, cocksuckers. 
Peace!
