I'd like to make special, special dedication 
To all of special, special people 
That did all special, special things 
Especially in the name of times 
In K.R West 
Can't forget slept with a W fresh 
A Big shot upon freestyle from the shit thirty pieces Let's do this for the people 
Let's make your mommas proud 2X 
Let's do this for the people 
Let's do, let's do it now Back in a day when I was a teenager 
Before I had status in a true way pager 
You go find witness in a two trap conquest 
They'll know it everywhere we wanna do this You see, you gotta understand that things going cycle 
Justin Timberlake is just a new form of Michael 
It's cold inspiration, that's the way it be 
Without a Jay Z's are probably wouldn't be no Peas So wanna do this for those that inspired me to be 
And multi faded me, to store my legacy 
I give a shut up to my man Ezze E 
A big R.I.P, cause he believed in me He put me down back in 1993 
And now I grab mic and rock the party 
I got Joys and Cheers for Pea by ease 
Pea by ease short for family, they are people Let's do this for the people 
Let's make your mommas proud 2X 
Let's do this for the people 
Let's do, let's do it now Praise with a key let me blow this track 
I gotta pay homes to my P. Way back 
How will Lil' Kim are huntin' the rap game 
And now the dreams are same, but the game is changed Back in '88 before first grade 
I used to battle on the block as a people on break (yeah) 
And heavy woman puss I use to wash the bush 
Use to leave Kung Fu down in Rock n Bloom Hip Hop (?) not the key belong 
Or less then saying unity over the bar 
You want the spot when my mic is on 
I was a good life foundation filling was fun I can't go on, so I don?t get left behind 
I can't go on, so I don?t get forgot my time 
I can't go on, so I could just bless your mind 
I can't go on, for the people busting my rhyme Let's do this for the people 
Let's make your mommas proud 
Let's make your mommas proud 
Let's do this for the people 
Let's do, let's do it now Spotted In my room back in '89 
Free styling in the sub for exercising the mind 
Just cooling with my crib brand new be arise 
B.Boy and then braking and try be on a nation Digging in a placement with DJ More inpatient 
Live and direct Kono radio station 
Rockin' with a fan do it short for fez 
Mic in my hand, standing in my B-Boy stand Whoever thought that the peas will spread like a disease 
And affect a whole blow, with a poster's soul 
This is for the people that loves the P sound 
We still make the music we're holding it down This is dedicated to the Poll crush 
If it wasn't for yo, then wouldn't be us 
This is dedicated to your TFO 
Grand Master flash and burned slow Let's do this for the people 
Let's make your mommas proud 
Let's make your mommas proud

Let's do this for the people 
Let's do, let's do it now
