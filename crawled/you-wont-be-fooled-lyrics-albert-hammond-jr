Don't you give up 
And say that you're stuck 
Surrounded by foolish things 
Now that you have 
All that was bad 
I know now what I must bring 
To all my friends 
You haven't changed 
You're still think that [Chorus: ] 
You won't be fooled, by this 
You won't be fooled, by this 
You won't be fooled, by this 
You won't be fooled, by this What's left to say 
I'm on my way 
I won't know what you last said 
I'm not one that asks 
Or then what's said 
I know now that I can change And now and then 
As I close my eyes 
My foolish wisdom 
Becomes my (?)
