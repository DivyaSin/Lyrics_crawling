Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine Even though we fuss and fight 
I don't wanna live one night without you 
So what am I gonna do, baby? Sometimes we don't see eye to eye 
And I just can't tell you why but I love you 
And you know it?s true, 'cause, girl, you know Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine Even though the seasons change 
Our love remains the same 
Forever, we?ll be together And every time I try to leave 
Your love keeps calling me that's when I know 
That I can't let you go, 'cause, girl, you are mine Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine My days are incomplete 
When you're away from me 
I find it hard sometimes for me to breathe Said I need you in my life 
Beside me all the time 
Without you there's no me, 'cause you are mine Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine 
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine
