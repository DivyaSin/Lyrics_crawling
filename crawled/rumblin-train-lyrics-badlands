Just a poor boy scratchin' my back on razor's edge 
This razor's edge I call my home 
Keep my thoughts inside myself down where they're born and bled 
I'll prob'ly die by the fire I breath, yeah, yeah, yeah, I said 'Cause, in my mind this crazy boy is a runaway train 
No one's gonna steal my soul 
I bite the bullet no more Deep in my heart this crazy boy he's a rumblin' train, yeah. 
Look out babe ''cause here I come, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Rumblin' train, train. Devil's river's runnin' wild in my veins 
Kills the mind that feeds my soul 
Every night a dirty lady in a different bed 
I keep on playin' those hard-on games 
But, I've got more in my head 'Cause, in my mind this crazy boy is a runaway train 
No one's gonna steal my soul 
I bite the bullet no more Deep in my heart this crazy boy he's a rumblin' train, yeah. 
Look out babe ''cause here I come, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Rumblin' train, train. 
Rumblin' bad boy, bad boy on down All right. 
Crazy boy is a rumblin' train 
Crazy boy is a runaway train 
Crazy boy on a permanent ride tonight, yeah
