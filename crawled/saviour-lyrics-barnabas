A decree went out from Caesar 
Let the people be numbered 
Each in the town of his birth 
Let the people obey 
A young couple came 
To the city of David 
She gave birth to the Son of the Lord 
In a manger He lay Jesus of Nazareth 
God's only Son 
He gave his life as our Saviour 
Our lives have only begun The Son of God; the Son of man 
Christ Messiah 
Miracles flowed from His hands 
But His message was love 
He chose twelve from thousands 
To witness His teaching 
For He knew that He soon must return 
To His Father above Thirty pieces of silver 
And Judas betrayed Him 
They crcuified Christ on a cross 
Where everybody could see 
He died to pay for our sin 
And our salvation is free know 
"Eternal life is God's gift to the world 
If you believe in Me
