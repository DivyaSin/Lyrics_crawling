And there's no way of knowing That the love you're looking for 
Won't come too easily 
Or maybe you're too blind to see Once in a lifetime comes a lover 
All you're looking for 
Maybe I've found my perfect lover 
I've waited so long for someone like you I've waited so long 
I've waited so long for someone like you That the love you're looking for 
Won't come too easily 
Or maybe you're too blind to see
