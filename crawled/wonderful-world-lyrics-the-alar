Guys wearing gas masks are levelling their guns 
At school children singing whilst studying sums 
It a clear sign of violence 
And it's laced with heavy support 
This whole situations been dragged through the dirt 
By gargoyles and monsters and man eating birds 
Who act like the jury but you never see them stand up in court It's savage and ugly the riots unfurl 
But these are the ways of this wonderful world 
These are the ways of this wonderful world Well back at the banquet a madam meets her fate 
Whilst almost a mile from her country estate 
The helpless and homeless are dancing a ring in the rain 
Prompted by pressure from home and abroad 
Fifty five of them ministers will try to reach accord 
On some ill judged remarks concerning madam baby Lorraine It's savage and ugly the riots unfurl 
But these are the ways of this wonderful world 
These are the ways of this wonderful world Consignments of bibles and passenger planes 
Japanese funerals and gambling games 
And backers and bidders are dealing in textiles and lace 
They order revues that will salvage the state 
Guaranteed to put off and pass up that decay 
While the latest concerns are reports of a slackening pace Well it's savage and ugly the riots unfurl 
But these are the ways of this wonderful world 
These are the ways of this wonderful world (Well rock it son) Well it's savage and ugly the riots unfurl 
But these are the ways of this wonderful world 
These are the ways of this wonderful world Yes these are the ways of this wonderful world 
So don't be a panicking haven't you heard 
That these are the ways of this wonderful world 
This wonderful world 
(One more time) Violence 
Agression Homeless Helpless 
Hey wonderful
