I see their faces in the street 
People I knew once, but none of them know me 
Everybody's talking 'bout that new shit I see their faces but they don't see me 
Reminds me of some lost melody 
Everybody's talking 'bout that new feeling Familiar voices call my name 
This way, that way, I can't seem to keep my head straight (No...) 
I tell myself the end is near 
Then I remember a sadder story 
Is it what I've always known? Gentle I go 
To that good night 
Say it ain't, no, say it ain't so. (No...) Gentle I go 
Into that good night (And....) 
It ain't so different, it ain't so different (No...) Gentle I go 
Into that good night 
Say it ain't, no, say it ain't so. (No...) Gentle I go 
Into that good night 
It ain't so different, it ain't so different (No...) So different (No..)
