Wildfire turned out the will of fate 
Brought us together 
Lighting a dream that we thought would stay 
And burn forever But love don't die when goodbye 
Comes crashing through the door 
It just hangs on after so long I still see your picture inside my mind 
Like a flash of light when I close my eyes And just like that you're right back 
Swept up in a rush of love inside my arms 
Like you were never gone Runaway hearts can take time to heal 
When love's unstoppable 
Can you believe in everything you feel 
It seems impossible Hard to let go when you're so close 
To landing on the moon 
It's too bad it didn't last I still see your picture inside my mind 
Like a flash of light when I close my eyes And just like that you're right back 
Swept up in a rush of love inside my arms 
Like you were never gone Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh 
Crashing through the door 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh 
Landing on the mo-o-oon I still see your picture inside my mind 
Like a flash of light when I close my eyes And just like that you're right back 
Swept up in a rush of love inside my arms 
Like you were never gone 
Like you were never gone
