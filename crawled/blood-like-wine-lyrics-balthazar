How long since I got some sleep 
How long since she grew her hair to keep 
The night from getting colder for 
The owl living upon her shoulder Cause one way or the other she will drink my blood like wine 
The only question left is whether that day the horns will sound 
And one way or the other it will keep me dragging on 
For hell knows how long And now the carnival band is gone 
This land reaching from the riverside where it begins to the hour where it ends 
It belongs to me or at least that's what she pretends And one way or the other she will drink my blood like wine 
The only question left is whether that day the horns will sound 
And one way or the other it will keep me dragging on 
For hell knows how long Like the oldest was sent ahead of the other 
In the middle of a small town where everybody sleeps with friend and enemy one after the other 
Yeah baby, that's where we were born for each other Raise your glass to the nighttime and the ways 
To choose a mood and have it replaced [x6]
