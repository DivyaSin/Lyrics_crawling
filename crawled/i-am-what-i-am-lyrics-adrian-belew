"Friends seen an` unseen...to you that are ridin` along 
In your automobile...to you that are sitting at you table 
I greet you with the holy word `Peace`... 
For with my infinite mind I thinks constructively... 
And I`m able to draw whatsaever I want into my immediate 
Surroundin`...for yo` minds are my mind 
And my mind is yo` mind and I`m sendin` out 
My mind to you, you, an` you... 
You`ve got to remain to bein` yourself...you cannot be 
Nobody else, it ain`t no use tryin` bein` no whirlwind 
An` uh, jumpin` here an` an` playin` checkers with 
Your own life, that ain`t gonna work, baby... 
Now repeat these words behind me: 
`I am what I am`...now that`s all you are... 
You are what you believe you are...stretch out 
So many of you all in Radioland, you`re not stretchin` out... 
But I want to say one thing to you today...it makes no 
Differen` who you are, what you`re doin`, what you`re 
Tryin` to do or want to do, repeat these words 
`I am what I am and that`s all I am...is what I am`... 
That`s all I, look, that, that`s all I am is what I am...and I`m it 
Make no differen` whether it`s in the mornin`, 
The evenin`, or in the night time... 
Hair breakin` out, bald headed...it`s the same thing... 
You are what you believe you are 
`Cause some of you all are sittin` there right now, 
Amen, an` tell if you had a necktie on yo`, on now, right now, 
A whirlwind would come along an` choke you to death, 
That`s how bad luck some of you all in... 
Some of you all in such a bad luck right now 
That you couldn`t hit a barn with a baseball bat... 
Some of you all in such a bad luck right now, amen, 
If you was to sit down by-a-by-men, by a pond, amen, 
Somethin` would come up an` stick ya` 
You just in that bad a` luck... 
I am what I am...now repeat this behind me: 
`I am what I am and that is all I am and I am it`... 
Yes, I know what you`re sayin`...stretch out...oh, yes...stretch out"
