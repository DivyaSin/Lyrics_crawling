I will not bear to watch 
While the animated sadness releases 
A cyanide touch for us 
So utterly devastating its measure glides 
The breath that is born of behemoth size Unveiled exhumed when everything twists into form 
For you to see all in a perilous mourn 
With long relentless devotion 
Grant of these open wounds and this heartless rip 
The drains are waiting for the loss of your blood Enter all simple solutions 
The center of this wasteland 
So barren and bleak, so feeble and weak 
With a quick flash of ice in your chest 
Like falling into a mine field face first Is this the snap of your filament 
Or the grimmest devout? 
Is this the snap of your neck 
Rung red and hung in this rope? I will not let this subside 
For the still beating heart that is buried inside 
The depths of old to the births of war The weak will beg, swaggering in descent 
The weak will beg, of instant revelations 
The weak will beg, in risk to repent 
The weak will beg for death again and again and again The shattered screams 
Of a people unfulfilled 
With the sight, with the sound 
The reign of steel, their blood unbound Is this the snap of your filament 
Or the grimmest devout? 
Is this the snap of your neck 
Rung red and hung in this rope? I will not let this subside 
For the still beating heart that is buried inside 
The depths of old to the births of war The weak will beg, swaggering in descent 
The weak will beg, of instant revelation 
The weak will beg, in risk to repent 
The weak will beg for death again and again and again The weak will beg, swaggering in descent 
The weak will beg, of instant revelations 
The weak will beg, in risk to repent 
The weak will beg for death again and again and again 
And again and again and again
