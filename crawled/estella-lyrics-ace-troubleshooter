Estella steps in silence 
Her every movement caught 
Encased in gilded memory Here it comes again 
Anticipation racing through me 
Thrilling with emotion 
You still me Estella, Estella you 
You're missing all you see 
I'm missing you Estella, Estella you dream 
You're missing all you see 
I'm missing you Estella moves in shadows 
Her every whisper caught 
Exhale and draw it in again When everything gets lost in the twilight 
I'll be waiting 
You keep me guessing 
You enigma, you dream Estella, Estella you 
You're missing all you see 
I'm missing you Estella, Estella you dream 
You're missing all you see 
I'm missing you my sweet Wide eyed, weak kneed 
Stare me through my soul 
You pierce me I know, we need 
Nothing short of holding, nothing back 
Come down to me 
And I'll show you, you mean worlds to me, you do Fare thee well, my love 
The last time in a whisper 
She whispered back Fare thee well, my love 
Believe me when I say 
I love you madly, deeply always Estella, Estella you 
You're missing all you see 
I'm missing you Estella, Estella you dream 
You're missing all you see 
I'm missing you
