Uno, dos, tres, quatros........arriba! I've seen you walking down the street 
What's that big dog by your feet 
Whatever it is, it could do with a beating 
It looks to me like....... a puerto rican A chick like you it's oh so rare 
You get off on his greasy hair 
You got a smart apartment, you got central heating 
Why go waste it on a puerto rican I'm gonna light up a beacon on a puerto rican 
Strike a matchstick on his head 
Light up a beacon on a puerto ric 
You gonna watch me smile if he drops down dead (yeah!) Me and the boys don't think it's right 
That you stayed out with him all night 
But don't go making such a fuss 
Come and burn him up with us! Well I'm here standing at tierra del fuego 
While you're out, playing with that dago 
With that girl I'm gonna make him cry 
I won't let that dago by! Arriba
