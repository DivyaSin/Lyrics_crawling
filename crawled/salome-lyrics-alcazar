I watch the sun rays always dancing on the clouds 
I share that feeling healing deep inside my heart 
But when the night falls, crew calls bells ring in the dome 
You'll hear me whisper softly, Salome come home Life is fantastic, drastic, charming wide appeal 
Life can be magic, tragic but always comes for real 
Go through the motion, notion, spend your life alone 
But don't destroy your chances, Salome come home I want to feel you, help you carry on 
Come let me heal you, Salome come home 
Salome come home, Salome come home I wrote you a letter, better tell you how I feel 
I stay so lonely only to keep your life surreal 
You may escape your home ground go down on your own 
To concrete jungle drum sounds, Salome come home I called the monastery, asked to hear your voice 
I've seen your new sun fairy but gurus leave no choice 
So put the past behind you, it's time to let things go 
And take your dearest, nearest, Salome come home I want to feel you help you carry on 
Come let me heal you, Salome come home 
Salome come home, Salome come home I count the sun rays always dancing on the clouds 
I wish that feeling, healing to reach into your heart 
But when the night falls, crew calls, bells ring in the dome 
I keep on whisper softly, Salome come home Life is fantastic, drastic charming wide appeal 
Life can be magic, tragic, but always comes for real 
Go through the motion, notion, spend your life alone 
But don't destroy your chances, Salome come home 
Salome come home, Salome come home, Salome come home
