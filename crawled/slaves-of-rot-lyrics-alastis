A new perception of the world 
Appears in your mind 
And you retrieve your instincts 
On your decision 
Open gates on a new truth 
You understand 
You're only temporary 
In this matter's body Come on, slaves of rot 
Kneeling in front 
Of your torturer Don't you feel that 
Through the hatred 
The light materializes 
From your cries of pain 
It comes alive 
On your distresses it feasts Come on, slaves of rot 
Kneeling in front 
Of your torturer In each being 
I guess the death 
And if by mistake 
You pass my way 
Don't expect any fellow 
And get ready for 
Worst anxieties Come on, slaves of rot 
Kneeling in front 
Of your torturer Ill feast on the blackness 
Of your soul 
Ill spit on your 
Lowest supplications 
No ending, no beginning, I draw 
My force from your death
