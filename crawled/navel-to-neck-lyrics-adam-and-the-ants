Give me your hand here is mine 
Better in the open 
It's showtime let's call the tune He's her baby boy 
Navel to neck 
Give me your mouth 
I want to kiss you Something deep inside me waits 
You're giving up your daughters 
But perfection is so dull He's her baby boy 
Navel to neck 
Give me your mouth 
I want to kiss you That's the way the honey goes 
Sweeter than a toy 
From his tippy to his toes 
He's he baby boy Every inch of you I prize 
Your body is a vision 
And all the while look in your eyes
