There was a time I said I loved you, 
A time I thought you cared 
A time when things were flowing, 
But now I'm lost for words I tried so hard to understand, 
In silence and emotion 
You take my smiles away from me 
With your careless notions Will you bring me down 
Will you lift me up 
Will you lift me up [Chorus] 
I want to be me 
When the night is fading, 
Morning's waking Didn't do what you were supposed to 
Do when you said you would do 
Holding on while all along 
I was scared to say goodbye Those days have gone, 
The time has come now 
For me to draw the line 
My mind is made up baby 
I won't play your game [Chorus] Will you bring me down 
Will you lift me up I want to be me
