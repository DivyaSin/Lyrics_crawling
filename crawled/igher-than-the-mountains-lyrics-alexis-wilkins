CHORUS 
I feel higher than the mountains 
Higher than the sky 
Higher than the sun 
Because of you and I 
We can make a difference 
with hope, love and peace 
Think about tomorrow 
So we can live free The sun shines today 
Let the birds sing 
And the trees grow 
Without our help that may not be 
Leave Mother Nature 
So she can grow in peace CHORUS 
I feel higher than the mountains 
Higher than the sky 
Higher than the sun 
Because of you and I 
We can make a difference 
with hope, love and peace 
Think about tomorrow 
So we can live free Make a ring of friendship 
Sing with all of us 
Kids, animals, trees and earth 
And protect it from harm 
So our spirits can breathe free 
Yeah, we can make a difference 
if we keep hope and try CHORUS 
I feel higher than the mountains 
Higher than the sky 
Higher than the sun 
Because of you and I 
We can make a difference 
with hope, love and peace 
Think about tomorrow 
So we can live free Chorus (Softly) 
Chorus (Normal)
