I want to date you maybe 
I want to take you out 
I want to wine and dine you-oo 
I want to twist and twist and shout 
I want you hard in my arms 
So soft on my bed 
You get the keys to my heart 
When you wear that sweet dress 
(You know, the short one) 
You're so physical, physical for me 
You're just too physical, physical, for me I want your rough house baby 
I want this night in your ear 
Let me feel you danger 
I want to make this feeling clear 
I want the touch of your charms 
The heat of your breath 
I want to say all those things 
(Those dirty things) 
That would be better unsaid
