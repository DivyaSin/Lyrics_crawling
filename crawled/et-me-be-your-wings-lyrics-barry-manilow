Let me be your wings 
Let me be your only love 
Let me take you far beyond the stars Let me be your wings 
Let me lift you high above 
Everything we're dreaming of will soon be ours. Anything that you desire, 
Anything at all. 
Everyday I'll take you higher 
And I'll never let you fall. Let me be your wings 
Leave behind the world you know 
For another world of wondrous things. 
We'll see the universe and dance on Saturn's rings. 
Fly with me and I will be your wings. Anything that you desire, 
Anything at all. 
Everyday I'll take you higher 
And I'll never let you fall. (You will be my wings) 
Let me be your wings 
(You will be my only love) 
Get ready for a world of wondrous things 
(Wondrous things are sure to happen) 
We'll see the universe and dance on Saturn's rings. Heaven isn't too far. 
Heaven is where you are, 
Stay with me and let me be your wings.
