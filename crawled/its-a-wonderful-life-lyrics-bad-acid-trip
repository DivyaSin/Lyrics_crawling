MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR MARKET - THEY'RE OUR PRISIONS 
KEEP THE MENICE OFF THE STREETS - WE DON'T NEED THEM 
BUILD BIGGER BETTER PRISIONS - FOR OUR CHILDREN 
BEAT'EM, BASH'EM, FUCKING RAPE THEM - HAIL OUR SYSTEM 
THEY DECLARE WAR ON DRUGS - WHAT A JOKE 
FUCKING WHORES AND SMOKING DOPE - CLINTON TOKES 
C.I.A. SELLS THE CRACK - IT'S AN INDUSTRY 
THEY ALLOW ALL THE DRUGS - IN THE COUNTRY 
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON 
HOPES OF A FUTURE ARE GONE 
USING OUR TAXES FOR BOMBS 
WHEN CHI;LDREN LIVE IN SLUMS 
THERE'S NO MONEY FOR SCHOOLS 
THE POOR ARE TREATED LIKE MULES 
EQUEAL OPPERTUNITY IS BULLSHIT 
WHEN THE RICH RULE ALL MARKETS 
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE 
WORK REAL HARD AND BREAK YOUR BACK - YOU'RE STILL POOR 
PIMP YOUR ASS FOR A LOAF OF BREAD - YOU'RE A WHORE 
POLITICIANS LIE AND CHEAT - ALL THE TIME 
THEY'LL FUCK YOUR MOTHER FOR A NICKEL - OR A DIME 
BUY THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEIR FOOD - THEY'RE THE BEST 
EAT THE CHEMICALS AND HORMONES - GROW A BREAST 
RAPE THE LAND AND POLLUTE THE SEAS - JUST FOR PROFIT 
KILLING MAN WITH THEIR DISEASE - CAUSING HAVOC 
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE
