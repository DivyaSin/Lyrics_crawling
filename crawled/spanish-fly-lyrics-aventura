I mean, you see her over in the club over there homie, 
We ain't talk like in weeks mans I need you to go there and translate Yea I can do that for you babes, lets make it happen I ain't too tough to tell her I cried 
El llora por ti 
Ever since ella left my side 
Why el se siente tan solo 
When I'm with my homies I play Mr. tough guy 
He's just playing on that one only part 
When I'm all alone all alone all I do is cry my spanish fly [Chorus] 
Why llora, llora, llora, llora, llora 
Spanish fly chick got me tripping got my heart skipping skipping 
Why llora, llora, llora, llora, llora 
There won't be ain't no dancing tonight feel like I ain't got no rhythm tonight 
Why llora, llora, llora, llora, llora 
Spanish fly chick got me tripping got my heart skipping skipping 
Why llora, llora, llora, llora, llora 
There won't be ain't no dancing tonight feel like I ain't got no rhythm tonight
