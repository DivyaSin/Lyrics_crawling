So all alone 
Little girl blue 
You tell me the tale 
And stand there crying I'm here for you 
You know that I care 
Listening to you 
Inside I'm dying Your heart may be breaking 
But my heart is breaking too He doesn't care if you're all alone 
But I do 
He doesn't care if you come back home 
But I do, yes I do 
Why can't you feel it too I'm your best friend 
A brother you say 
Hurting me so 
To see your sorrow Knew all along 
He's not for you 
Sadness and tears 
But tomorrow You'll see how I need you 
And maybe you'll need me too He doesn't care if he breaks your heart 
But I do 
He doesn't care if you fall apart 
But I do Oh, don't throw your love away 
On someone who doesn't deserve it 
If you belonged to me I'd love you more each day 
I'd take you and make you believe what I say
