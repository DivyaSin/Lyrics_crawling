I heard you got a filthy heart, 
Heartbreaking as a perfect dart, 
I though she was my sun, 
Wish I knew what I said wasn't getting through, 
Wish I knew it was dead when I looked at you, 
Neither did I know what was coming, 
Neither did I know I was free, You got a filthy heart, 
You got a filthy heart, 
You like to love me through hatred, 
Make me feel like shit, 
I always wanted to say it, 
Your such a bitch, 
You got a filthy heart, 
You got a filthy heart, 
You got a filthy heart, heart, Just another one that felt so hard, 
Just another one that's come and gone, 
I though she was the one, 
Wish I knew what I said wasn't gettin' through, 
Wish I knew it was dead when I looked at you, 
Neither did I know what was coming, 
Neither did I know I was free, You got a filthy heart, 
You got a filthy heart, 
You like to love me through hatred, 
Make me feel like shit, 
I always wanted to say it, 
Your such a bitch, 
You got a filthy heart, 
You got a filthy heart, 
You got a filthy heart, heart, Take your pretty wreckless life, 
Take these words and come back right, 
I see through you, 
You got a filthy heart, 
You got a filthy heart, You like to love me through hatred, 
Make me feel like shit, 
I always wanted to say it, 
Your such a bitch, 
You got a filthy heart,
