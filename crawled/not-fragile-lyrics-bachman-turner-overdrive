Comin' to you cross country 
Hoping boogie's still allowed 
You ask do we play heavy music 
Well, are thunderheads just another cloud, 
And we do 
Not fragile, straight at you Then we vanish to the night 
Still in your ears but out of sight. Not fragile. 
Don't think we feel hurt or wounded 
Or our egos are showing through 
Its our world that's been disrupted 
And our strength reflects from you 
Well it's true 
Not fragile over you Try us when you're getting down 
Feelin' high or just hangin' round. Not fragile. 
The times we travel in our lives 
Will make us hard and give us drive 
We may seem distant most of the time 
But many thoughts are still on our minds. Not fragile.
