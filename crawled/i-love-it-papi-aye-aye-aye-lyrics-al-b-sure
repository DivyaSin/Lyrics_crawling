I like when you receive me 
You keep me safe and warm 
When your body starts to tremble 
It's like a quiet storm Girl, I love it when you wait for me 
And hold on 'til its time 
Girl, then we reach the peak and the explosion hits 
Girl, you blow my mind I love it when you talk to me and say 
(Aye, aye, aye) 
I love it when you close to me it 
(Feels so right) I love it when you creep with me 
(Creep that way) 
And I love it when we moan too 
(Ooh, feels right) All you want from me is just to love you right 
And never do you wrong 
I love playing in your box when it's late at night 
To our favorite song 
(When I get this feeling) I watch your body in the shower 
Step into the beauty light 
Before you dry off, step into the room 
Damn, girl, your body's so right Girl, I'm looking forward to tonight 
'Cause papi chuloo's gonna make you feel so right 
Mami, I don't think tonight I hesitate 
Lady, you should feel free tonight 
Just scream my name, ohh I love it when you talk to me and say 
(Aye, aye, aye) 
I love it when you close to me it 
(Feels so right) I love it when you creep with me 
(Creep that way) 
And I love it when we moan too 
(Ooh, feels right)
