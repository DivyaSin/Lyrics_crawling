Chorus: 
You know that seein' is believing 
Don't say you love me if you're leavin' 
You know that seein' is believing 
Don't say you love me if you're leavin' Suddenly you up and take your love away 
Like a dream, it happened all in just one day 
Could it be that I was running out of time 
Is it me, or are you playing with my mind 
Don't you know that everything you said 
Is messin' with my head 
And mama said {Chorus} Ooh ooh wee 
Time has helped, me open up my eyes to you 
Now I see, you're not worth what you put me through 
Could it be that you were running out of time 
Now I see that you were playing with my mind 
Don't you know that nothing that you said 
Is messing with my head 
And mama said
