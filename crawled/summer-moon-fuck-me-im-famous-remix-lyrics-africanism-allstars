Summer moon on your face 
For the wind blows so sweet 
Come away, come away 
Dance with me Let us dance to forget 
Let us dance to remember 
All those days of last summer Summer moon on your face 
For the wind blows so sweet 
Come away, come away 
Dance with me Let us dance to forget 
Let us dance to remember 
All those days of last summer
