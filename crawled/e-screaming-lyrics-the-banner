the past is never, so far they won't still come back 
burning and hating and biding their time 
until they find their weakness 
they've waited and their time has come at last 
to overcome and break you, drag you back 
the gate has been opened the screaming are calling 
bolting through shadows till they are upon you 
waiting in hiding, chomping the bit 
you've stumbled and fallen and they smell your bleeding 
you rise from your knees try to get to your feet 
to run from the breathing the screaming have found you 
the dive from the trees descending upon you 
the stench of rotting burns your vision 
the time has come - to run is futile 
claws dig into your legs 
they've tasted blood, their talons claw at you 
now to see what your made of 
punching and fighting 
crys for help, for help go unheard 
the screaming the crying 
the demons they surround 
tasting your own blood 
it spills and soaks the ground 
you plead unto deaf ears 
choke on blood as you're torn wide 
the life now it pours out from you 
and blackness fills your eyes.
