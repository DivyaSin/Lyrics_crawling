I am a daimon among twelve 
You say "you will", I say "I am" 
The ouranic and the cthonic 
Your world will crumble at our feet I can destroy all of earth 
My mighty sea may drown you all 
Give us sacrifice, keep the right 
And forever you'll have day and night None defies me in my domain 
Nor do I mock my brothers names 
I am one in the cosmic order 
Divided in fate and honour The sea is my weapon 
The honorless my foe 
The water you are upon 
Is the trident, conos' son
