Theres something I gotta say to you 
But im so afraid of what you'll doo 
Ohhhh I'll just admit this to you now 
That Im stuck on you like glue somehow Don't wanna feel so cold inside 
I wanna feel the warmth that I feel with you all the time Surrounding me just like the wind 
Cuz youre the one who makes me sing Help me find myself like how I found you oh 
I need you so we can live happily too ohh 
I just want you I wanna go out with you tonight 
A picnic with candlelight 
I might just hold you tight Tell me you wanna be my queen 
If not its ok a princess seems just my type I promise I'll be there tonight 
I'll keep you warm in winter's white 
And in the summer walks on beach sound nice 
I want you now to talk with on the phone for hours at a time 
Baby I just want you to be mine all mine i wanna be ur valentine ur Christmas wish ur pickup line 
I wanna be the one who knows about ur friends and foes and the tv shows you love 
Look above the stars spell out ur name with an exclamation point at the end of the day ur the one who makes me say
