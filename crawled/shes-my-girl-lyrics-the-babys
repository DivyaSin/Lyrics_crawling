Me and my girl we don't like rules 
living hard and fast 
Doin' what we want to do 
We're as free as the wind we choose 
We got each other so we never lose 
My heart is on a one way trip 
Flyin' higher 
Kind of feels like a rocket ship 
She's the finest I've ever seen 
Sometimes we're livin' in a two way dream 
She's my 
She's my girl 
She's my 
She's my world 
Her friends tell her that I'm a fool 
She doesn't listen 
She knows what I'm trying to do 
We're as free as the wind we choose 
We got each other so we never lose 
Some guys would like to take my place 
They try to steal her 
But she winds up laughing in their face 
She's the finest I've ever seen 
Sometimes we're livin' in a two way dream 
She's my 
She's my girl 
She's my 
She's my world 
She always takes it to a different place 
She makes it harder 
And we always wind up face to lace 
She turns me on when she goes down 
She always turns my head around 
She's my 
She's my girl yeah 
She's my 
She's my world 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
She's my 
She's my girl 
She's my 
She's my world 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
She's my baby 
She's my girl 
She's my 
She's my world 
I love ya 
I love ya 
I love ya so 
She's my baby 
She's my girl 
She's my 
She's my world 
She's my baby 
She's my girl 
She's my 
She's my world
