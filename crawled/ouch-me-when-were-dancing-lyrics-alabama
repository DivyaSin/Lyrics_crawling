Play us a song we can slow dance 
On we want to hold each other 
Play us a groove so we hardly move 
Just let our hearts be together Oh baby 'cause it feels so good 
When we're close like this 
Whisper in my ear 
And let me steal a kiss Come on touch me when we're dancing 
You know you've got that lovin' touch 
Oh touch me when we're dancing 
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' in love Tonight's the night and it feels so right 
What my heart's saying to me 
You're the one and I've waited so long 
So let your love flow through me Oh baby 'cause it feels so good 
We can be this close 
You've got me up so high 
I could fly coast to coast Come on touch me when we're dancing 
You know you've got that lovin' touch 
Oh touch me when we're dancing 
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' in love Oh touch me when we're dancing 
You know you've got that lovin' touch 
Oh touch me when we're dancing 
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' Feel you when I'm fallin' in love 
Touch me when we're dancing 
You know you've got that lovin' touch 
Touch me when we're dancing I want to feel you when I'm fallin' 
All day and all of the night 
Touch me when we're dancing 
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' Feel you when I'm fallin' in love 
Touch me when we're dancing 
Touch me when we're romancing 
Touch me when we're dancing
