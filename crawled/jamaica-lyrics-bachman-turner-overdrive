When will these dark clouds disappear from view 
When will the sun begin to shine 
When will I once again be near to you 
When will I know for sure you're mine Dreaming of those Jamaican nights 
Longing to hold you 
Jamaica take me away 
Take me away with you 
Jamaica, I'm wasting away 
Take me away with you 
Jamaica take me away 
Take me away with you 
Jamaica, I'm wasting away 
Take me away with you When will these dark days disappear again 
When will I finally see the light 
How long must I wait 
To have you here my friend 
I want to be with you tonight Dreaming of those Jamaican nights 
Longing to hold you 
Jamaica take me away 
Take me away with you 
Jamaica, I'm wasting away 
Take me away with you 
Jamaica take me away 
Take me away with you 
Jamaica, I'm wasting away 
Take me away with you
