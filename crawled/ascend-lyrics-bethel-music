Come let us see our Lord and King 
He's reigning in glory 
Lift up your eyes all earth and sky 
His Kingdom is coming From glory to glory 
We will arise We will ascend the hill of the Lord 
And we will declare His holy word 
With clean hands and pure hearts 
With clean hands and pure hearts 
We will see God We fix our eyes, we give our lives 
Our hope is in heaven 
So let us run, we have overcome 
Now and forever
