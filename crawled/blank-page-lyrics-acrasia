Nobody pays attention 
Yet Im searching for someone 
that would probably accept me 
Im now in a hurry 
To have you daily Still I am a blank and a plain page 
Still I want to let you fill each 
Come on early come on early Make up your mind to hold the pen 
Share your life then 
to shelter mine as well 
Be in a hurry 
To marry me Still I am a blank and a plain page 
Still I want to let you fill each 
Come on early come on early
