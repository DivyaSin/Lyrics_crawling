Emmett til lEmmett till, he was just a child in those hills 
Emmett till Emmett till, he was just a child in those hills 
Had dreams and hopes for the future, as every young boy should, as every young boy should, as every young boy would Emmett till Emmett till, just a boy of 14 years 
Emmett till Emmett till, cried a lifetime of tears 
He'd wake up every morning, to the thrill of each dawn 
Had dreams and hopes for the future, as every young boy should, as every young boy should, as every young boy would In the summer of 55', Mamie Till told her only son, 'Segregations over, but you take care my precious one' 
Went to visit his family, out near the Tallahatchie bridge 
Had dreams and hopes for the future, as every young boy should, 
Had dreams and hopes for the future, as every young boy would He was just a young boy, he stood tall in his own skin 
The preacher said the boy he stood tall like a man 
Emmett lost his life, in the name of hate 
You know the penalty varies, from race to race 
They(the killers) live a dark life, behind the farce of the law 
That protects weak men that took the life of a child 
Men with no heart, men with no soul, not a thread of remorse,no not a thread of remorse
