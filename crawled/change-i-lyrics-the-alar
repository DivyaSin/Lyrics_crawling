Change upon faces 
Changing hands 
Change in my father 
And my fathers land Change, change 
Change, change, change, change, change Change in the weather 
And it flies through a flag 
Change in the places 
I knew as a lad Change, change 
Change, change, change, change, change Change on the mountain 
Where green was turned black 
Change on the valleys 
That take it all back 
Change in a worker 
With sweat on his hands 
Condemned by a future 
To the no mans land Change in the rivers 
Once clean, flowing fast 
Made sad and dirty 
By the tears of man 
Change at my ankles 
Holding me back 
Change like an icon 
Beckoning fast Change, change 
Change, change, change, change, change
