Our Christmas bonus 
Was spared with patience 
While men who owned us 
Took paid vacations 
They tried to clone us 
To fight deflation 
They should have blown us 
What? 
For reparations Instead we eavesdropped 
Found secret files 
Of bad accounting 
In shredded piles 
As pressure mounted 
So did denials 
Evidence will drag those criminals 
To face the man in trial Good-bye Martha my dear! 
Go Away Taking down upper management. What? 
Taking down upper management. What? 
Taking down upper management. What? 
Taking down upper management. What? For all those who work honestly 
Building up our economy 
Some bosses take the liberty 
To take our money happily 
Though what's up falls eventually 
They tore down our economy 
Lock them up in a penitentiary 
Hide the key for half a century Good-bye Martha my dear! 
Go Away Taking down upper management. What? 
Taking down upper management. What? 
Taking down upper management. What? 
Taking down upper management Captains go down with their ships 
Not jump ship as they go down 
All these pricks stood back 
And watched their companies drown 
They paid us with junk bonds 
Sold stocks before the sale 
But they failed! All Hail! 
To Chief Execs going to jail! Good-bye Martha my dear! 
Go Away Taking down upper management. What? 
Taking down upper management. What? 
Taking down upper management. What? 
Taking down upper management Good-bye Martha my dear! 
Go Away
