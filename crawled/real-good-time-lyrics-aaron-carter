Sometime, someplace 
Everybody has words 
Fallin' out, and making up 
Uh-huh [Chorus] 
Maybe I laugh, maybe I cry 
Maybe I scream, maybe I sigh 
Baby I feel, the feeling is real 
Maybe I curse, maybe I squeal But I enjoy, making some noise 
Foolin' around, adjusting to the sound 
You and I get, everything's set 
Be sure you know how to have a real good time (Yeah, yeah) 
One, two, three, four You and I are not to blame 
Sometimes we just go insane 
You and I have much to give 
Everything is relative 
When we have our darker days 
We just go our separate ways 
You and I are not to blame 
Sometimes we just go insane [Chorus] Sometimes baby in your eyes 
Love is truly justified 
When I hear you tellin' lies 
I just wanna terrorize 
Making up is oh so good 
Yeah we rock the neighborhood 
You and I are not to blame 
Sometimes we just go insane
