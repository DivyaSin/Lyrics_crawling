Frozin in time forever 
Carrying that torch for so long 
Can you hear my heart believing 
Frozen in the index of time They singled out my tongue 
In front of everyone 
Who was watching my show 
They say that I'm no good I'm sorry that I could 
Be that way to you 
Dusting off the roman dollar 
Searching for some work on the side I'm just closer to death then ever 
Frozen in the index of time 
They just don't have the minds 
To pay me for my crimes That they made me do 
They don't care how it feels 
To them this isn't real 
In my magical womb Frozin in time forever 
Carrying that torch for so long 
Can you hear my heart believing 
Frozen in the index of time Baby
