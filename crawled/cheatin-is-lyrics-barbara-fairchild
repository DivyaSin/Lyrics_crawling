Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring 
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss 
She blames him he blames her 
But neither one is ever quite sure which way it really is 
And all of the time in the back of their minds 
They know they're gonna have to lie bout where they've been 
Cheatin' is a thing that'll take a little ring 
And bring it into pieces that'll never go back again Cheatin' is the part of lovin' that starts 
When true love isn't what lovers are looking for 
A stranger here a stranger there then you turn around and swear 
That you'll never go back for more 
And laying at night when you're holding him tight 
Is sometimes that a cheater's heart just has to learn 
Cheatin' is a thing that's guaranteed to bring 
Two unhappy people to the point of no return The worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids 
Hangin' in the middle while mommie and daddy choose 
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins 
But the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose
