I like Saturdays and the rocket summer 
Blue skies and the morning's air 
Oh oh, oh oh I like you, you like me 
There's something wrong with this picture 
Let's turn it upside down so we can see 
The insecurities caused by the last four years 
Of economic downsizing in the Eastern US I like February along with Tilly and the Wall 
Pretty pictures and shirts that are too small 
For my child-like figure that you're so in love with I like the autumn's leaves and bright eyes 
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind 
Stands strong in my favorites of all time 
Along with you and your Technicolor eyes You say Johnny Cash is your favorite singer 
But you've never heard 'Folsom Prison Blues' 
So how do you expect me to believe you? I was never much on country songs but 
Someone should really tell you to come home 
'Cause it's getting late and your dinner's getting cold I like simple songs with pretty words 
I tried poetry but it's just no good 
The pages get lost besides I'd much rather sing to you I love living life with you by my side 
You're a smart kid with a beautiful smile 
And oh God those Technicolor eyes I like Saturdays and the rocket summer 
Night skies and that lovely stare 
I like you, you like me, so let's lock all the doors 
There's nothing outside we need to see 'Cause we've got love, yeah, we've got a TV 
We can watch 'Friends' and all we want 
And we can laugh at how I laugh like Ross when I get nervous And we don't have to worry about tomorrow 
Because we know it's gonna come 
Whether we want it to or not I like simple songs with pretty words 
I tried poetry but it's just no good 
The pages get lost besides I'd much rather sing to you I love living life with you by my side 
You're a smart kid with a beautiful smile 
And oh God those Technicolor eyes
