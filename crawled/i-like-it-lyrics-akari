I'm calling out to all the fellas in here tonight, 
You know you're looking sexy as hell, 
Damn baby you're my type, 
Boy you know you're something else! 
You make me wanna grab you real quick! 
Face like a model, pocket swift, 
I'm looking flawless in my outfit 
Know I'm even better when I'm out of it. Chorus: 
All my girls in the club, 
With your high heels on, 
And all my fellas trying to 
Take them home! 
Cause I like it, I like it, I like it, 
Everything about you! 
Cause I like it, I like it, I like it, 
And we dance to the beat 
You got me feeling like a freak 
And that's quite alright with me, 
Cause I like it, I like it, I like it, 
Everything about you! 
Cause I like it, I like it, I like it, 
Yes I like it, I like it, I like it! I love the way you move 
And makes them bottles pop, 
And when you do it's like slow motion 
And then then the music stops, aye. 
I see you stare 
I'm here, you're there 
And boy I need you closer to me, oh yeah! 
You make me wanna grab you real quick 
Face like a model, pocket swift, 
I'm looking flawless in my outfit 
Know I'm even better when I'm out of it. Chorus: (x2) 
All my girls in the club, 
With your high heels on, 
And all my fellas trying to 
Take them home! 
Cause I like it, I like it, I like it, 
Everything about you! 
Cause I like it, I like it, I like it, 
And we dance to the beat 
You got me feeling like a freak 
And that's quite alright with me, 
Cause I like it, I like it, I like it, 
Everything about you! 
Cause I like it, I like it, I like it, 
Yes I like it, I like it, I like it!
