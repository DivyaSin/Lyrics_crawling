It makes no difference where I turn 
I can't get over you and the flame still burns 
It makes no difference, night or day 
The shadow never seems to fade away And the sun don't shine anymore 
And the rains fall down on my door Now there's no love 
As true as the love 
That dies untold 
But the clouds never hung so low before It makes no difference how far I go 
Like a scar the hurt will always show 
It makes no difference who I meet 
They're just a face in the crowd 
On a dead-end street 
And the sun don't shine anymore 
And the rains fall down on my door These old love letters 
Well, I just can't keep 
Cause like the gambler says 
Read 'em and weep 
And the dawn don't rescue me no more Without your love I'm nothing at all 
Like an empty hall it's a lonely fall 
Since you've gone it's a losing battle 
Stampeding cattle 
They rattle the walls And the sun don't shine anymore 
And the rains fall down on my door Well, I love you so much 
It's all I can do 
Just to keep myself from telling you 
That I never felt so alone before
