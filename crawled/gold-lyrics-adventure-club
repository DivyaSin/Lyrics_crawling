Only sunshine, under the bright sky 
Only sunshine, under the bright sky When the words are like bullets 
And they break through your skin 
And there's no way to get them all out 
When it feels like a rush seeping into your soul 
Stay gold 
Stay gold 
Stay gold Under the bright sky, only sunshine Under the bright sky, only sunshine Stay gold 
Stay gold 
Stay gold 
Stay gold 
Stay gold 
Stay gold You were always searching 
For something out there 
Out of reach, couldn't stop you 
Couldn't hold you back 
You were so real, so real When the words are like bullets 
And they break through your skin, 
And there's no way to get them all out 
When it feels like a rush seeping into your soul 
Stay gold 
Stay gold 
Stay gold Under the bright sky, only sunshine Under the bright sky, only sunshine Stay gold
