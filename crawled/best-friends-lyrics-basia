You know me well by now 
There's more to be discovered 
And Baby my good heart 
Might improve your inner life Listen I'm your friend 
I don't try to be your mother 
Strange as it may seem 
I believe wrong can turn to right Against the rule 
I'm always here for you 
On each other's side 
There's so much that we can do Because no matter where we are going there together 
There's no doubt we will get there in the end
