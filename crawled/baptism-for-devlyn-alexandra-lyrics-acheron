A January eve, the year XXX A.S. 
Magick granted me a gift, that Lucifer blessed 
A daughter born of darkness, and oh so divine 
The next generation of the infernal bloodline Devlyn Alexandra, the world is yours to indulge in the things you wish 
Never submit to the righteous herds, my child may you "Do as thou wilt" Skin white as snow, her eyes an endless sea 
An unwarped newborn mind, without Christianity 
Free to walk the path, remember left is right 
Reap all of life's worth, young spawn of the night Devlyn Alexandra, a new Satanic millenium awaits for you to behold 
Use the tools given unto you, the creed being "Knowledge is power" I baptize you in the name of Satan! Hail Satan, rege Satanas, hail Devlyn, praise life 
Hail Lucifer, ave Satanas, hail Devlyn, praise power 
Hail Belial, rege Satanas, hail Devlyn, praise wisdom 
Hail Leviathan, ave Satanas, hail Devlyn, praise strength I lift the chalice and make a toast to this sacred time 
Raise your hands into the sign of the horns, the Satanic Salute 
Brothers and sisters we have honored this little witch 
May the black flame of Satan forever burn in her veins
