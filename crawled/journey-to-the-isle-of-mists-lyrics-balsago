(Over The Moonless Depths Of Night-Dark Seas) THE LOG OF THE NORTHERN MARINER: 
The great serpent-prow of my ship, Wave-Render cleaves the nighted 
waters as we voyage across the dark, icy sea, towards the unknown... 
Above, the brigth winter's moon emerges from a veil of cloud to cast 
its lucent rays upon us, and a clinging, supine sea-mist writhers upon 
the midnight waves, swirled by the colol, whispering wind which 
catches our great sail, pushing us onwards, vever onwards... And 
beyond the tang of the darkling sea, the scent of nights is as strong 
and heady as summer blossom. I know not what awaits us at the elder 
Isle of Mists... that grim and mistery-haunted place which beckons me 
to its shadowed embrace, swathed in dark legendry and etwined in the 
mantle of ancient sorceries... and yet I must hearken to its ethereal 
call... for mayhap the gods have decreed this to be my final voyage...
