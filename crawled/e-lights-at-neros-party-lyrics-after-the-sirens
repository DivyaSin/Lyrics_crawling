How vaguely we eschew complicity with You, 
it's always run-arounds, excuses 
and words we bind to nooses 
just to sullenly let swing 
the best of arbitrary things, 
like, do we care about the poor? 
Oh yes, but we support the king. And we're starving for the slaughter. 
A man gives up his daughter 
and the walls that keep us safe aren't saving anyone. 
Didn't You say 
to risk everything? And we're left dieting for more 
and then we're burning on the tor 
that flanks an emperor's affair. 
We've hardly sacrificed before 
so in manic heavenward stare 
let the confession from our lungs 
that as our bodies torch the air 
to the fanfare and the drums, 
amid drunken wild acclaim, 
we have the urge to scream Your name. 
and without hesitance or shame 
affirm our place among the burning. 
And our bodies break, confirming 
our inability to remain 
without an object for our yearning. Our inability, our inability.
