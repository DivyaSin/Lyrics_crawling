My best friend say 
She sick of me crying on the phone 
Telling how my man been dogging me 
My best friend say 
Don't tell her nothing bout me and u 
Cause she ain't showing me no sympathy 
My best friend say 
If she was me she'd let you go long long time ago 
My best friend say 
My best friend say 
I'll be there [Chorus:] 
I'll still be there for you 
In your time of need 
You can lean on me 
Come on 
I'll be there for you 
I'll be there for you 
In your time of need 
You can lean on me 
Come on 
I'll be there for you My best friend say 
I can stay with her 
At her house no doubt any time I like 
My best friend say 
Don't let you ruin my life 
Cause you don't do for me 
And you don't act right 
My best friend say 
If she was me she would let you go long long time ago 
My best friend say 
My best friend say [Chorus: x2]
