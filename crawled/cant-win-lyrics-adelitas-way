I'm slipping away and I cant sleep at night again 
My loneliness fades to a place thats deep within 
And I cant tell you how to feel inside 
And all I can do is make sure, this is right To crush him one last time, 
To take him off your mind, 
To crush him one last time, 
To take him off your mind, Your letting me drown and I just reach up for your hand, 
You pull it away, and i just don't understand, 
And I cant tell you how to feel inside, 
All I can do is deal with the pain in lies, To crush him one last time 
To take him off your mind 
To crush him one last time 
To take him off your mind I cant tell you how to feel (how to feel), 
All I can say, 
is that im never letting go, never letting go, 
I dont know if this is real (this is real), 
All that I know, 
is i'm never letting go, never letting go, To crush him one last time (Crush him, love him, kiss him, touch him), 
To take him off your mind (Take him off your mind), 
To crush him one last time (Crush him, love him, kiss him, touch him), 
To take him off your mind,
