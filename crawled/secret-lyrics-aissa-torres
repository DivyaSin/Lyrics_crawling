Secret 
It's my tiny little secret 
it's my little, little secret 
that I'm loving you, that I'm loving you, that I'm lovin' 
Secret 
It's my tiny little secret 
it's my little, little secret 
that I'm loving you, that I'm loving you, that I'm lovin' You're a star 
the star in my life 
everything that you are 
I just be watchin' watchin' you from afar 
thinkin' how nice it would be 
to walk in the breeze 
wit cha wit cha wit cha But you don't know 
the feelings that I have 
cuz I never let it show 
when I get the nerve to speak up 
I'm like whoa 
try to close my eyes 
and erase the thoughts from my mind But you walk 
run inside my brain all day 
I don't know what I can say 
to convince you to be with me 
and see that I can't go 
a day 
without thinkin' about you 
that I wanna be with you 
but I don't know how to say it 
I don't know what to say Secret 
It's my tiny little secret 
it's my little, little secret 
that I'm loving you, that I'm loving you, that I'm lovin' 
Secret 
It's my tiny little secret 
it's my little, little secret 
that I'm loving you, that I'm loving you, that I'm lovin' When I see 
you walkin' past me 
I really wonder if you can feel 
when my eyes meet yours 
and my heart's on the floor 
and my knees get so weak 
I'm unable to speak 
I can't even think straight 
my mind's messed up 
and my thoughts 
are all over the place [Rap] TNT Tha Nasty Tone 
You're my secret all day girl 
glad you made it my way girl 
but I guess it's ok girl 
if you want then we can play 
See your secret is safe 
if you want it to be 
see it's all about you 
and it's all about me 
a typical story 
where boy meet girl 
shining so bright 
like diamonds and pearl 
you gave the green light 
so I took a twirl 
now everybody ask 
if that's your girl 
so hard to keep a secret 
from the world 
especially the way 
you make my toes curl 
wooooo You walk 
run inside my brain all day 
I don't know what I can say 
to convince you to be with me 
and see that I can't go 
a day 
without thinkin' about you 
that I wanna be with you 
but I don't know how to say it 
I don't know what to say Secret
