Growing up was real hard on my block 
Cops and robbers I was never the cop 
To be the cop was considered a joke 
I'm the same little' nigga that taught your brother to smoke But now-a-days man I stay on the news 
My every move is up on the tube 
Whoever said being a gangsta was easy 
I got beef with BMF and I got problems with Jeezy To be a gangsta is a full time job 
A bad a boy but I ain't Black Rob 
The pays good but the hours are crazy 
You disrespect me I'm gonna see ya degraded I'm never scared but I'm thinkin ahead 
Because they don't bury the scared man they bury the dead I'm ex-con but I'm out on bond
