Did you think that I'd just slowly start to fade 
You could steal my livelihood and send me on my way 
I know it's old but I was caught out in the rain 
So I rested under a bridge 
I made some new friends 
And I wept, and I wept 
Did you really think that I'd just stand in line 
Wait around for you until whatever time you like 
I took the pieces of a broken heart 
And I had no choice 
Heartbreak on the 101 
Heartbreak on the 101 
I'm over it 
You leave me more damaged every day 
you took my entire world and threw it all away 
Its cold outside I need a place to lay 
So I rest beneath the bridge with the friends that I made 
Couldn't really think that I'd just stand aside 
Take up something new or start another life 
Look at the pieces of a broken heart 
And see what it could do 
Heartbreak on the 101 
Heartbreak on the 101 
I'm over it 
Can't think that I'd just slowly fade away 
You could put me on the sidewalk with a suitcase 
I know it's over and it sounds a bit cliche 
But I want you back so bad 
Leave the pieces where they lay 
And I pray for your return 
There's no sign 
And I'm sleeping with my one eye open 
Just in case you might 
No, nothing ever works 
Its just a waste of time 
I can't seem to get it right 
Heartbreak on the 101 
Everybody's watching 
Come take a look 
Heartbreak on the 101 
Everybody watch 
Everybody look 
Heartbreak on the 101 
Heartbreak on the 101 
Heartbreak on the 101
