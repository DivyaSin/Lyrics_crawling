Ooooooooh....Poncho man 
Why did you shed your clothes? 
Ooooooooh....Poncho man 
Put back on your robes Running down the street under the noon sun 
Why did you do it? Did you think it would be fun? 
Wearing nothing but a poncho - we can see your bare ass 
It doesn't give you elegance, style or class Ooooooooh....Poncho man 
Your soul to the world you show 
Ooooooooh....Poncho man 
At least wear a sombrero Red, green, yellow, blue, pink and indigo 
Wearing all the colours of a freaked out rainbow 
Woven out of wool so you don't catch cold 
But doesn't it itch? Cos that's what I was told. Ooooooooh....Poncho man 
They rugby tackled you to the ground 
Ooooooooh....Poncho man 
Indecent exposure, guilty you're found You think you're the head honcho 
With your dirty poncho 
People boo and hiss 
You just laugh and p*** Ooooooooh....Poncho man 
I think you look stupid too 
Ooooooooh....Poncho man 
But I wish I was just like you
