Once I heard a man, talkin' mostly to himself 
tellin' tales he'd heard around the world 
He said, "Son you'll see your big time, and you'll fight your boxing 
match, 
and there's always gonna be that fish that you didn't catch.." 
However far your ventures lead you 
however far your fences stretch 
There's something that keeps callin' you back 
No matter how much it decides you, it's something deep inside of you 
Somethin' beggin' to be cut some slack.. 
{chorus} 
It seems I go, where I don't expect 
should I have made a right when I made a left? 
It seems I go, where I must perfect 
a bigger system, that's got a bigger defect.. 
They're displaced revolutionaries and a captive audience 
They have seen what's never been done before 
If there are castle dragons they can't respect to the least degree 
then they'll find it forced upon them more and more 
I've seen them wanderin' on the road, they're dreamin' of somewhere else 
from the old school they've learned to hate their ways 
Living future memories, the best that they can crawl 
and hating everybodies latest craze.. 
From the most crazy aspirations come the most noble philosophies 
but see which one will get you anywhere 
The shadow prince you walk behind, has lost his crowning jewel 
and now it's you alone just standing there..
