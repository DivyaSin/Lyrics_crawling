We really rich niggas, we hop in the foreign 
Nigga you play and get shot by the mornin' 
Spray a whole hundred shots with no warnin' 
Bales and them scales, before rap I was rich 
Still hit them blocks, all up in the dead end 
This a cold world, I've lost so many friends 
So many fakes, I don't want no more friends 
Stack all this money and count all the yams

Rubber band racks by the ten now 
Used to be broke, went from bucket to Benz I'm in a foreign car, she in another car
