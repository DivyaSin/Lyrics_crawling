yeah i think ill kill myself again today, 
and ill probably do the same tomorrow 
because it really doesn't matter, 
i always wake up and everything is still 
heartbroken never love anyone like you 
might find someone to love me more 
but in the end it wont be enough well I'm clutching tight 
to the memories of yesterday 
while you you're running faster 
still from the memories of yesterday the stain the song the end is wrong, love my cancer 
the shame the lies belief relies on, love my cancer 
to laugh at will so these might kill, love my cancer 
the time has come, oh yes you will, love my cancer 
love my cancer
