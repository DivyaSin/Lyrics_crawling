Written by Michael Bacon "Hey man, how great were the 60's?!" - "Well...uh..." MB Overweight 60's rock star, staring from the TV screen 
Begging the youth of America, to live a life that's sober and clean 
But the kid's 17 in a ganja haze, this summer he's following Phish 
Watching the aging rock star, coming through his satellite dish 
Don't you do that blow, all around the world 
Don't you make that dough, don't you make them girls 
Am I even getting through to you son? 
Do like I say. Don't you do like I done She's a yellow rose of Texas, she's smiling from the crowd 
The message is the medium and man that guy talks loud 
He tells her that it's Earth Day and he loves all mankind 
She gives that talking unicorn her body, soul and her mind 
That American flag, you must invert 
As the sweat pours down his Mexican wedding shirt 
He leads her to oblivion 
Now the Rose is dead and he's long gone Don't you leave that lava lamp on for me 
Don't need a walk down memory lane 
I've had enough of that sorrow and pain 
Through your orange globs a-churning 
There're body bags and cities burning 
Don't you leave that lava lamp on for me 401 North Broad Street, I'm standing in my underwear 
Turn your head and cough son, then go stand over there 
But me I've got my letters and my middle class an 
I give some ghetto black boy his ticket to Saigon 
Say hello to Vietnam
