I rock around everybody else outta place 
Be bop a lula the big bad walls on the case 
I tend to benefit all at once all the time 
The nitty gritty get the sweetest taste of venom I hear the sound of a doubling up stereo 
See you shaking from the tic and the tac and the toe 
I trade it up to the fix and flex and you're gone 
Things are gonna get bloody from now on I've seen the good go bad 
I've seen the right go wrong 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond 
And if you wanna sing 
Well I got a song 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond I rocked up like adrenalin rococo 
Pass the competition there's a line for the show 
Pull yourself together for goodness sake 
From the twister tone to the shamrock shake Panorama like a passenger on a roll 
Pop my collar and I watch 'em go baby go 
I'm twice the speed of sound when I whip up a storm 
A stitch in time till the break of dawn I've seen the good go bad 
I've seen the right go wrong 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond 
And if you wanna sing 
Well I got a song 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond I've seen it all get real 
I've seen it come undone 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond 
And if you want stop me 
You've gotta get it on 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond Yeah! I've seen the good go bad 
I've seen the right go wrong 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond 
And if you wanna sing 
Well I got a song 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond I've seen it all get real 
Yeah! 
Yeah! 
Yeah! I've seen the good go bad 
I've seen the right go wrong 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond I've seen the good go bad 
I've seen the right go wrong 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond 
And if you wanna sing 
Well I got a song 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond I've seen it all get real 
I've seen it come undone 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond 
And if you want stop me 
You've gotta get it on 
From the middle of the city 
To the back of beyond
