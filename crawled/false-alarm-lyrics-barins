You know, we, Barins, are emigrants, 
false dago reds (devil rats), 
ended up in Brighton, England. We were looking to get a life 
We were staying in this crazy hostel 
With nuts, nuts all around One morning, I was, kind of, sleeping 
And, humn, you know, humn 
I didn't realize that, at the time, but 
There was this, humn Everybody downstairs 
And I wasn't even able to pull my socks up!
