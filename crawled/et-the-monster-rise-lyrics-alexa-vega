Didn't I tell you not to go out? 
Didn't I? You did, you did 
Didn't I say the world was cruel? 
Didn't I? You did, you did Then tell me how this happened 
What I did wrong, tell me why? 
Can we just go home, Shi 
And forget this dreadful night? Didn't you say that you were different? 
Didn't you? I am, I am 
Say you aren't that person 
Say it, I am, I am Then tell me how to act, dad 
What to say, dad, tell me why? 
All you've ever told me 
Every word is a lie Didn't you say that you'd protect me? 
Didn't you? I tried, I tried 
Is that how you'd help me? 
Is it? I tried, I tried Don't help me anymore, dad 
You are dead, dad, in my eyes 
Someone has replaced you 
Dad, I hate you, go and die Didn't I build a house, a home? 
Didn't I? You did, you did 
Didn't I raise her all alone? 
Didn't I? You did, you did Then Rotti took her from me 
Stole my Shilo, he's to blame 
Have I failed my daughter? 
Then let the father die and let the monster rise
