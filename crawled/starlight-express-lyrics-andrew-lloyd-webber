When your good nights have been said 
And you are lying in bed 
With the covers pulled up tight 
And though you count every sheep 
You get the feeling that sleep 
Is gonna stay away tonight That's when you hear it coming 
That is when you hear the humming 
Of the midnight train 
Here again 
Can't explain that midnight train 
That midnight train Starlight express, starlight express 
Are you real? Yes or no? 
Starlight express, answer me yes 
I don't want you to go Come try to take me away 
But bring me back before day 
Light and fill the time between 
Take me to everywhere 
But don't abandon me there 
Just want to say I've been I believe in you completely 
Though I may be dreaming sweetly 
Of the Starlight express, starlight express 
Are you real? Yes, or no? 
Starlight express, answer me yes 
I don't want you to go And if your there 
And if you know 
Then show me which way 
I should go Starlight express, starlight express 
Are you real? Yes, or no? 
Starlight express, answer me yes 
I don't want you to go Starlight express, starlight express 
Are you real? Yes, or no? 
Starlight express, answer me yes 
I need you to be here
