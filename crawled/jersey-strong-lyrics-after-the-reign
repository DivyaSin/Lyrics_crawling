Mother Nature dealt a harsh blow 
Coupled with the wrath of God 
The tides rose up and hell rained down from above 
Washed away our coastline 
A hundred thousand lost their homes 
Leaving many stranded and alone 
It may have knocked us down 
But not for long 
We're Jersey Strong From the tip of Cape May County 
To Sandy Hook and straight on through 
And every town along the way we'll remember you 
We're gonna build it back 
We'll right the wrong 
We're Jersey Strong We'll stand and deliver 
And we may not pick our fights 
We'll finish what's been started 
We'll soldier on through the night You see the devastation in our fellow states 
We'll pull together and make 'em great again 
We'll work side by side like brothers in arms 
We're Jersey Strong (Instrumental) We'll stand and deliver 
While we may not pick our fights 
We'll finish what's been started 
We'll soldier on through the night We may have lost our boardwalk 
Leveled to the sand 
But I promise you we're gonna bring her back 
We'll walk the boards again 
And it won't be long 
We're Jersey Strong Mother Nature dealt a harsh blow 
Coupled with the wrath of God 
But we're gonna survive 
We're Jersey Strong
