"I'd like to sing this song called Up For Murder" Well take a look and listen to the things that I have said 
Well could I really tell the truth with a rifle at my head 
Yeah, I gunned down a president 
And I have done a crime 
But now you've got to listen 'cos I'm running out of time It's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
It's not me that is guilty 
It's a man at the C.I.A. So I got put in jail because I got into a fight 
And while I was in prison I got beat up every night 
Torture it was blackmail I was messed up with cocaine 
And then they had me thinking that I knew just who to blame But it's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
It's not me that is guilty 
It's a man with the C.I.A. It's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
It's not me that is guilty 
It's a man with the C.I.A. Hey hey hey So there I stood before him a revolver in my hand 
With one shot for the torture and a bullet for the man 
So now I'm UP FOR MURDER on a charge I can't deny 
Well there ain't no clues I'm bom to lose and no ones gonna ask me why Wll it's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
It's not me that is guilty 
It's a man with the C.I.A. It's not me that you're after it's not me that's gonna pay 
It's not me that is guilty 
It's a man with the C.I.A. C.I.A. 
C.I.A. 
The C.I.A. "Thank you, this is Mike Peters"
