Little tornado 
Bane of the trailer park 
Lifting houses to leave your mark Little tornado 
Noah can build his ark 
But he will never disembark Make it go faster 
Baby go faster 
Make it go twice the speed of you and me Litter tornado 
You and the hurricane 
Close your eyes and go campaign Make it go faster 
Baby go faster 
Make it go twice the speed of you and me Oh, no, no we don't 
No we don't know Little tornado blew out the window pane 
Left the inside to the rain
