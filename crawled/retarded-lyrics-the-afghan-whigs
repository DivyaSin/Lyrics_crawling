Television's gone and I'm alone with Lucifer

And all you can't forget 
So roll on up the price is down 
So come on come on come on come on. Today the retard speaks to me and now I have it all 
What a drag 
Muthafucker lied to you 
It could never get that bad just ask So go on go on go on go on 
Who you call retarded now?

I see YOU standing proud 
Come on down & swallow hard
