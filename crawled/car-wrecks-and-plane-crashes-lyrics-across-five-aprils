Without cause people disapear right before my eyes. 
Did they speak the truth or were their words disposable. 
My heart is bleeding you've caused me so much pain. 
Go ahead leave you're not worth it. 
Heartache is all that I know. 
Heartache I embrace now, 
it's all I have left in the years I've invested. 
Thoughtless human shut your mouth. 
You break my heart. 
You've turned your back on all we've been through. 
The times we've shared I don't miss you. 
But I miss who you used to be.
