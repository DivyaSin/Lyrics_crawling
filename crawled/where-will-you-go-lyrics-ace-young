Once upon a summer night 
We made love a thousand times 
and I thought it'd never end 
'til I felt December's wind It's a shame that you and I 
All we ever do is fight 
about stupid little things 
that we don't remember why It's a rainy night, and it's cold outside 
I can't hold you back, it's your own damn life 
Before you pack that bag and leave 
You know you gotta tell me Girl, where will you go? 
You've got my child, ain't even born 
You're not the only one going through this 
If you could just hang on, we can do this. together girl Oh girl Who's wrong, who's right? 
When love's a suicide 
But there's something you should know 
This is bigger than us both We can scream and shout or we can work this out 
Hey, I'm talking to you, don't you walk away 
I know you're scared, but that's no excuse 
cuz we got everything to lose Girl, where will you go? 
You've got my child, ain't even born 
You're not the only one going through this 
If you could just hang on, we can do this together, girl Oh girl, where will you go? Oh, girl It's a rainy night, and it's cold outside 
I can't hold you back, it's your own damn life 
Before you pack that bag and leave 
You've gotta tell me Girl, where will you go? 
You got my child, ain't even born 
You're not the only one going through this 
If you could just hang on, we can do this Girl, where will you go? 
You've got my child, ain't even born 
Cuz you can choose revenge or forgiveness 
If we don't change, we don't have no business together, girl You're not the only one going through this 
If you could just hang on, we can do this 
Where will you go? 
Where will you go?
