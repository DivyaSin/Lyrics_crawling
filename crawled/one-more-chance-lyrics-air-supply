Whenever my mind sees you girl 
I think of the times we owned the world 
Crazy in love I missed the signs 
I just couldn't see 
I never believed you were leavin' my life CHORUS # 1 
Baby give us one more chance 
So we can love again 
There's a time for love, a time to heal 
Now it's time for us to mend CHORUS # 2 
Baby give us one more chance 
Let me come back home 
I don't wanna run the endless road 
Or fight this world alone You were the diamond in my life 
You were the only star in sight 
Playin' against the odds I lost 
All that I had 
Oh what was the cost of you leavin' my life CHORUS # 1 CHORUS # 2 Give us one more chance 
It's all that we need 
To let the heartache mend girl 
And make a love once broken 
Strong again CHORUS # 1 CHORUS # 2
