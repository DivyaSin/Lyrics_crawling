Stone's throw away 
I can see His agony start to bleed 
Stone's throw away 
I can hear His adamant plea, ?Let it pass from me?, yeah Save Lord, I pray 
Save me from my enemy who prowls in deep 
And I?ll fight to stay awake 
My spirit wills, my flesh is weak, so I fall asleep The dark is creeping in 
How suddenly my vanity betrays my speech 
?This man is not my friend?, what a foolish lie 
?Cause You I can't deny 
Your mercy haunts me every night in a dream Stone's throw away 
I can hear my Savior?s plea, ?Come to me? 
Oh, I've tried to run away 
Why does He keep on asking me for my loyalty? My world is closing in 
How suddenly my frailty finds words to speak 
I?ll love You to the end, until I die 
?Cause You I can't deny 
Your mercy haunts me every night in a dream Oh, I need You now , I'm lost without You here 
Forgive me, all the times I've turned away 
Ooh, my love is only Yours, I've told You twice before 
You I can't deny 
Your mercy haunts me every night in a dream The world is closing in 
Jesus, you're my everything, my life to breathe 
I?ll follow you until I reach the end ?til Your kingdom comes 
?Cause You I can't deny 
Your mercy haunts me every night in a dream Oh, I need You now , I'm lost without You here 
Forgive me, all the times I've turned away, away 
Ooh, my love is only Yours, I've told You twice before 
You I can't deny 
Your mercy haunts me every night 
Oh, You I can't deny 
Your mercy haunts me every night in a dream (Follow) 
And I?ll follow You ?til the end 
(Follow You till the end) 
I?ll follow You ?til the end 
(Follow You till the end) 
I?ll follow You ?til the end I?ll follow You until I reach the end 
(I?ll follow You ?til the end)
