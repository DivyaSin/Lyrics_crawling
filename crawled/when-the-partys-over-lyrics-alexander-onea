Having a good time 
Getting close to you girl 
Last dance is ending 
I don't wanna let you go, oh no So please excuse me 
If I come up kinda strong 
But the night is almost gone 
What I'm trying to say is that There's no need to leave 
When the party's over 
There's no need to go 
When the party's over Understand me 
I'm not forcing anything 
I just wanted you to stay 
So I thought I'd tell you this There's no need to leave 
When the party's over 
There's no need to go 
When the party's over There's no need to leave 
I don't wanna be alone, baby, no 
There's no need to go 
Stay with me, stay with me, baby There's no need to go
