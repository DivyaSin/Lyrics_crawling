(Nowhere) I'll be back 
(No way out) I'll be back again 
My heart feel pain (I'm) waiting for the night (Nowhere) I'll be back 
(No way out) I'll be back again 
My heart feel pain I'm waiting for the light Soshite soko de shinjitsu o mitsumeteta zattoo no gogo (And then I gazed at the truth in the afternoon crowd) 
(Nowhere) 
Soshite kotae ha soko ni ai e nai (And the answer there was not to love) 
(Go) 
Soshite soitsu o kaima mita sono zattoo no gogo (And ??? beginning saw in this afternoon crowd) 
(No way out) 
Soshite kotae ha aie nai (And the answer was not to love) Woah-oh! 
Do nothing, so what can I do (Do nothing, so what can I do) 
(Go!) (Nowhere!) No way out! Soshite soko de shinjitsu o mitsumeteta zattoo no gogo (And then I gazed at the truth in the afternoon crowd)
