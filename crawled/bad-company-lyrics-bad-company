Company 
Always on the run 
Destiny is the rising sun 
Oh I was born six gun in my hand 
Behind a gun I'll make my final stand 
That's why they call me Bad company 
And I can't deny 
Bad company 
Till the day I die 
Till the day I die 
Till the day I die Rebel souls 
Deserters we are called 
Chose a gun and threw away the sword 
Now these towns 
They all know our name six gun sound is our claim to fame 
I can hear them say Bad company 
And I won't deny 
Bad, bad company 
Till the day I die 
Till the day I die Bad company 
I can't deny 
Bad company 
Till the day I die 
And I say it's 
Bad company oh yeah, yeah 
Bad company 
Till the day I die oh yeah Tell me that you are not a thief 
Oh but I am 
Bad company 
It's the way I play 
Dirty for dirty 
Oh somebody double-crossed me 
Double-cross, double-cross Yeah 
We're bad company 
Kill in cold blood
