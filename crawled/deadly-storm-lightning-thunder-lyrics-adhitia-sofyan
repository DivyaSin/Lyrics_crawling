Would you call me if you can 
I'm waiting underneath it all 
All the mess and the chaos you've caused 
Now you're nowhere to be found So tell me I'm trying to define 
The meaning of unconditional love 
When it puts you faced down on the ground 
You're out there sailing away And maybe a deadly storm will come and catch you 
Lightning thunder will strike you 
It hits your head so hard you'll come to me It's all right I totally understand 
They're greener on the other side 
And the sun will shine brighter everyday 
I guess that's where all the light goes And I'm ok, I hope the best for you 
Remember to go out and have fun 
You could spend the day out in the ocean 
I heard the water's fine over there I guess I 'll learn to come by without you 
And somewhere out there I'm sure God is watching you close But then maybe his deadly storm will come and catch you 
Lightning thunder will strike you 
It hits your head so hard you'll come to me
