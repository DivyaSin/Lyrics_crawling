Chris: 
Falling for a fantasy, 
I threw away my destiny. 
I don't know where to start, 
Healing broken hearts. 
I think about it endlessly, 
My eyes too dry to cry, 
For i've lost all this time, 
All this time with you, oh I was tempted by the, 
Power of desire. 
I surrended to the, 
Calling of the fire, 
There is nothing I can ever say, 
To change the things I did, 
But I promise you, 
I'll make it up to you. Mark: 
Take me back to yesterday, 
When all our dreams were swept away, 
I'd never cross that line, 
That changed the course of time, 
I can never live this way, 
If only you'll forgive, 
We'll start again- with my heart, 
For all my love for you 
all my love for you I was tempted by the, 
Power of desire. 
I surrended to the, 
Calling of the fire, 
There is nothing I can ever say, 
To change the things I did, 
But I promise you, 
I'll make it up to you. Chris: 
No surrender , no return, 
If you believe that ... I was tempted by the, 
Power of desire. 
I surrended to the, 
Calling of the fire, 
There is nothing I can ever say, 
To change the things I did, 
Chris: But I promise you, 
I'll make it up to you.
