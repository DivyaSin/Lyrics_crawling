I took a taxi down beside the water 
I kicked a stone out along the pier 
I saw the lighthouse keeper blowing out his candle 
And that's a sight every sailor fears 
We sing on through the sound of distant thunder 
Save the skin I'm in 
I'm trying to break that spell that I am under 
Save the skin I'm in 
Saw my reflection face down in the water 
Floating by my broken tambourine 
Well, they caught the preacher flirting with disaster 
Now the righteous can again be free 
We sing on through the sound of distant thunder 
Save the skin I'm in 
I let that devil make a fool of me 
Save the skin I'm in 
Somebody got to 
Save the skin I'm in 
(Somebody got to) save me now 
(Save me) somebody, please 
(Somebody got to) help me now 
(Save me) somebody please 
We sing on through the sound of distant thunder 
Save the skin I'm in 
I let that devil make a fool of me 
Save the skin I'm in 
Somebody got to 
Save the skin I'm in
