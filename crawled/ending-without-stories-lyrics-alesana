This time I die Our love ruined by your malignance 
Broken shards of feelings are now just tainted memories left 
Beautiful dreams that I cherished now are so disgusting as I strangle the light from you I watched the smile fading from your face 
You bled till there was nothing in your veins 
Blood stains my hands so I won't forget you 
Its all over now so dry your eyes 
Never forget you, be afraid to die 
Blood stains my hands so I won't forget you Tears fall as your screams of anguish rage throughout the heavens 
Amidst the penance you must pay 
Caress this bullet as eyes close to the painful memories you left 
Consume the rest of me 
My vision of you has now turned to dust, your porcelain smile gone I watched the smile fading from your face 
You bled till there was nothing in your veins 
Blood stains my hands so I won't forget you 
Its all over now so dry your eyes... never forget you, be afraid to die 
Blood stains my hands so I won't forget you You let me go 
You let me go too soon 
I love you are meaningless words that slip away as I slit your throat 
And I will slit your throat
