Yes I people, yes I people, 
Careful on when we strung. 
Yes I people, yes I people 
Think its smart to get moved on. 
Yes I people, yes I people 
The near has come, the near has come. Pick to the year, for its fall. Yes I people, it is true, 
For me are you, thats for sure. 
Come on, people, I will keep on trying on, trying more. Yes I people, all these people have tried to won, tried to won.
