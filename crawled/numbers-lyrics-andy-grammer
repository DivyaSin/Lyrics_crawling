At the bass y'all 
At the trumpet y'all Well I'm five on a good day six 
I got plenty of things need to fix 
A bigger chest and dimples in my face 
With those i could be pushin seven to eight 
Guitar in my hand add a point to my score 
No car slide me down to a four 
Six feet with a pair of blue eyes 
Brings me back up to a five Greather than less than equal to 
You're making this way to mathematical 
The value of personality seems to be dead 
All walkin around with numbered halo's on our heads well Threes want fours and fours want fives 
Eights think nines have much better lives 
And it's a reasonable question to ask 
I guess it's all how ya doing the math 
And i can sit and i can lie to you 
And say this somethin' that i don't do 
But i'm a nother number crunchn' fool 
Whos calculaters' way overused Greather than less than equal to 
You're making this way to mathematical 
The value of personality seems to be dead 
All walkin around with numbered halo's on our heads and i'm thinking Just one time 
I wish i could have a nine 
She'd be hot and she'd be mine just one time 
But for every nine theres a two starting back at you 
wishing you would do what you wanted the nine to eh 90% of the mental judicial system is based soley on superficial intuition 
To me that seems a bit stange 
Only talk to people who we think we might be kissn' 
That's a lot of ideas to be dismissing 
WE leave it to humans to choose the criteria we can't change It doesn't make sence no doesn't make sense doesn't make sense 
For the numbers to be where we are concentrating 
In my minor sense i condesense in my minor sense 
Asymetrical interactions 
Simply evaporating 
I'm a five on a good day six 
Got plenty of things need to fix 
I need a formua or some sort of plan to focus on the soda not the can
