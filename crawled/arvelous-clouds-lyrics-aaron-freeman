I'm the son of the wild swan of Flanders 
Who sail on the river of dreams 
My mother the swan has left me and gone 
My home's the banks of the stream In the marvelous clouds sail by, marvelous clouds 
Aloft in the soft, summer sky, marvelous clouds I've seen all the lovers and always 
I've heard every promise at dawn 
I spent too much time just standing in line 
To be told I shouldn't belong And the marvelous clouds sail by, marvelous clouds 
Aloft in the soft, summer sky, marvelous clouds I've looked in the eyes of your heroes 
As they sailed from far, distant lands 
The mud on their uniforms, mud on their boots 
Blood on their faces and hands In the marvelous clouds sail by, marvelous clouds 
Aloft in the soft, summer sky, marvelous clouds My father, the king of the mountain 
Looks down and watches his child 
Come home, says he, if you hate what you see 
You're young and the country is wild But I'll stay and I'll wait for the canons 
And the drums to stop drumming my ears 
Is it too late, mankind, if you run out of time 
It's a matter of days or just years In the marvelous clouds sail by, marvelous clouds 
Aloft in the soft, summer sky, marvelous clouds 
Marvelous clouds, marvelous clouds
