I started out to be the man behind the scenes 
Knowing I was in above my head 
For all that I could see I never saw the truth. 
Now I'm alone. Heaven only knows how much I'm missing you, 
Knowing I had heaven in my hands. And there will be tears, 
Tears are mixed with rain. 
Keeper of my flame. Time and tide is on my side, 
It stands forever. 
There will be nights of love 
And, yes, there will be tears. I will not sleep tonight. 
There will be tears tonight. 
I will not sleep tonight. 
There will be tears. The silent telephone, the turning of the key. 
You're still inside of me, I'm not ashamed. 
For all that I can do, I can't forget your face. 
I call your name. Heaven only knows what I've been crying for, 
What I'm crying for. 
And all I've done to keep this love alive. Even through my tears, 
Tears are mixed with rain. 
Keeper of my flame. I will pray you're on my side, 
We stand forever. 
There will be nights of love 
And, yes, there will be tears. I will not sleep tonight (oh oh). 
There will be tears tonight. 
I will not sleep tonight (oh). 
There will be. Soon there will be tears 
Rolling down my world. 
Keeper of my flame. Time and tide is on my side, 
It stands forever. 
There will be nights of love 
And, yes, there will be tears I will not sleep tonight. 
There will be tears tonight 
I will not sleep tonight. 
There will be tears...
