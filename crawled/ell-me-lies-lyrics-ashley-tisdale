It's in your eyes, feelings can't be disguised 
'Cause the truth makes me want you to tell me lies 
My biggest fear is crying oceans of tears 
I would rather you not be so sincere How cold could you be? 
What would you do if you were me? 
I'm better off if it's a mystery 'Cause I don't want know 
If I kissed your lips for the last time 
Please don't say if it's so 
Tell my heart it's not goodbye 
And do this one thing for me 
Make up some stupid story tonight It's alright, keep your truth and tell me lies Something's not right, love is nowhere in sight 
I'm not ready to let go, it's not time 
How cruel could you be? 
Do say it's through least not to me 
I'm better off, leave it a mystery 'Cause I don't want know 
If I kissed your lips for the last time 
Please don't say if it's so 
Tell my heart it's not goodbye 
And do this one thing for me 
Make up some stupid story tonight It's alright, keep your truth and tell me lies Don't tell me you're leaving 
There's only so much I can take 
It's easier if you're faking Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh whoa 'Cause I don't want know 
If I kissed your lips for the last time 
Please don't say if it's so 
Tell my heart it's not goodbye 
And do this one thing for me 
Make up some stupid story tonight Can we keep pretending 
This is not the ending tonight 
It's alright, keep your truth and tell me lies Tell me, tell me, tell me lies 
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies 
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
