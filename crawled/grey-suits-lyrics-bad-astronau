Even grey suits have their day 
all the promises they made 
all the bad words you can't say 
you signed up now fake it 
you signed up now make it 
you signed up now make us proud 
the best is yet to come 
the best is yet to come 
seeing how they break you be honest 
you want it nothing else will do 
it's never enough for you 
it's never enough for you 
it's never enough for you 
and even grey suits have their way 
all your friendships find their graves 
in the lounge where you write 
they are lost 
and you are found 
the weather's fair in the clouds 
you signed up now make them proud 
the best is yet to come 
the best is yet to come 
the best is when you're falling from your throne 
yeah you bought it it's never enough for you 
you bought it it's never enough for you 
you bought it it's never enough for you 
you bought it it's never enough for you 
you bought it it's never enough for you 
you bought it it's never enough for you 
you bought it and you hold on
