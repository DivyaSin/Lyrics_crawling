Trusting melted snow 
When it's always changing 
Is hard but you'll know why I'm here 
Once I'm gone What's burning below? 
Miles of pain won't go, so I will 
Shame on the child in me 
Shame on the liar in me 
It's a shame, it's a shame You've made trust, to me seem a crime 
Just know I've been with you honestly 
The whole time Is this love or are we 
Looking for perfect things to claim? 
Is this love or are we 
Bleeding the blood of all the pain? 
I guess this is love The sun won't stay up for long 
And you are so afraid 
Afraid of the darkness that comes 
So what can I do? You can't be alone tonight 
So what can I do? I still love you This is love sometimes 
Forget all the perfect things we crave 
This is love this time 
What's living inside me, I can't tame 
I guess, I guess this is love 
This is love
