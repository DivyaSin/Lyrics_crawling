Death don't need a reason 
To come and take you, child, away 
Loss always in season 
Doesn't take a holiday It leaves you in your mourning 
Long about an evening frost 
Look away from living and 
Suddenly you find it's lost A holiday 
A hollow day 
A hallowed day 
No holiday So pack your alligator 
You may be the first to go 
Just what you're worth 
Only the undertaker knows 
A holiday 
A hollow day 
A hallowed day 
No holiday
