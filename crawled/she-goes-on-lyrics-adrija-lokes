Verse So her morning starts 
When the sun is right above our heads 
Gets up and tumbles 
And stares at the guitar next to her bed Thinks of the night's gig 
And amount of tears shed 
A different mask everyday 
Trying not to lose herself She gets up in the morning 
It's a different room everyday 
Picks up the change 
They throw right on her face Deciding the moves in her head 
Looking down at the suited men 
She picks up her pride backstage 
Ends up waiting at the corner again Chorus- Life without a home 
And all her dreams are gone 
Seems like everything is wrong 
But she goes on (x4)
