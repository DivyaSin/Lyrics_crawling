You always come around this time of year with your big ole bag that's full of Christmas cheer 
And when it starts to snow the little boys and girls all know soon they'll hear the sound of your reindeer Now sometimes grownups grow up to believe that you don't really come on 
Christmas Eve 
But I don't think that's true 'cause I know I see you in sparking little eyes 
around the tree Oh Santa Claus, I still believe in you 
And there's still a kid inside of me that still believes you're true 
Oh Santa Claus, the kids are tucked in tight 
And it's time to play ole Santa Clause tonight Well I don't see how anybody could ever doubt that there's really a Santa 
Clause. 
Not if they've ever seen a little girl with her arms wrapped around her baby 
doll, so tight both of 'em waking up Mama and Daddy way before daylight 
And Grandma and Grandpa are looking young and full of life, just knowin' that 
their grandkids are gonna be alright 
And Mama and Daddy, they'll be waitin' up to answer ole Santa's call. 
"Cause tonight they ain't worried about the bills- Lord they're just lovin' it all
