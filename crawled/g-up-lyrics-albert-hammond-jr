Everyone would say 
Don't you know the way 
Follow what I do 
I have no clue, yes 
I guess 
I'll go on wondering Well everything's got to be 
Just what ought to be 
I'll make you see 
Soon you'll come with me, yes 
I guess 
I'll go on wondering As I change from left to strange 
I know, you might not come with me 
But please, let me sleep on it 
I'm not, ooh Man oh man 
We've come, far from everyone 
You are and I 
You are and I, yes 
I guess 
I'll keep it coming I, I fell for you 
Dreams are what you do 
A pull to me 
Smile and let it be, yes 
I guess 
I'll go wondering As I change from left to strange 
I know, you might not come with me 
But please, let me sleep on it 
I'm need my rest
