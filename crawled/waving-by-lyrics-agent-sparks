It's just me, the monkey, do as you say 
Put on showtunes for a play, control my brain 
Break my heart, tear out my spleen 
Teach me Go Outside 
Climb a tree with two broken feet 
Soon I start to cry to you in the sky 
You'll see me waving by It's just me, the monkey, do as you say 
Even dumb birds tease me for play 
I can't complain 
They're only pecking at my two broken feet 
While climbing up a tree 
I swipe one across the beak Now I'm finally free from you in the sky 
You'll see me waving by to you in the sky 
You'll see me waving by Don't tie me 
Don't lie to me 
Don't tie me If this is you with all your intentions 
Of us in the sky 
Til you see me waving by to you in the sky 
You'll see me waving by to you in the sky 
Did you hear me say goodbye? Yanis
