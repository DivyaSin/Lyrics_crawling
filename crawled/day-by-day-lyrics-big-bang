Oh, girl, I cry cry 
You're, my all, say goodbye bye 
Oh, my love, don't lie lie 
You're, my heart, say goodbye TRANSLATION Leave 
Yeah, Finally I realize that I am nothing without you 
I was so wrong, forgive me 
Ah ah ah ah 
[Verse 1] 
My broken heart like a wave 
My shaken heart like a wind 
My heart vanished like smoke 
It can't be removed like a tattoo 
I sigh deeply as if a ground is going to cave in 
Only dusts are piled up in my mind 
(say goodbye) 
[GD Rap] 
Yeah, I thought I wouldn't be able to live even one day without you 
But somehow I managed to live on (longer) than I thought 
You don't answer anything as I cry out "I miss you" 
I hope for a vain expectation but now it's useless 
[TOP Rap] 
What is it about that person next to you, did he make you cry? 
Dear can you even see me, did you forget completely? 
I am worried, I feel anxiety because I can't get close nor try to talk to you 
I spend long nights by myself, erasing my thoughts a thousand times 
[Chorus] 
Don't look back and leave 
Don't find me again and live (on) 
Because I have no regrets from loving you, take only the good memories 
I can bear it in some way 
I can stand in some way 
You should be happy if you are like this 
I become dull day by day (eh eh eh eh) 
Oh girl I cry, cry 
You're my all, say goodbye... 
[Verse 2] 
If we pass by each other on the street 
Act like you didn't see me and go the way you were walking to 
If you keep thinking about our past memories 
I might go look for you secretly 
[GD] Always be happy with him, (so) I won't ever get a different mind 
Even smallest regret won't be left out ever 
Please live well as if I should feel jealous 
[TOP] You should always be like that bright sky, like that white cloud 
Yes, you should always smile like that as if nothing happened 
[Repeat Chorus] 
[Bridge] 
I hope your heart feels relieved 
Please forget about me and live (on) 
Those tears will dry completely 
As time passes by 
[YB] It would've hurt less if we didn't meet at all (mm) 
Hope you will bury our promise of being together forever baby 
I pray for you 
[Repeat Chorus] 
Oh girl I cry, cry 
You're my all, say goodbye, bye 
Oh my love don't lie, lie 
You're my heart, say goodbye
