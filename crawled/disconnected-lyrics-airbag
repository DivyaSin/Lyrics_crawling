Disconnected Nothing keeps me here 
Leave this place before I drown 
Each day repeat again 
Keep in line don't complain Reach out 
I'm reaching out from here 
Fade away 
Fade and disappear Wasted 
Bored to death 
Disconnected 
Erase me now 
Wanting , Needing 
It's never too much, Never enough Reach out 
I'm reaching out from here 
Fade away 
Fade and disappear Burned out 
Dead inside 
I'm checking out 
I disconnect
