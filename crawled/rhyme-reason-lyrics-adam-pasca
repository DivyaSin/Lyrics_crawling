It's so cold 
Let's take flight 
Well, we won't need a net 
Hold on tight 
A new ride 
Is unveiled 
And we don't need to try 
So there's no way to fail A desperate look in our eyes 
Holding on to one another 
Holding on for all our lives 
Just letting go to discover 
Oh-h yeah 
Oh-h ooh It's okay 
To realize 
Being born into nothing, no one and nowhere 
It's all a surprise A desperate look in our eyes 
Holding on to one another 
Holding on for all our lives 
Just letting go to discover That love don't need a reason 
And love don't need a rhyme 
I'm standing here pleading 
While you just cover your eyes 
Yeah-ah-ah A desperate look in our eyes 
Holding on to one another 
Holding on for all our lives 
Just letting go to discover That love don't need a reason 
And love don't need a rhyme 
Said love don't need a reason 
And love don't need a rhyme 
I'm standing here pleading 
While you just cover your eyes 
Yeah-ah-ah 
Ooh-ooh-ohh It's so cold 
Let's take flight 
It's so cold 
Hold on tight
