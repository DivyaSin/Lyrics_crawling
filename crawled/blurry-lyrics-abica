I sit and listen It's my addiction 
Can't retort feelings cuz they're all missin 
Self confliction just creates twitching 
And no one is here to stop all my unhealthy traditions 
Look at them look at him look at her 
Look at everybody looking at me looking like a blur 
And the view is all distorted when opinions start to leak 
The ideas of public make my argument seem weak 
Take it to the streets speak my peace and stand up 
Cuz I'm not the only one here getting fucked 
I'm in love with the game or the product at least 
I'll never stop until I leave until quit until I Chorus 
Look at me tell me what I cannot see 
It gets more blurry everyday so show me or leave me 
I'll give it all to you just tell me what I can do 
Don't matter what I say so take me or leave me Can you tell me why I do the everything that I do 
Why we never sell out and we always stay true 
If you listen to my words then maybe you will see 
Sometimes I feel like you know me better than me 
I can write a track sit back and it will die 
But you give it life if I'm gone it will survive 
And I know what you need all that draws you in 
We are all the same we all love but we all sin 
And I get it and you won't 
And I need it but you don't 
Before you speak your mind take the time to think it out 
Cuz aint a doubt what this songs about Look at me tell me what I cannot see 
It gets more blurry everyday so show me or leave me 
I'll give it all to you just tell me what I can do 
Don't matter what I say so take me or leave me Yeah I get it you wanna fit in 
But your life don't suffice so you gotta pretend 
You're falling again I'm sorry but it's all in your head 
That imaginary honor that you try to defend 
You can follow the trends and try to swallow them up 
Or jump the bandwagon and just follow your gut 
But never the less, it's always the more 
Like your car is still in park and your pedals to the floor 
Now you're sitting worried flippin and blaming the dirty pistons 
When you know it's blurry vision that's making you look ridiculous 
Specks can't correct the vitamin A deficiency 
Tell me what you see cuz the curiosity is killing me Look at me tell me what I cannot see 
It gets more blurry everyday so show me or leave me 
I'll give it all to you just tell me what I can do 
Don't matter what I say so take me or leave me
