I be ticking like a time bomb ready to explode 
And when I do aint no telling how far Ima go 
I got a hair trigger attitude, watch what you say 
Beside I aint shot a stupid motherfucker all day 
Ive been waiting for the right time and this is it 
Let me introduce myself, mudface bitch 
Just another spirit jumping into the soul 
Of a well known killa that be out of control Chorus (x2) 
What are you gonna do 
(another face on the totem pole) 
When I get there 
(another face on the totem pole) 
Muddy Muddy This is my time to shine, Ima show you what Im made of 
Strong like a dinosaur but silly as some trippy drugs 
Smacking yall in the face with a laugh 
Funny bone of the totem pole, do the math 
Resurrected from the past on, 
Learn the history of these warriors because we may not last long 
The silhouettes you see are just thoughts of me 
Ready to open your mind and feed it energy Chorus (x2) My microphone is like an eagle feather very extinct 
Too hot to hold so dont even think about it 
Cant nobody do it like me cause Im just a ghost 
And I dont need to breathe faster than the blink of an eye 
Top notch speed, you cant see me 
I guess thats why Im so underground 
Cause a native like me dont be fucking around Chorus(x4)
