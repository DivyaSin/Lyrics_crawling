No more frustration, let's relax 
Give me every pleasure to the max 
Surrender all your kisses and don't hold back [Chorus] 
(You gotta) Love me right 
I need your loving tonight 
So just love me right 
And saatisfy my appetite 
Don't Bite Touch me like you touch your little teddy bear 
Give me satisfaction till I just don't care [Chorus]
