Switch on the TV, look at the screen 
Money for a Rolls or a washing machine 
I pay my money and I pay my rent 
But every day it's always spent 
Maybe it starts to be the same 
Look out the window and it starts to rain 
Someone is saying "it's time to die" 
Send us some money and I'll tell you why 
I'll tell you why 
Broken cars in the street 
Do you really want to eat? 
Do you need all these things that you see on the screen? 
I drive my car when i go home 
It's hidden somewhere in the words of a song 
I pay my stamps and I pay my tax 
But it's not working and that's a fact
