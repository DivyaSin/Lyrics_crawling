Taste, you left a bitter taste in my mouth 
That will never heal to sub-reveal 
Unkind, can never rewind 
You play the part that's so unreal 
Repercussions now pay the price Watch me walk away done talking now 
Pigeons burning yesterday, won't put them out 
Never heard a single word, done talking now 
Try to get through to me, it won't happen now I find that you'll get me back sevenfold, decisions in your life 
I find gonna get me back sevenfold, bury me alive 
You're always on the ride, your adversaries love the view 
Signed and sealed lost sight, cannot lead the blind 
You point your finger filled with steel, your future deal denied Watch me walk away done talking now 
Pigeons burning yesterday, won't put them out 
Never heard a single word, done talking now 
Try to get through to me, it won't happen now I find that you'll get me back sevenfold, decisions in your life 
I find gonna get me back sevenfold, bury me alive 
You've been riding so high on one big lie all these years 
Denied all my pride never thought you'd hear all these years So crystal clear your promising tears we all did these years 
All these years, all these years Watch me walk away done talking now 
Pigeons burning yesterday, it won't happen now 
I find that you'll get me back sevenfold, decisions in your life 
I find gonna get me back sevenfold, bury me alive 
(At the same time) Watch me walk away done talking now 
Pigeons burning yesterday, won't put them out 
Never heard a single word, done talking now 
Try to get through to me, it won't happen now I find that you'll get me back sevenfold, decisions in your life 
I find gonna get me back sevenfold, bury me alive Watch me walk away done talking now 
Pigeons burning yesterday, won't put them out 
Never heard a single word, done talking now 
Try to get through to me, it won't happen now Watch me walk away done talking now 
Pigeons burning yesterday, won't put them out 
Never heard a single word, done talking now 
Try to get through to me, it won't happen now Watch me walk away done talking now 
Pigeons burning yesterday, won't put them out 
Never heard a single word, done talking now 
Try to get through to me, it won't happen now
