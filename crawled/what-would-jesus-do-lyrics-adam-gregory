They stopped sayin prayers in school yesterday. 
Theres a boarded up, run down church, up on third-n-main. 
Missions over flowin, but the crime rate just keeps growing. 
I dont know when its gona stop, but man this world is all we got. What would Jesus do in times like this? 
Would he walk amoung the sinners, fall to his knees? 
Heal the sick? Save lost souls the way he used to? 
Would he throw up his hands and just walk away? 
Cry a tear for a world gone astray? 
I dont know, but God I wish in knew... 
What would Jesus do? What if he appeard right where you stand? 
Could you look him in the eye, reach out and take his hand? 
Show him how it seems in this place, day by day in his amazing grace. 
Its a heaven on earth, but man its tuff. So I have to ask, is it really enough? What would Jesus do in times like this? 
Would he walk amoung the sinners, fall to his knees? 
Heal the sick? Save lost souls the way he used to? 
Would he throw up his hands and just walk away? 
Cry a tear for a world gone astray? 
I dont know, but God I wish in knew... 
What would Jesus do?
