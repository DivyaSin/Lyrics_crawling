I was walking down the street 
With my guitar 
You pulled up next to me 
In your fancy car 
She said take me to the place 
Where your horses run free 
Baby if you know how to ride 
You can ride me Said if you wanna rock it 
Got a condom in my pocket 
She said baby you're they key 
So come and unlock it It's just that easy 
Just to please me (Chorus) So let's go baby 
You and me naked 
We can do it all night 
Love is crazy 
Let's go crazy 
We can do it all night 
We can do it all night 
Believe me girl Barely made it down the street I didn't get far 
It doesn't matter where I go there you are 
See this sexy fella dressed in black and red 
Girl you're so fucking cool in your shades that you wear yeah It's just that easy 
Just to please me (Chorus) So let's go baby 
You and me naked 
We can do it all night 
Love is crazy 
Let's go crazy 
We can do it all night 
We can do it all night 
Believe me girl Oh my goodness 
Oh my gracious 
Take me home down to the basement 
On the floor, on the pavement 
Wake the neighbors 
Let's make a statement 
Let 'em watch, let 'em stare 
Put your legs up in the air 
Smack that ass and pull your hair 
Take a picture, I don't care 
You play checkers, I'll play chess 
Then we'll see who moves the best 
You're the teacher, I'm the pet 
Shut up, let's have sex We can do it all night 
Believe me, believe me, believe me girl 
We can do it all night (Chorus) So let's go baby 
You and me naked 
We can do it all night 
Love is crazy 
Let's go crazy 
We can do it all night 
We can do it all night
