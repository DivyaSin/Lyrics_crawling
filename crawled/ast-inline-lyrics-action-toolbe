You hesitate, to procreate, your up to late, exaggerate 
You're such a find, they must be blind 
Your insides hallow, it's all been mined 
Now don't quit 
There are too many girls that help rotate the world 
Left for me to get 
They don't know me yet 
They only seem to leave after we've met Words resonate, they complicate, they deviate, In such a state 
I can't stand still, placebo pill 
Can't fix this heart if you break my will 
Then you shout 
Things in your head are left better unsaid 
What's that all about? 
It comes pouring out 
There's nothing left for you to doubt Now I missed the signs 
I'm failing to slow down and now it's passed me by I don't unwind 
Can't seem to find someone to be the last in line 
This trip is long won't someone help me drive Another day another night half dead 
I really didn't hear anything you said 
Its getting late I think it's probably time for bed 
And anything you wanna do is fine 
Hurry up before I change my mind 
I'm gonna change my mind Let's dominate, and aggravate, and terminate its going great 
You're wasting time, Its such a crime, You said it's ours, but it feels like mine 
I can't help but to love myself above all else 
How can I love you too? 
I don't know what to do Now I missed the signs 
I'm failing to slow down and now it's passed me by I don't unwind 
Can't seem to find someone to be the last in line 
This trip is long won't someone help me drive It just starts over and over and over and over
