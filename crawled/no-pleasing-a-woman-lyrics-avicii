All tied up being down on my knees 
With the weight of the world comin' down on me 
She say's there's always someone better waiting for her 
That I was so lucky to get her All tied up being down on my knees 
With the weight of the world comin' down on me 
She say's there's always someone better waiting for her 
I was so lucky that I get her You can go high, I wanna cry 
I wonder why all my tears are dry 
Just don't care, I show her I care 
I got nothin' left to spare Wonder why I try 
Wonder why nothin' pleases a woman 
Wonder why I try 
Wonder why nothin' pleases a woman 
Nothin' pleases a woman 
There's just no pleasing a woman
