Look at yourself in the mirror 
Tell me do you like what you see now 
What will it take to get things clearer 
And break the back of the demons on you now Cause you're winding down 
Growing out 
Oh all your words are out 
And hold onto Cause its all you found 
Strolling out 
The door 
Without even saying goodbye (chorus) 
Just go 
Just go without me 
You'd be better off without me 
Just go ahead and doubt me Just go 
Just go without me 
I was the only one who cared about me 
You'd be better off without me Look at yourself in the mirror 
Tell me do you like what you've become 
All the question my heart 
And all the things undone Cause you're winding down 
Growing out 
Oh all your words are out 
And hold onto Cause its all you found 
Strolling out 
The door 
Without even saying goodbye (chorus) 
Just go 
Just go without me 
You'd be better off without me 
Just go ahead and doubt me Just go 
Just go without me 
I was the only one who cared about me 
You'd be better off without me When so much means so little 
And your lifes took you know little 
Oh inside a war 
You just can't seem to win When so much means so little 
And your world is upside down 
What can you do to clear yourself (chorus) 
Just go 
Just go without me 
You'd be better off without me 
Just go ahead and doubt me Just go 
Just go without me 
I was the only one who cared about me 
You'd be better off without me Yeah Ah oh ah oh ah oh-h Ah oh ah oh ah oh-h Ah oh ah oh ah oh-h
