when i was fifteen 
i knew that the world was our tv 
we were dying out there 
thriving on the streets 
i was fifteen 
i knew i fucking lost the choice in appeal 
well i paid destruction 
found decay in the comfort of the disarray 
will you buy the ticket, take the ride? woah woah woah 
journey through this hell with me 
woah woah woah 
broken bones and sorrow 
woah woah woah 
journey through this hell with me 
woah woah woah 
im gonna you death and show you life obscene now its been fifteen years 
most of us are gone or dead or in jail 
well i found solution, paid the price 
in the comfort of a cold device 
will you buy the ticket, take the ride? woah woah woah 
journey through this hell with me 
woah woah woah 
broken bones and sorrow 
woah woah woah 
journey through this hell with me 
woah woah woah 
im gonna you death and show you life obscene we all live in fear 
afraid of who we can be 
we all live in fear 
afraid of what we are 
we can shed our fear 
we will shed our fear woah woah woah 
journey through this hell with me 
woah woah woah 
broken bones and sorrow 
woah woah woah 
take a trip through hell with me 
woah woah woah 
take a trip through hell
