All the time I wanted you to see 
What you would lose if you gave up on me 
All the time I wanted you to understand 
That Im the only one who could ever hold your hand 
Every day I pray for you to see the light 
Remember how we were, how it felt so right 
Every word you said I believed 
Little did I know that love would bring deceit (Chorus) 
I said, You promised to be real and then you lied 
You said, I never made a promise and then I sighed 
I said, You promised me love and then you smiled 
You said, I never made a promise and then I cried I remember the battles you fought 
To keep other lovers from my thoughts 
I remember the whispers in my ears 
The ones of love you wished for me to hear (Chorus) 
I said, You promised to be real and then you lied 
You said, I never made a promise and then I sighed 
I said, You promised me love and then you smiled 
You said, I never made a promise and then I cried How can you stand so proud? 
You left me broken by the door 
In the end youll come back 
And I wont need you anymore 
(repeat) Right here, right now, I crave you in my sleep 
The wounds you made in my heart 
Couldnt possibly be too deep 
You cross my path once in a while 
We both smile and wave a hand 
If anyone can see the pain I feel I know for sure you can 
They say this pain will slip away and fade 
I dont know who theyre kidding, this isnt my masquerade 
I will always love you, I will always care, that will never die 
But for now Ill smile in daylight, but under the covers I will cry (Chorus) 
I said, You promised to be real and then you lied 
You said, I never made a promise and then I sighed 
I said, You promised me love and then you smiled 
You said, I never made a promise and then I cried
