I wake up and I'm sober don't even know you anymore 
I'm drunk on a feeling lost in believing I was sure 
I don't care what you had to say, damn words get in the way 
I don't wanna know I know there will come a time 
When I look you in the eyes and say I told you so And I promise you this, 
You're gonna miss me, miss me 
As long as you live 
You are going to miss me, miss me oh Set me up for the falling, 
Gave me no warning you were gone 
Let me down I was reeling, 
Can't believe what you have done 
Go do what you've gotta do, 
Damn words will follow you 
Everywhere you go 
And I know there will come a time 
When I look you in the eyes and say I told you so And I promise you this, 
You're gonna miss me, miss me 
As long as you live 
You are going to miss me, miss me oh I believe in my heart when something is wrong, say its wrong, 
I can deal with the part that something is wrong, 
If we both stay strong! 
I know there will come a time 
When I look you in the eyes and say I told you so And I promise you this, 
You're gonna miss me, miss me 
As long as you live 
You are going to miss me, miss me oh I wake up and I'm sober
