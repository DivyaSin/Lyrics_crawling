I was alone 
I was made of stone, you took me home 
We built a world, a world for us 
We flew like birds, a new beginning It's better, better, better 
You keeping me together, gether, gether 
You know that I will never, never, never 
Try to pull you down, down 
Lover, lover, lover you can always be here 
I'll take cover 
You know that I will never, never, never 
Leave you all alone 
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you 
If it wasn't for you I was a fool always keeping a distance 
If I'd ever know, oh 
You found a way, I thought I always stayed the same 
Because of you, I saw a new beginning It's better, better, better 
You keeping me together, gether, gether 
You know that I will never, never, never 
Try to pull you down, down 
Lover, lover, lover you can always be here 
I'll take cover 
You know that I will never, never, never 
Leave you all alone 
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you 
If it wasn't for you 
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you 
Nothing if it wasn't for you
