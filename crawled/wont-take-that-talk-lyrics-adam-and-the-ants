I won't take that talk from no one 
I won't take that talk from no one 
Inside it makes you ill 
And the pity of it all you're fighting 
You don't see it any more you're fighting 
A size 12 fight in a size 10 war I said I'd never forget you 
And I didn't and I never will 
Have a dance meet a girl you dig 
Acting like the second coming Oh words are only words 
Said another way 
Got to stop treating people 
Like they have no feelings 
Stop treating people 
Like they have no meaning I won't take that talk from no one 
I won't take that talk from no one 
Inside it makes you ill 
Soft as a mother's love 
Her hands were cool and graceful 
And you'll get no complaints from me I said I'd never forget you 
And I didn't and I never will 
Have a dance meet a girl you dig 
Behaving like the second coming Words were only words 
So I tell myself 
Got to stop treating people 
Like they have no feelings 
Stop treating people 
Like they have no meaning
