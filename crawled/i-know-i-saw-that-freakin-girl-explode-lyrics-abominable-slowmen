I been standing here for hours 
Staring at all the bunny flowers 
That pop up when you come around 
Hoping you'll pluck 'em off the ground 
And I feel my heart explode 
When that girl walks down the road I been standing here for hours 
Putting up with November showers 
Pony rabbit nibblin' at my shoelace 
I don't mind cuz I'm dreamin' of your pretty face 
And I felt my heart explode 
When that rain turned into snow Oh no! Woopsy daisy! 
Oh, she drives me crazy! 
Takes out my brain and replaces it with candy! 
Oh by gosh! By golly! 
Holy moly, Molly! 
Pining for you is my modus operandi! 
I been standing here for hours 
Throwin back a couple-a whiskey sours 
Setting off honey fire-crackers 
Thinking when she comes it won't impact her 
And I felt my heart explode 
When I saw that girl explode
