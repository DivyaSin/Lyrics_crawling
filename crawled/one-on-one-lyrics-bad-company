The look on this face makes me? for you 
You spin me 'round, you can make a strong man weak I can't help myself this time, I just can't say no Hey hey, bless my soul, I'm under your spell and I can't let go 
You got me living in a fantasy, fascination's taken hold of me 
Hey hey, I've gotta go, I want you so bad that I can't let go 
If I could take just a little bit of time, see you down the line Well, I'll see you, yeah It's one on one, me and you 
There's nowhere to run, I wanna see it through 
Run and hide, a fire burns
