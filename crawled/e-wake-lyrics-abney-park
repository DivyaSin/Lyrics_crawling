spoken: My father says that almost the whole world is asleep. Everybody you know, everybody you see, everybody you talk to. He says that only a few people are awake, and they live in a state of constant, total amasement. Debbie dates daily with a boy for every finger 
She leaves with one now and leaves another left to linger 
Coldly Debbie tells me it's a world of give & take 
But I say Debbie, bring it closer to the wake In today's society, too little anxiety falls in the right place 
People hurting each another, no care for another 
Can you stand your own face? Listen to me now? 
People gotta stop hurting themselves, STOP, 
now, now, now, now bring it closer to the wake 
Listen to me now, STOP, now, now, now, now bring it closer to the wake Billy blows bubbles that are filled with marijuana 
To rebel from all the troubles he was chained to by his mama 
Sadly Billy tells me that his happiness is fake 
But I say Billy, bring it closer to the wake In today's society, too little anxiety falls in the right place 
People hurting each another, no care for another 
Can you stand your own face? Listen to me now? 
People gotta stop hurting themselves, STOP, 
now, now, now, now bring it closer to the wake 
Listen to me now, STOP, now, now, now, now bring it closer to the wake Jason jets his jag up to speeds that's past eleven 
Jason buys a house that makes him feel like he's in heaven 
Bills been paying Jason, Bills friends are Jason's take 
But I just talked to Bill, Jason's further from the wake In today's society, too little anxiety falls in the right place 
People hurting each another, no care for another 
Can you stand your own face? Listen to me now? 
People gotta stop hurting themselves, STOP, 
now, now, now, now bring it closer to the wake In today's society, too little anxiety falls in the right place 
People hurting each another, no care for another 
Can you stand your own face? Listen to me now? 
People gotta stop hurting themselves, STOP, 
now, now, now, now bring it closer to the wake 
Listen to me now, STOP, now, now, now, now bring it closer to the wake Now you & I have been through much, we've both had Debbie's problem 
And we've both used Bills eyes to find our troubles & try to solve them 
But let's not use each other, for Jason's world was fake 
Only we can work together to bring us closer to the wake spoken: ...I'm not gonna tell you who you are. I don't know who you are. I know who wants to know. It's taken me all my life to find out who I am and I'm tired of your....
