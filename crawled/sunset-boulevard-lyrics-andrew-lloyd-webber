Sure I came out here to make my name 
Wanted my pool my dose of fame 
Wanted my parking space at Warners 
But after a year Of one room hell 
A Murphy bell 
A rancid smell 
Wallpaper peeling at the corners Sunset Boulevard 
Twisting boulevard 
Secret of the rich 
A little scary 
Sunset Boulevard 
Tempting boulevard 
Waiting there to swallow the unwary Dreams are not enough to win a war 
Out here they're always keeping score 
Beneath the tan 
The battle rages 
Smile a rented smile Fill someone's glass 
Kiss someone's wife 
Kiss someone's ass 
We do whatever pays the wages Sunset Boulevard 
Headline boulevard 
Getting here is only the beginning 
Sunset Boulevard 
Jackpot boulevard 
Once you've won, you have to go on winning You think I've sold out 
Damn right I've sold out 
I've just been waiting 
For the right offer Comfortable quarters 
Regular rations 
Twenty four hour 
Five star room service And if I'm honest 
I like the lady 
I can't help being 
Touched by her folly I'm treading water 
Taking her money 
Watching her sun set 
Well I'm a writer LA's changed a lot over the years 
Since those brave goldrush pioneers 
Came in their creaky covered wagons 
Far as they could go 
End of the line Their dreams were yours 
Their dreams were mine 
But in those dreams 
Were hidden dragons Sunset Boulevard 
Frenzied boulevard 
Swamped with every kind of false emotion 
Sunset Boulevard 
Brutal boulevard 
Just like you we'll wind up in the ocean She was sinking fast 
I threw a rope 
Now I have suits 
And she is hope 
It seemed an elegant solution One day this must end 
It isn't real 
Still I'll enjoy a hearty meal 
Before tomorrow's execution Sunset Boulevard 
Ruthless boulevard 
Destination for the stony hearted 
Sunset Boulevard 
Lethal boulevard 
Everyone's forgotten how they started 
Here on Sunset Boulevard
