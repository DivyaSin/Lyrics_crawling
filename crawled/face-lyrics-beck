Love leaps into motion 
Trying to keep hanging on 
When I need reason to wake up 
I find you turning 
Laughing and smiling Love you girl but sometimes 
I feel like you leave me behind 
Now you don't have to mind it 
I find you shining 
Everyday by day Sing it up, my sister 
In this world where everyone is lonely 
Everything will be fine someday Remember 
Playing in a backyard 
Hiding myself in your eyes 
Since you never could catch me 
I find you crying 
Weeping in darkness Sing it up, my sister 
In this world where everyone is lonely 
Everything will be fine someday 
Some other day Love leaps into motion 
Trying to keep hanging on 
When I need a reason to wake up 
Find you turning 
Laughing and smiling Sing it up, my sister 
In this world where everyone is lonely 
Everything will be fine 
Some other day Sing it up, my sister 
In this world where everyone is lonely 
Everything will be fine someday 
Some other day 
Some other day
