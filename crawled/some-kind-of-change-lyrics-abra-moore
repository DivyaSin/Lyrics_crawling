I needed to blame somebody 
I wanted you to be the one 
Said I needed to blame somebody 
I wanted you to be the one Sometimes the wind brushes me back 
Sometimes I feel faint 
And sometimes I just don't know Be alone sweet life 
The wind cries in my head, cries 
Sometimes I wanna go I wanna hold you up, hold you up high above me 
I wanted you to be the one 
I wanna lift you up, lift you up high in the sky 
I wanted you to be the one High You're gonna hold on 
And never gonna, never let me go 
You're gonna hold on, hold on You're gonna hold on 
And never gonna, never let me go 
You're gonna hold on, hold on I needed you, I needed you 
I needed you, I needed you 
I needed you, I needed you 
I needed you I needed you, I needed you 
I needed you, I needed you 
I needed you, I needed you 
I needed you I was looking for some kind of change
