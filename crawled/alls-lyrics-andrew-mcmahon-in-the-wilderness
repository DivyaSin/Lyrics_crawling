Pouring rain in Tuscon, Arizona 
Checked into the Congress hotel 
Met the band in a bar next to the lobby 
Looking for another story I could tell When I left town you were heading for the altar 
And I told you I'd be back before too long 
I cut my hair and I found me a new girlfriend 
Thought a broken heart could write a perfect song 
And it did and I was right so now you're gone You echo in the halls 
I feel your shadow on this empty stage 
I hear your music through the walls 
I see your picture on the blank page, oh 
You echo in the halls Play the show, left another message 
Booked a ticket for tomorrow in Tempe 
Three AM, I'm doing cartwheels down the hallway 
I've been drinking since the day I set you free 
But on this airport morning will you wait for me? You echo in the halls 
I feel your shadow on this empty stage 
I hear your music through the walls 
I see your picture on the blank page 
You echo in the halls You echo in the halls 
I feel your shadow on this empty stage 
I hear your music through the walls 
I see your picture on the blank page, oh 
You echo in the halls 
I feel your shadow on this empty stage 
I hear your music through the walls 
I see your picture on the blank page, oh 
You echo in the halls
