WRITTEN BY MICHAEL BACON Well you say you'll climb the highest mountain 
In the whole damn world 
I think you will yes I'm sure you will 
But you may need some guy you know 
Down at base camp far below 
I could help a lot yes and maybe not Chorus 
Don't lose me boy 
Now that you've found your way 
Leave me some light of day 
So these old eyes can see their way 
Off you go and out the door 
Don't you look back any more 
Between the pain and the joy 
Don't lose me boy 
Don't you lose me boy So you say you'll be the next Hendrix 
Clapton or Buddy Guy 
I think you will yes I'm sure you will 
But who you got on that second guitar 
Background vocals electric sitar and changing strings 
I can do lots of things CHORUS You'll probably roll your eyes 
And tell me to lighten up 
I think I will some day I'm sure I will 
But this song is for your mom and me 
Just before we set you free 
So listen if you can 
Boy take it like a man CHORUS
