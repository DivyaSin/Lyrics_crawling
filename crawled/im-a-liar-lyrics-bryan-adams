Maybe I told you right from the start 
You can have me but you can't have my heart 
It's easy enough to say but I couldn't care less Ya, I mighta told you, you were on my mind 
Guess I talked a pretty good line 
Hey, I could talk all day but I just can't confess That I'm a liar 
I'm a victim of desire 
I'm a moth into the fire 
Yea, I'm over my head, forget what I said Tell ya, I'm a liar 
I'm just walkin' on the wire 
That I couldn't get much higher 
Yea, I'm over my head, forget what I said 
Baby, I'm a liar Yea, when I told you I was hard to pin down 
You know I was just messin' around 
Guess you know by now that, that's just my way And if you want stories, well I got a few 
But hey, "This is the truth I swear to you" 
Yea, how many more times do you want me to say? That I'm a liar 
I'm a victim of desire 
I'm a moth into the fire 
But I'm over my head, forget what I said Tell ya, I'm a liar 
I'm just walkin' on the wire 
But I couldn't get much higher 
Yea, I'm over my head, forget what I said 
Baby, I'm a liar 
I'm a liar Yea 
If I told you to go away 
Baby, you can't believe a thing I say 
Listen I'm a liar 
I'm a victim of desire 
I'm a moth into the fire 
Yea, I'm over my head, forget what I said Baby, I'm a liar 
I'm just walkin' on the wire 
No, I couldn't get much higher 
But I'm over my head, forget what I said 
Baby, I'm a liar 
I'm a liar But I'm over my head, forget what I said 
I'm a liar

I can't help myself 
I'm a liar 
But I'm over my head, forget what I said 
But you can't believe a single thing I say
