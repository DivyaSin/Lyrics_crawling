Dance to sound or delight 
Hold these parts with her 
All her love in your hands 
Could be mine forever Taking it slowly now 
Common affairs 
Are weaker than you know 
I'm older 
And maybe wiser 
I'm old enough to 
Save something Save, something 
Save, something, yeah 
Save, something 
Save, something, yeah
