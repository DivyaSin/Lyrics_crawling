I shot the wolf with a silver bullet 
He didn't think that I would pull it 
Tried to block the path I was headed 
I'm tryin' to get back on my good foot 
They scratching the back of the good book 
Shit little nigga that's a good look 
Black hooded 
40 acres of land developed, 40 acres wooded 
So much wrong we don't know where to put it 
Follow the rainbow, a pot to cook with 
I'll call Paul to Bank it 
40 tails up at the banquet 
Plus he had Snow White's blanket 
All they talk was body language 
Don't prison the pauper 
They both got vanquished 
T-t-t-time to die, we causin' damage Speedway Sonora 
It's just somewhere to fly 
It's just a sky like 
Armies race 
Somewhere way up high 
On the sight lines 
The concrete 
All the ways (Speedway) 
Everyday 
Everyday Ay yo 
I paved the path many warriors walk on 
Black hawk and my plague is stomped on 
Lightning bolt strikes the horizon 
Deep in the woods spent time with the wise men 
Slightly on site and my chi energy, it keeps on risin' Bob the Huntsman, sip tiger bone (hahaha) 
Bob the Huntsman, sip tiger bone

It's just somewhere to fly

We say it's alright 
I wonder where you hide 
Across the sky 
No boundaries babe 
It's just a read you lie 
Summer's wide eyed 
Bomb bombardier 
All the way

It's just somewhere to fly 
Across the sky like 
Found dream state 
I wonder where you hide 
It's always bright light 
Surrounding All the way
