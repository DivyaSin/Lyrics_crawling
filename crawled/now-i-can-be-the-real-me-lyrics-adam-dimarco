Walls, you can build them all around 
Just to shield a piece of your world out of sight 
And I needed you to look through 
To the shadows I tried to bury inside 
Drawing them out to the light 
You showed me I got nothing here to hide Now I can be who I am 
Now I can stand up for everyone to see 
Taking this life in my hands 
Now I can be 
Now I can be the real me Free, of defenses, finally 
And I'm somehow 
safer than I've ever felt You, tend to be you 
Now I know I don't have to be someone else 
When I'm with you, I'm just myself Now I can be who I am 
Now I can stand up for everyone to see 
Taking this life in my hands 
Now I can be 
Now I can be the real me Now I can be the real me 
Now I can be the real me 
Now I can be 
Now I can be the real me Walls, you can build them all around 
But you showed me I've got nothing here to hide Now I can be who I am 
Now I can stand up for everyone to see 
Taking this life in my hands 
Now I can be 
Now I can be the real me Now I can be the real me 
Now I can be the real me 
Now I can be 
Now I can be the real me
