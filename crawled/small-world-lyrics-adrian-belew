Someday when I'm flying far away 
Somewhere over Germany 
Someday when you least expect 
I'll be singing in your hair Once upon a time in a different era 
When great fat Cadillacs roamed the earth Oh, it's a small world on a two-inch t.v. 
Yes, it's a small world on a two-inch t.v. screen 
Small world Someday when I'm lost in a dream 
Out my window in the clouds 
Someday you'll be doing your gardening 
Hear me singing out loud Once upon a time in a different age 
Of drive-in movies and luxury trains Oh, it's a small world on a two-inch t.v. 
Yes, it's a small world on a two-inch t.v. screen 
Small world Big doors opening 
Big doors are opening wide 
Glass of red wine 
Wine.
