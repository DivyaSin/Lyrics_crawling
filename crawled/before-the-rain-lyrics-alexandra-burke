Once upon a time there was a story so unreal is hard to tell 
And no one seems to understand 
Once within my mind there was a name that I can't even start to spell 
Cause I don't wanna break again All I do and all I am 
Everything's because of him My head my heart my honesty 
My self and I with all of me 
I would give more than I had 
But all I had was nothing of head 
My voice my eyes will never see 
The way they looked and spooked of me 
No where I can go to regain 
Whatever I was before the rain Every single time I close my eyes 
My mind goes back to where he was 
Cause she don't wanna ???? to stay(no no) 
Love is not a crime 
But it shure feels like doing time 
My mind is shown that she don't wanna 
Let me in, no And all I do and all I am 
Everything's because of him My head my heart my honesty 
My self and I with all of me 
I would give more than I had 
But all I had was nothing of head 
My voice my eyes will never see 
The way they looked and spooked of me 
No where I can go to regain 
Whatever I was before the rain Whatever I was before the rain Once upon a time there was a story so unreal is hard to tell 
And no one seems to understand My head my heart my honesty 
My self and I with all of me 
I would give more than I had 
But all I had was nothing of head 
My voice my eyes will never see 
The way they looked and spooked of me 
No where I can go to regain 
Whatever I was before the rain Oh Oh Oh Whatever I was before the rain(x 2)
