That's me right there on the corner, listening to Wu in my Walkman 
Neon lights at the water, reflecting the city of I'm lost in 
That's me right there on the corner, I one day would be leaving 
For a dream that I didn't have, that I'd one day would believe in 
Strange how the same place I ran from's 
The same place I think of whenever the chance comes 
It's inevitable cause wherever I go I hear echoes of a thousand screams 
As I lay me down to sleep 
There's a black hole deep inside of me 
Reminding me, that I that I've lost my backbone 
Somewhere in Stockholm 
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm I'm from a place where we never, openly show our emotions 
We drown our sorrows in bottemless bottles and leave them to float in the ocean 
I'm from a place where we never, seperate people from people 
Some generalize, but in general I still believed that we are treated as equals 
My father, my mother, my sister, my brother, my friends and my family's there 
My hope and my money, my innocence in a sense, almost lost everything here 
Rught where I was founded, is right where I'll be found dead 
The streets of my backbone until I get back home I hear echoes of a thousand screams 
As I lay me down to sleep 
There's a black hole deep inside of me 
Reminding me, that I that I've lost my backbone 
Somewhere in Stockholm 
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns not of the city, but out of the 'burbs 
A river that's just dying of thirst, I am a reverend lying the church 
A cracking in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen 
I promise that never was kept, one of those moments you'll never forget 
I am that feeling inside the one we all know but can't really describe 
I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still Somewhere in Stockholm, but I'm not alone 
Don't have to get by on my own, I'm finally home 
Hemma I Stockholm I hear echoes of a thousand screams 
As I lay me down to sleep 
There's a black hole deep inside of me 
Reminding me, that I that I've lost my backbone 
Somewhere in Stockholm 
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm
