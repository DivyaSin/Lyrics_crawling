[Intro - Ace Hood] 
Okay 
Camera man we going to do like the thirty six frame, you heard me? 
It's movie time homie 
Mister Hood [Chorus - Joe Boom] 
I jump up out the Bent', I'm stepping outside 
There's cameras everywhere 
Yeah I'm about to go live 
Louis V. shades, to cover my eyes 
The paparazzi flashing, I'm about to go live 
About to go live, live, live 
About to go live, live, live 
You want to be fly? I'm on a G5 
And everybody broke, ask me worldwide [Verse 1 - Ace Hood] 
Okay, hello to the money, good morning to the bread 
What up to you bitches? Bring me breakfast in the bed 
Hit a button on the blinds, watch the curtains roll back 
Took a look into the mirror, they not fucking wore of that 
Better cut it up a notch, put more diamonds on my chest 
Bigger stones in my ears, hundred carats in the Lex' 
Put more horses in the 'Rari, nasty as calamari 
Rolling out with a Barbie, hiding from paparazzi 
Tell them I'm going live, Mister Life-of-the-Party 
Keep my jewels in the cooler, maybe I know the mula 
Pull up in something European so they can flash 
In three, two, one, I'm going live on that ass [Chorus] [Verse 2 - Ace Hood] 
Now tell them tune in, I'm back at it again 
Want to be fly like I grew up in the wind 
I'm a bad motherfucker, arrogant as I could be 
Fresh up out of Louis, have them wishing they was me 
I'm sorry that you not, I'm way too fucking hot 
And everywhere I go you better know I'm showing out 
Got my diamonds on check, carry cash no checks 
Want that Beamer not the Lex', now you know I'm finna flex 
It go three, two, one, you either ready or you not 
Make it feel like Hollywood, every time I'm stepping out 
Custom cameras over here, and you know they over there 
Bad bitches in my bed, smell the money in the air [Chorus]
