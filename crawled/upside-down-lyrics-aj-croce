You say, you found the road to Heaven but you don't fly 
You say, it?s inner peace that get?s you high 
You say that you don't need emotion, I wonder why 
Is it just too hard for you to cry? What you need to do 
Is change your point of view Turn it upside down and hold on tight 
Turn it upside down, know wrong or right 
Turn it upside down, I think you'll find 
On the other side, it?s upside down 
On the other side, it?s upside down See the storm around us raging, and you'll stay dry 
As if the laws of nature don't apply 
We see that nothing lasts forever and good things die 
Still it seems to come as a surprise What you need to do 
Is change your point of view Turn it upside down and hold on tight 
Turn it upside down, know wrong or right 
Turn it upside down, I think you'll find 
On the other side, it?s upside down 
On the other side, it?s upside down What you need to do 
Is change your point of view Turn it upside down, turn it upside down 
Turn it upside down and hold on tight 
Turn it upside down, know wrong or right 
Turn it upside down, I think you'll find 
On the other side, it?s upside down 
On the other side, it?s upside down 
On the other side, it?s upside down
