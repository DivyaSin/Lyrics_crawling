Here is the world, they try to sell you 
Here is the ache of which you ate 
They'll have your eyes and they will hang your view so high Minus the world, we find forgiveness 
Minus the world, she find herself 
Minus the walls, she wouldn't hang her view 
So lieu... What if their eyes, shadow and plagued those creatures we portrayed 
Born into this, unbearable mess 
This bankruptcy her and I have left Paradox can't run out on me... 
Minus need, you are growing cold 
Minus believe, we are growing old 
Minus her face, she is unspoken 
Minus her hand, she is clean 
But in filth, we destroy purity Words conceived.... 
Sorrow and shame, Tangled and named, Indebted endlessly 
Enter the day 
Of depravity 
She'll have to make believe tranquility Minus the world, we leave 
Minus the world, we leave 
Minus the world, we leave.....
