You know an apple a day 
Won't keep the doctor away Welcome to the cliches 
welcome to the part 
Where we want to finish 
What we can't start 
Come and get me Just don't miss the water 
Until the well is dry 
You got to learn walking 
After you can fly 
Come and get me What goes in, will get out 
What goes up, comes right down 
We go up, we go up, we go up [Chorus] 
You know an apple a day 
(You know an apple a day) 
Won't keep the doctor away 
(Won't keep the doctor away) 
Were never taught what we teach 
And won't practice what we preach 
You know an apple a day 
(You know an apple a day) 
Won't keep my troubles away 
(Won't keep my troubles away) 
Once bitten bye, bye 
All the cliches is here to die Just eat all the people 
On your way up 
'Cause they will eat your heart out 
On your way down 
Come and get me Start what you can't finish 
Stick to what you can't 
Life is here to help us 
Get things out of hand 
Come and get us What goes in, will get out 
What goes up, comes right down 
We go up, we go up, we go up [Chorus] 'Cause you are what you're eating 
('Cause you are what you're eating) 
Don't stick to what's true 
(Don't stick to what's true) 
You are what you're eating 
('Cause you are what you're eating) 
Let it come as it came We are what we are (we are) 
What's build up will fall (will fall) 
Do what you want (what you want) 
And be happy, be happy, be happy You know an apple a day 
(You know an apple a day) 
Won't keep the doctor away 
(Won't keep the doctor away) 
Were never taught what we teach 
And won't practice what we preach 
You know an apple a day 
(You know an apple a day) 
Won't keep my troubles away 
(Won't keep my troubles away) 
Once bitten bye, bye 
All the cliches is here to die 'Cause you are what you're eating 
('Cause you are what you're eating) 
Don't stick to what's true 
(Don't stick to what's true) 
You are what you're eating 
(You are what you're eating) 
Let it come as it came We are what we are (we are) 
What's build up will fall (will fall) 
Do what you want 
And be happy
