On doorsteps and in alleyways 
I see these fools passed out 
At any time of the day 
Crashed out in a bed of piss 
Empty bottle cradled in their arms. So tell me 
Who's job is it to tend these few people? 
Back to self-sufficiency and respect 
I turn my head it puts chills in my heart 
If I give you some change to clear my mind 
Would I have played my part? 
There's a man who has a dream 
But never seems to make it 
'Cause everytime he gets some, someone tries to take it. A second chance at life, no one will give him 
In an alley wat is where he's livin' 
You see him there you walk by laughing and smirking 
Thinking to yourself it's only his fault, he ain't working. That might be true but it's only half the story so 
Kick back while we tell you his story. He came back from the war a veteran 
The only thing he learned to do was kill and shoot a gun. 
That comes in handy when you're fighting a war 
But when you came back to society you need much more. 
So all he had was terror in his mind 
No job skills so a job he couldn't find. 
The only thing he had was memories 
Of his friends being killed and crying and dying babies. So he grabbled bottle for an escape 
From all the mental torment that the war had made. 
Now you're calling him a bum 'cause he can't get none 
While you're sitting at home not willing to get some. Sharing and caring is what he needs now 
Some support for his marals, some help for his ego. 
So he can go to the top where every man can 
And all he really needs is a helping hand. So tell me 
Who's job is it to tend these few people? 
Back to self-sufficiency and respect 
I turn my head it puts chills in my heart 
If I give you some change to clear my mind 
Would I have played my part? Cold dark and lonely 
Broken and abused 
Homeless hungry and hated 
Forgotten 
Only remembered on the streets 
And they're down, down and out.
