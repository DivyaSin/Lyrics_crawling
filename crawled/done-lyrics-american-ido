You've been wearing that crown and tearing me down 
It's been a while since you treated me right 
You strung me along for far too long cause I never gave up the fight 
Until now 
Its gonna hit you hard til you see stars 
Its gonna put you through a world of hurt 
Oh I don't believe in getting even but getting what you deserve 
Oh my, Oh my Mama always told me that I should play nice 
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice 
I'm through with you 
You're one bridge I'd like to burn 
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn 
I'm through with you 
LA DEE DA 
I don't wanna be your just for fun 
Don't wanna be under your thumb 
All I wanna be is DONE. You crossed the line too many times 
I'm gonna put you in your place 
You play with dynamite, don't be surprised 
When I blow up in your face 
Oh my, Oh my Mama always told me that I should play nice 
But she didn't know you when she gave me that advice 
I'm through with you 
You're one bridge I'd like to burn 
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn 
I'm through with you 
LA DEE DA 
I don't wanna be part of your fun 
Don't wanna be under your thumb 
All I wanna be is DONE. With your selfish ways 
And all the games you play 
I'm through with you 
And everything you say Mama told me that I should play nice 
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice Mama always told me that I should play nice 
But she didn't know you when she gave me that advice 
I'm through with you 
You're one bridge I'd like to burn 
Scatter the ashes, smash the urn 
I'm through with you 
LA DEE DA 
I don't wanna be your just for fun 
Don't wanna be under your thumb 
All I wanna be is DONE. 
All I wanna be is DONE. I wanna be DONE.
