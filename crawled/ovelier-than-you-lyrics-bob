Maybe one day we can go 
Hand in hand down a golden road 
And if I get there before you go 
I'll be waiting at the door 
In the future hopefully 
We'll be together you and me 
Don't you worry baby please 
'Cause honestly If I could rewind 
Both the hands of time 
Still I would never find 
A lovelier design 
Than you Nothings lovelier than you 
Nothings lovelier than you 
Nothings lovelier than you 
Nothings lovelier than you Maybe one day girl I pray 
We could float off to space 
Hold my hand I'll lead the way 
I won't let go or fall a stray 
Ain't no if, buts and maybes 
Your my baby my lady 
Don't you worry baby please 
'Cause honestly If I could rewind 
Both the hands of time 
Still I would never find 
A lovelier design 
Than you I'm dangerously, dangerously, dangerously in love 
I love her more than I love myself 
and still that ain't enough 
If this is a dream I don't want to wake up 
We go together like the tub and the shower head above 
Not even thousands and thousands of miles 
Could amount to my love I'd have countless sky miles 
I'd climb up a mountain climb right back down 
I'd run across the world and jog back round 
Noun and a verb is just a sound 
And a word is not profound 
Enough to show my urge for her smile 
I'd shout on a curb with a loud speaker 
'Til the entire town heard how I felt and I'm out Nothings lovelier than you 
Nothings lovelier than you 
Nothings lovelier than you 
Nothings lovelier than you Maybe one day we can go 
Hand in hand down a golden road 
And if I get there before you go 
I'll be waiting at the door 
In the future hopefully 
Well be together you and me 
Don't you worry baby please 
'Cause honestly If I could rewind 
Both the hands of time 
Still I would never find 
A lovelier design 
Than you
