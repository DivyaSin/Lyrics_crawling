I like the way we are, I love what we've become 
When I'm in your arms, I know I've found the one 
I love your kiss-me-mouth and your static touch 
It's just the way you are, makes me feel so much, yeah No one could ever know what we're like alone 
Rollin' round like rain, we're a midnight storm 
And like a river rising I feel it through your skin 
When we're together, oh, I never want it to end, no I thought I'd seen everything till I saw you 
I thought I'd been everywhere till I'd been with you 
I thought that everyone knew what I knew 
I thought I'd seen everything till I saw you I like the way we are, its like a raging fire 
Burning up the night, burning with desire 
You're such a sweet temptation, you know I can't resist 
Electricity, hey, every time we kiss Oh, I thought I'd seen everything till I saw you 
I thought I'd been everywhere till I'd been with you, yeah 
I thought that everyone knew what I knew 
I thought I'd seen everything till I saw you 
Yeah, I saw right through, oh, I see you coming Hey, I thought I'd seen everything till I saw you 
I thought I'd been everywhere till I'd been with you 
I thought that everyone knew what I knew 
I thought I'd been everywhere 
I thought I'd seen everything, oh, till I saw you Oh, all over and right through, yeah 
I thought I'd seen everything, till I saw you 
Like a midnight storm, you left me all alone 
It's like a raging fire, I thought I'd seen everything, yeah 
Till I saw you
