I've got something to say 
I've probably left it too late 
I hope that you understand Lately I've been losing my faith 
In things you said we would do 
In who I'd be without you I find it hard to tear me away 
We've been comfy so long 
On the couch in your arms But I've got a lot on my plate 
You've got to see it this way 
I need a second to chew And I don't know where I stand 
I don't know who I am in all of these plans It's such a long way to come: from intimate and alone 
From 'like the back of my hand' to 'lovers once long ago' 
I wish I wanted to stay and nothing we couldn't do 
I never thought that I'd lose, never thought I'd lose you I was taken aback 
I guess that I knew 
I felt you drifting away Still I've been doing just fine 
I'm slowly coming out of my cage You must be touching his chest 
How haunting 
I can't believe that he isn't me Oh, where on Earth do I go? 
I've waited here so long 
I dunno who I will be And I don't know where I stand 
I don't know who I am outside all of these plans It's such a long way to come: from intimate and alone 
From 'like the back of my hand' to 'lovers once long ago' 
I wish you wanted to stay and nothing we couldn't do 
I never thought that I'd lose, never thought I'd lose you It's such a long way to come: from intimate and alone 
From 'like the back of my hand' to 'lovers once long ago' 
I wish you wanted to stay and nothing we couldn't do 
I never thought that I'd lose, never thought I'd lose you
