Who'd ever thought that I would see this day 
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away 
'Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way 
And now I look forward to every day (welcome to my sunny day) Block don't stop always stayed hot 
No matter how the seasons got 
I still remember when they took me away 
Kept it on lock den I got caught den I realized dat I had to stop 
Den I took the time to explore a better way Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go 
I just know, there's a sunny day Who'd ever thought that I would see this day 
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away 
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way 
And now I look forward to every day Welcome to my sunny day 
My sunny day 
Everyday 
A better day 
Welcome to my sunny day 
My sunny day 
Every day 
A better day 
Welcome to my sunny day Been a long day 
On my way to my holy place to pray 
Give thanks for every blessing given to me 
I know there's more to see, more to me, no more living in misery 
Cause this is how I visioned life to be Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go 
I just know, there's a sunny day Who'd ever thought that I would see this day 
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away 
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way 
And now I look forward to every day Welcome to my sunny day 
My sunny day 
Everyday 
A better day 
Welcome to my sunny day 
My sunny day 
Every day 
A better day 
Welcome to my sunny day
