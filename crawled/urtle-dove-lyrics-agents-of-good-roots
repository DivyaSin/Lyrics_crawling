Music: jones Lyrics: I met a lass with eyes of glass 
Named amy atlas-friend 
She cooked for me, I served her tea 
For two upon the thames 
But don't believe the thought police 
They'll twist your words in fives 
If love is blind then so am i 
My dove begins to fly I know you need love too 
I heard you wanna be my dove 
I've seen us near venus 
Between us 
Would you be my 
Love is the color of the dove 
That awakens my blood 
Turtle turtle turtle dove The day began with cakes and flans 
And elderberry wine 
We swam the brook where atlas shook 
And coaxed her cat alive 
"again," she screamed and bit my sleeve 
To twist my head in fives 
This honeybee became for me 
A london tripper's prize I know you want to love me 
I know you turtle dove 
I've seen blood on the watchtower 
I love you turtle dove Laugh like a lion, dance like a dove Nighttime fell with big ben's bell 
On sycamore street west 
She gripped my wrist 
And whispered bliss 
And handed me a test 
"is london's lass with eyes of glass 
A dove that God would send? " 
With blackbird pie my wings spread wide 
And flew to amy friend
