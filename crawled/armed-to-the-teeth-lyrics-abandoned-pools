I am armed to the teeth 
You can't hold me down 
I've turned seething 
Into a hobby Why is God out to get us 
Can't we just be friends? 
I feel a twinge of righteousness 
Like a corporate hedonist Armed to the teeth 
I'm ready 
Go out and spend 
Your money The thugs are banging 
In S.U.V.'s 
My thoughts are changing 
Into theories The master of our destiny 
Out in the graveyard of good ideas 
That could have been 
The downfall of leaders, yeah Armed to the teeth 
I'm ready 
Go out and spend 
Your money Giants of industry 
Come on, come on and try to eat me 
Armed to the teeth 
I'm ready What century 
Are you living in? 
An ancient puzzle piece 
That won't fit in Armed to the teeth 
I'm ready 
Go out and spend 
Your money Giants of industry 
Come on, come on and try to eat me 
Armed to the teeth 
I'm ready 
I'm ready 
I'm ready
