Moonlight Rider 
Fred Turner Have you got a new beat 
Make it on a fast sweep 
Movin' across the night in a coal black steed 
Now you're breakin' new ground 
Gossip wears a new crown 
You've been seen runnin' round on the other side of town You're a moonlight rider, 
You only deal in schemes 
You're a moonlight rider, 
You ride into their dreams 
You ride into their dreams Don't know when we'll see you 
You walk within' the shadows 
We wait all day but you never come around 
There's no way to find you 
You vanish into morning 
You sleep all day to ride when the day is through You're a moonlight rider, 
You only deal in schemes 
You're a moonlight rider, 
You ride into their dreams Maybe you won't find us 
We'll catch you in the moonlight 
Your shadow will give you up like the light of day 
Thought that you could fool us 
But know that we are watching 
Waiting to catch you up as you ride our way You're a moonlight rider, 
You only deal in schemes 
You're a moonlight rider, 
You ride into their dreams 
You ride into their dreams You step on the dreams 
You step on the dreams 
You step on the dreams 
You step on the dreams 
You step on the dreams 
You step on the dreams 
You step on the dreams 
You step on the dreams 
You step on the dreams 
You step on the dreams 
You step on the our dreams 
You step on the dreams
