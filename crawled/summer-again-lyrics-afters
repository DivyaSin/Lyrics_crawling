Im watching the green give into gold 
As summer becomes Octobers cold 
Gravity begs for one final kiss 
She drops it to him as she gives in Traces of light linger around 
As laces of white fall to the ground 
The softest of sounds for the heaviest things 
The pain that it brings As she falls I try to catch her 
For one last touch of warmth from summer 
As one thing leaves to become another again 
I remember when Dont remember the day she started to fade 
The ground felt a chill as she gave it away 
A whisper, a sigh for the time that she passed 
But the winter wont last As she falls I try to catch her 
For one last touch of warmth from summer 
As one thing leaves to become another again 
I remember when, oh, to be with summer again The days were warm, we wore them like skin 
Now I feel the effects of October again As she falls I try to catch her 
For one last touch of warmth from summer 
As one thing leaves to become another again 
I remember when, oh, to be with summer again 
Oh, to be with summer again I'm watching the green give in to gold 
As summer becomes Octobers cold
