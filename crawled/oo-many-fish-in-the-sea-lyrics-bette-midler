Now listen here, ladies (yeah) 
Take this advice, and remember (what?) always in life 
Into each heart some tears must fall 
Though you love and lose, you must stand tall 
'Cause we all got to cry sometimes 
I said, sigh sometimes 
Pull yourself together 
No use crying forever 
Because there's too many fish in the sea uh uh uh 
Too many fish in the sea 
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones 
Too many fish in the sea (yeah yeah) My mother once told me something 
And every word is true (what did she say?) 
Don't waste your time on a fella 
Who doesn't love you (who doesn't love you) 
He'll only mislead you 
Only grieve you 
Don't worry about him 
And let him go, do without him 
Because there's (too many fish in the sea) 
You know there is (too many fish in the sea) I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones 
Too many fish in the sea (yeah yeah) Well, if the fish isn't on your line 
Just bait your hook and keep on trying 
Don't let him get you down (no no no) 
There's other boys around 
'Cause there's too many fish in the sea 
You heard me (too many fish in the sea) uh uh uh 
(Too many fish in the sea) that's right, there is 
(Too many fish in the sea) I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones 
Too many fish in the sea 
I don't want nobody that don't want me now 
(Too many fish in the sea) 
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me 
(Too many fish in the sea) 
I don't need nobody that don't need me 
(Too many fish in the sea) 
I don't want nobody that don't want me 
(Too many fish in the sea) (Too many fish in the sea) 
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones 
(Too many fish in the sea) 
Smart ones, dumb ones, different ones, black ones 
(Too many fish in the sea) 
Ain't gonna love nobody, love nobody, love nobody, that don't love me
