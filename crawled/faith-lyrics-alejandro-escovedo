Gotta have faith 
In the one that you love 
You gotta faith beyond the above 
Sometimes you gotta lose it, gotta lost it 
Just to find it again 
You may not recognize it 
Gonna need it when you get to the end You gotta have faith 
In one that you love 
You gotta have faith 
In the mystery above 
You gotta faith 
When your friends let you down 
And its dark all around 
You gotta have faith You gotta have faith 
When the wave's crashing down 
You gotta have faith 
When the beat turns around 
Sometimes you just gotta lose it just to find it 
Just to lose it again 
You may not recognize it 
Gonna need it when you get to the end You gotta have faith 
In one that you love 
You gotta have faith 
In the mystery above 
You gotta faith 
When your friends let you down 
The tears of a clown 
You gotta have faith You gotta have faith 
In the broken and torn 
You gotta have faith 
In the love that's reborn 
Sometimes you gotta lose it 
Just to find it 
Just to lose it again 
You may not recognize it 
Gonna need it when you 
Get to the end You gotta have faith 
In one that you love 
You gotta have faith 
In the mystery above 
You gotta faith 
When your friends let you down 
And its dark all around 
You gotta have faith
