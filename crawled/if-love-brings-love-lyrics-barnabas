Alone in my thoughts, I wonder 
Will it be you and me? 
I've followed in shadows forever 
Waiting for you to see 
My heart is a fountain 
Bursting with love it can no longer hide 
Fear is the mountain 
Crucified dreams if my hope is denied So if love brings love, then let it 
If not, then just forget it 
It all depends on you Awoke before dawn to follow 
Any river to the sea 
The sound of the waves was hollow 
Like the feeling in me 
Afraid to tell you 
Hope buried deep in an ocean of pride 
Would this compel you 
To risk it with me, or to cast me aside? But if love brings love, then let it 
If not then just forget it 
It all depends on you Late at night you bring the light 
To the backstreets of my mind 
But in the daytime I cannot find 
The words to make you mine So if love brings love, then let it 
If not, then just forget it 
It all depends on you Alone in the light from your window 
Won't you please let me in?
