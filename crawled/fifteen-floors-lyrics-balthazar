Waiting on easy street 
A brownstone where writers meet 
Waiting so indiscreet 
My sugar tooth feel her teeth 
I guess all she is

Tell your mother that you love her 
Kiss her like you kiss no other

Kiss her like you kiss no other And I don't know 
I don't know 
If you're the one 
Who told me so 
And I don't know 
The words by heart 
But they sure make sense 
Ever since that we took part Now all the hard faces I've come 
With tears that are old from laughter 
It won't take long 'fore they get what their after 
It won't take long 'fore they get what their after Now all the hard faces I've come 
With tears that are old from laughter 
It won't take long 'fore they get what their after 
It won't take long 'fore they get
