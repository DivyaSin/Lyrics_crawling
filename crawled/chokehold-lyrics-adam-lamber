Staring at the ceiling in the dark 
Sheets are in a knot 
My heart is like rock, eh Pictures flashing by inside my head 
I'm hanging by a thread 
But I'd do it all again, eh I keep running away, running away, running away from you 
But I can't stand breaking the chains 
Breaking the chains, breaking the chains 
It's too good 'Cause I know the second you go 
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back 
Bring it on back to me 
And you know I want your chokehold 
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back 
Bring it on back to me 
Bring it on back to me 
Bring it on back to me All without your touch I suffocate 
I could asphxiate, but I kind of like the pain, eh 
Baby, I can smell you on my clothes 
I try to stay composed 
But I feel the fever grow, grow oh oh I keep running away, running away, running away from you 
But I can't stand breaking the chains 
Breaking the chains, breaking the chains 
It's too good 'Cause I know the second you go 
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back 
Bring it on back to me 
And you know I want your chokehold 
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back 
Bring it on back to me 
Bring it on back to me 
Bring it on back to me Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey 
Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey 
Baby, gonna bring it back to me 'Cause I know the second you go 
Want you to bring it on back, bring it on back 
Bring it on back to me 
And you know I want your chokehold 
Want cha to bring it on back, bring it on back 
Bring it on back to me, yeah yeah 
Bring it on back to me 
Bring it on back to me
