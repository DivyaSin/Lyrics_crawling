(Intro) 
Unfold, Unfold, Unfold 
(V1) 
One day you wake up, and ask God why do you have your life 
But you kept your head high and you soar the sky 
Even when they had you at the low life 
People talk about you and they ridiculed you 
But they do it just for the spite, 
Now its bout that time when they knock you down 
Just get back up and go fight 
C C Cause once upon a time not long ago, 
Its was a lil lil kid and he had a flow 
And he had a dream, he aint know where to go 
And his dad passed away do he had to go 
He was just a youngin and he came from the hood 
People didn't want to know him, he was misunderstood 
Pretty gang what he rap, and he not going back 
So listen to me when I came from this old trap 
(Hook) 
Your almost close, just follow the road 
It's a big dream and no one knows 
Your almost there, don't be scared 
Just keep dreaming your be near 
Your story unfolds, unfolds 
Your story unfolds, unfolds 
Its your time can you tell now 
one day your make it out of town 
Your make it outta town 
*Reverse Make It Outta Town* 
Unfold 
*Reverse Make It Outta Town* 
Unfold 
(V2) 
Seem like everybody wishing 
Sometime feel like no one will listen 
Got bullied by the ones in the kitchen, 
wow I'm chaffing up my next proud vision 
Man this #$# get hard, got to raise the bar 
Gotta know your worth, and where you wanna start 
Have heart, take ricks 
Only God can judge me it's a blist 
Gay, Straight, Bi, and Trans grander 
We can all stand up and make the world wonder 
Black, Indian, Caucasian, and Asian 
We can all stand up and make the world brave 
And I don't care if you rich or your broke 
But we aint living in silence no more 
put your hands up, Now stand up 
2013 we tell em and WHAT! 
(Hook) 
Your almost close, just follow the road 
It's a big dream and no one knows 
Your almost there, don't be scared 
Just keep dreaming your be near 
Your story unfolds, unfolds 
Your story unfolds, unfolds 
Its your time can you tell now 
Oday your make it out of town 
Your make it outta town 
*Reverse Make It Outta Town* 
Unfold 
*Reverse Make It Outta Town* 
Unfold 
(Bridge) 
If you hear me now

If you got a big dream 
A,A aa 
If nobody stops you 
A,A aa 
Put your hands in the air 
A,A aa 
If you don't live in fear 
A,A aa 
If you here in this country 
A,A aa 
Its 2013 we about to bust the 
(Hook) 
Your almost close, just follow the road 
It's a big dream and no one knows 
Your almost there, don't be scared 
Just keep dreaming your be near 
Your story unfolds, unfolds 
Your story unfolds, unfolds 
Its your time can you tell now 
One day your make it out of town 
Your make it outta town 
Unfold, Unfold 
UNFOLD
