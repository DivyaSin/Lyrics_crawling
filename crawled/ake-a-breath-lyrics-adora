You're talking to yourself, there's nobody home 
And you know you're alone, you know you're alone 
You did this to yourself, you're not innocent 
We remember the day you said things that you meant Don't try to fix all the things you see 
'Cause I won't be here when you need me 
So take a breath tonight Just like your window I am shattered again 
I don't care what you heard, I don't care what was said 
So get your fix; you're struggling to survive 
These conversations, they're keeping me alive Don't try to fix all the things you see 
'Cause I won't be here when you need me 
So take a breath tonight 
I promise you'll be pleased with the outcome 
I can't be here like this These eyes, they stare, they stare deep in me and I still hear your voice 
These eyes, they stare, they stare deep in me I still hear your voice 
Don't try to be, just give up on me, 'cause I still hate the sound Don't try to fix all the things you see 
'Cause I won't be here when you need me 
So take a breath tonight 
I promise you'll be pleased with the outcome 
I can't be here like this
