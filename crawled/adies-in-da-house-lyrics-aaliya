[Chorus: x2] 
If my ladies in the house tonight let me here you say (hey) 
If my fellas in the house tonight let me here you say(hey). I'm talking to my ladies, across the world. 
Are you looking for a pl-pl-playa? tell me what's the word. 
To the east side, I roll to the west side of town. 
I came to represent, and show you how I get down. [Chorus: x2] Talking-talking to my fa-fa-fellas, across the sea. 
I heard ya looking for a see you-see you-cutie, so it must be me. 
I came to party, there's no doubt. 
Aaliyah's gonna show you how, to turn this mother out. [Chorus: x2] Bad girls, talking bout a bad bad girl. 
Ba-bad girls, talking bout a bad bad girl. [Missy] 
You damn-damn, skip-skippy, 
If the track is like paper, I'm guaranteed to rip it, 
Smells good here sniff it. 
I'm lifted, nigga no I ain't also gifted. 
I'ma let him mix it, hit it hit-hit-hit it. 
Aaliyah, the l-I-why-a-h. 
Step to me mistakably, phatalicious, make 3 wishes 
Track-track, dirty like dishes, 
Hi [repeats] 
Oh my. [Chorus: x2]
