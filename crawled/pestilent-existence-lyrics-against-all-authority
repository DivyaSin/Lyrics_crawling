Systematically populated, Nuclear annihilation Mind rotting flesh eating cellular infection Genetically manipulated, human imitation All staring through my window as I sit here in damnation Will we progress? Or end the human race I wonder how it's gonna end, If we keep up this pace We're destroying our planet, We've fallen from grace Take me to this place to I just can't take it anymore This wall of sound that surrounds me It's in my heart and in my soul Ands keeps me bound to the underground I wanna kill you with my rock and roll Can't take it anymore, don't wanna think about it, it makes me sick And destroy the forces that control our pestilent existence I step outside and all I see is our deterioration When we're gone all that remains Will be plastic implantations So everyone climb aboard And I can't tell the Christians from Satan's congregation Nonstop to damnation! This run away machine Someone said "its Entropy" well its too late now Never slowing down We're far to gone We keep adding to this pile Ands keeps me bound to the underground Just wanna sit back and listen for a while to this It's in my heart and in my soul Wall of sound that surrounds me I wanna kill you with my rock and roll Can't take it anymore, don't wanna think about it, it makes me sick And destroy the forces that control our pestilent existence This pestilent Existence It grows like a plague Humanity's persists in While we whither away
