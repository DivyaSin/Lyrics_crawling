You and me, we're both so fucked up 
You're fucked up in the good way and I'm fucked up in the bad 
You and me, we thought we were so smart 
We thought we could outrun them but they had robot dogs 
You and me, we're both in the same hole 
But you dream of ways of leaving and I get used to the cold All the ashes in the air, you can hear us anywhere 
All the ashes in the air, you can hear us anywhere, oh You and me, we heard a sudden thud 
But you ran in to save them and I didn't give a fuck 
You and me, our egos made from fires 
Burning all our flesh off 'til we're skeletons duelling with wires All the ashes in the air, you can hear us anywhere 
All the ashes in the air, you can hear us anywhere, oh You and me saw the light of the ship get crossed 
But it was up above us, it left us where we was 
You and me have learned that love is true 
If you ask me how I know it, I'll never lie to you All the ashes in the air, you can hear us anywhere 
All the ashes in the air, you can hear us anywhere, oh
