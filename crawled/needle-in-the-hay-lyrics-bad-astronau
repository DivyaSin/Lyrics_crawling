On his arm is that charm around her neck 
Strung out again call in some friends 
Trying to cash a check cause 
I've been dumb that's what you've come to expect Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay She's wearing your clothes 
Head down to toe and the auction of you 
You said you know what he did to idiot kid 
Who don't have a clue 
Sometimes they just caught in the eye 
Am pulling them through Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay Now on the bus nearly touching this dirty retreat 
Falling out six inch pallet 
There's sweat in my teeth 
I'm gonna walk walk walk four more blocks 
Cause the one in my brain 
Chow downstairs see the man 
He's gonna make it all look gay 
I can't be myself I can't be myself 
And I don't want to talk taking a cure 
So I can be quiet wherever I want 
So leave me alone you oughta be proud 
That I'm getting these marks Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay 
Needle in the hay
