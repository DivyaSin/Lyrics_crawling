You're up to the neck 
You may never see the sun again 
One slip and the world will split like a bloody wound 
So place your final bet 
Roll the dice; try to pretend 
You can go forever, but the end is coming soon You've seen the signs; when you know you've been left behind 
Remember what your dark lord said: 
"I destroy after use" Ignorant child 
So proud in believing you're wild 
But you're a dog in chains taking kicks from your master in hell 
He's got his hooks in you 
Will you take the triple-six tattoo 
Or try for freedom? You and time will tell You've seen the signs; any day you're going to find 
The devil's got a line on you 
To destroy after use
