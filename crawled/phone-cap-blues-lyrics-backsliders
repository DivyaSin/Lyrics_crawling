2 Loud Phone talker riding on a bus 
Heads in the clouds no thought for us 
One way monologue, we're all trapped 
It's a long 20 minute ride but their plans are capped x 2 Loud Phone talkers they're under the weather 
One's a baby boomer who should know better 
A tedious racket, we're all trapped 
Its a 40 minute ride but their plans are capped x 2 Yeah the folks on the train they all need to hear 
'bout my medical condition and the office affair 
Yeah don't worry I got heaps of time to chat 
it's a 40 minute trip and my plan is capped You said 'I got fair warning from my line manager 
Said I spend too much time on social media' 
No need to say it again we all got that 
You can surf all day cause your plan is capped
