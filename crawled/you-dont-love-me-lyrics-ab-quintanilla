Girl, 
I can't believe you tried to play me for a fool 
I almost didn't see this one coming 
You don't love me Chorus: 
Girl, don't tell me no more lies 
Pretending that you're satisfied 
Baby, I know your love's not true 
Quit tryin' to play me for a fool 
Girl, you know that you are wrong 
You're here one minute and the next you're gone 
I'm not blind, baby 
I can see 
So why don't you admit 
You don't love me You called me on the phone 
Sayin' you'll be late comin' home 
You say your boss is making you work late 
But I don't believe it 
'Cause when I called your office 
So that I could speak to you 
Ya know what they told me? 
They told me that you quit last week And how can you explain 
That when we make love 
You're callin' out somebody else's name 
And when we kiss 
Your eyes are open wide 
And they can't hide what you feel inside, baby Chorus 
I saw you on the street 
At the place we were supposed to meet 
But you were with another man 
I couldn't believe it 
So I asked your friends 
Who the hell was he? 
Ya know what they told me? 
There was a guy that you met last week And now I can explain 
Why when we make love 
You're callin' out somebody else's name 
And when we kiss 
Your eyes are open wide 
And they can't hide what you feel inside, baby Chorus 
You play with my heart 
And try to play me for a fool, yeah 
And like the saying goes 
"What goes around comes around" 
And one day 
You'll know exactly how it feels 
How it feels Chorus
