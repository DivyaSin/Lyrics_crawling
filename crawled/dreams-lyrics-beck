You're just the girl of my dreams 
But it seems my dreams never come true I first met you down on Lover's Lane 
The birds were insane, flapping all about 
Softly you would sing, swinging in your swing 
It wasn't night, it wasn't day You're just the girl of my dreams 
But it seems my dreams never come true
