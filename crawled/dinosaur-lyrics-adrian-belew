Long ago and far away in a different age 
When I was a dumb young guy 
Fossilized photos of my life then 
Illustrate what an easy prey I must have been 
Standing in the sun, idiot savant 
Something like a monument Im a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones Ignorance has always been something I excel in 
Followed by naivet 
And pride 
Doesnt take a scientist to see how 
Any clever predator could have a piece of me 
Standing in the sun, idiot savant 
Something like a monument Im a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones When I look back on the past 
Its a wonder Im not yet extinct 
All the mistakes and bad judgments I made 
Nearly pushed me to the brink 
It doesnt pay to be too nice, 
Its the one thing I have learned 
Still I made my fossil bed 
Now I toss and turn Im a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones
