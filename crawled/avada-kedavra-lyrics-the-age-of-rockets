Well youre not brave if you still keep the letters 
And youre not sane if you dont wanna get better 
And youre not drunk if you cant stay in your lane, no Well youre not awake but you havent been sleepin 
And ya hate god but you dont believe in him 
And youre not scared but you still have your eyes closed The sky explodes 
And only you know 
[X3] I want you to worry when I dont call you back 
[X2]
