Their spirits soar on high 
They wing with birds that float on by 
Your love and mine 
Their spirits with the breeze 
That gently plays the summer leaves 
Your love and mine Life is a bird in the sky 
Life is the breeze blowing by 
Time picked the words 
Time picked the songs 
But we sang them wrong Their spirits with the rain 
That feeds the wheat and weeds the same 
Your love and mine The sun their spirits light 
That feels and warms both black and white 
Your love and mine Life is the rain from on high 
Life is the sun in the sky 
Time picked the words 
Time picked the songs 
We were the choir 
But we sang them wrong Their spirits bless the cruel 
The intellectual, the fool 
Your love and mine Their spirits point the way 
But who has noticed, who will say 
Your love or mine? Life is a soft lullaby 
Soothing a child as it cries 
But it cries in pain 
Time wrote the songs 
We hear the cry 
And still we sing wrong
