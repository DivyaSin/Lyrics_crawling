There's a fire starting in my heart 
Reaching a fever pitch, 
It's bringing me out the dark 
Finally I can see you crystal clear 
Go head and sell me out 
And I'll lay your ship bare See how I leave with every piece of you 
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart 
Reaching a fever pitch 
And its bring me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
The scars of your love they leave me breathless 
I can't help feeling 
We could have had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it 
To the beat Baby I have no story to be told 
But I've heard one of you 
And I'm gonna make your head burn 
Think of me in the depths of your despair 
Making a home down there 
As mine sure won't be shared The scars of your love remind me of us 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all 
The scars of your love they leave me breathless 
I can't help feeling 
We could have had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it 
With a beating Throw your soul through every open door 
Count your blessings to find what you look for 
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold 
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow We could have had it all 
We could have had it all 
It all, it all it all, 
We could have had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside your hand 
And you played it 
To the beat 
You could have had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside your hand 
And you played 
And you played 
And you played 
And you played it to the beat
