Whatever it takes to get inside your heart 
Someone will, I hope it's me 
Whatever it takes to get beneath your skin 
Someone will, I hope it's me 
(chorus) 
The sand on my feet 
And the sun on my face 
Jeune fille in a white sundress Late afternoon I watch the waves roll in 
Soft and slow against the beach 
I watch you walk down the wooden steps 
Sky grey eyes smile at me Chorus And when I talk with her 
I can't understand a word 
She says so sweetly 
But I don't care 
Because I have such a crush on her 
It feels as if she fell from heaven Midnight in the restaurant 
Ocean breeze, crescent moon 
A song is playing on the radio 
"ma cherie amour" - I think of you Chorus And someday I'll walk 
With the sun in my face 
And jeune fille in a white sundress
