All you know 
Has just slipped away 
Still you go on 
Waking up each day 
How'd you get 
Into this state? 
Countless hours 
With no end in sight 
Counting promises 
That turned into lies 
Everyone 
Got in your way 
Everyone 
Got in your way Countless hours 
With no end in sight 
Counting promises 
That turned into lies 
Everyone 
Got in your way 
Everyone 
Got in your way
