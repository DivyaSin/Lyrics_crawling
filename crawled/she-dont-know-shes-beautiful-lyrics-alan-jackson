She don't know she's beautiful 
She don't know she's beautiful 
Though time and time I've told her so 
Sammy Kershaw, 'She Don't Know, She's Beautiful' No one can make me cry 
Make me laugh, make me smile 
Or drive me mad like she does 
It's like the curse that is the cure Better or worse, one thing's for sure 
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do 
If I lost it 
Kenny Chesney, 'I Lost It' 'Cause anywhere is paradise 
When you're with the one you love 
Anywhere is a place that's nice 
When you're with the one you dream of Anywhere is paradise 
When you're with a love that's true 
There's nowhere I'd rather be baby 
Than anywhere with you Your heart and mine joined together 
Like hand and glove 
We already found our forever 
On earth as in Heaven above So baby, anywhere will do for me 
For wherever in the world 
We'll ever be, will always be the land of love 
Stefan Anderson, 'Anywhere is Paradise' I want to stand with you on a mountain 
I want to bathe with you in the sea 
I want to lay like this forever until the sky falls down on me 
Savage Garden, 'Truly, Madly, Deeply'
