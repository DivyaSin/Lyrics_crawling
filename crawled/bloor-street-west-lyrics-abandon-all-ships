See you tripped on us, I see you shining 
See you tripped on us, Was it to the end? 
Bloor street west, burn this storm I made it now 
I'll be on the vibe out 
Great party so make it all bloor 
Trust my chain, See you tripped on us, I see you shining 
I see you tripped on us, Longer you'll be on my world 
Shut the fuck up, taste so wake up and you still .. 
Time shits and you ' 
Shut the fuck up 
Shut the fuck up 
What make to you? Sometimes on silence run on bloor west street 
Way you on that well? 
When I say all in silence 
Why did you go? 
Why did you go? 
Why did you go? 
Why did you go? See you tripped on us, I see you shining 
I see you tripped on us, 
See you tripped on us, I see you shining 
I see you tripped on us, 
No, you'll not rock my world Shut the fuck up 
Shut the fuck up 
Shut the fuck up 
Shut the fuck up
