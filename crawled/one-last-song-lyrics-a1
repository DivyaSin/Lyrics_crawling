Take my hand, touch my face 
Let me feel your embrace 
Let me see in your eyes 
That you wont say goodbye Just tell me how you feel 
I dont know what youre thinking anymore And if you need me, youd kiss me 
Then tell me how you feel 
And if you want me, youd show me 
That your love is for real And if you love me 
Youd hold me in your arms where I belong 
So while Im feeling strong 
I sing you one last song Let me ask time has passed 
Do you feel this could last 
If you dont, why then stay 
Take your wings, fly away I love you way too much 
To wanna be the one who brings you down And if you need me, youd kiss me 
Then tell me how you feel 
And if you want me, youd show me 
That your love is for real And if you love me 
Youd hold me in your arms where I belong 
So while Im feeling strong 
I sing you one last song One last song I sing for you 
Like I always did 
This time its for real 
I never come to you like this 
Expecting you to turn my kiss 
Oh no, no, no, no And if you need me, youd kiss me 
Then tell me how you feel 
And if you want me, youd show me 
That your love is for real And if you love me 
Youd hold me in your arms where I belong 
So while Im feeling strong 
I sing you one last song Oh yeah 
I sing you one last song 
I sing you one last song
