Let's face the day like it's our last understanding 
We are all alive but don't be naive 
Yes you will be judged 
Found guilty or not guilty, it's out of your touch 
Just where you are and why you're alive 
Just where you are and why you're alive If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself 
We aren't gods here, only humans with a lot of opinions Patient when the world doesn't move at the same rate as you do 
Sometimes it's good to be misunderstood 
And it's so fulfilling when you find someone who understands 
Who understands you 
Just where you are and why you're alive 
Just where you are and why you're alive If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself 
We aren't gods here, only humans with a lot of opinions 
If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself 
We aren't gods here, only humans with a lot of opinions about other opinions Cheers to the world 
For all it's ups and downs 
I like being a socialized animal, how about you? 
How about you? If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself 
We aren't gods here, only humans with a lot of opinions 
If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself 
We aren't gods here, only humans with a lot of opinions about other opinions
