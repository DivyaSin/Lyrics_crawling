I saw that 
She came around here 
As he came around me 
You can note 
He instead of choosing me 
He didn't pick me! 
You say that's ok but I say no 
You can't stay to say goodbye 
You can beat forever or you can beat whatever you want 
Or you can be my own 
And say what I've gotta hear 
Or what I can not do 
You can be 
You can be 
You can be my song 
You can be my joy 
OOhh 
You could be my joy You and me, side by side 
You could be my partner 
We could do an oath right here under the sky 
I could help you being tougher 
And at least once you could be cool 
With who really wants you 
I can tell it worth You worth, you and I 
Were tied against love 
Not this time, hard times 
We won't give up 
You can bring me hope 
You can deeply fall in love 
You can be my diamond ring 
You can play with whole story you want
