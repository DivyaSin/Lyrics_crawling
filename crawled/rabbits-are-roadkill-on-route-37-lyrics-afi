What once did exist 
Now is meaningless And doesn't it seem funny 
How soon you did forget 
All the words that now lost their way 
But I remember, I remember Desperation, devastation 
All I truly know 
Is isolation, self-damnation 
All life that I know 
Was shed and worthless now What I knew was wrong 
One who lived is gone Guess, it was just an echo 
When you would sing my song 
All the notes you've forgotten now 
You've left abandoned, I remember Desperation, devastation 
All I truly know 
Is isolation, self-damnation 
All life that I know 
Was shed and worthless now I can hate myself 
More, more than anyone Will you join me? 
Well, now you know that this 
Tortures me 
Have I created the suffering 
So blank? I feel it happen again 
Smothering 
To sell the words that decide 
That binds me Now all I feel is Desperation, devastation 
All I truly know 
Is isolation, self-damnation 
All life that I know 
Was shed and worthless now Desperation, devastation 
All I truly know 
Is isolation, self-damnation 
All life that I know 
Was shed and worthless, worthless now
