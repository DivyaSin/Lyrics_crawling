Started out with once upon a time 
Little princess came into this life 
An illusion of perfection 
She had it all 
Money, looks, and friends 
Till the day her world 
Her world came crashing down to an end (Chorus) 
This is no fairy tale, this is reality 
Might not be what you're ready to see 
No fairy tale, no fairy tale, yeah 
This is no perfect dream 
Even though you cannot see 
This is all true about me 
True about me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Since that day my world was a broken life 
Everything was wrong 
Couldn't make things right 
It was shattered like glass 
Luckily I had that perfect beginning 
Maybe if things get better I'll have, have a happy ending (Chorus) Love, love 
Hate, hate 
Tears, tears 
Heartbreak, I said heartbreak (Chorus) Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
