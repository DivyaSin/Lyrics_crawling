Waiting in the shadows; striking from behind 
An evil genius orchestrates a plague against mankind 
Rabid dogs surround him, so quick to emulate 
The voice from hell which casts its spell 
And fans the flames of hate Europe knelt before him, the Empire at his feet 
The innocent were cruelly spent in orgies of deceit 
Deeper now than ever, the depravity of men 
So those who think those days are gone had better think again While a blemished flock plans an easy escape 
Tucked away safely in heaven 
The world awaits her violent fate 
Auschwitz '87 Unmindful of the millions who will die at his decree 
A velvet-tongued destroyer will arise from troubled seas 
His global plan is ready and waiting to begin 
The western guard lies sleeping while a Trojan horse slips in So we render unto Caesar 'till we're rendered penniless 
Unmindful of the warnings, we increase our negligence 
Sharper now than ever, the sword of Damocles 
The noose grows ever tighter on a drugged democracy 
While a blemished flock plans an easy escape... Unmindful of the torment of butchered, unborn sons 
Stabbing deep within the womb, the carnage has begun 
The fuse burns ever shorter, through phony, worthless talks 
Holocaust escaping from Pandora's lead-lined box Saviour high in heaven, look down upon your bride 
Tiny men, yet precious gems for whom you bled and died 
Father high in heaven, we praise You through Your Son 
Refine your people in the fire that surely has begun While a blemished flock plans an easy escape 
Tucked away safely in heaven 
The world awaits her violent fate 
Auschwitz '87
