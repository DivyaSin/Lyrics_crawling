I get the feelin' we've been left in the dark 
About mysterious lights in the sky 
The magnetic poles start to shift 
The world is chargin' at the speed of light 
It's got somn' to do with an attitude 
Not carin' if we live or die 
Crowds start runnin', breathin, 
Starin' at the sky 
One more death means one more lie 
Red Alert 
Red Alert 
Red Alert 
Red Alert 
Red Alert 
Better take cover 
Now that I'm much older 
I can see a lot is over 
And a lot has passed me by 
I try to see the sun comin' over the hill 
On a dark and dusty night 
I wanna feel the way I used to 
Guess the secret lies inside 
But if you want the truth 
Better hide tonight 
One more death means one more lie They won't save me [several times]
