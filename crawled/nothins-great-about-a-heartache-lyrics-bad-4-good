Somebody told me Im supposed to feel this way, 
That a heart can never reach a peak of truth until it breaks. 
That you feel nothin, until you feel like youre nothin. 
And that real sufferin, it helps to keep that muscle pumpin. 
Well, Im beat. 
Give me back my inexperience and keep the heat. 
Let me dream for deliverance. Nothins great about a heartache, 
Theres nothing there I wanna learn from all this pain. 
And Id rather not feel love then to have to feel this way. 
Like Im dying, youve all been lying. 
Cause theres nothin great about a heartache. Somebody told me life can sometimes bring you pain, 
That the spirit carries passion like the thunder carries rain. 
And that our emotions are a test to our devotion. 
Just like devastation is the path to recreation. 
Well, I bleed. 
Give me back my childhood innocence and the peace, 
And my faith in the future. Nothins great about a heartache, 
Theres nothing there I wanna learn from all this pain. 
And Id rather not feel love then to have to feel this way. 
Like Im dying, youve all been lying. 
Cause theres nothin great about a heartache. [Solo] Somebody told me Im supposed to feel this way, 
That a heart can never reach a peak of truth until it breaks. Nothins great about a heartache, 
Theres nothing there I wanna learn from all this pain. 
And Id rather not feel love then to have to feel this way. 
Like Im dying, youve all been lying. 
Cause theres nothin great about a heartache. Nothins great about a heartache, 
Theres nothin great about a heartache. 
Nothins great about a heartache, 
Theres nothin great about a heartache. (Repeat)
