Goin' down life's highway 
Sometimes you get lost 
Hurryin' to nowhere 
You forget what you forgot Lookin' for a miracle, 
Following a dream 
You get knocked down you get back up 
But that's no guarantee 
You got it fixed That's what it is 
Things ain't never gonna change 
That's what it is 
When you get into the game 
That's what it is, n-not what it ain't 
D-do what you can, n-not what you can't 
You gotta make the pieces fit 
If that's what it is 
That's what it is Where are we going? 
Why are we here? 
We ask of the same questions 
But the answer's never clear 
Life is just a gamble 
You gotta roll the dice 
You gotta dance with lady luck 
And if you don't get it right 
You take the hit That's what it is 
Things ain't never gonna change 
That's what it is 
When you get into the game 
That's what it is, n-not what it ain't 
D-do what you can, n-not what you can't 
It's all hit and miss 
That's what it is That's what it is, baby 
Take the hit! That's what it is 
Things ain't never gonna change 
That's what it is 
So just learn to play the game 
That's what it is 
Things ain't never gonna change 
That's what it is 
When you get into the game 
That's what it is 
Things ain't never gonna change 
That's what it is 
When you get into the game 
That's what it is 
Things ain't never gonna change
