Ya know 
I dun been to jail for a lot of stupid shit 
and when you go to jail for a lot of stupid shit, you try not to go back 
and...ya know i take percausion ya know 
however, sometimes you can take too much percausion to the point where 
it gets rediculious... oh man Each day at my dope spot, i watch him as he passes by 
I say to myself, he looks like the FBI 
A white man like him, what is he doing over here? 
i wonder, what does he want 
then he asked me "you gotta light, you wanna help me smoke this blunt" (chorus) 
It was just my paranoia, hey heyy 
runnin away with me yea 
It was just my parania 
runnin away Down on my luck couldnt fine no job 
id rather sell dope and rob, why squab? 
I know i cant do it forever 
so uh ima do it quick and clever, however 
Drinkin' malt liquor, smokin endo 
Two cops ran pass my window 
Its a raid, uh thats what i assume 
I flushed to ounces in the bathroom 
I ran out the back 
Before they could find me 
come to find out, they raided the house behind me 
yea man they went through my back yard 
hopped over the fence..anyway (chorus) 
It was just my paranoia, hey heyy 
runnin away with me yea 
It was just my parania 
runnin away Im tellin you man, your paranoia can get to you 
i remember i use to trip everything, know what ima sayin

i hate them late model cars dawg on it 
look like vice wit all those attenas on it 
paranoid, i use to sell yale man 
trippin on the telephone and the mail man 
Treat custom mugs like compulsive liars 
raise they shirt and check for wires 
I got a little money, but i need a little more 
dam, somebody's knockin at my front door 
some guy in a shirt and tie 
is it homacide or FBI 
does he have a warrent for Joseph Foreman?

It was just my paranoia, hey heyy 
runnin away with me yea

everybody be lookin like undercovers cause they be starin 
and i dont be knowin, ya know what im sayin 
I hate sellin dope, i think about stoppin 
Undercover cops follow me while im shoppin 
Trackin me, wit a hidden camera 
plottin to through me back in the slamma 
they think i dont see em 
but yes i do, they some haters 
actin like they pickin tomatas

i see em in the airport, plain and clear 
street clothes with that little wire in they ear 
they rush me, shake my hand

It was just my paranoia, hey heyy 
runnin away with me yea 
It was just my parania 
runnin away ya know, i wrote a hit song 
"because i got high"

Universal Records year man 
took my money like enron 
broken along, things got hard 
however, it brought me close to god 
i changed my life and became a christian 
singer, rapper and musician 
ive been high, ive been low 
ive been rich, ive been poor 
ive been right, ive been wrong 
since i been wit god, my paranoia's gone (new chorus x2 fades) 
No more paranoia hey hey 
runnin away wit me yea 
i have no more paranoia 
runnin away
