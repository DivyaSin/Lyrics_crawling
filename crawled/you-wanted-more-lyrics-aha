You know the way, you've been before 
I've seen the signs, outside your door 
You've set the rules, their bitter taste, 
Can't be ignored 
It's just the same, just like before 
You wanted more I loved the sun, I loved the rain 
I gave it up, but all in vain 
I loved the way, it was before 
So bittersweet to be adored 
We had it all, you let it go 
You wanted more But in the end, what is a friend 
If not someone, to help pretend 
Remember me, you know my name 
I'm still the same 
But not for you, that's not enough 
You wanted more I loved the sun, I loved the rain 
I gave it up, but all in vain 
We couldn't change, you know the score 
So bittersweet to be adored 
We had it all, you gave it up 
You wanted more 
We had it all, you gave it up 
You wanted more But in the end, what is a friend! You loved the way, it used to be 
The way it was, with you and me 
It came too late, and left too soon 
Just like the rings around the moon 
We had it all, you let it go 
You wanted more 
We had it all, you gave it up 
You wanted more
