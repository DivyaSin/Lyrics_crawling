I could be a better person but I choose not to 
I'm as selfish as a suicide and wait I take that back 
I didn't mean to say it quite like that Supercalifragalisticexpialadocious 
I took all of my memories and threw them in the ocean 
Just like that they drowned on impact 
In a flurry of nightmares dressed up like dreams 
I opened my eyes and managed to find some clarity Don't hang onto words you don't understand 
They're just letters in unalphabetical order anyway 
Anyway, anyway, anyway Don't hang onto words you don't understand 
They're just letters in unalphabetical order anyway 
Anyway, anyway, anyway Supercalifragalisticexpialadocious 
I took all of my worries spun them in a single motion 
Said, "How about that, now you're on the inside" 
I'm outside and warm looking in at the mess 
I followed you here with planned exact steps I made a map of the words you left in other people's ears 
Wrote down your hopes, to do lists and fears 
Drew you a picture, it's pretty if you squint 
Regardless of my past I'm a pretty alright kid Don't hang onto words you don't understand 
They're just letters in unalphabetical order anyway 
Anyway, anyway, anyway Don't hang onto words you don't understand 
They're just letters in unalphabetical order anyway 
Anyway, anyway, anyway I loved you and left you for another that kissed better 
Had prettier eyes than you 
For reasons unknown you always dragged me down 
It's not your fault you were born in this town But could you be a little less depressing 
And maybe smile a bit more? 
Hey there, I guess I'm really not good at this 
But love starts with L and so does liar You're a prettier version of yourself ten years from now 
You're brilliant but often late 
I'm better off friendless I guess, I guess, I guess 
I guess, I guess, I guess Well, I could be wrong I'm pretty fond of waking up 
When it comes to lucky charms I eat the marshmallows first 
I'm weird, sometimes, I like to be lonely 
But other times I hate the sound of silence Let's dress up like dreams and pretend we're free 
Dress up like dreams and pretend we're free 
Let's dress up like dreams and pretend we're free 
I hear it's nice, I'd like to try it sometime
