I fell in love with you, 
T'was like a dream come true 
And my love for you will never end oh no 
Was such a special night 
You lay right by my side 
And I told you things I never told a soul And now that I have you babe 
I promise I'll never leave 
'cause you are the only one that makes my life complete [Chorus] 
And I'm, 
Crazy over you, 
I don't know what to do, 
I'm Crazy over you A love that never ends 
You're more than just a friend 
And my heart and soul I'll always give to you, 
The only in my life 
Someday you'll be my wife, 
And I'll be with you until the end of time And now that I have you babe 
I promise I'll never leave 
'cause you are the only one that makes my love complete [Chorus] It doesn't matter what you say or do 
Because I love you (And I know you love me too) 
Love me, kiss me, and hold me in your arms 
Lets me know you're crazy over me 
And I'm Crazy over you 
'cause you are the only one, 
To make my life complete [Chorus]
