I'm gonna love you, when our time is right 
Be thinking of you, every day and every night To think you're somewhere in this world 
and someday I will make you my wife 
So every day we're not together 
I hope you know that you'll be alright 
Cuz I.... I'm gonna make you feel, like you're the only girl in the world 
Like you're the only one that I'll ever love 
Like you're the only one who knows my heart (Oohh) Like you're the only one that's in command 
Cuz you're the only one who understands 
How to make me feel like a man And when you're lonely, I'll keep you company 
Like this world was only made for you and me 
And when it doesn't feel right with another, I hope you believe 
That in a world with no light, I will be all that you need...to see (CHORUS) I'm gonna make you feel, like you're the only girl in the world 
Like you're the only one that I'll ever love 
Like you're the only one who knows my heart (oohh) Like you're the only one that's in command 
Cuz you're the only one who understands 
How to make me feel like a man Ta da da da (4x) (Wooah oohh) (Repeat Chorus)
