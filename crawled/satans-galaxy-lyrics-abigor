What means imagination 
If not the trigger 
To pure hell? 
The chaos nova of our vision Closed the fissure of the night 
After the mirror of the void was scared 
By shapeless horns - Satan's galaxy 
Seeing through five triangular shapes We are so close to this dimension 
As the center erects a spiral 
Uniting us without bridges 
We swim in a chalice of cataklysm The pentagrams dynamism 
The chlorophyll of liquid dreams 
Cloaks the lords of apocalypse 
As the distortion in the tapestry shows me What they cannot see 
Reborn by the burial of syndrome 
This pure flight of transparency 
Mutating into the new circle of power I gave death to whom 
I gave death to me 
An exchange of the links below 
The geometry of madness fulfilled I breed into new unzoned trance 
United in parallel 
Genetic eternities 
By shapeless horns Satan's galaxy
