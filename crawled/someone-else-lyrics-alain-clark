Some days it just gets so hard 
having to deal with it all 
Don't wanna sound like a girl but sometimes I just get in the shit, yeah 
Oh it's so difficult to get out of it, no 
I get insecure too girl, yes I do The thing is I think I can't afford no wrong 
gotta make an impression I'm strong 
gotta do it all right 
for my girl, for my peeps for my homies, all right 
it's like my mind is screwing with me 
Damn what am I doing to me 
I hate looking through somebody else's eyes Oh look into the mirror tell me what you see 
All of those eyes looking back at me 
I don't even have an identity no more We live in a world where we 
can't be ourselves 
but baby with you I don't 
need to be someone else We live in a world where 
everything needs to be perfect 
sometimes I get so scared that 
you won't think that I'm good enough so 
baby, if you let me be myself 
then I can be all that I can be for you 
this I promise to you I can feel there is so much more in me 
if you want girl you go exploring me 
all of that talk is boring me 
psychologically extorting me 
I don't wanna wake up another day 
and look at myself in a negative way 
maybe right now is the time to say I'm not gonna play that game no more We live in a world where we 
can't be ourselves 
but baby with you I don't 
need to be someone else Let me break it on down now: 
can't afford it Imma be the one that pays in the end 
need to tell you cause I know I'm not as real as I can 
Need to do it cause the feelings got me hurting baby 
need to show you cause the feeling's got me burning baby 
baby you and I can go to places undiscovered 
Let's surrender baby done with being undercover I got to stand up to everything that is wrong within my life, oh girl 
and I hope that I inspire you 
to do the same, oh to do the same 
to do the same We live in a world where we 
can't be ourselves 
but baby with you I don't 
need to be someone else no no no no no no...
