I lost all the riches 
The diamonds in the mine 
It turns out that this was the best thing 
To ever happen to me 
Errors and glitches 
And what a way to find 
That such hurt can bring you a greater piece of mind Ooh 
Bring me 
Piece of mind 
Ooh 
Bring me piece of mind If you've ever lost every part of yourself 
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue 
It will be only a matter of time 
Before your life comes through for you If you've ever lost every part of yourself 
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue 
It will be only a matter of time 
Before your life comes through for you If you've ever lost every part of yourself 
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue 
It will be only a matter of time 
Before your life comes through for you If you've ever lost every part of yourself 
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue 
It will be only a matter of time 
Before your life comes through for you
