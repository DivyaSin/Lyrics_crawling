Verse 1: We may feel all alone 
We may feel like giving up 
But you said "I have power over death" 
And you are not dead yet 
No, you are not dead yet Chorus: Wake us up, Holy One 
Hallelujah 
We are your daughters and sons Oh you can meet God, 
Said the father to us 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
We are Yours! Verse 2: We may say that we can't change 
We may try to run away 
But you said "I have power over death" 
And you are not dead yet 
So we cry out Chorus Bridge: So we ask you to change us 
And awake us 
And fill our hearts with grace 
with our hands raised We surrender 
For meaning, for nothing 
Lord change us by your grace 
By your grace, yeah! Chorus
