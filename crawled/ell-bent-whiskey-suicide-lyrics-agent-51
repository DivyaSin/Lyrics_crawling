YEA! I've seen the worst I've seen the best Time is runnin out once again for me 
I try so hard just to pay the rent 
I try so hard just to make a dent 
Believe it or not its killing me 
Lets get blinded by the lies 
Kick one back and take it out 
Hell bent whiskey suicide ohh yea! 
Lets get blinded by the lies 
Chace it down and take it out 
Oh my god I see the light 
?? 
Paybacks comin round the bend 
Now its time to take revenge 
For all the Fuckin shit that they've been givin' YEA! 
Give me fire or give me death 
Light that fuckin cigarete 
??
