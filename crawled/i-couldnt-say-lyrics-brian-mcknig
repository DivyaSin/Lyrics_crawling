Baby, I saw you standing all alone 
In the moonlight, wishing as I may 
And I might have just one night with you, pretty mama 
Showdown, not ready but willing 
To slow down, 'cause I want to please you 
I'll be around, after the lovin' is through But if we move too fast 
Will we wake up bein' strangers? 
We've got time, let it pass 
'Cause how will we know 
How far it will go, will it end? I couldn't say, I love you tomorrow 
It's too big a chance to take 
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow 
It's too big a move to make 
We'd be makin' a big mistake Don't get me wrong, 'cause I want you 
More than you know, but let me get to know you 
Make my heart show what my feelings show 
Then I'll get closer to you But I'm just so helpless against your touch 
I'm defenseless, you're makin' me weak 
But I've got to be strong 
If right by you, I'm gonna do But if we move too fast 
Will we wake up bein' strangers? 
We've got time, now let it pass 
'Cause how will we know 
How far it will go, will it end? I couldn't say I love you tomorrow 
It's too big a chance to take 
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow 
It's too big a move to make 
We'd be makin' a big mistake But if we move too fast 
Will we wake up bein' strangers? 
We've got time, let it pass 
'Cause how will we know 
How far it will go, will it end? I couldn't say I love you tomorrow 
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow 
I wanna do right by you baby 
It's too big a move to make 
We'd be makin' a big mistake I couldn't say I love you tomorrow 
It's too big a chance to take 
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow 
It's too big a move to make 
We'd be makin' a big mistake, yeah I couldn't say I love you tomorrow 
It's too big a move to make 
'Cause I'd be afraid you'd love me tomorrow 
Yeah baby, it's too big a chance to take 
We'd be makin' a big mistake
