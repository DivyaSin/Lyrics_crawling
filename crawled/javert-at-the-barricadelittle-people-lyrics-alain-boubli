GAVROCHE 
Liar! 
Good evening, dear inspector 
Lovely evening, my dear. 
I know this man, my friends 
His name is Inspector Javert 
So don't believe a word he says 
'Cause none of it's true 
This only goes to show 
What little people can do! And little people know 
When little people fight 
We may look easy pickings 
But we've got some bite 
So never kick a dog 
Because he's just a pup 
We'll fight like twenty armies 
And we won't give up 
So you'd better run for cover 
When the pup grows up! GRANTAIRE 
Bravo, little Gavroche, you're the top of the class! PROUVAIRE 
So what are we going to do 
With this snake in the grass? ENJOLRAS 
Tie this man and take him 
To the tavern in there 
The people will decide your fate 
Inspector Javert! COURFEYRAC 
Take the bastard now and shoot him! FEUILLY 
Let us watch the devil dance! LESGLES 
You'd have done the same, Inspector, 
If we'd let you have your chance! JAVERT 
Shoot me now or shoot me later 
Every schoolboy to his sport 
Death to each and every traitor 
I renounce your people's court! COMBEFERRE 
Though we may not all survive here 
There are things that never die GRANTAIRE 
What's the difference, die a schoolboy, 
Die a policeman, die a spy? ENJOLRAS 
Take this man, bring him through 
There is work we have to do! (Javert is bundled away as the first shots ring out. 
Eponine enters, wounded) JOLY 
There's a boy climbing the barricade! MARIUS 
Good God! What are you doing? 
'Ponine, have you no fear? 
Have you seen my beloved? 
Why have you come back here? EPONINE 
Took the letter like you said 
I met her father at the door 
He said he would give it (She collapses in his arms) Don't think I can stand any more. MARIUS 
Eponine, what's wrong? I feel... 
There's something wet upon your hair (There is blood on his hands) Eponine, you're hurt 
You need some help! 
Oh God, it's everywhere...
