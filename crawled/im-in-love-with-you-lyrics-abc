I - I would swim the seven seas 
I - I would crawl upon my knees 
I - Climb mountains high for you 
I - Would guarantee your every dream come true 
...Come true Oh I - I'm in love with you 
Yes it's true 
Oh I - I wouldn't cheat on you 
Yes it's true 
Oh I - I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
With you... I - I would drink an ocean dry 
I - Would pluck the moon out from the sky 
I - I would build a palace just for you 
I - I could give you... Park Avenue 
...Park Avenue Oh I - I'm in love with you 
Yes it's true 
Oh I - I wouldn't cheat on you 
Yes it's true 
Oh I - I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
With you... I - I could travel back in time 
I - I would kill a man to make you mine 
I - I would leap the Empire State 
I - I'd win a war, just to conquer hate 
...Conquer hate Oh I - I'm in love with you 
Yes it's true 
Oh I - I wouldn't cheat on you 
Yes it's true 
Oh I - I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
With you...
