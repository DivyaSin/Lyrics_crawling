(One, two, three, four) My father said "Son, now my life's work is done 
There's a future for you, there's a job to be done 
Stop fighting the system 'cause the system won't break 
Get your hair cut boy and learn from my mistakes" 
Now I said to my father "Father give me a break 
There's a million more chances that I'm bom to take 
I don't want to die like I saw you die 
In a dead end job in a dead end way" How many years must I waste in these black times 
How many years must I waste Today I can't find nothing nowhere 
Tomorrow I might find something somewhere 
Give me a future now 
I need it so badly now 
Oh For tomorrow "These are times of recession" father said unto me 
"Don't you leave now my son, you'll break our family" 
I said, "I've got ideas that I cannot deny 
If I stay I'll be killed by the dreams on my mind." How many years must I waste in these black times 
How many years must I waste Today I can't find nothing nowhere 
Tomorrow I might find something somewhere 
Give me a future now 
I need it so badly now 
Oh for tomorrow I see the signs of black times everywhere I run 
I can't can't escape them 
No matter how hard I try 
I see these signs of black time everywhere I run 
I can't stand another day 
I gotta move away 
I gotta move away Today I can't find nothing nowhere 
Tomorrow I might find something somewhere 
Give me a future now 
I need it so badly now 
Oh for tomorrow 
Oh for tomorrow
