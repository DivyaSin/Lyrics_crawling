Lyrics: jones & winn 
Music: jones & winn Lyrics: Hello to the moon 
I look at it and I think of you 
Hello to the blue 
And capture it like a lonely tune 
Well is it too much? 
Overdone, like a fun stunt 
Too much is all I want 
I need to find it again 
Like a monkey grin Shine on when I turn to you 
Shine on when I look at you 
Shine on when the music's blue 
Shine on like a cuckoo's coo Now I'm feeling like a big star 
I've got the world on my shoulders 
Then I'm driving in my big car 
Babe you better move over 
You know they say I'm going to go far 
I've got my six-string guitar 
So when you see me in my big car 
Beep beep First light never seen 
Yellow moon followed me to sleep 
Tongue in cheek tongue in hand 
Followed me like a "lonely woman" 
Well am I all right? 
I need the back-beat 
To keep me upright 
All right is what I like 
Need to find it again 
Like a monkey grin Beep beep 
Babe you better move over
