Generation X. A generation vexed, we can't remember why or what for. We used to be so beautiful... so filled with rage, smashing up the whole place. Now we're headed downhill so fast... picking up speed, we can't even see that we're running on empty. Empty pockets, empty souls... so what you gonna do? What you gonna do when it ain't cool to be a loser no more? Generation X. A generation vexed, they stole the soul and sold it back as an aesthetic. And we're feeling like deja vu, and it's pathetic that we're blaming you. Now we're headed downhill so fast... picking up speed, we can't even see that we're running on empty. Empty pockets, empty souls... so what you gonna do? What you gonna do when it ain't cool to be a loser no more?
