Yea I'm getting older now what can I say 
Everyone you know starts to go away 
But you know that track that puts you back into that place 
With a smile or a tear running down your face 
And you get that taste, and you want it back 
But you know you can't get it cuz its in the past 
And it happened so fast, and you don't know where it went 
Did you give it your all, one hundred percent? 
Let this song be the song you won't forget 
Let it represent all that hasn't happened yet 
Let this song be the song of your youth 
If you feel it in your heart then you know that it's the truth Prehook 
The more I fight the more I pull it back inside of me 
The more I am the more I fucking need to try to be Chorus 
Open up your eyes 
Now tell me what you see 
Nothing more to hide 
Now tell me what you see 
Everything I was 
Now tell me what you see 
Is nothing more because 
It's who I used to be 
I'll tell you what you'll see 
I'll tell you what you'll see 
What can I do I tried everything 
I never lied and I never hide anything 
What I felt I pushed to the side 
And it came back around cuz the feelings don't die 
Inside it rest in line 
Till it's too much to hold and it freezes time 
Look around nothings the same, nothings ok 
Nothing ever heals the pain 
The more I fight the more I pull it back inside of me 
The more I am the more I fucking need to try to be 
Open up your eyes 
Now tell me what you see 
Nothing more to hide 
Now tell me what you see 
Everything I was 
Now tell me what you see 
Is nothing more because 
It's who I used to be 
I'll tell you what you'll see 
open up your eyes 
I'll tell you what you'll see 
Remember way back when 
I told you what you'll see 
Well everything for you 
Means so much more to me 
Nothings what it seems 
Now the time has come 
And this all goes away 
now I'm not on the run 
Remember way back when 
I told you what you'll see 
Well everything for you 
Means so much more to me 
Nothings what it seems 
Now the time has come 
And this all goes away 
Now I'm not numb 
And I'm not numb 
And I'm not numb 
And I'm not numb 
And I'm not numb 
The more I fight the more I pull it back inside of me 
The more I am the more I fucking need to try to be 
Open up your eyes 
Now tell me what you see 
Nothing more to hide 
Now tell me what you see 
Everything I was 
Now tell me what you see 
Is nothing more because 
It's who I used to be 
I'll tell you what you'll see 
I'll tell you what you'll see 
Look around, look around 
I'll tell you what you'll see 
Nothing's the same, look around, never heals the pain 
Look around, nothing ever heals the pain
