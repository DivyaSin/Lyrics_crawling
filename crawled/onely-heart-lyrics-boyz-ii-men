Mike and a girl talking to each other: Girl: mike.. 
Mike: yeah, baby 
Girl: it's over 
Mike: how can you say that? 
Girl: I'm sorry. the love is gone. 
Mike: no, please don't leave me. 
Girl: don't feel bad. 
Mike: how can I not feel bad. I love you. 
Girl: but, it's better this way. 
Mike: no. I don't believe this. 
Girl: no, baby I never thought that it could be 
You would turn and do this to me 
I can feel the love that we had between us 
Merely fade away 
You told me you'd never go away 
And for me you'd always be here 
Now you tell me that somethings wrong and you must move on Chorus: 
Lonely heart is what I'll be 
And no one cares for me 
Let me show you now 
The way that it would be if you were with me 
Now I can feel the love we share 
When you say it's not there 
Deep inside I know that you still care 
But I need you to show me now I'm lookin' for a quiet place where love is free 
And the dreams we shared last eternally 
I feel now that it's the time 
So won't you please come over here 
The closer and the closer I get to you 
Keeps me warm to know that you'll stay around 
So please keep your promise to me and don't go Chorus Let me show you now 
The way that it would be if you were with me 
Now I can feel the love we share 
When you say it's not there 
Deep inside I know that you still care 
But I need you to show me now Chorus (fades out)
