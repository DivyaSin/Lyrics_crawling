THERE'S A STORY TO BE TOLD 
THE ARMY RIVAL MARCHES TOWARDS THEIR GOAL 
WE ARE PREPARING, CALLING GODS TO BE BOLD 
NO TIME TO WASTE, NO TIME TO MOURN AS WE DO SO, THERE'S A FALLING RAIN 
AND CRYING CHILDREN, BEING FRIGHTENED AGAIN 
WE ARE PRAYING, NOT WATCHING BEHIND 
ONLY SCARY PICTURES ROAM IN YOUR AND MY MIND WRETCHED MEMORIES, ALL AROUND BURNING FIRE 
SEEING MEN, LIFELESS BODIES HANG ON BARBED WIRE 
NOT SURRENDERING, THIS IS A WAR, WE'RE GOING FAR 
THE BATTLE BEGINS, SPREADING THE STATE OF VUKOVAR AND EVERY SINGLE TEAR IS FILLED WITH DEADLY BLOOD, A FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM 
THOUSAND ANGELS CRY, THE LAST GOODBYE THAT COMES, FOR NOBODY'S REASON SO WE TAKE OUR WEAPONS, NOT ENOUGH, HELMETS AND FIGHT 
STRUGGLING FOR SUPPLIES, PREPARING FOR TOUGH NIGHT 
WE FEEL SOMETHING IS BEHIND, THE ETERNAL SCARE 
THERE IS MUCH MORE OF THEM, WHAT'S NOT FAIR AND EVERY SINGLE TEAR IS FILLED WITH DEADLY BLOOD, A FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM 
THOUSAND ANGELS CRY, THE LAST GOODBYE THAT COMES, FOR NOBODY'S REASON AND EVERY SINGLE TEAR IS FILLED WITH DEADLY BLOOD, A FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM 
CALLING ALL OUR GODS, WITH HEARTS FALLING APART, NO MERCY NOR WISDOM BARE BODIES, LIFELESS SIGNALS, TRYING TO BE FINE 
ADRENALIN RUSH, AS WE MARCH STRAIGHT IN THE LINE 
THEIR ARTILLERY, HOUSES THAT VANISH, ARE WE DOOM? 
THEN HELP ARRIVES, HERE WE GO, RISE AND BOOM SO THE AGES HAVE PASSED, ON THE GROUND WE'RE STILL 
THERE'S NO SUPPLIES, ONLY THAT STRENGTH, ALTHOUGH FILL 
BUT NOT GIVING WHAT BELONGS TO US 
FOREVER VUKOVAR, WE ONLY HAVE THAT TRUST CHORUS 2X AS THEY'RE HAVING THEIR LAST FAILED EMBRACES 
FREEDOM GATES ARE OPENING IN FRONT OF OUR FACES 
ALL THAT BIG HEROES, FRIENDS OF MINE AND THY 
THEY'RE TRAVELING NOW, CAN'T TELL YOU HOW AND WHY
