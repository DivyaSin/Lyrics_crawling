you were sewn to the ground, so you cut the wires of lead. 
you swim against the tide, yet you drowned in the sky. 
you whispered to make a sound, and you crawled to reach the ground. 
you held your head up high, yet you duck beneath the clouds. 
you are on your way. this one was locked, closed down and refrained. 
you tore through the glass, no one could understand. 
as you pushed them all away, you made them all return. 
this on was overcome, yet you lost in the end. 
you are on your way.
