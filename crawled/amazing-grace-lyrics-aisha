Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me 
I once was lost, but now am found 
Was blind, but now I see It was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fears relieved 
How precious did that grace appear 
The hour I first believed Through many dangers, toils and snares 
I have already come 
It is grace has brought me safe thus far 
And grace will lead me home. The Lord has promised good to me 
His word my hope secures 
He will my shield and portion be 
As long as life endures When we've been there 10,000 years 
Bright shining as the sun 
We've no less days to sing His praise 
Than when we'd first begun Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me 
I once was lost, but now am found 
Was blind, but now I see
