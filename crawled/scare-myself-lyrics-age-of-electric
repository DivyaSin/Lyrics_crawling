You're sick of me, and no-one else 
I must agree, I scare myself 
Can you explain, why this must be 
Like pulling teeth 
I got my secret from you 
Dirty and hideous, burned and scarred by the truth 
Unbearable, the Gods they smile down on you 
Wings of perfect apathy, banished serpent am I 
You're sick of me, and no-one else 
I must agree, I scare myself 
Can you explain, why this must be 
Like pulling teeth 
A child of perfect neglect, arrive in agony 
Recoil at my touch, don't look at me 
Your distance keeps you safe, conscience your enemy 
With mercy on your lips 
You're sick of me, and no-one else 
I must admit, I hate myself 
Can you explain, why you and me 
You're sick of me, and no-one else 
I must agree, I scare myself 
Can you explain, why this must be 
Like pulling teeth 
Like pulling teeth, I scare myself 
Like pulling teeth, I scare myself
