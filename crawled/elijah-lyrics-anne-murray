I have no fancy sermon, 
Just a plain and a simple song, 
That you can play in the key of 'A', 
If you'd like to sing along, It's all about the way things are, 
And not the way things might have been, 
You can be ridin' in the hurricane's eye, 
And still have peace within! I live for my own pleasure, 
I was a leader of the blind, 
A passenger on the road to fame, 
I was a legend in my mind Ah, but when the truth came to me, 
Well I sadly did confess, 
With just a pile of rags before God's eyes, 
In my righteousness, Elijah was a man, 
Just like you, 
Sometimes happy, 
Sometimes blue, 
He was a little bit impatient, 
But he somehow knew, 
If he waited on the Lord, 
He would surely come through! Well I nearly searched this whole world over, 
Just to find me a place of rest, 
Where I could be myself and do, 
All of the things that I love best! Like a black sheep a wandering, 
Or a rebel in retreat, 
Never found contentment children, 
'Til I fell at the Shephard's feet! Elijah was a man, 
Just like you, 
Sometimes happy, 
Sometimes blue, 
He was a little bit impatient, 
But he somehow knew, 
If he waited on the Lord, 
He would surely come through! [musical interlude] Elijah was a man, 
Just like you, 
Sometimes happy, 
Sometimes blue, 
He was a little bit impatient, 
But he somehow knew, 
If he waited on the Lord, 
He would surely come through! Whoa-a Elijah was a man, 
Just like you, 
Sometimes happy, 
Sometimes blue, 
He was a little bit impatient, 
But he somehow knew, 
If he waited on the Lord, 
He would surely come through! Elijah was a man, 
Just like you, 
Sometimes happy, 
Sometimes blue, 
He was a little bit impatient, 
But he somehow knew, 
If he waited on the Lord, 
He would surely come through!
