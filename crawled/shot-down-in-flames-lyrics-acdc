(Yow! One, two) 
Out on the town, looking for a woman 
Gonna give me good love 
Anybody want to hand off me 
And give me plenty of 
She was standing alone over by the jukebox 
Like she's something to sell 
I said, baby what's the going price? 
She told me to go to hell Shot down in flames 
Shot down in flames 
Ain't it a shame 
To be shot down in flames Singles bar, got my eye on a honey 
Hanging out everywhere 
She might be straight 
She might want my money 
I really don't care, no Said, baby, you're driving me crazy 
Laid it out on the line 
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said 
Toss off buddy she's mine 
Oh! Shot down in flames 
Shot down in flames 
Ain't it a shame, yea yeah 
To be shot down in flames Hey you Angus, shoot me, shoot 
That's nice, woo! Uh! Oh! Oh! Wooooh! Shot down in flames 
Shot down in flames 
Ain't it a shame 
To be shot down in flames Oh 
Shot Shot down in flames 
Shot down in flames 
Ain't it a shame 
To be shot down in flames I don't want the pain 
Don't want to be shot down in flames 
Ohhh
