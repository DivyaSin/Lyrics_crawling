A chilling silence, a world of violets 
My breath materialized again 
Immaculate, inanimate 
A comfort cutting time I see a string of white lights Forever walking through December 
Forever 
Forever longing for a sign of life, a bringer of light 
Forever wandering together through 
A world of violets Ice everlasting 
A full moon casting a purple veil enshrouding all 
I perambulate, somnambulant 
A solace piercing time I see a string of white lights Forever walking through December 
Forever 
Forever longing for a sign of life, a bringer of light 
Forever wandering together through 
A world of violets If only one for night, if only for one night 
If only for one night remember 
If only for one night, if only for one night 
if only for one night together Forever walking through December 
Forever 
Forever longing for a sign of life, a bringer of light 
Forever wandering together through 
A world of violets
