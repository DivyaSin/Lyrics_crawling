I have been trying lately to close my eyes 
Those little lambs complaining they're getting tired 
Try as I may and I would fell off my bed 
Don't tell me no bedtime stories 
They just won't do this time 
I know just what the cure is it's gonna work 
I need to get you by my side 
There's no other way But every time I try to catch you I stumble and I fall 
How do I begin to finish this never ending fairy tale 
I need to get back to reality 
Every time you do that thing the thing you always do 
I ended up in misery while starring at your photograph 
I'm loosing my grip to reality I woke up turn on the TV for a thousand times 
Reruns I've seen to many on the animal show 
The tiger runs after the dear and he finally catches on I see the end of the rainbow not far away 
This time I'm gonna let it slide
