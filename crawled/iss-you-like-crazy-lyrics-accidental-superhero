i heard you on the radio 
i don't know what to say to you so i thought i'd come up to the bedroom 
but i tripped on your straw broom 
failed to circumvent the event that made it so 
stayed up for the video 
the one on our favorite show 
dropped your hands as the lights went down 
and the air left my lips without a sound i miss you like crazy 
don't want to be alone anymore 
don't want to be alone i thought of nothing else but you 
and it looks like he did too 
saw the trap of the cult of that 
that makes me do what i don't want to 
and now it's up to you 
whatever you want to do 
saw you hands pretend to despair 
and your mouth looked like it cared for something new i miss you like crazy 
don't want to be alone anymore 
don't want to be alone make up your mind 
make up your mind 
now it's up to you i miss you like crazy 
don't want to be alone anymore 
don't want to be alone
