It's about being like a leaf in the wind I wish I could soak in the energy of the city that I live in (Amsterdam) 
To every breathing thing around me I wanna give in 
Like a prostitute in the window I am ready and willing 
and like the old dude with the beard and the guitar I'm maximum chilling It's about being like a leaf in the wind (light and open) 
it's about taking all the energy in 
Then it's about giving all that energy back 
You gotta make it yourself good-life-living set I wish I could take on another identity cause I would be stealing 
Just that rush alone gives me a brilliant feeling 
I don't mind that art oldskool, sniff-o-ghetto vibe...I'm cool with it 
I said art oldskool, sniff-o-ghetto vibe...I'm cool with it It's about being like a leaf in the wind (light and open) 
it's about taking all the energy in 
Then it's about giving all that energy back 
You gotta make it yourself good-life-living set I want to see hypnosis I want maximum dosis 
You can take my soul cause I want to feel like moses 
I want to see hypnosis, I want maximum dosis 
You can take my soul cause I want to feel like moses I wish I could soak in the energy of the city that I live in (Amsterdam) It's about being like a leaf in the wind 
it's about taking all the energy in 
Then it's about giving all that energy back 
You gotta make it yourself good-life-living set We ain't joking around
