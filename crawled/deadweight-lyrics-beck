On a highway unpaved going my way 
You're so alone today 
Like a ghost town I've found 
There's no relief, no salt in the sea 
Is it true what they say 
You can't behave 
You gamble your soul away 
Measuring your dreams of this life seems 
Like the gristle of loneliness Don't let the sun catch ya crying 
Don't let the sun catch ya crying Like an nice age nice days 
On your way sipping the golden dregs 
On a rip tide freaks ride 
Sleep inside a parasite's appetite 
Oh say can't ya see the chemistry 
The parasites, the cleanup fee 
Death leather hands recycled cans 
Get well cards to the hostage vans Don't let the sun catch ya crying 
Don't let the sun catch ya crying You're a dead weight right straight 
On your way sunk in the midnight shade 
Skies burn eyes turn 
Learning to counterfeit their disease 
In this town where we roam 
We bluff our souls on canteen patios 
Drink the greatest draft 
The music drags the music drags	the music drags Don't let the sun catch ya crying 
Don't let the sun catch ya crying
