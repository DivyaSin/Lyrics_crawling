The time is now and I'm running so thin 
I got thin, I got thin, while the others got fat 
So fatten up and deliver your secrets 
Those secrets, those stories untold Sorry to say love is a game 
We're all just pawns in the way 
Lost, lost, lost, move the rook-E-eight 
Eliminate and get this game underway Too many secrets are shattering our lives 
While others are stuck in expansive time 
I've been trying to get out of this 
Goddamn fucking game So back it up and up to down 
Down, downtown, don't you tell me wrong 
Choose your battle of words that rule the world 
It's in our heads anyway Speak of the devil and I just may appear 
I appeared in your dream, when you dreamed of getting ahead 
Headless chickens that are missing their exes 
So axe this and go to the next, next chapter Too many secrets are shattering our lives 
While others are stuck in expansive time 
I've been trying to get out of this 
Goddamn fucking game So back it up and up to down 
Down, downtown, don't you tell me wrong 
Choose your battle of words that rule the world 
It's in our heads anyway [Incomprehensible] Which shall I be, a warlock or a priest 
A pagan, Christian or an evangelist? 
Pledge my alliance in the name of science 
Follow the moth into the fire 
Getting my head in a bit of a twist 
What does it matter when your enemies are my friends? Self serve friends, who are friends for a second 
I second that notation, it feels so intense? 
Intensely fishing without a hook, line, and sinker 
I sank to bottom, we'll bottoms up to you Please inject some instant karma 
Into my instant coffee 
Soon, soon, soon with the rope in the kitchen 
All the answers will be on there way Too many secrets are shattering our lives 
While others are stuck in expansive time 
I've been trying to get out of this 
Goddamn fucking game So back it up and up to down 
Down, downtown, don't you tell me wrong 
Choose your battle of words that rule the world 
It's in our heads anyway
