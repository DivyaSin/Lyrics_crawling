Station, static lo-fi 
I'll get my head on straight and I'll call you 
Read, but don't read into it 
There's no lonelier place I know than a postcard 
And I've got my own problems sown 
Where do we start this? 
If you're leaving you better make it quick 
The more you complicate 
The bitter the taste If I ever get back to my California... 
If I ever get back to my California... 
I've been tryin' and tryin' 
Tryin' to get it right 
But you know its hard to take it easy Everything you swallow makes a hole in your body 
You can't sleep at night 
Everybody talkin' 'bout the hole in the heavens 
The bitter taste If I ever get back to my California... 
If I ever get back to my California... 
I've been tryin' and tryin' 
Tryin' to get it right 
But you know its hard to take it easy
