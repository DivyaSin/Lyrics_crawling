Hey, I think you're cute 
Would you like to be my new best friend? 
We can talk for hours or just lay in bed 
You're just the kind of kid I could grow old with 
So won't you walk with me to the park up the road I told you that I'd be right back 
You said that "I'll be the judge of that 
'Cause, see, boys they have a tendency of running from me 
As fast as they can 
I don't know why" 
And i just laughed and asked if you'd like 
A Coke or some sort of assorted beverage 
From the diner up the road 
If so, you should walk with me 
Feel free to hold my hand 
Feel free to kiss me on the cheek even though I'd 
Even though I'd prefer the lips Hey, I think you're groovy 
Would you wanna see a movie with me? 
We can sit in uncomfortable seats and eventually 
I'll get the nerve up to put my arm around you 
Can I put my arms around you? 
'Cause I'd sure like to It'll be like an episode of Boy Meets World 
Except without the commercials 
And i'm just fine with that 
How about you? 
How about you? I like the way you talk 
I like your dyed black hair 
I love your half-ass accent you stole from the foreign movies 
I like your pretty eyes, and how you're afraid of the dark 
Well I am too 
So would you like to take a walk with me? 
Through a well-lit park 
Just up the block I'll be the bright side of your bad day 
I'll be the bright side of your bad nights 
I'll be the bright side of your bad day 
If you'll be mine
