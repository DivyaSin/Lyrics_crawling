When days are going crazy 
The world can make you lazy 
Youre caught up in a haze that wont let you go 
The borders in your mind bring problems and you find 
Its hard when youre in a bind to live what you know Words are empty 
And they dont mean 
That your dutys anywhere but your hands 
Every ocean 
Needs some motion 
You gotta get on up and do what you can No words Can take the place of action 
No talk can change the truth so 
Stand Up Its not enough to say it 
Your faith is measured by the things that you do Theres more to every season 
Than logic, rhyme and reason 
People wont always know the plans in your head 
If you aint always reachin 
To practice what youre preachin 
What good is anything that you may have said Faith is empty 
When you dont see 
That your creed is not just some words you pray 
Whats compassion 
If its just fashion 
What goods the map if you dont follow the way No words Can take the place of action 
No talk can change the truth so 
Stand Up Its not enough to say it 
Your faith is measured by the things that you do Run where the road will go 
Live what you think you know 
Love is a gift you share 
Working will be your prayer Actions the price you pay 
For the gift of each day 
I dont care what you say 
Its what you do Nows the time to leap 
Though its not easy 
And miracles cant sleep 
In your head 
But how would someone act, if you really 
If you believe a man can rise from the dead No words Can take the place of action 
No talk can change the truth so 
Stand Up Its not enough to say it 
Your faith is measured by the things that you do No words Can take the place of action 
No talk can change the truth so 
Stand Up Its not enough to say it 
Your faith is measured by the things that you do Run where the road will go 
Live what you think you know 
Love is a gift you share 
Working will be your prayer Actions the price you pay 
For the gift of each day 
I dont care what you say 
Its what you do
