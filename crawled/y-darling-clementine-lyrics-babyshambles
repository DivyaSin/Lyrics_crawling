My darling Clementine, you know I love you 
My darling Clementine, you know I do 
I bless and curse the day I found you 
I wonder why 
I get lost in the wonderland around you 
...

But you're always welcome here 
I keep love handy, I keep it near 
And I take note of all of your witty reposts 
And I follow with the famous quotes and 
If i say I care, I really mean it She's got the money, and she 
She's moving on 
She's thinking on 
She's thinking on all the good advice 
Because there's always good advice The man with the golden arm rarely deals a joker 
But he kept two aside, just for you 
He burnt your fingers in the fire
