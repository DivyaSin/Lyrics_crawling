Theres the cool kids 
Theres the preps and theres the skate punks and the jocks 
And then theres me 
Theres the losers 
Theres the nerds and theres the stoners and the Goths 
And then theres me But then theres you 
Cause you're the new kid in the school 
Not defined by one specific breed 
And so your free to flip from group to group 
From scene to scene 
Cause you're the consulate, the medium, the go-between 
Which means your perfectly positioned to get me what I need Evan: 
Look, Archie, Im the wrong guy for this. Archie: 
One date, thats all Im asking. Evan: 
Isn't there some nice girl on the special needs bus? Archie: 
They don't like me 
Even back before the crutches, it was clear I don't fit here 
So its hopeless 
I cant walk right up to Kendra and say Hey, 
Shed run away But look at you 
You're making friends and having parties 
And adapting at impressive speed 
Just twenty minutes as were sitting so our knees can touch 
Yes, its a tiny inconvenience, but it means so much 
Cause out of all of Indiana, you can get me what I need Evan: 
Its impossible! Archie: 
And what I need is Kendra! Others: 
Kendra, Kendra! Archie: 
Beautiful Kendra! Others: 
Kendra, Kendra! Archie: 
Wonderful Kendra! 
Make her appear! Boys: 
If you want a girl, the girl you want is Archie: 
Kendra! 
Very hot, Kendra! Boys: 
Very hot, very hot Archie: 
Go tell Kendra 
Im waiting here Heres the problem 
Every minute, every second that I wait might be too late 
So lets face it, 
If I ever had a chance, the time is now, I don't care how 
Just do your best 
And I wont bother you again and thats a promise guaranteed So, you can help me out and it can go through very well 
Or I can turn around and make your life a living hell 
Its up to you, you've got a choice, you've got incentive to succeed 
Yes, I know it sounds insane 
Jerry Lewis can explain 
You've got to help me, Evan 
Help me, Evan 
Help me, Evan 
Help me, Evan 
Get me what I need Evan: 
Ill try! Archie: 
I knew you would.
