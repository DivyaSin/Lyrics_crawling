She said she was not the one for me 
There was nothing I could do to change her mind 
She said she was sorry but some things arent meant to be 
She was unaware that she was robbing her heart blind (Chorus) 
What she dont know is Ill always love her forever 
What she dont know is that Ive never done her wrong 
Underestimation will break her heart for sure 
What she cant see, what she dont know 
Wont hurt her but its killing me Deep in the shadows of the smokey neon lights 
I play myself in a lonely game of pool 
I chalk it up as he sits down by her side 
I take another shot, swallow my pride and I play a fool Chorus Watching her dance with him 
Around that empty hardwood floor 
Is like putting sawdust in the wound 
And I cry a little more Chorus
