[Verse 1] Now baby I ain't got a lot but I'm determined 
Not tryna put you on the spot but girl it's urgent 
When every single time I see you's like a circus, yeah yeah 
And every word up out your mouth is like a sermon Cause when your big eyes looking at me 
I be feeling hella sprung 
And I don't even know your name, but 
All them details is irrelevant [Chorus] I don't know your name 
But I think that I might love you baby, baby 
Every time I open up my lips 
I end up talking crazy, crazy I done caught your eye a couple times 
Have you noticed lately, lately 
I been down here for so long 
Someone come and save me [Post Chorus] I been down here for so long, come and save me 
I been down here for so long, so long 
I been down here for so long, come and save me 
I been down here for so long [Verse 2] Do you have the time to give at all? 
Working like a factory 
So come and give it back to me, yeah Do you have the time? No not at all 
'Cause you won't give it back to me 
And this ain't happen naturally, yeah Return it back 
Give it back one time 
No turning back 
I'll earn it back one time 
No curving that 
You hurt me bad one time yeah Return it back 
Give it back one time 
No turning back 
I'll earn it back one time 
No curving that 
You hurt me bad one time yeah [Chorus] [Post Chorus] (x2)
