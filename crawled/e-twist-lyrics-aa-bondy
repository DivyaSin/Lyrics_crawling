I see these creatures in tired action 
I hold the blade with the midnight arm 
My brother dreams in real violence 
My brother, dreaming through the red 
In ritual positions, I kneel before his love 
Far away from the world 
I follow all these signs and wonders 
I walk on by the suicide doors 
Under the stars in animism 
I'll hold the mirror for the ghost 
In ritual positions, I kneel before his love 
Sometimes in benediction, a mouth to sing the flood 
Far away from the world
