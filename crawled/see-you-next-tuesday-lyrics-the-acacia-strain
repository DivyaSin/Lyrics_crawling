I said run. 
And you won't be able to see me because you'll be bleeding from the eyes. 
The thought of your genitals makes me sick and I bet you could fit five cocks up that ass. 
Why don't you just strap a mattress to your back? 
These are the last days of the rest of your life. 
Next time I want a better excuse - dropped like a bad habit. 
I wash my hands of you all. 
My slate is clean. 
And I'll be smiling all the way to the bank. 
Face down, ass up; I want to destroy something beautiful. 
By the end I want everyone dead. 
By the end I'm going to be the only one standing. 
Not even your children are safe.
