Starship settles down and sets me free 
Sand dunes stretch as far as the eye can see 
The twin suns break me down on Tataouine The winds rise up and sling the sand across this brutal desert land 
Lost inside the Great Dune Sea I fear there is no hope for me 
I feel the troopers closing in so my gears grind and my wheels spin 
And I push for the distant shore cuz I'm the droid they're looking for Canyon walls are looming over me 
Sand dunes strech as far as the eye can see 
The desolation breaks me down on Tataouine
