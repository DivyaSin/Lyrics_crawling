By the glaze in your eye, 
By your shape, by your size, 
By the pen in your heart, 
By the art in your room, 
By your bicycle. 
By the hole in your shoe, 
By New York, by the blue, 
By the song in your throat, 
By the sting in your nose, 
By your watermark. 
Ooh Belle, 
It's not like I couldn't tell, 
The shape of your sadness 
Can't hide behind your little shell. 
You can pull on the chain, 
You can knock on the door, 
You can sing in the rain, 
You can roll on the floor, 
You can separate. 
You can run in the halls, 
You can paint on the walls, 
You can bow to the sun, 
You can spit in the eye 
Of everyone. 
Ooh Belle, 
Sometimes I'm overwhelmed. 
Then you overcame salvation 
the further you fell. 
Sun set only brings the colors out, 
And they were always there. 
Masters make their systems so their family 
Is in the hands of other men. 
Oooh Oooh Oooooh, 
La la la la la la la la. 
By the sand in your eye, 
By the shine in your lip, 
By the crack in your voice, 
It's a feel, not a choice, 
That I come to you. 
It's the chain of events, 
It's the came and the wents, 
It's the least that I have, 
It's the most I can give. 
Ooh Belle, 
I hope that you're doin' well. 
The trick of the Devil 
Is to make you think 
You're livin' in Hell. 
Oooh Oooh Oooh, 
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oh Oh Oh. 
Ooh Belle, 
Sometimes I'm overwhelmed. 
The trick of the Devil 
Is to make you think 
You're livin' in Hell.
