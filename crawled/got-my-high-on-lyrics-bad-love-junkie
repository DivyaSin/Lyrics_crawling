I called you up 
To take you out for drinks 
But you said it was too late 
You already had a your high on 
I said I'd come over 
Just to scratch you back 
But you said: give me a break 
You already had a high on a high on 
I thought of packing up my shit 
And leaving town 
When the car broke down 
By the time I got back home 
I found you on the floor Use to care but now I don't 
Death is sweet and life's a joke 
And I've already got my high on my high on 
As I wallow in the pain and waste away 
And I just wish that I could fall asleep 
Just fall asleep I've tried but I just can't forget 
I hear your voice inside my head 
I've already got my high on 
I've already got my high on 
I've already got my high on
