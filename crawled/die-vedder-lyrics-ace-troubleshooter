You, object of all my hate 
'cause you, object of all her love 
Yeah it's you, you she's thinking of Teen idol, you're ruining my life Looming larger than life 
You never give a chance 
To an average Joe Schmoe like myself 
And I get tired 
You've got your millions, so why take her? You got all that nice long hair 
But you don't even know her 
So why does she care about you? 
It should be me she's thinking of
