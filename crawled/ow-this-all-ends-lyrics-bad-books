I arrived with no shoes 
Without a name, without a use 
I tried to talk it out of you 
Just because I found it's best, 
To keep it quiet and keep it still You sat without your clothes 
Without a name, without a home 
And I love the weirdness of it all 
So I stalled, 
Saying everything, that's everywhere 
Is lost (Yeah, Everything, that's everywhere is) Now, I can see 
In the end, we unfortunately 
Have to end either way 
That we put it either way 
The book says 
And i know what it does 
And you pass, to pretend 
What you have 
And the inkling, the clue 
How we all got here 
How this all ends I hung another noose 
Without a hand, without a tool 
There's no way, that its up to you 
So cry to me, 
Everything, everywhere ends 
It's true Now, I can see 
In the end, we unfortunately 
Have to end either way 
That we put it either way 
The book says 
And i know what it does 
And you pass, to pretend 
What you have 
And the inkling, the clue 
How we all got here 
How this all
