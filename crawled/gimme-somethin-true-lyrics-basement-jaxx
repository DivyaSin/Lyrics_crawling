(get on on it, get on on it) 
Those lonely nights you spent without me baby, done something to you, 
Those lovely nights when we were one without a care we used to do, 
I need to find the love we lost and hide between the cracks of what we knew 
Another soul I call who wonder through the maze of love and can't find something true Know the dawn is coming soon 
But baby hold me close and set me free (yeah) 
Because the magic is the music and the music is my melody 
C'mon now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme something true 
C'mon now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme something true (get up on it) (basement jaxx representing new york city) 
Those lonely nights you spent without me baby, done something to you, 
Those lovely nights when we were one without a care we used to do, 
If we could face the family be we'd find the rhythm to set our mind and body free 
But girl it's magic when we touch 
Oh when we touch just you and me Know the dawn is coming soon 
But baby hold me close and set me free (yeah) 
Because the magic is the music and the music is my melody 
C'mon now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme something true 
(oh gimme gimme gimme) 
C'mon now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme something true
