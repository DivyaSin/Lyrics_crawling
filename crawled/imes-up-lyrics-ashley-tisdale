I've played the song, now it drives me crazy 
I've run a race, now I'm too damn lazy 
This is love of ours is so sad it makes me laugh today 
Seems a little different 
Hard to say, but it looks like the end Time's up 
Promise this time I'm getting off 
Better we slam the door shut 
Didn't you know if nothing changes, nothing changes 
Time's up 
Promise this time I'm getting off 
Better we turn the lights off 
Love is a train 
We wait for it even when it's gone We've surfed the wave, now we've hit the short end 
We've squeezed the fruit 'til there's no more juice left 
We're both so good 
Good at keeping up the lie 
We can get it in perspective 
Kiss my lips 
Life is what we make it Time's up 
Promise this time I'm getting off 
Better we slam the door shut 
Didn't you know if nothing changes, nothing changes 
Time's up 
Promise this time I'm getting off 
Better we turn the lights off 
Love is a train 
We wait for it even when it's gone As I'm waving you goodbye I want you to smile 
Save the picture in your frame followed right next to my name 
I'm willing to die for love, willing to try, but not willing to lie for love 
I know that this cake's already baked 
Now it's burning, burning 
We can get it in perspective 
Kiss my lips 
Life is what we make it Time's up 
Promise this time I'm getting off 
Better we slam the door shut (oh, yeah) 
Didn't you know if nothing changes, nothing changes 
Time's up (even when it's gone) 
Promise this time I'm getting off (even when it's gone) 
Better we turn the lights off 
Love is a train 
We wait for it 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Even when it's gone 
Even when it's gone 
If nothing changes, nothing changes Time's up (even when it's gone) 
Promise this time I'm getting off (even when it's gone) 
Better we turn the lights off 
Love is a train 
We wait for it even when it's gone
