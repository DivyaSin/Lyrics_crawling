her name is cigarette 
and i can't quit 
'guess i'm the malboro man 
she likes my west and shirt 
more than my cowoy boots 
i saw her put it on this morning I was lying in bed 
stealing looks in her silouhette 
smoking a cigarette 
we ain't finished yet 
you've come a long way baby i'm a tobaccoman 
not a medicine clown 
i walk a mile for your camel oh darling put on a film 
and make the room that we like to hide in 
uuuh... na na nanana na na. 
no need to talk 
and here we go again 
right now, baby well, right now 
couldn't care less 
what the people have said 
fire, babe we're on fire 
and all i want is one more day 
with you Smoking a cigarette 
a little russian roulette 
we keep on spinning 
what's all this about? 
when i thought i was out 
you pull me back in i might not be boyfriend material 
but i'm different from the hang out wit 
if that's what you are looking for now 
the two of us can be a hit well baby put on a film 
like we're gonna watch the whole thing 
uuuh... 
na na.... 
no need to talk 
and here we go again 
right now, baby well, right now 
couldn't care less 
what the people have said 
fire, babe we're on fire 
and all i want is one more day 
with you....
