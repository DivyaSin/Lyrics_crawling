Somehow... someway... somewhere 
Bad blood - When you speak you know I'll listen 
Bad blood - all your kisses now I'll miss them 
Bad blood - a bulletin on in car system 
Bad blood is back There are those who complain 
There are those who cope 
There are those who lose all belief 
There are those who still hope 
There are those who can solve your problems 
There are those who live life like a TV... 
Life like a TV soap Gonna bring bad blood 
Bad blood - When you speak you know I'll listen 
Bad blood - all your kisses now I'll miss them 
Bad blood - a bulletin on in car system 
Bad blood is back There are those you should meet 
There are those to avoid 
There are those who act brave in defeat 
There are those who feel destroyed 
There are those who just mute the heartache 
There are those for whom life ain't over... 
Life ain't overjoyed Gonna bring bad blood 
Bad blood - When you speak you know I'll listen 
Bad blood - all your kisses now I'll miss them 
Bad blood - a bulletin on in car system 
Bad blood is back 
And bad blood breeds bad What's good? 
What's good? 
What's good about goodbye? 
Heartache... heartache... heartache... Bad blood - When you speak you know I'll listen 
Bad blood - all your kisses now I'll miss them 
Bad blood - a bulletin on in car system 
Bad blood is back 
And bad blood breeds bad 
Bad blood... bad blood...
