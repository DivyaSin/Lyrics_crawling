[First Verse] 
Desdemona 
Don't you notice? 
The world keeps spinning 
And it's turning us inside out [Second Verse] 
Desdemona 
Don't you know it? 
We'll climb every mountain 
Just to turn around and take the fall 
Into the clouds [Chorus] [Third Verse] 
Desdemona 
Don't let it control ya 
Set your own pace 
And give what you got in the tank [Fourth Verse] 
Desdemona 
Don't let him fool ya 
Your beauty is a prison 
And the mind can be a miserable place 
Filled with hate [Chorus] [Bridge] 
And in this world of tumbleweeds 
Dragonflies and willow trees 
The great divide of our histories 
The wars that we have known 
The angels still sing on high 
Under moonlight 
The cowboy rides 
The cosmos breathes a quiet sigh 
And we are on our own 
We're all alone [Fifth Verse] 
So Desdemona 
I know you know that 
But love can throw daggers 
And liars can pretend to be saints 
It undermines our faith [Outro]
