I'm tired of fighting, got a fever 
When you try to get out (out, out, out) 
I've tried but I can't understand 
What all the fuss is about 
I wish that I could be the man 
That you wanted me to be 
I need you to see [Chorus] 
I try and I try yet I can't seem to fly 
My soul full of pain when you cry 
I wish I was perfect and God knows I try 
But everything I do just tears your heart in two 
I wonder why I never thought that being lovers 
Meant that we can't be friends 
If only I could understand what makes you stay 
And stop breaking free from me 
I wonder why [Chorus] Can't you see it's killing me 
It's not the way things used to be 
Can you remember yesterday 
We used to smile without a care 
Whenever you and I were near 
Can't you see that I wanna be with you Oh baby Oh, oh, oh everything I do 
Tears your heart in two [Chorus: x2]
