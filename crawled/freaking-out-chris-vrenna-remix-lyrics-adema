I was so much an outcast 
No one ever liked me cause I wasn't wanted 
I was so different from the rest of them all 
Fucked up on the drugs, from all the speed 
And I never got no sleep 
Cause I kept on trippin' over what they said 
And everything that my mom said made me mad 
And everything that my dad said made me sad Why am I even trying? 
I'm crying out, I'm crying out 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out 
Spinning round, spinning round, I've fallen down 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out You keep shootin' those glances 
Relating to the rawness, I'm a fuckin' lost kid 
Trying so hard to become just like me, talk like me, walk like me 
You keep trippin' on everything I wear, every time I swear 
Even when it comes to my hair 
It seems like you don't have the time to relate to my kind 
I'm not a dope pullin' your life Why am I even trying? 
I'm crying out, I'm crying out 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out 
Spinning round, spinning round, I've fallen down 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out 
I'm trippin' out, I'm trippin' out 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out 
Draw me down, breaking down 
I've hit the ground 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out Your dreamy dreads 
Are you still tripping on me? 
You're drinking dread 
Are you still tripping on me? 
Now do you drift? 
Are you still tripping on me? 
Now do you drift? 
Why are you tripping on me? I was so much an outcast 
Find a way to make it right 
I was so much an outcast 
I can't seem to find a way to make it right 
I was so much an outcast 
No ever liked me 
I can't find a way to make it right 
I was so much an outcast 
I can't seem to find a way to make it right Why am I even trying? 
I'm crying out, I'm crying out 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out 
Spinning round, spinning round, I've fallen down 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out 
I'm trippin' out, I'm trippin' out 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out 
Draw me down, breaking down 
I've hit the ground 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out 
I'm crying out, I'm crying out, I'm crying out, freaking out 
Draw me down, breaking down 
I've hit the ground 
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
