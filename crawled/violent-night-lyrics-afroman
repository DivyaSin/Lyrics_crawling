Drink some wine, smoke a blunt with me 
Call up some friends, and play this CD 
Merry Christmas to all of you 
I say yeah, Merry Christmas to all of you Silent night, po-police line 
Stop the engine, keep your head inside 
Cops surround me, pistols in hand 
Three outstanding warrants for just suffering 
Sleep in the county jail, can't post no bail (I wanna wish you a) merry Christmas to all of you 
(holiday is f**ked up) 
Merry Christmas (you gotta have a good time anyway) to all of you 
I said, yeah, merry Christmas Si-silent night (he said silent night), handcuffs are tight (have you ever had the handcuffs tight?) 
People staring at me at the red, red light 
Ninety-five hundred I've seen a far 
Past higher robbing the custody car 
Sleep in the county jail, can't, can't post no bail
