Hey girl 
Keep your head high 
I never said I 
Wouldn't be back when I'm 
Leavin' on the red eye Got to do this show so I can get my dough 
Blow then lay low with you and I 
Huggin' up at the house on the top of the hill 
Where we can drop and get ill A little spot we can chill 
Or hide out when things get real 
Shorty, won't you tell me how ya fell 
If I will How can I be sure 
If your love remains here 
Well, I gotta go Until we get this clear 
Ya just gotta know When you're not here I be so tight 
No matter what I try, it won't go right My shorty 
'Cause you got my back 
My shorty 
We keep it real like that My shorty 
I want to be where ya at 
My shorty 
That's why I feel like that Shorty ain't around... 
I don't feel right 
My shorty 
My baby My lady 
Come with me 
Shorty ain't around 
I don't feel right My shorty 
My baby 
My lady 
Come with me Onto a 2 month 8 weeks 60 days later 
I threw so many groupies off 
One I even made her cry 
Had to tell her I really didn't hate her, right? Couldn't lay her, why? 
'Cause we had to say goodbye 
I never thought that I 
Would never see the day that I Fall for her the way that I did 
So I will say that I 
Never stray cause I find a better way when 
I hold it down and keep it tight 
Could never say goodbye My shorty 
'Cause you got my back 
My shorty 
We keep it real like that My shorty 
I want to be where ya at 
My shorty 
That's why I'm gettin' like that Shorty ain't around... 
I don't feel right
