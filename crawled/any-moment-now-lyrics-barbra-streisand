BARBRA 
Any moment now, he'll notice me 
Me, and my butterfly heart 
Any moment now, he'll turn around and grin 
And say at last where have you been? 
We're late for daybreak on the Riviera 
If not the Riviera, the beach at Malibu 
The rich Madera sunset, going on forever 
With my arms growing cold, 
And his arms growing warm with life unfolding 
Any moment now, he'll say to me 
Why don't you follow your heart? 
How can he know that I've been praying he'd arrive 
Afraid to come alive till then, just saying 
Any moment now HUGH 
Any moment now, she'll notice me 
Me and my, simple guy ways 
Any moment now, she'd said she'd settle down 
If that were true I'd paint the town 
I'd take her flying to Atlantic City 
If not Atlantic City, to see Niagara Falls 
I know a pretty trout stream up above Seattle 
What a life we could build 
in a home, that is filled with love and laughter TOGETHER 
Any moment now BARBRA 
You'd say to me HUGH 
You'd humor me BARBRA 
Chase the past HUGH 
Those overcast days TOGETHER 
How can I begin? 
Forgetting where we've been BARBRA 
To love TOGETHER 
To let the laughter in again BARBRA 
It's always any moment now HUGH 
Oh any moment now
