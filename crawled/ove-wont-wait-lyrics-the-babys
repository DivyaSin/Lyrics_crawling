Tell me that you're lonely 
And you miss me so 
And that you're living for me 
In the afterglow I can feel the passion 
I can feel the heat 
You can't keep a secret 
And I can't be discrete You tell me love won't wait 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait Tell me that you miss me 
And that your heart's on fire 
Living out a fantasy 
And it's all desire Neon lovers making 
Red hot neon love 
Gazing at the sky together 
Into to the stars above They tell you 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait When I'm alone with you 
The whole world seems alight 
Burnin' through the darkness 
'Til the daytime turns to night Love won't wait 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait 
Love won't wait
