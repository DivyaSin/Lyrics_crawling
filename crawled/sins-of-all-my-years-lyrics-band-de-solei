My brother dies and left me 
My Mother moved away 
And I been gone now for so long 
How long I cannot say And I am left to wonder 
What I'm doing here 
Guess I got to pay for 
The sins of all my years I got to pay 
For the sins 
Of all my years I been talking to the lord 
Sweet Jesus let me be 
And please keep the devil 
Far away from me 
Cause I have outrun my fears 
Guess I got to pay for the sins of all my years But I won't be afraid 
And I will find a way 
No, I won't be afraid 
Of the sins of all my years 
If I should live to be half a century 
Is there a way that I can pay and 
Live forever free cause 
My spirit is breaking 
There's not much fight left here 
Guess I got to pay for the sins of all my years But I won't be afraid and I will find a way 
No no I won't be afraid if I have to 
Pay and pay 
If I have to pay and pay and pay 
For the sins of all my years
