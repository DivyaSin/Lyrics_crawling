Well there's a cat in the cradle / A man on the moon / Dope romanticism / In a silver spoon / And burning in the shadow fire / Mutant powers take me higher / In Infernal Justice League / Nothing's quite how it first seems 
Faster than speeding train / Is it a bird or a plane / Hellboy 
I got a soulless luxury / A Babylon of flesh gone bad / I am a real gone ding dong dad / And I will nuke this head of mine / All the way past the sun / I'll take you all to kingdom come 
High as a kite / And out like a light / Calling the gods / Really outta sight / And all the friends / I thought I had / Are really just a load of crap / Who needs shit like that in Hell / Who needs anything in Hell
