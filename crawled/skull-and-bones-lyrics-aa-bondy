There in the wheat, 
I heard you sigh. 
I don't know the size of it. 
Who can know? Patriot, 
Under the spell, 
Maybe howlin' underground, 
Ear at the dirt. Running home with the notion in your head 
Running home with the notion in your head Shadows on the land Whiter the whale 
Nothin' is wrong 
I cannot be here today 
I will not be Skull and Bones 
Taking the fear 
Something for a hungry mouth 
Something for Running home with the notion in your head 
Running home with the notion in your head Shadows on the land
