Stop twisting your 
Words into shapes 
Shapes you can only make out when you squint 
Traveling with 
Heads full of myth 
Our submarine pulls into Stockholm 
Stop! It was one in a series of 
Highlights and holy lows 
One in a series go! Forget yourself 
He's somewhere else 
You have the luxury of b-sides 
Know what I do 
I got buckets full 
Our submarine pulls into Stockholm 
Stop!
