Whoa, oh why why 
Cmon, cmon 
Oh ooo why, yeah 
Verse 1: 
Just touched down from a very long flight 
Its been some time 
Since my heart has beat this fast 
But yes I know why, yeah 
Cuz Im bout twenty minutes away from home 
Cab driver, do you know any other shortcut 
Once I get thru the door you already know what were gonna do 
Pre-Chorus: 
Close your eyes, squeeze my hands 
Brush your cheek against my face 
Boy lets bless every song 
Pick me up, Ill let you take 
Every corner, every inch 
Dont stop staring in my eyes 
Post me up on the wall, get a real good grasp 
Dont let me fall, fall, fall 
Chorus: 
Get ready were gonna close the blinds 
Just stay in all day, do it do it 
Light the candles; well ignore the sun 24/7 
Do it, Do it 
Try a million things some new way 
Why you still got your shirt on? Lose it 
Be honest, you want it, dont have to rush 
All day All day do it, do it 
Verse 2: 
All the neighbors just gonna have to complain tonight, yeah 
Let em go ahead call the cops on us if they like, yeah 
When they come knockin by then, well be lost 
Phone off the hook so we dont need to pause 
See every bit of my four kisses on you 
Baby, close your eyes 
Pre-Chorus: 
Close your eyes, squeeze my hands 
Brush your cheek against my face (against my face) 
Boy lets bless every song 
Pick me up, Ill let you take (pick me up, Ill let you taste boy) 
Every corner, every inch 
Dont stop staring in my eyes (staring in my eyes) 
Post me up on the wall, get a real good grasp 
Dont let me fall, fall, fall 
Chorus: 
Get ready were gonna close the blinds 
Just stay in all day, do it do it 
Light the candles; well ignore the sun 24/7 
Do it, Do it 
Try a million things some new way (hoh oh why) 
Why you still got your shirt on? Lose it (hoo ooo why) 
Be honest, you want it, dont have to rush 
All day All day do it, do it (Ooo baby lets do it) 
Bridge: 
Rewindin, replayin 
What Im ready to do it mind 
So anxious, its crazy 
I can feel it heating up inside 
Ooo woo when Im ready to act it out boy 
We about to be the stars of our own show 
But first lets hold on a minute cuz 
I think its time we lock the doors 
Chorus: (2x) 
Get ready were gonna close the blinds 
Just stay in all day, do it do it 
Light the candles; well ignore the sun 24/7 
Do it, Do it 
Try a million things some new way 
Why you still got your shirt on? Lose it 
Be honest, you want it, dont have to rush 
All day All day do it, do it
