Nothin' in your pocket 
Something up your sleeve 
Look right at my alley 
Coming down my street Gun goes off at midnight 
Whistle blows at dawn 
Give me half the morning 
And we'll carry on Straight from your hip 
Make a backbone slip 
Right in front of my eyes 
Like a sweet surprise, hey, hey, hey, yeah Bet you're gonna find a little foolin' on your mind 
Soon you're gonna feel a little tuggin' on your line 
Bet you're gonna be a little nervous boy 
Run for cover and jump for joy You make me happy 
Without even trying 
You make me happy 
Every time, oh yeah Gotta roll with the punch 
Stagger with the kiss 
Follow what you feel 
On a night like this Gotta raise up the flag 
Holler in the street 
Someone's throwing roses 
All around your feet Straight from your lips 
You're gonna let it slip 
It's there in your eyes 
So don't apologize, hey, hey, hey, yeah Bet you're gonna find a little foolin' on your mind 
Soon you're gonna feel a little tuggin' on your line 
Bet you're gonna be a little nervous boy 
Run for cover and jump for joy You make me happy 
Without even trying 
You make me happy 
Every time, oh yeah Hey, hey, hey, yeah 
Bet you're gonna find a little foolin' on your mind 
Soon you're gonna feel a little tuggin' on your line 
Bet you're gonna be a little nervous boy, oh You make me happy 
Every time 
You make me happy 
Without even trying You make me happy 
Every time, oh yeah Baby, happy, happy 
Happy, happy 
Happy, happy 
Happy, happy 
You make me
