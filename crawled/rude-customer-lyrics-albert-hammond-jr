You, You ask for the bill 
He brings you the change 
You want him to go 
but you just don't know his name x2 It's all just the same It's a rule 
You never thought that you wanted 
Give it time 
And you will see that you want to, want to 
These words ain't solutions 
For your one too many times 
You got lucky 
You're afraid to coexist 
But you want to, want to Want to, want to. You, he wants you to be 
He asks for his faults 
He says we're alone 
Don't you know you're the cause? You, you ask for the bill 
He tells you his name 
You want him to go 
But it won't feel the same It's a rule 
You never thought that you wanted 
Give it time 
And you will see that you want to, want to 
These words ain't solutions 
For your one too many times 
You got lucky 
You're afraid to coexist 
But you want to, want to It could be the change 
You act rather strange 
Could be your fault 
You asked for his name But did you ask for his name 
I saw him let his down his guard
