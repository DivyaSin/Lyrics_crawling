Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling 
Do you feel my heart beating 
Do you understand 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming 
Is this burning an eternal flame I believe it's meant to be, darling 
I watch you when you are sleeping 
You belong with me 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming 
Or is this burning an eternal flame [bridge] 
Say my name, sun shines through the rain 
A whole life so lonely 
And then you come and ease the pain 
I don't want to lose this feeling ...ooooohhhh.... [break] repeat bridge Close your eyes, give me your hand 
Do you feel my heart beating 
Do you understand 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming 
Is this burning an eternal flame Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling 
Do you feel my heart beating 
Do you understand 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming 
Is this burning an eternal flame Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling 
Do you feel my heart beating 
Do you understand 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming An eternal flame Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling 
Do you feel my heart beating 
Do you understand 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming 
Is this burning an eternal flame
