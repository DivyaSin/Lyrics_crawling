look inside yourself 
your soul is hollow 
you live inside your hell 
you're fake and shallow 
the darkness fades to light 
I know you're always right 
because I belong to you I am everything 
I am nothing 
I am what you need 
everything has gone astray 
you are just like me 
you are nothing 
you are everything when everything has gone away don't try to be a friend 
your words cannot defend 
your inflicted wounds 
you cannot compromise 
every single lie that you told 
and you know it's true
