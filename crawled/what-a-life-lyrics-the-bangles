Another crummy perfect day 
Waking up in L.A. 
Never thought that I would stay so long Dusty leaves and bees are hummin 
Ten day says theres no rain comin 
The sun is shining cause 
It nearly always does 
What else can I say What a life 
What a life 
What a life we lead 
Im just layin here 
So wake me when its time to leave Orange sky and ashes falling 
I cant get home the car is stalling 
How lucky can I get? 
I am so fortunate What a Life 
What a Life 
What a Life we lead 
Im just waitin here 
So wake me when its time to leave 
Yeah, wake me when its time to leave Well, its another perfect day 
I guess I wouldnt have it any other way.
