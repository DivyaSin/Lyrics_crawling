Somewhere inside is burning 
I don't know why it's hurting 
Hoping for just one sign in your eyes 
That tells me you will be still Where can I go to find you? 
What must I do to feel you? 
Always looking, but too blind to see 
You were there, right by my side Say goodbye, I'll never forget 
Say goodbye, I believe in the day 
Say goodbye, our hearts could beat both together 'Cause we, we'll find a way...one day What can I do, to hold you 
Now that I know, I love you 
Never found that our hearts felt the same 
'Til the cold light of day stole our dreams Say goodbye, I'll never forget 
Say goodbye, 'cause I believe in the day 
Say goodbye, our hearts could beat both together 
'Cause we, we'll find a way... Say goodbye, I'll never forget 
Say goodbye, I believe in the day 
Say goodbye, our hearts could beat both together 
'Cause we, we'll find a way We will find a way 
We will find a way 
We will find a way
