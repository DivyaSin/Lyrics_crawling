Do you feel your heart beating a million miles an hour? 
Me too Like we're being guided by some higher power 
Me too Do you kinda get the feeling this feeling's so right 
There must be a reason we're together tonight 
Do you think it might be love we're falling into? 
You do? 
Me too Don't you want to know where this emotion is going? 
Me too Wouldn't you hate to go through life never knowing? 
Me too Is it my imagination or is something so strong 
Going on between us that it can't be wrong 
Do you think you've got the heart to see this through? 
You do? 
Me too Do you think you've got the heart to see this through 
I really want to know baby, tell me the truth 
Do you think it might be love we're falling into? 
You do? You do? You do... 
Me too 
Me too Do you feel your heart beating a million miles an hour? 
Me too Like we're being guided by some higher power? 
Me too Say you do, say you do, say you do 
Say you do, say you do, say you do 
Can you feel it? 
Baby!, can you feel it? 
Can you feel it baby? 
Me too
