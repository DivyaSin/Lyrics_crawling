minimal, minimal, physical, magical 
I used to be the man on top couldn't stop 
I used to be the thinking head but it was said 
I used to lead the window race put on a face 
my every joke was funny I had a lot of money 
and all the people are fake can't only take 
I'm losing my mind and way, need to get away 
away from gray and crowded places 
city with many faces, my head is about to blow 
I need to lay low

I used to be the man on top 
used to be the man on top, couldn't stop 
minimal, minimal, physical, magical 
my head is about to blow 
minimal, minimal, physical, magical 
Under the rain I run like a train 
feeding my brain, my private lane 
they will never find me 
I cannot be seen I'm the king of jungle, I will go and win 
this is the life I need now I plan to see only myself to feed 
I'm the man on top don't wanna stop 
my survival is critical

minimal, minimal, physical, magical 
I need to run away and . 
before I go and lose my mind did I lose my mind 
did I lose my mind
