Perfect strangers - both of us know the dangers 
Sharing secrets - in each other-ers arms Time is passing (I am all but frozen) 
One chance is all we're asking (Put your arms around me) 
Somehow, somewhere (Don't know why you've chosen) 
Love will find a way (Someone like me) 
Gently, slowly, let me, fall in love wi-ith you Far across the ocean in the darkest night 
I was sailing on the ship of fools 
But looking in your eyes I see the harbour lights 
Now I just want to stay with you So take my hand, follow me 
Understand what I need 
And love me as if you've always loved me 
'Till the mor-ornin' light - and it's alright 
You're the perfect stranger tonight My love, for you, fills my heart 
The more you, hold me, gently 
In your loving arms Open hearted (I am just a shadow) 
I love the love we've started (Shine your light upon me) 
Sharing, dreaming (You're the only answer) 
In this place and time (I've been waiting for) 
Once in a lifetime, you find love, let it be tonight Far across the ocean in the darkest night 
I was sailing on the ship of fools 
But looking in your eyes I see the harbour lights 
Now I just want to stay with you So take my hand, follow me 
Understand what I need 
And love me as if you've always loved me 
'Till the mornin' light - and it's alright 
You're the perfect stranger tonight
