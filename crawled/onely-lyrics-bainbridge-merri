I was told to toe a line 
Instead I kissed the boys 
And made them cry 
But still you think its funny 
I was late 
Well god told me to wait 
And in the end when hearts were handed out 
Some of us missed out 
But if your lonely 
Kiss the boys 
And make them cry 
It only hurts you for a little while 
And we'll keep turning, 
Turning round the sun and 
All the days roll into one 
I took my time to look around 
In love and other places I have been 
I pushed and stumbled in 
But I was late 
Still god told me to wait 
And if I go up high on my trapeze 
Let's hope that I dont sneeze 
But if your lonely 
Kiss the boys 
And make them cry 
It only hurts for you a little while 
And we'll keep turning, 
Turning round the sun and 
All the days roll into one 
Georgy porgy told a lie 
Kissed the boys 
And made them cry 
When the boys came out to play 
Georgy porgy ran away, 
Georgy porgy ran away 
But if your lonely 
Kiss the boys 
And make them cry 
It only hurts for you a little while 
And we'll keep turning, 
Turning round the sun and 
All the days roll into, into one 
And we'll be turning, 
Turning round the sun and 
All the days roll into, into one 
And we'll be turning, 
Turning round the sun and 
All the days roll into, into one 
If your lonely 
If your lonely 
If your lonely 
If your lonely
