Baby Brown 
I think 
I need you now 
To put me down 
And help me lift me up 
Your shaking bones 
In my telephone 
No good 
For anyone Baby Brown 
So you think you 
Know me now 
You tell me how 
And show me everything 
Your wandering mind 
And your restless kind 
I want you here 
To make some sound Oh, silent night 
Oh, holy night Baby Brown 
Now you're more 
Than you mean to be 
You're mean to me 
You take away from me 
My shaking bones 
In your telephone 
Don't you hear 
That sound Oh, silent night 
Oh, holy night 
Oh, silent night 
Oh, there's a hole 
In the night Oh, silent night 
Oh, holy night 
Oh, silent night 
Oh, there's a hole 
In the night
