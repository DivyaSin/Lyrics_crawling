You shout cease fire 
But the booms and bangs keep drowning out your cries 
And the world comes crashing down before your eyes 
And before mine 
I cannot tell what's right I beg calm down 
But it's more to you to stay and 
stand your ground 
Don't you see we're losing more than what we found 
Through this fire and dust 
We'll never come around I'd lay down my gun 
If I weren't the only one 
And I'd give up this fight 
If it meant we'd sleep tonight 
I'd go gladly through the flames 
If it meant you'd speak my name 
With love in your voice You want no more 
Because to win's no longer worth the damage done 
And if you could I know you take it back and run 
And you can't be blamed 
Cuz if I could I'd do the same
