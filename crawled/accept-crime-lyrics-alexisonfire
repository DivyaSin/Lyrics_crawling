Everybody on the count of three 
Accept crime 1-2-3 
Bethlehem to Galilee 
Accept crime 1-2-3 Between the sheets, the voyeur watches you 
And each caress takes us one step further from his tired truth 
Say, we will be free, to use our bodies as we please 
We will be free, to use our bodies as we please Say hey! There's no police! 
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts 
Hey! There's no police! 
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts Let the clergy damn our every emotion 
Until every impulse is a revolution 
And will we know to bring good, we'll let it carry us through 
It's your chance to use your disobedience 
We will say 
We will be free, to use our bodies as we please 
We will be free, to use our bodies as we please Say hey! There's no police! 
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts 
Hey! There's no police! 
There's no police, no police between two beating hearts I'll feel no guilt 
I won't repent 
Day to day I accept crime 
And that's for me to confess Hey! There's no police! 
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts 
Hey! There's no police! 
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts 
Between two beating hearts 
Between two beating hearts 
Between two beating hearts 
Between two beating hearts 
I know
