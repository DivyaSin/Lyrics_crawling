Can't see the pain 
I feel it 'cause it hurts 
Hope it gets better 
Will you be my nurse? There's no heart broken 
That your love can't fix 
Oh please fix me 
Before the silence hits You make me feel so good 
You're my pure delight 
You lift me up in the galaxy 
You're my triangle of light You lift me up in the galaxy (x6) Let's rock this road together 
I'll make it good for you boo 
Let's rock this road together 
Is there something I can do Oh save me from myself 
I'll make it good for you boo 
Let's rock this road together 
Are you feeling it too? Oh oh oh oh, eh ya eh ya (x4) You make me feel so good 
You make me feel much better 
You're my pure delight 
You're my pure delight 
You lift me up in the galaxy 
I'm on cloud nine, cloud nine 
You're my triangle of light You lift me up in the galaxy (x6) Let's rock this road together 
I'll make it good for you boo 
Let's rock this road together 
Is there something I can do Oh save me from myself 
I'll make it good for you boo 
Lets rock this road together 
Are you feeling it too? Oh oh oh oh, eh ya eh ya (x4) You lift me up in the galaxy You're my pure delight
