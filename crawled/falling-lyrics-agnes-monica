I have been on this road 
so many days 
about million faces 
but i'm feeling alone 
from city lights 
took instant storm 
from to the last 
but then staying home.. when i'm alone, i think of you.. 
and i keep falling falling in the edge.. even though it's raining.. 
I can keep on smiling.. 
coz I know I'm falling into you.. we don't know where we going 
we just keep in moving 
all I know I am falling into you.. 
lets just get fallingfallingfalling hiye iye iyee.. now you not there 
no plan at all 
take me a man 
did you just give me my own 
but you are there 
and i am here 
there a feeling 
has there ever been this clear 
when i'm alone, i think of you.. even though it's raining.. 
I can keep on smiling.. 
coz I know I'm falling into you.. we don't know where we going 
and we just keep in moving 
all I know I am falling into you.. lets just get keep falling falling falling hiye iye iyee..

striving out on your eyes
