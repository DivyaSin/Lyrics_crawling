I swear to you I will always be there for you 
There's nothin' I won't do 
I promise you all my life I will live for you 
We will make it through 
Forever, we will be 
Together you and me 
Mm, when I hold you nothin' can compare 
With all of my heart you know I'll always be 
Right there 
I believe in us, nothin' else could ever mean so much 
You're the one I trust 
Our time has come, we're not two people 
Now we are one, yeah, you're second to none 
Forever, we will be 
Together, a family 
The more I get to know ya, nothin' can compare 
With all of my heart you know I'll always be 
Right there Forever we will be 
Together, just you and me 
The more I get to know ya, the more I really care 
With all of my heart you know I'll always be 
And you know I really love ya, nothin' can compare 
For all of my life you know I'll always be 
Right there
