From grace she fell beneath the ashes 
That forced her to her knees 
Cut her open wide To bleed her body dry of feeling 
The wounds the wounds will form no scars, only memories.. Tearing at the scars, she's open wide 
Screaming 'til her lungs collapse 
(Inside) 
Behind her cold and vacant eyes, 
Her innocence that dies inside.. 
Dies inside! The tears that line her face.. 
The anguish! 
The lies she'd fed herself 
Closing, loveless eyes To bleed her body dry the feeling 
Of breath escaping lips, closing lifeless eyes Tearing at the scar, she's open wide 
Screaming 'til her lungs collapse 
(Inside) 
Behind her cold and vacant eyes, 
Her innocence that dies inside.. 
Dies inside! She dies inside! 
She dies inside! 
She dies in Tearing at the scar, she's open wide 
Screaming 'til her lungs collapse 
(Inside!) 
Behind her cold and vacant eyes, 
Her innocence that dies inside.. 
Dies inside! 
Tearing at the scars and now she's open wide 
A broken, bitter heart that's stained in black 
Behind her cold and vacant eyes, 
Her innocence that dies inside.. 
Dies inside!
