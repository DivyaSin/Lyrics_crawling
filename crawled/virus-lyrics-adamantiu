Down instead of up, back instead of forward, 
faster and faster, begging to stop. 
Stop the madness. 
Slipping backwards, losing your life, 
the whole fucking world, to its knees by this virus. 
Could you stop yourself before? 
Before this has gone too far. 
This has gone too far. 
Stop the madness.
