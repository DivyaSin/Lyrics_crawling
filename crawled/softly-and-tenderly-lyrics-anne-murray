Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling 
Calling for you and for me 
See all the portholes 
He's waiting and watching 
Watching for you and for me Come home, come home 
You who are weary come home 
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling 
Calling all sinners, come home. All for the wonderful love he has promised 
Promised for you and for me 
Through all our suffering 
He has mercy and pardon 
Pardon for you and for me Come home, come home 
You who are weary come home 
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling 
Calling all sinners, come home.
