Remember all those nights 
When all our neighbours could hear us sing 
Remember all the fights 
And all the make ups that they would bring But now those days are gone 
And summers turned to fall 
You know how much I know 
But please I beg don't call I'm trying to leave you alone 
I've been dying to pick up the phone 
And around and around and they always go 
But I can't love you again 
Can't love you again
