You blow my mind, with the things you do to me 
Girlie I can't resist your luscious lips caressing my body How do you keep not from fallin 
Fallin in love, with a girl that can do you 
The way you like to be done You blow my mind with the things you do to me girlie I cant resist your 
Luscious lips caressing my body Takin my time with you girl 
Never know when we'll do this again 
Takin my time with you girl, 
Touchin your love stokin you from within (hook) I hear your voice callin 
(baby please pick up the phone) 
But I don't wanna answer

So I'm tellin you not to fall in love with me Repeat hook 3x The time is right for you to be 
Close to me 
Indefinately 
They say good things come to those 
Who wait I need to hold you in my arms
