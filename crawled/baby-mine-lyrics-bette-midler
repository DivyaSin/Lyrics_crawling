Baby mine, don't you cry. 
Baby mine, dry your eyes. 
Rest your head close to my heart, 
Never to part, baby of mine. Little one, when you play, 
Pay no heed what they say. 
Let your eyes sparkle and shine, 
Never a tear, baby of mine. If they knew all about you, 
They'd end up loving you, too. 
All those same people who scold you, 
What they'd give just for the right to hold you. From your hair down to your toes, 
You're not much, goodness knows. 
But, you're so precious to me, 
Sweet as can be, baby of mine.
