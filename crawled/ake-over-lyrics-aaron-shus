I tried to run 
I tried to fight You 
But I'm done 
I'm giving up 
I've learned to trust You, Your love No I'm singing Can You take over? 
Take over 
Can You take over me? 
I've been here over and over again 
Here on my knees 
I'm only closer and closer 
To where I wanna be 
When You take over, take over 
Can You take over me? I tried before 
To let go 
And I just hold on more 
Amazing Lord 
I need the strength to let go 
And be Yours So now I'm singing Can You take over? 
Take over 
Can You take over me? 
I've been here over and over again 
Here on my knees 
I'm only closer and closer 
To where I wanna be 
When You take over, take over 
Can You take over me? I surrender all I have 
And I surrender all I am 
As I remember what You've done to set me free I just want to sing Can You take over? 
Take over 
Can You take over me? 
I've been here over and over again 
Here on my knees 
I'm only closer and closer 
To where I wanna be 
When You take over, take over 
Can You take over me? Can You take over? 
Take over 
Can You take over me? 
I've been here over and over again 
Here on my knees 
I'm only closer and closer 
To where I wanna be 
When You take over, take over 
Can You take over me? Take over me 
Take over me
