I have been so alone my whole entire life 
I gotta get a break 
I needed comfort although I'm home alone 
I just got no way 
I gotta get a guy 
To take care of me I gotta get the right man... 
Gotta Find the right man 
Oh, find the right man I wonder how I'd feel if he was never around 
If I was by myself 
I'd be so frightened, I'd be a baby again 
'Cause I'd have no one else 
I'd have to wear a frown 
While walking through the town I'd be without a man 
I'd have to find the right man 
Oh, gotta find the right man But even if I get my boy 
How am I gonna know (he's the right man) 
I gotta meet a guy, go out on a date 
(spoken: That's for you, mom & dad) So I can find the right man 
I've gotta find the right man 
My own right-hand man 
Help me find the right man..
