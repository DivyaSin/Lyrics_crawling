And if I knew the answers I would tell you now 
Just what would be the chances that I could show you how 
If I knew where all the tears were coming from 
Add up all the years that you've been gone 
This is that new song 
I told you about twenty years ago Do you know what true romance is and could you show me now 
Just what would be the chances that I could tell you how 
If I knew where all the tears were flowing to 
Guide them to a river where I'd swim with you downstream 
This is that old dream I told you about twenty years ago And could you hold me now
