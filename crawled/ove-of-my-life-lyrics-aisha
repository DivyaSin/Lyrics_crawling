Verse 1: I asked you the way to your heart 
And you told me I was always there 
It's nice to know you care 
It brought tears to my eyes 
When I realized 
How much You love me 
I've never truly loved someone before 
Until You I was never sure 
It was love 
You understand me in a way 
That not many people do 
I love you 
You saw through the disguise 
You saw the tears in my eyes 
That I could not cry 
And didn't even want to try Chorus: So when anyone asks me 
Who the Love of my life is 
I tell them you 
I knew you were the one 
I'd love for the rest of my life 
You are the love of my life Verse 2: What can I say 
About the love that changed my life 
Other than I love you 
I've never met anyone like you 
That sees life the way you do 
The love you've given me 
For eternity 
Saved me Repeat chorus Bridge: I don't deserve such a love 
But I thank God above 
That he sent you The love of my, the love of my life 
The love of my, the love of my life
