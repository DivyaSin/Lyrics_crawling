Yeah, told you we'd be back 
Welcome to hell There's a switch, I flip, I spit emotions cut off 
So cold I'll roast my butt off 
And it ain't even anticipating the tip of the 
Ice burg in the middle of the ocean yet so fuck off 
Other words I didn't put a dent in a can 
Compared to the damage I've yet to do Long as you still have feelings to hurt 
I'll be around as long as you let me get to you 
Long as I got two balls to palm 
I'll be the bomb, you're just a false alarm Get scared little piss ants 
And see if I don't come along and stop your farm 
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail 
Sleet with a tornado's the kind of brainstorm I get 
So when the wind starts blowing, shit, talking about goin' in? 
Goin' insane's more like it Wizard of words when he he spits hazardous with it 
Like a disastrous blizzard 
So you better listen quick fast don't miss it 
Yeah go ahead little prick bastard, diss it But when you get hit with a sick ass explicit flow 
Don't ask how much of his passion is it that goes 
Just know, that all he knows is this 
It's better to kick ass than kiss it Dick dastardly of audacity mental capacity 
Unmatched it has to be stopped 
But it can't be, but man I can't just keep doing them like that 
Or no one will rap with me 
'Cept one, you asked who is it? Guess who just came through to blast you bitches 
With the ratchet, the book of Mathew, a book of matches 
Lighting 'em under white linen You about to have to admit it 
They pass you the mic, asked you to spit it 
You got handed your own ass, your ass in your own hands 
I'm sure they gonna laugh when you go into the bathroom with it 
Now with what would you come against us? 
Better be something with a big foot pedigree Easily these are the reasons that we need to be in your prayers 
Each region breed some emcees that wanna be, 
Which means they wanna breath our air 
With these ideas, anybody thinkin' that the game don't need 
The bad and the evil regime 
That's like saying that bad boy 
Piston team didn't need Isaiah Sip piss and bleed, 
This is a different breed of emcees, I swear 
Better be aware, there's too much at stake, 
And to find someone this raw on a beat is rare 
You can kiss my ass 
And the shit stains on my underwear that I don't even wear This gotta be no fair 
This like hittin' the lottery, oh yeah 
Who you know hotter? there gotta be no pair 
Shotty that I got a lobotomy, your hair 
Classic, smack it, smother it 
Read it and weep and perhaps you'll have no rebuttalin' 
In fact, you seein' me in this rap 
Is like saying tila tequila can sing like Jasmin Sullivan Back to bash her skull again 
Push a bitch out the Aston until I get the fuck outta dodge 
Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors? 
You has been's are dumber than 
Color books that ain't colored in Second and third, fourth wind, gotta another win 
Here they come again, none other than, bad and evil 
Also known as Sadam and Osama Bin It's been a long time, 
But I bet neither one of us have felt as sick as we do right now 
And we only get iller with time, 
Me and nickel fucking shit up on the grounds 
Tellin' us to pipe down 
It's like talking to a meth head Bruce Willis on his death bed 
Last breath with an infection 
Fightin' it while he's watching internet porn 
About to meet his death with an erection 
My god, what I mean is 
David Carrideine jacking his penis in front of his tripod 
Choking his own neck, what part you don't get? 
I'm saying I die hard When you listen to my bars, nothin' but the fire 
Comin' out your iPod, we come up in a place 
Chicks heads start spinning like motherfuckin' white walls Got your mother suckin' my balls while we fuck each other 
Punch each other in the eyeballs 
And I never say I'm sorry, the five nine and the Fire Marshall 
We spit with an intensity to shut shit down in the industry 
Two different entities, with a propensity to put these nuts 
Inside of your fucking mouth
