Oh shit (oh shit) 
Ohhhhh

Fergie Ferg, what's up, baby? [Verse 1] 
When I come to the club, step aside. 
Part the seas, don't be hate me in the line. 
V.I.P., 'cause you know I gotta shine. 
I'm Fergie Ferg, give me love you long time All my girls get down on the floor, 
Back to back, drop it down real low. 
I'm such a lady, but I'm dancing like a hoe, 
'Cause you know 
I don't give a fuck, so here we go! [Chorus] 
How come everytime you come around, 
My London, London bridge, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, be goin' down like... How come everytime you come around, 
My London, London bridge, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, be goin' down like... [Bridge] 
As the drinks start pouring, 
And my speech start slurring, 
Everybody start looking real good. [Verse 2] 
Grey goose got your club feeling loose. 
Now I'm wishin' that I didn't wear these shoes. (I hate heels) 
It's like everytime I get up on the dude, 
Paparazzi put my business in the news. And I'm a get up out my face, (oh shit) 
'fore I turn around and spray your ass with mace. (oh shit) 
My lips make you wanna have a taste. (oh shit) 
You got that? 
I got the bass. [Chorus] 
How come everytime you come around, 
My London, London bridge, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, be goin' down like... How come everytime you come around, 
My London, London bridge, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, wanna go down like, 
London, London, London, be goin' down like... [Bridge 2}
