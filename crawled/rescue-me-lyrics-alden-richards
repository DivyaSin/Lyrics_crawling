Sky is gray 
Moon is pale 
Find the missing colors 
Smoke like in the air 
Never been 
Haven't seen 
A shelter to get over 
A secret hide away Rescue me 
You're all i have 
Turn to me 
Come take my hand 
Don't know where i stand 
Nowhere to be found 
Rescue me 
Let love suffice 
Let illusions leave my eyes 
Temporary lies, turn to paradise 
Rescue me, Rescue me Another day 
Not astray 
Gather shattered pieces 
While you are on your way 
All i see, is you and me 
Clear as the water 
Pure as it can be Rescue me 
You're all i have 
Turn to me 
Come take my hand 
Don't know where i stand 
Nowhere to be found 
Rescue me 
Let love suffice 
Let illusions leave my eyes 
Temporary lies, turn to paradise Imaginary lines 
Drifting on my mind 
Lighten up the burden inside 
Wait until tomorrow 
Soon the sun will rise 
Will be together in time Rescue me 
You're all i have 
Turn to me 
Come take my hand 
Don't know where i stand 
Nowhere to be found 
Rescue me 
Let love suffice 
Let illusions leave my eyes 
Temporary lies, turn to paradise 
Rescue me (Rescue me) 
Rescue me (Rescue me) 
Rescue me (Rescue me) 
Rescue me
