I used to smoke my brains out 
Fly through the sky 
I used to freak out 
Didn't wondered why 
I heard the Stones a rollin' 
And I'd roll too 
I didn't care what I was doin' 
As long as I was with you I was blown (woo woo) 
And that's what you are now 
I was blown (woo woo) 
Didn't care why or how 
I was blown (woo woo) 
Ran and jumped and screamed 
I was blo-o-own 
Right inside a dream I used to tell my story 
Right out loud 
I sure was in my glory 
I sure was proud 
But then one day I fell down 
I couldn't get up 
People crowdin' all around 
That was when they locked me up I was blown (woo woo) 
And that's what you are now 
I was blown (woo woo) 
Didn't care why or how 
I was blown (woo woo) 
Ran and jumped and screamed 
I was blo-o-own 
Right inside, Right inside 
Right inside a dream I was blown (woo woo) 
And that's what you are now 
I was blown (woo woo) 
Didn't care why or how 
I was blown (woo woo) 
Ran and jumped and screamed 
I was blo-o-own 
Right inside, Right inside 
Right inside a dream I was blown (woo woo) 
I was blown (woo woo) 
I was blown blown blown (woo woo)
