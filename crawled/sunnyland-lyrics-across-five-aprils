With heat commence,why would you just want to ride the fence.Your taste is luke warm and with it you lost all of your charm.What about the things we had.What about the things you said.What about the way you look laying in my bed.What about the things we had.What about the things you said.What about Sunnyland.You left me without one shred of clarity.I made you and I'll break you you're nothing without me.There is no love here there is no love, There is no love here there is no love.You little slut go get yourself some self-respect.Don't tell me you're sorry.I'll never be your plan b.its darkness everyday guess I'll be on my way.Take off your mask and get some self-respect.You lost me it's over hope you have a nice day.What about the things we had.What about the things you said.What about the way you look laying in my bed.What about the things we had.What about the things you said.What about Sunnyland.Caught in the moment never wanted it to stop.In retrospect I should have pushed you off the top.I've got something you wish you had.I have something you'll never have.What about the things we had.What about the things you said.What about the way you look laying in my bed.What about the things we had.What about the things you said.What about Sunnyland.
