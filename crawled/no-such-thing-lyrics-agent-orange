hey your kind of acting strange to me 
you really shouldn't be so rude 
i think i've seen you change your mind before 
i've never seen you change your mood 
everybody get away from me 
don't everybody push and shove 
everybody stop asking me 
i'm telling you i'm not in love there's no such thing 
it doesn't matter to me i know 
there's no such thing 
isn't that a relief to know 
there's no such thing hey you, snap out of it 
it's time for you to act your age 
no you're never gonna get your way 
so break into a screaming rage 
a good excuse t start a non-stop teenage romance 
turning love into lust 
i'm only looking for somebody to talk to 
or somebody that i can trust [chorus]
