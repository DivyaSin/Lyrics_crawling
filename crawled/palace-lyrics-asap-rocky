[Hook] 
God damn, how real is this? 
I know the whole world gonna be feeling this 
East coast nigga, but how trill is this? 
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss 
[Screwed] 
God damn, how real is this? 
I know the whole world gonna be feeling this 
East coast nigga, but how trill is this? 
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss [Verse 1] 
Stone cold love 
Rose gold slugs 
I could afford it 
I imported stone cold drugs Stone cold, rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga 
Write it on my tombstone, I was stoned nigga Don't remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga 
Slash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, Nah 
Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music 
A trill nigga to the truest 
Show you how to do this My all gold grills give her cold chills 
Said she's got a coke feel cause I'm so trill 
Two dope boy scales, but I sold pills 
No L, put her on her feet, toe nails Them vampires, them blood suckers, them thirsty killers 
We bout it bout it, we rowdy rowdy, that Percy Miller 
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla 
No bounty hunters, I'm bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla Give me the title, then give me the cash 
Fold it then bag it then move to the trash 
Follow my stash 
Stealing my swag 
Niggas is wickity wickity wack 
Like Kriss Kross 
Her lip gloss, slip-ons get slipped off 
My bitch, boss, Cristal We smoking then thinking then burning that hash 
Puff it and pass 
Making it last 
Walk in my shoes 
And cross in my path Game was for grabs 
Making them crash 
Took in a section 
And giving they back [Screwed] 
Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life 
The insights of my trill life [Hook]
