I know I'm alone, but somebody's watching me 
Follows me everywhere I go 
A cold flow surprised me again, I shiver 
The presence of something I can hear it's breathing Leave me alone, wherever you came from 
Hearing so much voices, no one's talking 
Oh leave me alone Leave me alone, wherever you came from 
Hearing so much voices, no one's talking Waiting for something, nothing in the black of the night 
Creeps around you, the invisible force that makes you crazy 
I can't remember how it feels to be warm, to be alone... 
Without that fear deep inside me Icons of death float on beyond me 
whispering my name and breathing my fear... The menace of insanity 
Inner voices cry out for action 
Defenceless as I am 
Lost in the alleged paradise I'm not sure if I am here or elsewhere 
Searching for satisfaction 
Beyond the frontiers of my comprehension Leave me alone, wherever you came from 
Hearing so much voices, no one's talking Leave me alone, wherever you came from 
Hearing so much voices, no one's talking 
Oh leave me alone
