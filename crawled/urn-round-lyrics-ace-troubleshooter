Turn round and I will press your hand 
If you will put our hands together now 
Turn round, don't stir under my gaze 
And you will hold my gaze forever now Now you know it, girl please don't run 
So turn round, turn round 
It's not over, it's just begun 
So turn round, turn round Turn round and watch the shooting stars 
And we'll name all the stars together 
Turn round and stay a while, stay 
Enchantress say you'll stay forever now Now you know it, girl please don't run 
So turn round, turn round 
It's not over, it's just begun 
So turn round, turn round Turn round, turn round 
And turning round be mine 
Turn round, turn round 
And turning round be mine Turn round, turn round 
And turning round be mine 
Turn round, turn round Turn round, turn round 
And turning round be mine 
Turn round, turn round 
And turning round be mine Now you know it, girl please don't run 
So turn round, turn round 
It's not over, it's just begun 
So turn round, girl turn round
