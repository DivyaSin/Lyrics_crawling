[music: nick, aborted; lyrics: nick] Random torture, suffer by my hand 
Slicing and cutting, submit to my torment 
Pierced with nails, wired to the celing 
Reincarnated puppet, patched human being 
Vacilating on the verge in a blaze of gory 
Moulding the eructations of my carnal artistry Gathering the insides, winnowing inferior guts 
I sever and dismember, hack fervidly with gasping cuts Muscular limbs, a perfect casket 
The slenderest torso, how fanatic can I get ? 
Diffirent corporal parts, agglutinated with suture 
From a mental delusion to a morbid stature
