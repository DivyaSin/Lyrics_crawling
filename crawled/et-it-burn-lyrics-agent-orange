I propose that we devise a plan 
Down to every last detail - we cannot fail 
'cause the only thing that's standing in our way 
Is disastrous betrayal 
So let the driving force prevail now I'm falling back on all the dreams we left behind 
It's a lesson that I never thought I'd learn 
Tonight I'm gonna sacrifice something I really love 
Feel it melt into my hands and 
Let it burn - all night long ever since the day it all began 
Massive walls surrounding me - on every side 
Now I hear a crash - they all come tumbling down 
As memories collide - I'm living for that wild ride could it be that I've forgotten what I came here for? 
When I leave this world, I never will return 
I know the only way for me to save my soul tonight 
Is to light the midnight lamp and 
Let it burn - all night long
