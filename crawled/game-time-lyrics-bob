[Verse 1 -B.o.B] 
Hahaha 
Hahaha 
You feel it? 
Well if youre trying to stop me it dont matter 
I got the power of a 40 caliber 
Got the flow, got the style, got the stamina 
Better call you a police and ambulance 
Cuz Im rippin em down tasin em down 
Slower than four legged animals 
All I need is a blunt of that canibus 
And I leap in the air like a catapult 
Look way up there its a bird its a plane 
No its the savior to change the game 
Doin my damn thing 
Shootin em up like bam bang pow 
Getting a little bit now 
Lettin em know to bow down 
Yup its b o bizzle and Im letting em know what Im about. [Hook - B.o.B] 
They got the cameras on let em know its game time 
Strap em up strap em up cuz its game time 
Toe to toe 
Blow for blow 
Now its game time 
Yea its game time 
Yea its game time 
Its game time 
Its game time 
Its game time 
Lettin em know its game time 
Its game time 
Its game time 
Its game time 
Lettin em know its game time
