No matter how many hearts you have broken 
Whoah No matter how many tears you made fall 
Well I still love you baby 
I'm waiting for your call No matter how many times you have left me 
Whoah and you said you never really cared 
Oh I still love you 
I'm just waiting for your call oh my dear my dear 
The first time you left me 
Whoah I couldn't say I did to make you stay 
Oh But believe me dear 
I'd never talk about about it 
I'd just pray, pray that you'd come back home to me one day Whoah No matter how long I'm longing outside 
No matter how many times I been crying 
Baby I still love you 
And I'm just waiting 
Baby I'm just waiting for your call
