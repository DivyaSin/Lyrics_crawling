A hand to hold 
Is often hard to see 
And I cannot 
Deny You're reaching out to me 
The day is gone 
And still I know You're near 
And I've got nothing to fear [Chorus] 
But when I open my eyes 
You're the first thing I see 
A vision once clouded 
I feel Your presence over me 
From when the sun comes up 
'Til I fall asleep at night 
I know You'll be there 
When I open my eyes Now granted 
I've been here a time or two 
I've learned, I've lived 
And now I've learned again 
I pray that I 
I might become like You 
I've got nothing to lose [Chorus] Your love is like the ocean 
It never stops rolling in 
You are my world 
I can't survive without You 
With You it's all surrender 
In that I find such peace 
Tell me this is no dream, yeah When I open my eyes 
Oh Lord, I feel Your presence over me 
From when the sun comes up 
'Til I fall asleep at night 
I know You'll be there 
I know that You'll be there [Chorus]
