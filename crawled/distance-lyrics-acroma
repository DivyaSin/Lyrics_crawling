And the distance in your eyes paralyzes me 
And the words that stain your lips stain my soul 
And now I can't deny that I must've missed the point 
And I suffocate here in this cage 
This alone 
Save me now, don't let me drown and save me now 
And I feel, I feel like I'm slipping away 
Save me now, ooo the distance is less than what it seems
