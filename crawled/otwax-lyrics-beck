It takes a backwash man to sing a backwash song 
Like a frying pan when the fire's gone 
Driving my pig while the bear's taking pictures in the grass 
In my radio smashed And I like pianos in the evening sun 
Dragging my heals 'til my day is done 
Saturday night in the Captain's clothes 
Tin horns blowing with my jury 'phros Yo soy un disco cabrado 
Yo tengo chicle en cerabo I can't believe my way back when 
My Cadillac pants going much to fast 
Karaoke weekend at the suicide shack 
Community service and I'm still the mack Shocked my finger spicing my hand 
I been spreading disease all across the land 
Beautiful air-conditioned sitting in the kitchen Wishing I was living like a hit man 
Face down in the guarantees 
Jaundiced marshal's getting busy with ease 
Because I get down I get down 
I get down all the way Yo soy un disco cabrado 
Yo tengo chicle en cerabo Sawdust songs of the plaid bartenders 
Western Unions of the country westerns 
Silver foxes looking for romance 
In the chain smoke Kansas flash dance ass pants And you got the hot wax residues 
You never lose in your razor blade shoes 
Stealing pesos out of my brain 
Hazard signs down the Alamo lanes Radar systems using the souls 
You never get caught with the wax so rotten 
All my days I got the grizzly worms 
Hijacked flavors that I'm flipping like birds Yo soy un disco cabrado 
Yo tengo chicle en cerabo Who are you 
I'm the enchanting wizard of rhythm 
Why did you come here? 
I came here to tell you about the rhythms of the universe
