Ice, shock, tremble in my chains 
Waiting for your hands to light me up again! 
Tick, tock, longing for the pain 
Plug me in, turn me on, connect me to the mains! 
(Shock me) Shock, shock, I want it 
(Cut me) Up, up into nine slice 
(Give me) The perfect body 
(Wreck me) Up, up! 
I'll be your dream tonight I feel you're coming down tonight 
There's power in your hands tonight 
There's power in your hands to give me life 
To give me life tonight 
My heart's in my mouth and it's time 
Release me and open my eyes 
I'm ready tonight and I see the life 
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive 
And it feels so good! So good Ice, hot, running through my veins 
You are the doctor playing with my brain 
And the knife cuts sweetly through the pain 
Plug me in, turn me on, connect me to the mains! 
Cut me, operator 
Cut me just right! 
Cut me back together 
Do what you like! 
Oh, please operator, deeper inside 
Operator, I'll be your dream tonight! I feel you're coming down tonight 
There's power in your hands tonight! 
There's power in your hands to give me life 
To give me life tonight 
My heart's in my mouth and it's time 
Release me and open my eyes 
I'm ready tonight and I see the life 
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive 
And it feels so good! So good (tremble in my chains) 
So good (longing for the pain)
