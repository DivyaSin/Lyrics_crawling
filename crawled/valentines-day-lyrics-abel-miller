Yeah hey 
Yeah oh 
Oh woah (Cashtastic:) If you was my girl 
all I gotta say 
is every single day would be valentines day 
I'd give you my love everyday of the year 
I know its not traditional 
but girl I dont care 
and girl I'll share there wont be no secrets 
treat you like a girlfriend should be treated 
there when your strong and when you're feeling the weakest 
your personality compiments your features 
everyone says we look fly together 
I'll take you away we can fly together 
when its time to rise we rise together 
if God's willing you'll be mine forever 
so mandem if you got this song on your playlist 
thinking about that girl you thinks the greatest 
you want her but you dont know how to state it 
just look her deep into her eyes and say this (Abel Miller:) If you was my girl 
Then all I gotta say 
Is every single day would be valentines day 
Every single day would be valentines day 
If you was my girl 
Then all I gotta say

Every single day would be valentines day (Cashtastic:) If you was my girl 
Then all I gotta say 
Is every single day would be valentines day 
I'd give you my lovin' every day of the year 
I know its not traditional but girl I dont care 
Forget everyone cause today is your day 
It's on you we can do things your way 
Your hot girl they close to your flame 
Its hard to find a beautiful girl with your brain 
I hope that your staying 
I hope that your staying 
I hope that your serious 
I hope that you aint playing 
I hope you want cash not that cash that I'm paying 
I hope you dont just want cash for the fame 
And mandem if you got this song on your playlist
