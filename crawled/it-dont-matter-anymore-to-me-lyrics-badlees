I climbed up the mountain, I sailed across the sea 
But it don't matter anymore to me 
I sent my money to the preacher man, I prayed for the lottery 
But it don't matter anymore to me 
Everybody has somewhere else they think they wanna be 
But it don't matter anymore to me 
I visited the gypsy, I visited the shrink 
But it don't matter anymore to me 
I drank bourbon whiskey like it was goin' extinct 
But it don't matter anymore to me 
Everybody has someone else they think they wanna be 
But it don't matter anymore to me 
I jeopardized my friends and my own mental health 
Just tryin' to defend my own opinion of myself 
I gave it all my money, I gave it all my time 
But I don't know why 
Tried to please everybody all of the time 
But it don't matter anymore to me 
You no sooner change yourself then they change their mind 
It don't matter anymore to me 
Everybody knows someone else they think you oughta be 
It don't matter anymore to me
