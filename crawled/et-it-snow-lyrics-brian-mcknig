Let it snow, let it snow 
Hey, it's another Christmas holiday 
It's a joyous thing let the angels sing 
Cause we're together 
We got a thing can't let it slip away 
No, outside its raining sleet 
When our bodies meet 
I don't care about the weather [Chorus:} 
Let it snow, let it snow 
Outside its cold but the fire's blazin' 
So baby let it snow 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Ohhh, come over here and help me trim the tree 
I want to wrap you up baby 
Maybe then you'll see you're the only present I need 
There's so much more 
Waiting for you in store 
From this precious day 
I can gladly say 
There's no place I'd rather be 
I know you are my everything, come a little closer 
God must have sent you down from heaven [Chorus]
