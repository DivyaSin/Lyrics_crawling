Yesterday my life was cold and empty 
All my hope was gone 
And every time I tried a new romance It always turned out wrong 
And then you came along 
To light up my life like a candle so bright 
Yes you came along 
And give me a lifeline, just at the right time I can't help but love no one but you 
And I could search my heaven 
No one in this universe will do Whoa-whoa I was drowning in a sea of pity 
Love had passed me by And then you came along 
You got my attention Divine intervention 
Yes you came along 
As quiet as a church mouse And bright as a lighthouse I cant help but love no one but you 
And I could search my heaven 
No one in this universe will do 
Now were together I can't help but love no one but you Whoa-whoa You've given me a higher love, 
You helped me to understand 
You got me reaching for the stars above 
You give me a reason to live Yeaaaaahhhh! Yesterday my life was cold & empty now I just wanna stop ..and thank you Chorus etc
