I know your tears more than you 'cause I see 'em so much 
That's what happens when you're here with no trust, okay 
I lied, cheated, you cried 
You done worse shit, and I'm still here, right? 
And motherfuck your friends 
All them hoes hatin' 
If you're not down, then what's your location? 
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation 
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation 
Man, you on some other other shit 
Just found out about my other other bitch 
Went from "I love ya" to "Ya don't know who ya fuckin' with" 
Fresh off of vacay and already need another trip 
She said I had enough tries 
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys 
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time? 
If you wanna leave fine Just don't tell me you love me 
You're gonna make it too hard for me 
I wish you were ugly 
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave 
'Cause baby I hate to, love you 
I can't make up my mind 
'Cause right when I tell you it's over 
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu 
You you you you 
I be right back in bed witch you 
You you you you 
So don't tell me you love me Wishin' I would've tried more 
She wanted the truth 
Truthfully I wish I lied more 
'Cause when I was true, 
All I heard was buy more, 
Fuck you, who is that? And I don't know why more 
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart 
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage 
Feelin' like we ended too soon 
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms 
Back shots, I know what you like 
Had you hittin' high notes and you don't even need no autotune 
Nights I was Patron'ed up 
Girls dressed alike lookin' like they cloned up 
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up 
And you was thinkin' "Damn boy, grow up!" 
And I could still hear her leavin' 
Crazy, when a heart breaks it never breaks even 
I even found another girl that's perfect 
And I'm the only reason we're not workin' 
'Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time? 
And if you wanna stay, fine Just don't tell me you love me 
You're gonna make it too hard for me 
I wish you were ugly 
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave 
'Cause baby I hate to, love you 
I can't make up my mind 
'Cause right when I tell you it's over 
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu 
You you you you 
I be right back in bed witch you 
You you you you 
So don't tell me you love me
