At Christmas time in the steeple high 
The bells would proudly ring 
To tell the world of the joy and cheer 
That Christmas day would bring But one little bell in the steeple high 
Could only pain alone and cry 
No matter hard he try and try 
Poor little thing he couldn't ring at all All the other bells in the steeple high 
Saw all his lonely tears 
And watched him tried his best to ring 
Each Christmas through the years But the little blue bell in the steeple tower 
Just cry for Christmas pain to call 
For like I said in spite of all 
Poor little thing he couldn't ring at all One Christmas eve in the steeple high 
An angle did appear 
She smiled and said to the little blue bell 
I've come to dry yours tears And on that night so the story's told 
She changed the little blue bell to the purest gold 
With the richest tone to whole and whole 
Proud little thing, just hear him ring
