Wish that I could say these words tonight 
Wish I have the courage, wish I might 
Have the chance to show you, speak what's on my mind 
While you're right next to me, I've loved you from the start Wish that I could walk you down the road 
Share each moment, have my hand to hold 
My imagination's, beginning to unfold 
Every wish is granted, every dream and hope Chorus: 
Wish I may, wish I might find a way to your heart 
Wish that I'll be the sun to warm you all through your life 
Wish you may feel my love that is hidden in the stars 
Wish I may, wish I might be the one Maybe now I'm ready to be found 
That I'll be a part of who you are 
A promise of forever, never break your heart 
Always there to listen, always by your side
