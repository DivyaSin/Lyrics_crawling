Deep river woman 
Lord I'm comin home to you 
Deep river woman 
Lord I know she's waiting 
Just anticipating all my love Spent a night in LA 
Just another chance to see you 
Just you and I 
Wanted you to know 
That my playin days are over 
Cause all I do is think of you 
The writings on the wall Deep river woman 
Lord I'm comin home to you 
Deep river woman 
Lord I know she's waiting 
Just anticipating all my love I've been out in the world 
I guess the fast life had me going 
Now all tha's changed 
Finally made up my mind 
Bout the one thing I've been knowing 
You're the only girl 
I've ever cared for in this world Deep river woman 
Lord I'm comin home to you 
Deep river woman 
Lord I know she's waiting 
Just anticipating all my love Your kind of love girl is forever 
Took me a long time to realize 
That I've come so far to end up going nowhere 
Girl I need you by my side Deep river woman 
Lord I'm comin home to you 
Deep river woman 
Lord I know she's waiting 
Just anticipating all my love Deep river woman 
Lord I'm comin home to you 
Deep river woman 
Lord I know she's waiting 
Just anticipating all my love
