Yeah Yeah I can feel fabulous 
Oh yeah I'm so fantabulous 
You know I'm so happy 
It's finally happening 
Yeah 
Chorus 
I'm a cute princess 
I'm princesshalicious 
So glamorous 
I eat from diamond dishes 
I'm a fab hot diva 
But I keep it clean 
I'm sassy but happy and in between 
Yeah Yeah I can see ya smiling 
Oh yeah I heard the siren 
Telling me to make my move 
Cause I want you 
(and you want me too) 
Whoa 
Chorus 
I love me 
I'm lovely 
I want to stay pretty for a long 
ti-ee-i-me 
I want to stay beautiful 
I want to stay sexy 
I WANNA BE A PRINCESS FOR ALL 
I WANNA BE A PRINCESS 
FOR ALL OF MY LIIIIIIIFE
