I want to tell you a story every girl oughta know 
If you want a little loving you gotta start real slow 
He's gonna love you tonight if you just treat him right 
Hmm squeeze a real gentle you gotta make him feel good 
Tell him that you love him like you know you should 
Cause if you don't treat him right he won't love you tonight 
Hey hey hey hey [ Fiddle ] 
If you practise my maintenance just as hard as you can 
You gonna get the reputation that you can love your man 
And you'll be glad every night that you treated him right 
Hey hey hey hey [ Guitar ]

He's gonna love you tonight if you just treat him right 
And you'll be glad every night that you treated him right
