As I'm walking through the rain 
Sit beside the room all night long In the grey December morning 
(I decide to leave my home) 
Took a train to nowhere 
Far away 
Far away Many thousand miles away 
When the moon took to the stars 
Dreamed about the days 
Days gone by 
Days gone by In the night, the seawinds are calling 
And the city is far far away 
Soon the sea turns to darkness 
It is night and the seawinds are calling 
Seawinds gone, 
Seawinds gone Took thousand miles away 
When the moon took to the stars 
Dreamed about the days 
Days gone by I've been told so many stories 
Of dreams my plans have made 
So is no illusion 
Sail away 
Sail away In the night, the seawinds are calling 
And the city is far far away 
Soon the sea turns to darkness 
It is night and the seawinds are calling 
Seawinds gone, 
Seawinds gone
