She puts her voicemail in my head 
With every girl I see a bed C'mon be retarded 
Don't want to be bothered 
When she spills out her problems for me 
So here I am 
Say when is when 
Once again 
Three am 
Say when is when 
Not you again Women will win men climbing charts 
I am the joker in your deck of cards C'mon be retarded 
Don't want to be bothered 
When she spills out her problems for me 
So here I am 
Say when is when 
Once again 
Three am 
Say when is when 
Not you again I think your nickname suits your reputation 
They call you miss I call you ho 
She blew my fortune and my fame 
With every target a different name C'mon be retarded 
Don't want to be bothered 
When she spills out her problems for me 
(she spits out her problems, she's plain walkin' trouble) 
So here I am 
Say when is when 
Once again 
Three am 
Say when is when 
Not you again So here I am 
Once again 
Three am 
Say when is when 
Not you again Say when 
Say if 
Say when
