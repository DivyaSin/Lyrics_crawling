When I saw you for the first time 
Eyes the color of the ocean 
Something moved inside of me 
Long forgotten lying broken Now I can't turn away 
Watching you as you lay sleeping 
Can you hear winds of change 
Is this something to believe in I lost direction in the darkness 
Couldn't stop myself from running 
I could feel the sun on my back 
But I was afraid to let the light in Now I can't run anymore 
Now I see this gift you bring me 
Can you hear winds of change 
Maybe this loser's luck is turning
