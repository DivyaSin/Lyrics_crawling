I don't wanna live 
Anywhere 
I wanna live, I wanna live everywhere 
In a rolling big house 
Full of fresh air 
A motor bungalow, 
Round and comfortable 
Like a highway yacht with a shower, 
No stairs 
You can anchor her, 
You can anchor her anywhere 
Sleep a week or so 
And get to know the local jokes 
In a motor bungalow, 
Round and comfortable In the bungalow breakfast nook 
On the bungalow breakfast table 
Violets picked in Vermont 
And shells knicked on a Florida jaunt 
And a menu from Cohens restaurant 
In a motor bungalow 
Motor bungalow One morning 
Roll down the windows 
Let the north wind in 
And fly across the continent 
Up to Canada, 
Whoa, Canada 
To view a true moose, uuhhhmm 
Wet your pants, ha! 
In a cold stream 
Eat home-made ice cream 
And live 
In a motor bungalow
