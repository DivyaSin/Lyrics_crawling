Arguing with you's no good 
Well you'll be nobody's fool but you almost 
Speak 
Don't talk about it 
Don't talk about the 32nd of December 
That's the night I'm trying so hard to forget 
All you do is you come round and then, well I remember 
Remember what I try, that I, what I.... Speak 
Don't talk about it

And don't talk about it Don't you talk about the 32nd of December 
That's the night im trying so hard to forget 
All you do is you phone, then I, I remember 
Remember what I try 
That I, what I... Speak

So don't you say goodbye

But they never do 
So I'll never do
