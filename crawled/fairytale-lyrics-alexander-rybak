Years ago 
When I was younger 
I kinda liked 
A girl I knew 
She was mine and we were sweethearts 
That was then but then it's true I'm in love with a fairytale 
Even though it hurts 
Cause I don't care if 
I lose my mind 
I'm already cursed Every day 
We started fighting 
Every night 
We fell in love 
No one else 
Could make me sadder 
But no one else 
Could lift me high above 
I don't know what I was doin' 
But suddenly we fell apart Nowadays 
I cannot find her 
But when I do 
We'll get a brand new start I'm in love with a fairytale 
Even though it hurts 
Cause I don't care if 
I lose my mind 
I'm already cursed She's a fairytale 
Yeaaah 
Even though it hurts 
Cause I don't care 
If I lose my mind 
I'm already cursed
