Hook 
Niggas know we do robberies, we ain't running up in no crib for 2 g's 
We want about 50 thou and 4 ki's 
And maybe after that we just might breath 
But if you think it can't happen, nigga please 
We put you on your knees, like you was praying 
We ain't playing 
It's the o-ffi-cial, o-rig-inal, season-al, motherfucking crimi-nals You know the format, ringing your bell, standing on your doormat 
'who is it? " thats your sentence 
Looking through the peephole with your eyes squinching 
Too late, we kicked the door off the hinges 
I heard you selling stacks of crack getting mad-tracked 
Thats why we in your place, throwing your face in the carpet 
With the rug rats, where the drugs at, fuck that! 
I represent broke niggas who ain't no joke nigga 
Bullets rolled in bamboo cause we here to smoke niggas 
And fuck them uppercuts, like we here to fight you up 
Man, we hang you from a chandalier and light you up 
We like free delivery cause we take niggas out 
Leaving you cracking like daffy with duct tape on your mouth 
And roping you with strings and tessles squeezing your blood vessel 
Leaving your ass tied up like pretzels 
Ak to the inye to the le, rolling with real g's 
Doing these official robberies yes! Hook I'm on some mike tyson ex-wife shit kid 
Thats how I'm living 
Cause when I start robbing, you'd better start giving 
How else you think the money's supposed to come thats why 
When I need bread I grab the toaster and stick niggas for they crumbs 
I extort as you get stuck for bucks 
Whether it's in airplanes or airports cause I don't give a flying fuck 
I drop it like an incinerator was the topic 
Cause I'll be damned if you ain't 
I'll empty in your pockets 
Shake you like gelatin, and for all you good semaritans playing hero 
Akinyele put one in your belly 
And leave your stomachs looking like the number 0 
As a rob like work cause I need mad dinero 
Cream, like vaseline put you in intensive care 
With the tech 9 backing you up like spines 
Taking your materialistic things like rings 
Like your hoe, your doe, gold and diamonds 
I turned this art into art-tillery 
With guns that bark to keep them from killing me 
On point, like a sword cause I always stay on board 
Ready to clap a stinking victim like a fucking applause 
Anywhere, anyplace 
Even if you got condoms in your wallet 
That don't mean your money's safe 
So act like you not having it when I start grabbing it 
Guns in your face (gibberish) like you talk arabic 
Holding a mac that I pimp like a mack 
But some of you macks, never find a mac 
Ever since you lost that job at mcdonalds 
But I know that I'll mork your ass like nanu-nanu 
By putting one shell in your head like a rhino 
Or I'll do to 2 to your head 
Before I damn wanted to let you know that you ain't who's hot 
And you niggas not making it home in the fucking morning 
Because..............
