I always live by the, golden rule 
Whatever happens, ha, don't blow your cool! 
You gotta have nerves of steel 
And never show folks how you, honestly feel I lived all my life this way, hah 
For example, take yesterday I breeze home happy bringin' her my pay 
Her note read, so long savvy, I haven't gone away! 
An' I threw myself down across our empty bed 
An' this is what I said Oh shit Oh Oh Oh 
What? Oh what are you gonna do with me? 
Oh wow uh 
But I was cool! So I "one for the roaded" at a all night bar 
I wound up so loaded, I tore up my car 
The judge threw the book at me, 
An' when I read, the sentence there, I said Ow! Please ow ow, please I got to know, I got to know 
What? what went wrong? 
I don't underst' I oh a, 
But I was cool! So I said she's the only one, that I have to pay 
And I found her an' pulled my gun, an' fired point blank 
The shot whistled right past that woman's head 
An' I killed my hound dog, dead! Ow, ruff ruff, r' r' r' r' r' r' 
As they carried me away 
I was overheard to say, 
"Be cool, be cool, stay cool, be cool!"
