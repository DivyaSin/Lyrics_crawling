I stopped by the house we called our home 
It was a little rundown, the grass was overgrown 
Its screen door was opening with the wind 
I thought I heard you called my name again. I wish that I could hold on to the past 
'cause everything is changing way too fast 
I can't help it long for how it used to be 
When you were here and you were loving me. I finally got that near to go inside 
I made it to our bedroom door to cry 
I always thought that we could come back home 
These empty rooms just prove that I was wrong
