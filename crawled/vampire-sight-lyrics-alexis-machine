(verse1) 
When you first open your eyes 
don't be afraid I'm here to guide 
in a world of vampire light 
with me you'll live eternal night 
I seek you out through the light of night 
searching for my darkness bride 
when I see that beauty's eyes 
no longer alone will I hide 
(chorus) 
Let the sunlight cease to shine 
in this vampire sight 
sunrise beauty once was mine 
now I'm seeing only night 
in this vampire sight 
(verse2) 
I take you in my arms so white 
your flesh burns mine with it's blood heat 
razor kiss suck out past life 
give you death life with my heart beat 
I know you love the dark night life 
I see it shining in your eyes 
if you would come and be my bride 
night will be yours all the time (chorus) 
(solo)
