All the lions The ocean beckons with its gaze 
Pulling me beneath the waves 
The fury I search is now gone All the lions It's calling at my burning skin 
Till I wash away the sin 
It's washed away 
Am I the first to be fooled by 
Your dirty little trick? 
I guess I should have seen this coming 
I will not forget, I will not forget 
It's washed away I'm the one who has to swallow water 
That's what I get for chasing after (you) 
You should be hanging by your neck 
Hanging there silently I can't stop the bleeding 
Tell me that you want me (if you need me) 
Tell me that you love me (if you want me) 
Your dying eyes tell a story of poisonous passion 
Tell me that you want me (do you want me?) 
Tell me do you want me (do you love me?) It is quite clear you despise me 
By showing your face here 
And you never even told me 
Why you disappeared 
Why you disappeared 
It's washed away I'm the one who has to swallow water 
That's what I get for chasing after (you) 
You should be hanging by your neck 
Hanging there silently I can't stop the bleeding 
Tell me that you want me (if you need me) 
Tell me that you love me (if you want me) 
Your dying eyes tell a story of poisonous passion 
Tell me that you want me (do you want me?) 
Tell me do you want me (do you love me?) Why won't you be quiet now? 
Why won't you be quiet now? 
Why won't you be quiet now? 
Why won't you be quiet now? 
Why won't you be quiet now? 
It's time to see what's left of me I can't stop the bleeding 
Tell me that you want me (if you need me) 
Tell me that you love me (if you want me) 
Your dying eyes tell a story of poisonous passion 
Tell me that you want me (do you want me?) 
Tell me do you want me (do you love me?) You will be sorry when 
He spills the blood from your throat 
You'll be torn limb from limb 
Tramp! You'll be torn limb from limb (limb from limb)
