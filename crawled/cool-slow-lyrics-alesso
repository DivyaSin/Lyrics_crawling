I saw stars on the pavement 
California dreams 
Looked up through the bright lights 
No stars did I see You said it's all yours if you take it there 
I said I can't do it alone I swear 
You said it's all yours 
It's all yours and you smiled It's only you (Who) 
Loves me like you do (Do) 
Tryna keep it cool (Cool) 
But I can't keep cool about it,about it Acting like a fool (Fool) 
Wanna scream it from the roof (Roof) 
I'm tryna keep it cool (Cool) 
But I can't keep cool about it,about it And for your love I was blind 
Drifting at sea 
You were the beacon I followed home 
You were the one who rescued me You said it's all yours if you take it there 
I said I can't do it alone I swear 
You said it's all yours 
It's all yours and you smiled It's only you (Who) 
Loves me like you do (Do) 
Tryna keep it cool (Cool) 
But I can't keep cool about it Acting like a fool (Fool) 
Wanna scream it from the roof (Roof) 
I'm tryna keep it cool (Cool) 
But I can't keep cool about it,about it You said 
(Oooh-wooah) 
I don't wanna lose your love 
(Oh-woaah) It's only you (Who) 
Loves me like you do (Do) 
Tryna keep it cool (Cool) 
But I can't keep cool about it,about it Acting like a fool (Fool) 
Wanna scream it from the roof (Roof) 
I'm tryna keep it cool (Cool) 
But I can't keep cool about it,about it
