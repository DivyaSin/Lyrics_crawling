Past the point of no return 
No backward glances 
Our games of make-believe are at an end. Past all thought of if or when 
No use resisting 
Abandon thought and let the dream descend What raging FIRE shall flood the soul 
What rich desire unlocks it's door 
What sweet seduction lies before us? Past the point of no return 
The final threshold 
What warm unspoken secrets 
Will we learn 
Beyond the point of no return? CHRISTINE: You have brought me 
To that moment when words run dry 
To that moment when speech disappears 
Into silence 
Silence. I have come here, 
Hardly knowing the reason why 
In my mind I've already imagined 
Our bodies entwining 
Defenseless and silent, 
Now I am here with you 
No second thoughts 
I've decided 
Decided. Past the point of no return 
No going back now 
Our passion-play has now at last begun. Past all thought of right or wrong 
One final question 
How long should we two wait before we're one? When will the blood begin to race 
The sleeping bud burst into bloom 
When will the flames at last CONSUME us? BOTH: Past the point of no return 
The final threshold 
The bridge is crossed 
So stand and watch it burn 
We've passed the point of no return. PHANTOM:(soft and sort of saddened) Say you'll share with me 
One love, one lifetime 
Lead me, save me from my solitude Say you want me 
With you here 
Beside you 
Anywhere you go 
Let me go too 
Christine that's all I ask of 
(Christine tears the mask, showing his face to the audience) PHANTOM:(looks at her sadly, then pushes one lever that causes the chandaleir to fall and the other lever with foot and they fall through a trap door!)
