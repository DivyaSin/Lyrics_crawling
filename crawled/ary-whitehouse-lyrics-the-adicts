She don't like pornography 
When it's on the BBC 
She won't even look at me 
Oh no no no she don't love me 
I love Mary Whitehouse 
She don't love me 
I love Mary Whitehouse 
She don't love me 
I know she ain't that wonderful 
She's only trying to be helpful 
When she sees all those nudes 
She'll speak out and say 
That's very rude 
Mary Mary they think you're crazy 
How does your mind work 
With silver bells 
And ..... shells 
You're digging up the dirt
