(Les Holroyd) 
See the river deep and wide 
Could be free 
On the other side 
Oh, cross the water 
When the gun and knife 
Have gone 
Who'll be here 
When tomorrow comes 
Oh, living in fear 
Sunrise, sunset, sunrise over 
The rainbow they fly 
Shadows o 
N the sky 
Hear the sound that fills 
The skies 
Killer man with dollar eyes 
Oh, bring disaster 
You can stand, you can run 
When you hear, the sound 
Of the gun 
Moving closer 
Sunrise, sunset, sunrise 
Over the rainbow they fly 
Shadows on the sky 
An 
D as far as 
The eye can see 
Black as night 
Is the cloud you're under 
There's a chance 
That it cannot be 
Hear the cries like the 
Rolling thunder 
Sunrise, sunset, sunrise 
Over the rainbow they fly
