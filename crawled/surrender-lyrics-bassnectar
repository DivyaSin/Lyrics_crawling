From the moment you dream 
It's not always as it seems 
If you still believe 
It's all you need 
When you give you feel more alive 
When you love you step into the light 
Standing on the edge you are part of me 
And you leave the past behind. Let it all rewind, 
Let it out. 
Let it all rewind, 
Moving on. 
Let it hurt, hurt. 
Let it all rewind, 
Moving on. In the end 
Time is like a night. 
In the mind 
Time is like a knife. 
Sending them off the drop 
Like an echo 
Orbiting like a satellite Let it all rewind, 
Let it out. 
Let it all rewind, 
Moving on. 
Let it hurt, hurt. 
Let it all rewind, 
Moving on.
