Secret dreams rising up in the dead of night 
All alone; its a weakness that's hard to break 
Another summer fades away like the evening light 
Another year, as your confidence starts to shake Do you someone who will hold you close? 
Do you need a friend who won't leave you all by yourself? 
Do you need someone you can call your own? 
All alone, all alone The peaceful moon reflects in tears of your solitude 
Look around, but there's no one to share the blame 
Unwilling loner in an unfeeling multitude 
Play the fads, but the face in the mirror won't change So now you find yourself in places you shouldn't be 
In the dark, where the music can hide your sorrow 
Sometimes you come so close to finding the love you need 
But one more drink, and you're back on that road tomorrow
