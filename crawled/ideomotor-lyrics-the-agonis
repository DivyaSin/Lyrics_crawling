we are but prisoners 
of waterfalls 
we stand on broken ribs. 
Faces to the glass, 
we drown. 
Heavy mileage on our minds, 
we wrap the earth in cerebral folds. 
And the corpse we carry really 
is a weight we'd like to throw. 
We love the strange new animals, 
we love the fearful plants 
but we all surrender 
turpentine to rid us of our pasts. 
You would walk the rotten hillside, 
you would taste the clouds bellow. 
But the world you walk 
is running water through 
valleys in palms of hands. 
We all know we will be 
respected by greed and death 
and loathed by clarity 
Jettisoned 
emotions flood the banks 
the valleys overflow. 
If only 
memory served us better, 
we could swim to dry our souls. 
We're suicidal swans. 
We're silence, 
in throats we creep. 
You'll know us by 
the shaking ground 
when ideas emerge from the deep. 
Dolphins have more dignity. 
A sleepwalking helicopter, 
gracefully deceased. 
Beauty makes the blind weep. 
To describe a song in color 
is a portrait's symphony 
The light drips on closed eyelids 
through holes in weathered sheets. 
Curiosity stands up where 
strange faces hide and seek, 
swarming the webs of electricity 
that dragnet the city; 
confusing power with duty 
in a place with trees like origami. 
Monstrous theories dance with nightmares 
on the horizon absolute equinox. 
Listening to history in the present, 
planets approach with lupine walks. 
We're suicidal swan. 
We're silence, 
in throats we creep. 
You'll know us by 
the shaking ground 
when ideas emerge from the deep. 
We're suicidal swan. We're silence, 
in throats we creep. 
You'll know us by 
the shaking ground 
when ideas emerge from the deep. 
Offering flowers to the dirt 
like paralyzed dancers we decline 
and smile and flee. 
But, with years of past devotion, 
the crushing atmosphere 
is bitter-sweet. 
Haaaa....... 
(SOLO) 
In my waterfall, 
here, 
in hearth, i'll slowly disappear. 
(SOLO)
