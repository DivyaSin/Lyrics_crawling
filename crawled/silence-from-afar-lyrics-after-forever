When the fate leaves you behind 
And drags me off to an unknown destination 
Shall my tears shape a sea 
On which your boat has to reach the area When the storm is most violent 
And the horizon seems to be far away 
You will find strength to go on 
And conquer the misery that wants to 
Bring you down, down, down, down When silence from afar is close at hand 
Our harmony becomes as elusive as time Viribus exhaustus sentio meum finem 
Meam amicam viduam relinquens 
Viribus exhaustus sentio meum finem 
Meam amicam viduam relinquens Oh, oh, oh Viribus exhaustus sentio meum finem 
Meam amicam viduam relinquens When silence from afar is close at hand 
Our harmony becomes as elusive as time
