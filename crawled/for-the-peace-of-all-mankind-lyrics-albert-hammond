It Never Rains in Southern California 
For The Peace Of All Mankind 
You turned me on so bad that there was only one thing on my mind 
An overnight affair was needed at the time 
Hello, goodbye, no searching questions, that was clearly understood 
But how was I to know that you would be so good? For the peace, for the peace, for the peace of all mankind 
Will you go away, will you go away, will you vanish from my mind 
Will you go away and close the bedroom door 
And let everything be as it was before Too much too soon, too bad it didn't hit me till a week had passed 
I might have saved the day if I had acted fast 
I looked around in case you'd scribbled down the number secretly 
But all you left were fingerprints and memories For the peace, for the peace, for the peace of all mankind 
Will you go away, will you go away, will you vanish from my mind 
Will you go away and close the bedroom door 
And let everything be as it was before For the peace, for the peace, for the peace of all mankind 
Will you go away, will you go away, will you vanish from my mind 
Will you go away and close the bedroom door 
And let everything be as it was before Da-di-da, da-da-di, da-da-di-di-di-di-di 
Will you go away, will you go away, will you vanish from my mind 
Will you go away and close the bedroom door...
