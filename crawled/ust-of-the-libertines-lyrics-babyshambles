The Lust of the Libertines 
Is really quite tame 
It rages quietly nigh here beside you 
And your lust for fame 
But fame is such a sinister game, I know... 
It could all end this way then 
Some things won't be the same 
Oh just a face, and a name on a page 
But I'll be soundly sleeping 
I'll be soundly sleeping 
I'll sleep right through that age Cause I can deal with all... 
The blood on my shoes 
The holes in my soul 
My spirit is tainted 
All my tears are painted Am just so long as you... 
You don't forget to... oh uh ow 
Cut me on the wall 
By the graffiti of all the things 
I just couldn't say Shove me up the wall 
Oh my darling (oh Poor Cow) 
It was a kind of loving 
But you've left me in the family way again The dust on my tambourine 
Really can be explained 
I need to shake it more often 
I need to shake away the blame Oh well, fame is such a sinister game, I know... 
The taste of goulash in your mouth 
As you stumble offstage... 
Forget-me-nots bloom on this day then 
But they whither with age Oh I can deal with all... 
The blood on my shoes 
The holes in my soul 
My spirit is tainted 
All my tears are painted Am just so long as you... 
You don't forget to... oh uh ow 
Cut me on the wall 
By the graffiti of all the things 
I just couldn't say Oh won't you hove me up the wall 
Oh Poor Cow 
It was a kind of loving 
But you've left me in the family way again
