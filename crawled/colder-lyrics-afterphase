It's time to get this thing sorted out right now. 
The mess is bigger than you really know. 
It's only time to think a little clearer. 
Before you let it all, up and go. It may feel a little colder, but I know it's over. 
Do not need a stronger shoulder, cos I learn, I'm older. 
Got to see a little further, the good times are coming back to me. My mind is numb and sore from all this thinking. 
An echo rings inside my aching bones. 
If only I could free the intense pressure. 
Then I could see exactly where to go. It may feel a little colder, but I know it's over. 
Do not need a stronger shoulder, cos I learn, I'm older. 
Got to see a little further, the good times are coming back to me. Intensity has grown and made it harder. 
Sometimes I'd like to see a helping hand. 
To take away the pain, and make it easy. 
But this will not arrive, because it can't. It may feel a little colder, but I know it's over. 
Do not need a stronger shoulder, cos I learn, I'm older.
