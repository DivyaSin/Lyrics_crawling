Bessie was more than just a friend of mine 
We shared the good times with the bad 
Now many a year has passed me by 
I still recall the best thing I ever had I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie 
Oh, see her soon 
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith 
When I get there I wonder what she'll do All the crazy things I had to try 
Well I tried them all and then some 
But if you're lucky one day you find out 
Where it is you're really comin' from I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie 
Oh, see her soon 
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith 
When I get there I wonder what she'll do Now in my day I've made some foolish moves 
But back then, I didn't worry 'bout a thing 
And now again I still wonder to myself 
Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie 
Oh, see her soon 
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith 
When I get there I wonder what she'll do
