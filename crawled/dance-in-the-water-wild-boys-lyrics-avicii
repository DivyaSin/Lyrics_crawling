So bold and fine 
I've known you for some time 
Whole life changed while 
Bones like yours and mine 
Go dance in the woods and 
Down we go, down, down 
Oh boy, you're mine 
Do you remember old times? [Chorus x2] 
Go deep boy, I wanna follow you 
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too 
Go deep boy, I don't wanna be with you 
There's a time for everything and not for you 
Go deep boy, I wanna follow you 
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too 
Go deep boy, I don't wanna be with you 
It's our time for everything and I call you [Verse 2] 
Bold love O' mine, distraction ain't a crime 
For those who find love as a game like you and I 
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we cry 
Oh boy, you're fine, do you remember old times? [Chorus x2] 
Go deep boy, I wanna follow you 
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too 
Go deep boy, I don't wanna be with you 
There's a time for everything and not for you 
Go deep boy, I wanna follow you 
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too 
Go deep boy, I don't wanna be with you 
It's our time for everything and I call you
