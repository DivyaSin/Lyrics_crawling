That night I still remember 
It was warm in the middle of summer 
Your voice like a lullaby, so low, so sweet 
Thought you had me but I'd never been so free Now you're scared but you don't know why 
You keep running but there's nowhere to hide You never thought I'd ever be 
Something you want, something you need 
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat 
Now you just can't get over me We'll spend the night watching movies in the dark 
You're playing bands I've never heard of 
And I know you tend to always overthink 
But tonight it's as simple as just kiss me Now you're scared but you don't know why 
You keep running but there's nowhere to hide 
Scared to care because then you lose 
Try and hide how you feel but I feel it, too You never thought I'd ever be 
Something you want, something you need 
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat 
Now you just can't get over me Take all of your doubts and throw them away 
We're falling tonight tell me that you'll stay 
You'll stay You never thought I'd ever be 
Something you want, something you need 
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat 
Now you just can't get over me You never thought I'd ever be 
Something you want, something you need 
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat 
Now you just can't get over me
