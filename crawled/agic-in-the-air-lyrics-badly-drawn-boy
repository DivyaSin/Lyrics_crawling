We laughed so much, then we cried 
All night 
And you left your shoes, in the tree 
With me 
I'll wear them to your house, tonight 
Tonight 
Magic in the air, tonight Yes I just might try her 
How she made me feel 
Today, today, today 
Feels right We slept on leaves, on my drive 
All night 
And you, gave me, no rest time 
Nothing in this life, for me 
Tonight 
But nothing ever seemed, so bright And if you should lose me 
You will track me down, again 
Before the summer ends
