We slept for close to seven hours all the way to your dad's basket case. 
I didn't catch the final score so I prayed that we'd sink a few more. 
And I didn't mind and you didn't seem to mind about me, but I was wrong. 
Who wouldn't fear to leave it all cause it's gonna come, it's gotta come. 
I am the widow, the spidered king. There's web in your teeth, And there's holes in the ceiling. And I wanted more, I left with nothing. 
Who's really lost and who's really winning? I begged again, you said hello. 
For now that's all I know. Now I remember the exhaust and remains. 
A shallow shadow hung across my brand new drapes. 
And I gave my car away, down towards the post office. Man told me he needed it more. I believed him, went home and slept more. 
And that's what gets me sometimes, that's what struck me blind, 
And that's why there's no time. That's why I still try, and that's why... 
I begged you everything, I begged you everything. 
Begged you everything, everything. 
Fuck am I supposed to do when you just lie your arms in mine? 
Fuck am I supposed to do when you never lie about tellin a lie? 
So what was I supposed to do? Just keep on trying through sleepless nights? 
Fuck am I supposed to choose? Cause I begged you everything, everything. 
I can remember wishing that the season had lasted a little longer. 
It don't, and we die. If not me, then to my pride. If not now, then tonight. 
If not then, we just might give up trying.
