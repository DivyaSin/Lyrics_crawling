Come see what we all talk about 
People moving to the moon 
Stop baby don't go stop here 
Never stop living here 
Till it eats the heart from your soul 
Keeps down the sound of your 
Silent sigh 
Silent sigh, silent sigh silent sigh 
Keeps down all move me down 
Could we love each other Come see what we all talk about 
People moving to the moon 
Stop baby don't go stop here 
Never stop living here 
Till it eats the heart from your soul 
Keeps down the sound of your 
Silent sigh 
Silent sigh, silent sigh silent sigh 
Keeps down all move me down 
But don't love each other 
No don't love each other 
Never gonna be the same
