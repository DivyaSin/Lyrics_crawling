One, two, three, four You told me 32 ways to make you smile 
I did 31 within the first hour 
You stood amazed in your delighted shoes 
Bewildered but willing, didn't know what to do 
So I grabbed your cold hand 
Pressed it to my beating heart and said Isn't it neat how our bodies tick 
And we can move our feet 
Whenever and however we please? 
You stared blindly while I waited politely 
In the doorway by our school Some cars passed and I noticed 
Someone was singing 'Us' by Regina Spektor 
You know how I had a crush on her 
I know you don't like gray skies 
We know our multiplication tables You got straight A's while I was writing fairy tales 
And looking out window sills asking why 
The sun shine liked my eyes and kissed my cheek 
When it knew I was in love with the moon 
And of course with you Well, I sped it up 'cause you don't like slow songs 
You're more of the literal kind 
You're like ocean's waves 
You get closer at the end of the day When you know I can't see your face 
When you're sure I'm already lost 
Love is oh so lovely 
But it also comes with a cost 
Yeah, it also comes with a cost
