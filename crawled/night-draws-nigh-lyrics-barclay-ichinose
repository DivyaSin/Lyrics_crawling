Am I sitting? Or am I flying? 
Balloons are so near, but I'm not dreaming 
I haven't personal boundaries I'm running to the moon 
Set my heart on fire, but I feel no pain 
I'm chasing after myself Dizziness is eating me 
I'm Tripping Over My Own Feet 
Why I'm not smiling Am I quenching my happiness? 
But I really don't know 
Why the night draws nigh I'm falling 
Into the oblivion 
But you can't understand 
I'm sinking 
To bottom of the ocean 
But you can't understand I'm crying, maybe it is over 
I really don't know 
Why I'm feeling this grief I'm falling 
Into the oblivion 
But you can't understand 
I'm sinking 
To bottom of the ocean 
But you can't understand
