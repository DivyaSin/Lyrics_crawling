Find an action, take an action 
Faced with life 
Make it easy, make it easier 
Say what you want 
'cause I'll do anything you say for you 
Simple minded parasite 
Put a gun in my hand 
Oh, I'm not alright . . . Satisfaction is making billions 
Faced with life 
A narrow mind makes many world wide problems - will you drive? 
My headache is much more aware of you than I am Simple minded parasite 
Put a gun in my hand 
Oh, I'm not alright . . . 
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah-Ah, Ah . . . And someday you will ask yourself who you are 
Ask yourself who you are 
Ask yourself who you are 
Ask yourself! who you are 
Ask yourself who you are
