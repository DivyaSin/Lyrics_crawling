I`m warm when I`m cold 
I`m cold when I`m warm 
And nothing seems to be alright 
I`m down on my knees 
And I`m easy to please 
When I think `bout what I did last night When you told me to share 
And ran my fingers through my hair 
Infinity? Yes I do! 
But when I cry in your arms 
Or dress up in my charm 
I`m not the one sayin', "I love you" Yeah life is a bomb 
And it hits so hard 
It will bring out the tears from my eyes 
Yeah love is a drag 
Yes it can be that bad 
When at the end of the rope is your dad I`m not the one who loved you 
I`m the one who left you behind 
Fed-ex my life 
Ex-file and access denied You out me up on a stand 
And read the palm of my hand 
What makes you think you know what I've been through? 
All the phonies and the gold 
Are you scared of gettin' old? 
Welcome to planet fuckin' "deja-vu" I`m the one
