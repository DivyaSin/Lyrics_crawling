Don't want to give, Don't want to steal 
Don't want to be anything I'm not 
You take answers I give questions, like some rolling, monologue 
Want to be the one to say, that today could be the day 
A pity to believe in what you know is what you know I will, take you as you are 
Please accept me as I am 
Find your lonely life bizarre 
Know it's above you, I know it's below me Always someone Don't want to live, life in your shoes 
Don't feel I know the way 
Feeling you, giving me, directions I don't need 
Up and up, and round we go 
First it's fast and then we're slow 
Could you connect with my intellect? I won't take you as you are 
Please don't take me as I am 
Find your lonely life bizarre 
You'll see this in love, you'll see this in li-ife Hold an all-year-round reception 
For a love with no connection 
Knowing you, knowing my, ignorance to more than life 
Know it's above you, I know it's below me I will, take you as you are 
Please accept me as I am 
Find your lonely life bizarre 
Know it's above you, I know it's below me I will, take you as you are 
Please accept me as I am 
There'll be something in the wind 
To show us we're right, and tell us we're wrong I want to wake up
