Brother rejoice, a new day is dawning 
Oh, your worldly sorrow will soon fade away 
Be ready, dear friend, for that great celebration 
Meet me in heaven someday Will you meet me in heaven someday 
Join me in that beautiful place 
Just follow your heart (just follow your heart) 
And the voice of God calling (while the angels are singing) 
And meet me in heaven someday You don't know the time, you won't know the hour 
'Til the angel of death stares you right in the face 
So ready your soul, make your preparation 
To meet me in heaven someday Will you meet me in heaven someday 
Join me in that beautiful place 
Just follow your heart (just follow your heart) 
And the voice of God calling (while the angels are singing) And meet me in heaven someday Will you meet me in heaven someday 
Join me in that beautiful place 
Just follow your heart (just follow your heart) 
While the angels are singing (and the voice of God calling) 
And meet me in heaven someday
