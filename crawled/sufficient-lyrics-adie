Hear my heart, Lord, as I cry out to You 
Hear my prayer, Lord and carry me through 
In Your mercy in the promise You made 
Be my strength, Lord, when my strength fades away 'Cause when I am weak 
Your strength is complete, it's perfect 
Completely all I need, sufficient for me

Through the seasons of laughter or pain

Completely all I need, You're all that I need I'll find You when I seek, I'll look for You with all of my heart 
And I'll find You when I'm weak 'cause You are strong Hear my heart, Lord, as I cry out to You 
Hear my prayer, Lord and carry me through 
Carry me through 'Cause when I am weak
