I'm in love, I'm in love 
There's a feeling of gladness 
Mingled with sadness 
All this state of mind ... 
Lover please be kind 
To my heart I'm in love, so in love 
With the whispering breeze 
Birds in the trees 
Children out at play 
And the break of day 
Made this feeling stay 
Within my soul I'm in love, yes in love 
With strangers agreed (?) 
While out on the street 
Each face I see 
Looks good to me 
How heavenly, I'm in love 
With life you see You see 
I'm in love
