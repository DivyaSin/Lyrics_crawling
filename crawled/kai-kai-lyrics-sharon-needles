Verse 1: 
I'm just a boy boy 
Who dresses like a girl girl 
Who's looking for a toy 
In this boy driven world 
Just because I wear paint 
Doesn't mean I'm not a man 
It takes a real big 
To do what we clucking can Pre-Chorus: 
There goes the pantyhose 
Let's make a stink 
Let's make the room stink 
Bottoms up boots down 
We're born in blue but live for the pink 
We're making the coin we don't care what you think Chorus: 
Let's have a kai kai 
Serving fish tonight night 
Why would you ask me why why 
Mary it's just a kai kai 
Let's have a kai kai 
Just give it a try try 
Do it before you die die 
Hunty it's just a kai kai Verse 2: 
We're looking dusted 
Your attitude is busted 
I'm not tryin' to throw shade 
Wanna guess what we're paid? 
No T, 5 G's 
Why yins be judging me? 
G.U.N.T. 
We're hotter after every drink Prechorus: 
There goes the pantyhose 
Let's make a stink 
Let's make the room stink 
Bottoms up boots down 
We're born in blue but live for the pink 
We're making the coin we don't care what you think Chorus: 
Let's have a kai kai 
Serving fish tonight night 
Why would you ask me why why 
Mary it's just a kai kai 
Let's have a kai kai 
Just give it a try try 
Do it before you die die 
Hunty it's just a kai kai Let's have a kai kai 
Serving fish tonight night 
Why would you ask me why why 
Mary it's just a kai kai 
Let's have a kai kai 
Just give it a try try 
Do it before you die die 
Hunty it's just a kai kai Bridge: 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Oh, let me rephrase that, 
Ladies and ladies 
You're looking amazing tonight. 
Welcome to the fish fry. 
Let's stink up the place, shall we? Not your average girl girl 
In this tranny world world 
If I were born a boy boy 
I'd still dress like a girl girl 
Pretty pretty boy boys 
Tilting on the twirl twirl 
Let's break out all our toy toys 
And take over the world world Over powdered, over plucked 
Pantyhose don't need a tuck 
High heels, higher hair 
Legendary children stare 
Round hips, glossy lips 
Electric blue acrylic tips 
Bottoms up, boots down 
Say what you want she won the crown Chorus: 
Let's have a kai kai 
Serving fish tonight night 
Why would you ask me why why 
Mary it's just a kai kai 
Let's have a kai kai 
Just give it a try try 
Do it before you die die 
Hunty it's just a kai kai Let's have a kai kai 
Serving fish tonight night 
Why would you ask me why why 
Mary it's just a kai kai 
Let's have a kai kai 
Just give it a try try 
Do it before you die die 
Hunty it's just a kai kai
