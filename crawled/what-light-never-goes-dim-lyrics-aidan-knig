I'm not in love with the sound of my voice 
I have been in love only one time 
I see red shows, she is quiet the band is loud 
Sharing beer from the can at the back of the crowd 
Anyway, I've only been in love the one time Sometimes we dance, you have convinced me to dance 
This is a testament of your power to convince 
I am convinced and continue to be convinced 
Like I said, I've only been in love the one time What light never goes dim 
What light never goes dim 
What light never goes dim 
What light never goes dim What light never goes dim 
What light never goes dim
