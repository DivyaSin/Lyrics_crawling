WRITTEN BY KEVIN BACON Yeah I used to smoke like a house on fire 
I couldn't put them down 
And I would drink all night till the morning light 
They'd find me on the ground 
You name it I abused it 
Without shame I used it 
There is just one thing that I can't let go 
When it comes to you I just can't say no CHORUS 
Strung Out on you baby 
And I can't clean up my act 
You're like a heavenly addiction 
You're like an angel on my back 
It's a physical dependence girl 
There's nothing I can do 
I just can't get enough of your sweet sweet love 
And I'm still Strung Out on you The first time that I saw you girl 
My hands began to shake 
I was hypnotized paralyzed watching every move you make 
Every second every minute 
I was falling deeper in it 
How was I to know that that one sweet kiss 
Would lead to harder stuff like this
