There's only one thing in this world you can count on 
There's only one thing you can lay your money down on 
You can bet your life your farm your home on the range 
If you've got a woman, a woman's got a mind to change 
I said a woman's got a mind, a woman's got a mind to change 
I said oh baby oh baby oh baby, 
Let's get us some Chinese food 
But she said no no no no no no 
Not in the mood 
We headed down to Pedro's Taqueria 
We ordered up a couple of those old salty Margaritas 
You know that menu it didn't whet her appetite 
She said I got a good idea 
Let's get Chinese food tonight 
There's only one thing in this world you can count on 
There's only one thing you can lay your money down on 
You can bet your life your farm your home on the range 
If you've got a woman, a woman's got a mind to change 
Oh, and I said my woman's got a mind to change 
We had our fling, we had our thing 
And she went back to mister Raines 
Cried some tears, drank some beers 
I got in bed and I turned out the lights 
Oh then I heard these keys inside my door 
Familiar footsteps just kind of move across my floor 
Said aw baby I thought you said we were through 
She said what can I say I changed my mind 
I'd rather be with you 
There's only one thing in this world you can count on 
There's only one thing you can lay your money down on 
You can bet your life your farm your home on the range 
If you've got a woman, a woman's got a mind to change 
There's only one thing in this world you can count on 
There's only one thing you can lay your money down on 
You can bet your life your farm your home on the range 
If you've got a woman, a woman's got a mind to change
