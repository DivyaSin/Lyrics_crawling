Where can it be 
Is it you 
It had to be someone 
In my life through these days 
There's got to be a better way 
Seen my love lose her grip 
She can't take it 
Get high 
Get low 
Well one day I'm gonna break it 
But here in your eyes 
I see what I need to know 
You're so young you've got alibis 
And you stripped away my disguise 
Ain't it so 
Day or night 
You make me feel alright 
Ain't it funny how the time flies 
Gazing in your eyes 
Who in the world even cares 
We're all gettin' older 
I'm alone 
I need love 
I'm gonna break it 
Seen my love lose her grip 
She can't take it 
Get high 
Get low 
Well one day I'm gonna break it 
But here in your eyes 
I see what I need to know 
You're so young you've got alibis 
And you stripped away my disguise 
Ain't it so 
Day or night 
You make me feel alright 
Ain't it funny how the time flies 
Gazing in your eyes 
Gazing in your eyes 
Gazing in your eyes
