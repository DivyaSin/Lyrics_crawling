Come into our world 
Let's see what's underneath the surface 
A red light in the dark 
lights the way 
it's the beating of your heart And it shines in the dark 
Come and see what's inside of me Moving faster to the edge 
and nothing matters at all I tried to believe 
what happens to me 
The mirror's falling apart 
this time I'll fuck with your heart 
I want you to know 
I settled the score 
I'm chasing no more for every piece that's gone from here I wonder how you feel 
with all your dirty pretty faces 
A curse that can't be healed 
lingers here 
makes your real thoughts run and hide Won't you swallow your pride 
Come and see what's inside of me It's running out of all source 
A feeling that comes alive 
Lick it all dry because nothing matters at all I tried to believe 
what happens to me 
The mirror's falling apart 
this time I'll fuck with your heart 
I wished we'd reduce 
our long time abuse 
no longer accused 
it's just a heartbeat away Come and see what's inside of me The circle gets closer 
No one left but me 
Try to believe what I cannot see 
Your black colored hair covering your eyes 
Nasty clothes, what you're trying to hide 
I must have been sleeping as this virus grew 
A feeling of hate and I 
I blame you I tried to believe 
what happens to me 
The mirror's falling apart 
this time I'll fuck with your heart 
I wished we'd reduce 
our long time abuse 
no longer accused 
it's just a heartbeat away from here
