Ya know sometimes in your life 
You may find it hurts to be in love 
Specially when you and the one ya love 
Already belong to somebody else 
You're tied to her and I'm tied to him 
And we don't wanna hurt either one of them 
That's how it is When you're married but not to each other 
Ya gotta go home in the middle of the night 
Try and pretend every things alright 
But it ain't, no it ain't When you're married but not to each other 
Make believe that you've been good 
Give your love to the one you should 
But you can't, no you can't 'Cause you're tied to her and I'm tied to him 
We don't wanna hurt either one of them 
So what can you do, what can you do? When you're married but not to each other 
Ya gotta be careful everywhere you go 
Tryin' to avoid everyone you know 
'Cause people talk, you know they talk When you're married but not to each other 
You've gotta make up alibis 
Hopin' they don't sound like lies 
'Cause if you get caught, and ya might get caught Hurry up and love him 
Hurry up and please him 
And when it gets right 
You've got to leave him 
You better leave him 'Cause you're tied to her, I'm tied to him 
We don't wanna hurt either one of them 
That's how it is, that's how it is When you're married 
But not to each other Hurry up and love him 
Hurry up and please him 
And when it gets right 
You've got to leave him 
You better leave him
