We are the synchronizers 
Send messages through time code 
Midi clock rings in my mind 
Machines gave me some freedom 
Synthesizers gave me some wings 
They drop me through twelve bit samplers 
We are electronic performers 
We are electronics We need to use envelope filters 
To say how we feel 
Riding on magnetic waves 
We search new programs for your pleasure 
I want to patch my soul on your brain 
BPM controls your heartbeats 
We are the synchronizers 
We are electronic performers
