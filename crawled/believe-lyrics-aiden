Lying face down, lying face down 
In the gutter now, so damn proud 
Well, I know, I know, I know 
It's my fault, it's my fault Lying face down, lying face down 
In the gutter now, so damn proud 
Well, I know, I know, I know 
It's my fault, it's my fault In a world where we all just waste away and suffer 
(We just waste away) 
In a place you cry for today 
(We're all going mad) Believe, believe, believe in me 
(I will follow) 
Believe, believe, believe in me 
(I will follow) Lying face down, lying face down 
In the underground, so damn proud 
Well, I know, I know, I know 
It's my fault, it's my fault In a world where we all just waste away and suffer 
(We just waste away) 
In a place you cry for today 
(We've all been brainwashed) Believe, believe, believe in me 
(I will follow) 
Believe, believe, believe in me 
(I will follow) Believe, believe, believe in me 
(I will follow) 
Believe, believe, believe in me 
(I will follow) Love, silence and fade away 
(Darkness, darkness and decay) 
Scarlet kiss and what to say 
(Darkness, darkness and decay) Love, silence and fade away 
(Darkness, darkness and decay) 
Scarlet kiss and what to say 
(Darkness, darkness and decay) Believe, believe, believe in me 
Believe, believe, believe in me Believe, believe, believe in me 
(I will follow) 
Believe, believe, believe in me 
(I will follow) Believe, believe, believe in me 
(I will follow) 
Believe, believe, believe in me
