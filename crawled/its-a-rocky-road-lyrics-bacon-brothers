WRITTEN BY MICHAEL BACON It's a rocky road down Ida's farm 
Past the sticks and stones 
And names that harm 
They don't like her rooster crowing 
Cows and flies and weeds are a growing 
It's a rocky road 
Down Ida's farm It's a rocky road 
Down Bankie's dune 
Made of memories and bits of moon 
Here they come with a zillion dollars 
Crowds of tourists soon to follow 
It's a rocky road 
Down Bankie's dune From the hills of Pennsylvania 
She fights to hold her ground 
To the white sands of Anguilla 
He still hears the sound 
Of music made for no reason at all
