I'm trying, 
Not to be falling, 
When i need you, 
Thinking of you, 
Wanna touch you, 
I'm Drowning inside you, 
Forever and ever and ever... 
How deep is your love 
Your love(x5) 
I'm trying to see u flying, 
Wanna take u into the blue, 
Wanna hold u, 
I'm feeling some bad dreams, 
When you are here, 
There is no fear(x2) 
How deep is your love 
your love(x5) 
I'm falling, 
Inside is feeling, 
So keep me falling, 
Right inside you, 
Having no clue, 
Keep me falling, 
We are just falling, 
Into deep love, 
Having no clue, 
What should we do? 
We'll be falling in.
