One less bell to answer 
One less egg to fry 
One less man to pick up after 
I should be happy 
But all I do is cry (Cry, cry, no more laughter) 
Oh, I should be happy 
(Oh, why did she go) 
I only know that since he left my life's so empty Though I try to forget it just can't be done 
Each time the doorbell rings I still run 
I don't know how in the world 
To stop thinking of him 
(I should be happy) 
'Cause I still love him so 
I end each day the way I start out 
Crying my heart out One less bell to answer 
One less egg to fry 
One less man to pick up after 
No more laughter 
No more love 
Since he went away (Since he went away) 
Since he went away Ooh, A chair is still a chair 
Even when there's no one sitting there 
Well, I'm not meant to live alone 
Turn this house into a home 
When I climb the stair and turn the key 
Oh, please be there 
Still in love with me (One less bell to answer) 
Each time the doorbell rings, I still run 
(One less egg to fry) 
One less man (one less man) to pick up after 
No more laughter, no more love 
Since he went away (Since he went away) 
Since he went away 
All I do is cry.
