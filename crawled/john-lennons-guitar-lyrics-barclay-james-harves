Back in the autumn of seventy 
On the night shift at Abbey Road 
Four young men were recording a song named, 'Galadriel' 
For an album they'd call 'Once Again' The producer was Norman Smith 
Who'd engineered with The Beatles and John 
Whose guitar was to be instrumental that day 
When I came to play I remember it well, as if it was yesterday 
The day that I played, John Lennon's guitar 
I remember it well, as if it was yesterday 
The day that I played, John Lennon's guitar Back in the autumn of seventy 
As I played on my borrowed guitar 
How could I know The Beatles would split the next day 
My heroes break up and go their own way Now autumns they came and they go 
But my friends and my memories remain 
And my heroes, well some of them fell 
From the stage but their light still remains I remember it well, as if it was yesterday 
The day that I played, John Lennon's guitar 
I remember it well, as if it was yesterday 
The day that I played, John Lennon's guitar I remember the day 
I remember the day 
I remember the day 
I remember the day 
The day that I played, John Lennon's guitar I remember the day, as if it was yesterday 
And I know that the memories will never fade 
I remember the day, as if it was yesterday 
The day that I played, John Lennon's guitar
