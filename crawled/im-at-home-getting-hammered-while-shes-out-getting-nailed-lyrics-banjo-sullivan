We started in the morning, carried well into the night 
Throwing dirty dishes with all our might 
Sad commentary on a marriage that has failed 
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed Police pulled into my trailer park 
Domestic violence cost [Incomprehensible] after dark 
Late night with her boss, says they're trying to make a sale 
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed I'm at home drinking whiskey in my easy chair 
Watching Jerry Lawler pulling Andy Kauffman?s hair 
Had a suspicion, so I opened up her mail 
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed She used to bring me beer and love all over me 
Right before I went on disability 
My wiggler ain't so straight, I got whiskey dick 
She don't perk it up 'cause, 'cause her ankles got so thick
