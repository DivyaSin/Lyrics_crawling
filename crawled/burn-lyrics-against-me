Beautiful to live in poverty 
Just to spite what they're selling 
Take a thousand hits to prove the rest and I'll move in 
Millimeters still won't mean shit against well-done subversion Fathers of invention will one day turn in their graves 
When their own sons and daughters 
Manifest destiny into a lesson to others 
Sent away my crippled let the old ones categorize their deathcamps, they're all dead [Chorus:] 
Burn Burn Burn 
Like they did to the Anarchists at their stakes 
And Burn Burn Burn 
The histories they stole from us 
One day patriotic thugs will dance to songs of justice 
And cringe, and rack guns of shame. [Chorus x2] Well it may take a team of well-rounded hoodlums 
In full riot gear to unrest objection 
A well-controlled media to pick out our terrorists 
When beaurocrats start dying from cancer There are already businessmen who'll market bottled water 
And purified aerosol solution, guess who's their target 
Seven approaching a measure off the map 
And you'll see me dance in the street once again [Chorus x3] And it'll Burn Burn Burn like they did to the Anarchists 
And it'll Burn Burn Burn like the histories they stole from us 
One day patriotic thugs will dance to songs of justice 
And give apologies for a immeasurably acted perfection [Chorus x2]
