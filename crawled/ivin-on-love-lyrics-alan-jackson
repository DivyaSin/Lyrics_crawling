Two young people, without a thing 
Say some vows and spread their wings 
And settle with just what they need 
Living on love 
She don't care 'bout what's in style 
She just likes the way he smile 
It takes more than marvel and time 
Living on love Living on love, buying on time 
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime 
It's like that old fashioned storybook rhyme 
Living on love 
It sounds simple that's what you're thinking 
Love can walk through fire without blinking 
It doesn't take much, when you get enough 
Living on love Two old people, without a thing 
Children gone but still they sing 
Side by side on that front porch swing 
Living on love He can't see anymore 
She can barely sweep the floor 
Hand in hand they walk through that door 
Just living on love Living on love, buying on time 
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime 
It's like that old fashioned storybook rhyme 
Living on love 
It sounds simple that's what you're thinking 
Love can walk through fire without blinking 
It doesn't take much, when you get enough 
Living on love Living on love, buying on time 
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime 
It's like that old fashioned storybook rhyme 
Living on love 
It sounds simple that's what you're thinking 
Love can walk through fire without blinking 
It doesn't take much, when you get enough 
Living on love 
No, It doesn't take much, when you get enough 
Living on love
