I wanna see the pages turn 
Want to let the bridges burn 
I don't want more than what I earn 
I'm only in from out of town 
I'm only up from underground I always try to play it cool 
End up feeling like a fool Maybe you're right 
(Maybe you're right) 
Maybe I'm wrong, oh, just maybe But, baby tonight 
(Baby tonight) 
Maybe so long Starting over once again 
I only quit before the end 
Need to break before I bend 
I'm always looking inside out 
I never question what I doubt I always judge before the trial 
I'm in a rush to wait a while Maybe you're right 
(Maybe you're right) 
Maybe I'm wrong, oh, just maybe But, baby tonight 
(Baby tonight) 
Maybe so long I would never say forever 
I can't wait that long 
But whenever we're together 
Everything goes wrong, a little wrong I always judge before the trial 
In a rush to wait a while Maybe you're right 
(Maybe you're right) 
Maybe I'm wrong, I, just maybe Baby tonight 
(Baby tonight) 
Maybe so long, oh baby Baby tonight 
(Baby tonight) 
Maybe so long
