[Chorus] 
I can't do for together 
I can do for two more songs 
I can't do for together 
You scaring with together I wanna miss the floor 
Or dancing 
Mighty stop fastest dance 
I give the course 
Just got a songs 
I believe what you feeling 
Give your course after 
Now increase a floor 
I got your dance 
And I middle the dance [Chorus] I not live you together 
I not right dance 
Boy got a candy for kids 
It was the gas course 
Now increase a floor 
I got your dance 
And I middle the dance 
I not do your step (ooh) 
I got increase 
Now increase a floor 
I got your dance 
And I middle the dance [Chorus] I not live together 
Mighty live together 
I not do 
Let's go [Chorus: x2]
