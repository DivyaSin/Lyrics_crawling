Blood, split, mud, stench 
Piggy plays fantastic game 
Puff puff a violent wrench 
Piggy is in charge of pain Essence of evil, bloody machine 
The worst piece of shit I've ever seen 
I will raise my bare fists Even if I have to beg on my knees 
Even if I have to beg on my knees 
Even if I have to beg on my knees I loose control I sell my soul 
I loose control I sell my soul 
I loose control I sell my soul 
I sell my A beast walks its filthy ways 
Like stubborn fuck, no grace 
I'm lost, stuck in a maze Nobody's ever seen such paranoid, horrid place 
Nobody's ever seen such paranoid, horrid place 
Nobody's ever seen such paranoid, horrid place I loose control I sell my soul 
I loose control I sell my soul 
I loose control I sell my soul 
I sell my soul
