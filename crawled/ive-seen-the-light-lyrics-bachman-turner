I've Seen The Light 
Fred Turner Workin' down round the corner 
Things were good and that's a fact 
I've been workin' down round the corner, baby 
Got so bad I can't go back 
There ain't nothing they can do for me 
I'm on my own, I've been set free Looked in the mirror tonight 
Saw the face of fear starin' back at me 
All night I've been awake, 
Wish it was a bad mistake 
It's real, they won't deal I've seen the light, whoa baby, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, whoa baby, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, I've seen the light The boss was on the blower 
Said the bottoms fallen' out 
Yah the man was in a fever pitch 
What we worked for was in doubt 
Said he had to cut the excess fat 
We were it, and that was that Looked in the mirror tonight 
Saw the face of fear starin' back at me 
All night I've been awake, 
Wish it was a bad mistake 
It's real, they won't deal I've seen the light, whoa baby, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, whoa baby, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, I've seen the light 
If there's one thing that this teaches me, I'm on my own 
I've been set free 
I've seen the light Sittin' high up on the rooftop 
Starin' at the street below 
Sittin' high up in the shadow 
Seemed the righteous place to go 
Felt the anger closin' in on me 
Reached way down deep I set it free Looked in the mirror tonight 
Saw the face of fear starin' back at me 
All night I've been awake, 
Wish it was a bad mistake 
It's real, they won't deal I've seen the light, whoa baby, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, whoa baby, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, I've seen the light 
If there's one thing that this teaches me, I'm on my own 
I've been set free 
I've seen the light, oh baby, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, oh baby, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, I've seen the light 
Oh baby, I've seen the light 
I've seen the light, I've seen the light
