Everybody's got to dance 
With the blues sometimes 
Everybody's got feel some things 
They don't want to feel sometimes 
I'd buy you a smile in a minute 
But would you wear it? 
If I had one moment in time 
Would you com down and share it? I want to see you out on the street 
Makin' a scene for everybody 
I want to hear your voice up above 
The crowd and the noise 
Down in the Bowery I hope you live long enough to forget 
Half the stuff they taught you 
When it's all said and done I hope 
You've got your own set of rules 
To hang on to 
I'd buy you a smile in a minute 
But would you wear it? 
If I had one moment of time 
Would you come down and share it? I want to see you out on the street 
Makin' a scene for everybody 
I want to hear your voice up above 
The crowd and the noise 
Down in the Bowery I hope you live long enough to forget 
Half the stuff they taught you 
When it's all said and done I hope 
You've got your own set of rules 
To hang on to 
I'd buy you a smile in a minute 
But would you wear it? 
If I had one moment of time 
Would you come down and share it? I want to see you out on the street 
Makin' a scene for everybody 
I want to hear your voice up above 
The crowd and the noise 
Down in the Bowery
