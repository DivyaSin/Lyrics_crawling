Jumpin' every day like a corked-up bottle 
Shaken up and down without a stop 
Broodin' every night like a big volcano 
Rumblin' and ready to pop my top Did you ever feel like you gotta do somethin' 
Gotta do it soon 'fore the flood bursts through 
Did you ever fear you'll amount to nothin', 
Gotta stop that now, gotta tell the truth I can't take it 
So frustrated 
Somethin's gotta give I'm Pent Up, ready to blow 
Unleash the river, achin' to go 
I'm Pent Up, and way too hot to handle Train on the track 
And I'm not holdin' back 
Baby I gotta let go 
This boy's gonna blow Livin' every day in a pressure cooker 
Temperature is risin' in my veins 
Dyin' every night the frustration's boilin' 
Keepin' it inside's drivin' me insane Now I'm always ridin' on the edge and 
Gonna fall off at a moment's notice 
Finally uncaged, I can't wait no longer 
Now's the right time, ready, set, and blow this I won't make it 
So frustrated 
Somethin's gonna give, oh-oh oh I'm Pent Up, ready to blow 
Unleash the river, achin' to go 
I'm Pent Up, and way too hot to handle I'm Pent Up, so live what I know 
Release the lava, itchin' to flow 
I'm Pent Up, when I got my hands full My time is up 
And I'm gonna erupt 
Come on I'll start the show 
This boy's gonna blow It's too hard to hold it in 
It's time to set myself free 
Time to let go I can't make it 
So frustrated 
Somethin's gotta give I wont' make it 
If I fake it 
This boy's gonna live I'm Pent Up, ready to blow 
Unleash the river, I'm achin' to go 
I'm Pent Up, and I'm way too hot to handle I'm Pent Up, so live what I know 
Release the lava, it's itchin' to flow 
I'm Pent Up, when I got my hands full I'm Pent Up, ready to blow 
Unleash the river, achin' to go 
I'm Pent Up, and I'm way too hot to handle I'm Pent Up, so live what I know 
Release the lava, oh itchin' to flow 
I'm Pent Up, when I got my hands full Train on the track 
And I'm not holdin' back 
Baby I gotta let go 
This boy's gonna blow Gonna blow 
Blow
