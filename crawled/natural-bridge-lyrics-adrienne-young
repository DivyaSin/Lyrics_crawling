Natural Bridge 
by Adrienne Young (Autumn 2006) 
Feel like I been riding for a thousand years 
Down this lonesome road and bitter trail of tears 
But I gotta keep on 
Gotta be strong 
Emptied out this vessel in the desert sand 
It was filled up so many things I couldn't understand 
Yeah I did a lot wrong trying to belong 
What makes you do wrong when you want to belong Damn this dead end road 
Down again I go 
There's a different path that I can see 
And it's waiting for me It's a natural bridge that I'll be crossing over 
A simple high green ridge to bonny fields of clover 
And there my soul will dance again with my true love and all my kin 
The greatest privilege to cross a natural bridge Underneath the trees I breathe the breezes in 
I know it's time to start and I know where to begin 
I got to move on kick back and roll on Damn this dead end road 
Down again I go 
There's a new path that I can see 
And it's waiting for me It's a natural bridge that I'll be crossing over 
A simple high green ridge to bonny fields of clover 
And there my soul will dance again with my true love and all my friends 
The greatest privilege to cross a natural bridge Feel like I been ridin for a thousand years 
Down this lonesome road and bitter trail of tears 
But I gotta keep on 
I am strong
