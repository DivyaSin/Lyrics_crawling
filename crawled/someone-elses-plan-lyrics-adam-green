Now I'm bored and feeling sorry 
for someone elses plan 
Avengeful disected the woman from the man 
Might being held when someone else reached out his hand 
Its good to see you on a face on someones face I know 
Twice approved your name but now you cant grow old 
Your wind is cold Your fever and the cain 
People like us get married every day 
Now Im feeling sorry for everyone you know 
When they lose your weight 
or occupy your hole Dont they wish they could send you back 
but had to pay you toll 
And then they make you smoke a bowl 
Ive been switching cages and I need ur ego glue
