There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes 
In a happy home, I was a king I had a gold throne 
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall 
I still hear the sounds from the places where I was born Up on the hill across the blue lake, 
That's where I had my first heart break 
I still remember how it all changed 
My father said 
Don't you worry, don't you worry child 
See heaven's got a plan for you 
Don't you worry, don't you worry now 
Yeah! Don't you worry, don't you worry now 
Yeah! 
Ooh ooh ooh ooooh! 
See heaven's got a plan for you 
Ooh ooh ooh ooooh! There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind 
We ruled the world, 
Thought I'd never lose her out of sight, we were so young 
I think of her now and then 
I still hear the song, reminding me of her Up on the hill across the blue lake, 
That's where I had my first heart break 
I still remember how it all changed 
My father said 
Don't you worry, don't you worry child 
See heaven's got a plan for you 
Don't you worry, don't you worry now 
Yeah! Don't you worry, don't you worry child 
See heaven's got a plan for you 
Don't you worry, don't you worry now 
Yeah! 
Ooh ooh ooh ooooh! 
See heaven's got a plan for you 
Ooh ooh ooh ooooh! 
Yeah!
