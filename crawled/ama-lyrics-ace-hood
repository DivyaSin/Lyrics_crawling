Mama, can you hear me? 
Mama 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Oh oh 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Mama 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Oh oh oh May eleven special, I was born in God's favor 
Mama gave birth in tears through that hard labor 
I just wanna thank you, ain't no way I could repay you 
Strongest woman that I know, you've been my motivator 
And just know I'll be everything that you said I would 
Only focus is hoping that all my family good 
A lot of ups and downs, a lot of hard times 
A lot of cloudy days, prayin' for that sun to shine 
I was hard headed, granddaddy diabetic 
Lord bless her soul, granny kept the food ready 
Five kids, three jobs, how you ever did it? 
Tryna make a livin, hustle got me reminiscin' 
Daddy chose lust over all us 
Tell me what's the type of man who never kept in touch 
How do you feel? Mama showed me the real 
Can't recover them years, too much emotion to feel 
We was covered in bills, mama takin' them pills 
Got er stressin' for days, then why the fuck ain't you here 
It's why I love her to death 
She was there when they left 
Prayin' for me every day, Lord honor my steps 
I hope you hear my Lord, if yo mama's around 
Gotta cherish the love, gotta savor the smile 
Never want for nothing, gotta keep it 100 
You are the epitome of a strong black woman, 
You hear me? Mama, can you hear me? 
Mama 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Oh 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Mama 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Hear me? Hear me? Hear me? Hear me? Dear mama I just wanna say I love you 
And if you left today I don't know what I'd ever do 
Sayin this boy ain't nothing like yo mama 
Through the road blocks, fake friends and the drama 
Mo girlfriends and a chick named karma 
Real eyes realize I could call on her 
Any time of day, any time of night 
Been there from the start up on this journey called life 
Now I'm twenty four and grown, tourin' doin' shows 
Thankful for it all, know it's been a bumpy road 
As I'm starin at my Rollie, started reminiscin' 
Boy my bad ass, used to run from all them woopings 
But I understand, made me a better man 
You hear me mama told you would never want again 
I put my pain on the beat, and fed it all to the streets 
I'm a believer in me and now we livin' the dream 
Oh Lord, a black boy up outta Deerfield 
Who'da thought that I'd be countin' up a couple mill? 
All on TV and on magazines with label deals 
Talkin bout the struggle, start to give a nigga chills 
God and some prayers, people still hate 
Wasn't for my mama, don't know where I'd be today 
Lord have mercy 
Don't know where I'd be today Ain't no love like mama's love 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Ain't no love like mama's love 
Ain't no love like mama's love 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Like mama's love 
Ain't no love like mama's love 
Mama, can you hear me? 
I hear you baby 
Son, see no matter how bad, no matter how sad 
No matter how mad 
Son I'm just a phone call away When all your friends 
all your false friends are gone 
You know mama's gonna stay 
And stay and stay and stay 'cause I'm mama 
Yea, that's how we do 
That's how we do Ain't no love like mama's love 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Ain't no love like mama's love 
Ain't no love like mama's love 
Like mama's love, like mama's love Ain't no love like mama's love 
Mama, can you hear me? 
Ain't no love like mama's love 
Ain't no love like mama's love 
Like mama's love, like mama's love

I hear you baby 
I'm talkin' bout mama 
I'm talkin' bout mama See when your friends tell you how 
They gon' show up and come 
And ain't nobody there but god and mama 
For your support I know you know about a mama 
Oh you can count on mama all day, all night, anyway
