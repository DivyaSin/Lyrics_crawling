The cold December day I came 
You knew me well but I was a stranger 
You suffer me, oh oh you suffer me 
Ooo suffer me 
Why you suffer me I touched you 
You felt me heart 
Oh how you suffer me oh you suffer me 
Oh suffer me 
Why did you suffer me Oh suffer me why did you 
How could you suffer me 
Suffer wo oa oh
