I take it all to heart 
Don't point the finger 
Choose the winner 
Hold your own 
It's never been always 
Who's the liar 
I'm the coward 
The letter read like this Of all the sinners I walk before 
I can't deny 
Somehow you're seeing it 
So you're the one who took the fall 
And it's bringing us together 
Don't ask me why 
Somehow I'm seeing blue 
And I'm breaking after all 
This could last forever The choice has always been 
To take advantage 
Ride it to the top 
Still I'm caught again 
I see this coming 
See this coming Through Of all the sinners I walk before 
I can't deny 
Somehow you're seeing it 
So you're the one who took the fall 
And it's bringing us together 
Don't ask me why 
Some how I'm seeing blue 
And I'm breaking after all 
This could last forever We'll see if I start coming clean 
You'll see that I'm still missing I can't deny 
Somehow you're seeing it 
So you're the one who took the fall 
And it's bringing us together 
Don't ask me why 
Somehow I'm seeing blue
