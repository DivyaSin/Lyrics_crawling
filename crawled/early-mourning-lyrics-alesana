Last night I forgot 
How the sound of your voice whispered sweet goodbyes 
Your eyes, left to die 
I'm alone to understand why 
Why not one more night? 
One last kiss goodbye? 
Me sweet love, tonight 
I hope the stars still spell out your name where you are 
Kiss my closing eyes 
Help me sleep, without you I'm so lost 
And tonight, I cry, tell me why 
I can't live without your warm embrace 
Why not one more night? 
One last kiss goodbye? 
My sweet love, tonight 
I hope the stars still spell out your name where you are 
I close my eyes and you are everything I see... Goodbye... 
Goodbye to you my love 
I won't forget you 
I'll see you soon 
Goodbye my love 
Goodbye to you my love 
I won't forget you 
Bye bye, love
