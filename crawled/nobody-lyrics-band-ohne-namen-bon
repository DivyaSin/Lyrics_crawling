Lyrics: G. Gross, C. Capek 
Music: G. Gross, C. Capek, G. Raschke Refrain: 
No, nobody does it better than you 
Nobody makes me feel like you do 
Cause you are the sun that makes my life shine 
And you are the love I've always tried to find I could spend a lifetime 
Telling you how bright you shine 
And that you're one in a million 
I'd give you all my time 
And that you're worth more 
Than anything that I could ever buy, 
If I could, I would give you my life. So tell me if there's something that you want, 
I got it right here. 
If there's something that you ask, 
I got it right here. 
If there's something that you see 
That you like 
That you feel 
That you might need, 
I got it right here And if there's ever something bugging you 
Or troubling you, 
Then I'll be right there 
Hugging you and snuggling you 
Until the trouble is trough, 
Cause baby girl, we were meant to be 
One team 
You and me 
I can see Nobody 
Filling me with life like you and 
Nobody 
Who could be my wife like you and 
Nobody, 
I just want to rise with you to skies so blue Refrain You can make a man 
Give you all that he's got, 
And baby 
You can make a man 
Treat you hotter than hot, 
And baby 
You can make a man 
Feel that he's on top. 
He'll never stop treating you right, 
No, he'll never stop, no I'll spend the rest of my life 
Giving you diamonds and pearls 
Giving you my whole world, my girl. 
And even more, I'll give you 
Things that money can't buy. 
My friendship, 
My time, 
My love, 
My life Nobody filling me with life like you and 
Nobody who could be my wife like you and 
Nobody, I just want to rise with you to skies so blue Refrain I need nothing but you 
All day and night 
And I know that us two 
Can make it right 
I want you to be by my side Refrain 2x
