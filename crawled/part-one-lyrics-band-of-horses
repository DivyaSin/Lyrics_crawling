The bottom, the earth, I have to fall 
But you really caught me 
You really caught me, dear 
At the bottom where I'd fallen And slowly dear, ask that you dance with me 
Here with the shades down 
Lights off When I didn't know you 
And everything I do 
Done badly Now, I'll love you always 
Even when I say 
You distract me And sit out tonight in some strange place 
If we have no friends here 
Well, I had a few to begin with To wake next to you in the morning 
And good morning to you 
How do you do? 
Hey, good morning to you! 
More covers for you 
Sleep soundly dear, 'cause I have to go And I'll love you always 
When we leave this place 
And drive back to Carolina 
And down to Savannah and 
Stay
