Wake up Jack get ready 
Here we come to rock this town 
Hold on tight and steady 
Over under sideways down You must feel the power 
Fix your eyes upon the stage 
Watch us now devour 
Everything that gets in our way [Chorus] 
Your fascination with my creation 
Adds stimulation rock til you drop 
Hard rock nation lost generation 
End the frustration get shot full of rock 
Get shot full of rock get shot full of rock Taste the hard rock candy 
Guaranteed to melt in your mout 
Jump back now Jim Dandy 
East west north and south [Chorus] Catch the rush all over 
Take a chance if you dare 
ain't got time for posers 
Look out Dick you better beware [Chorus] You must feel the power 
Fix your eyes upon the stage 
Watch us now devour 
Everything that gets in our way [Chorus]
