Come with me down town 
Money money down down down 
Ain't nobody gotta find out why 
You commin with me tonight 
On my joy ride 
Let me tell you that I'm 
Ready for tonight 
Gonna move my body 
Better hold me tight 
Do it, do it, do it 
Go ahead tonight 
Do it, do it, do it 
Just go ahead and try 
Do it do it 
Go ahead and let it happen tonight, I'm on that Superflying 
Energetic 
Baby don't go, baby don't go over there 
Come into my room or in my harem, really don't Care 
I see you standing there, going solo very mad What's on inside your head, just come on here And spread those legs out 
Once you're in, can't get out 
Arabic, just about 
Taste my meat, eat it out 
Swing and shout, won't go without it tonight 
Come with me down town 
Money money down down down 
Ain't nobody gotta find out why 
You commin with me tonight 
On my joy ride 
Let me tell you that I'm 
Ready for tonight 
Gonna move my body 
Better hold me tight 
Do it, do it, do it 
Go ahead tonight 
Do it, do it, do it 
Just go ahead and try 
Do it do it 
Go ahead and let it happen tonight, I'm on that Superflying 
Energetic
