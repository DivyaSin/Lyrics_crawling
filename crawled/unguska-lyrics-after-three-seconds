Dead still in the city as six million faces drain of blood 
Hearts beat in denial, we can't hope to stem the coming flood 
This cerberus, it comes for us, we bear a watchful eye 
Our natures true now shining through, our lives all consumed by a constant watch of the sky When the rain pours in we drown in sin to quench our thirst 
Now let the end begin, there's something indescribable 
In living when the end is so damn close 
As we drink the dying dose Bright sky in the summer shines another day on this failing sphere 
Don't breathe too deeply, no time to exhale when the end is near 
Apophis, who is fueling you to shatter what was whole? 
What lies between this holocene and in the great after, who will reclaim this soul? When the rain pours in we drown in sin to quench our thirst 
Now let the end begin, there's something indescribable 
In living when the end is so damn close 
As we drink the dying dose 
We're martyrs to a cause we never knew 
When there's nothing left to do but die
