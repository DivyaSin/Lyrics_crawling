I met her on the walk way 
staring as she walked pass 
she looked back at me side ways and said 
i cant help but to ask 
I Said You Wanna Be Startin Somethin 
You Got To Be Startin Somethin 
I Said You Wanna Be Startin Somethin 
You Got To Be Startin Something we end up going back to her place 
wish i could tell you what i saw 
the sexiest women in a negligee 
we hit off until the mornning 
Until you hear her say ADLIB (AKON) 
ama ma se, 
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa 
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, 
Ma ma coo sa (10)X VERSE 1 (AKON)
