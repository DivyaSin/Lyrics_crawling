Oooooo 
Fly so high Just let me fly my kite 
into a starry night 
I will make it glow in the dark 
The birds will catch a fright Just let me skip with the turtles 
Make the sky turn people 
I'll touch the stars and make them quake 
Or shall I make them giggle? Ha ha ha ha ha 
ooooo 
Ha ha ha ha ha 
Ohhhhh I I I'm gonna be one of the stars 
Because I know it's where I belong 
I'll guide my little kite 
And watch it fly on and on Just let me hide my kite 
From the stormy night 
I will keep it safe and warm 
And sing a lullaby Because the flowers speak to me 
When they're dancing happily 
I'll paint a house with the rainbow 
Or shall I surf the sea? Ha ha ha ha ha 
ooooo 
Ha ha ha ha ha 
Ohhhhh I I I'm gonna be one of the stars 
Because I know it's where I belong 
I'll guide my little kite 
And watch it fly on and on Ohhh my little kite 
will bring better days 
Wash away the rain 
break out the sun rays 
We can take this world 
out of their haze 
Figure out this 
never-ending maze Just let me fly my kite 
into a starry night 
I will make it glow in the dark 
The birds will catch a 
fright
