Pack the bag, I'm goin' away 
It's over, goin' home 
Thank your people, but it's too much to stay 
It's done now, I'm goin' home Now I feel like I'm one 
Now I feel like I'm due 
Spent my time in some fun 
And for that, I thank you 
It's over, it's over, it's over, I'm goin' home 
It's over, it's over, and for that I thank you Now I feel like I'm one 
Now I feel like I'm due 
Spent my time in some fun 
And for that, I thank you 
It's over, it's over, it's over, I'm goin' home 
It's over, it's over, and for that I thank you
