Oh Heimdall, my shield in the bay gone fight 
Be thanked for your aid last night 
Were you not there against wrathful foe? 
Would the life out of my body go? For the day when my life I leave 
Today this promise you I give 
On the day when you the Gijallar horn blow 
I will be by you with rage like a fiery glow We affirm our alliance a new 
And I fight until death beside you
