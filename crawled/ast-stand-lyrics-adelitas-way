I'm all alone 
You're far away 
Never learned from my mistakes 
I should have known 
Just what to say 
To make you want to stay 
You were always the one giving 
I was always there to take it 
Take your heart and break it 
Oh And I'll never make it without you 
I need a second chance 
Cause I want to make it about you 
I'm making my last stand 
It took a moment to say 
It wasn't you it was me 
I couldn't let you in 
Now I'm ashamed I pushed you away from me 
Now I'm afraid it's too late to save again Miss you the most when I sleep 
Turning nightmares into dreams 
Can't lose hope 
It's killing me 
(killing me) 
I'm the one who made you leave 
But if I just take a chance now 
Open up and finally reach out 
(reach out) 
Can I save it all somehow 
Oh And I'll never make it without you 
I need a second chance 
Cause I want to make it about you 
I'm making my last stand 
It took a moment to say 
It wasn't you it was me 
I couldn't let you in 
Now I'm ashamed I pushed you away from me 
Now I'm afraid it's too late to save again
