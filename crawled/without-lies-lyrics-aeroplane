There wouldn't be any artists 
No jugglers or tightrope walkers 
Without lies in my eyes 
Life would be straight up sad A bit of sun to melt the ice flow 
A good disguise to start the show 
Without lies in my eyes 
Life would be straight up gray 
When I eat cake, I prefer the cherry Changing the scenes, different faces 
Another costume changing places 
Without lies in my eyes 
Life would be pretty boring We wouldn't be great performers 
We'd watch the time just pass us over 
Without lies in my eyes 
Life would be pretty bad 
In the champagne, I prefer the bubbles A bit of sun to melt the ice flow 
A good disguise to start the show 
Without lies in my eyes 
Life would be straight up gray When I eat cake, I prefer the cherry 
I prefer the cherry, I prefer the cherry
