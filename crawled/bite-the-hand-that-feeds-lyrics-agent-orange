I asked a million questions, you looked so surprised 
Forgot a million things that I had memorized 
Yes, but I confess, I never dreamed 
I had done my best or so it seemed Take the time to waste a thousand years 
Touch the face and wipe away the tears 
Speak the truth and break the heart that bleeds 
Stab the back and bite the hand that feeds Think of things that made you cry when you were young 
Realize at last your life has just begun 
Think of lonely places far away 
I'm sorry but I don't know what to say to you Take the time to waste a thousand years 
Touch the face and wipe away the tears 
Speak the truth and break the heart that bleeds 
Stab the back and bite the hand that feeds Close your eyes remember me from long ago 
Never say a word no one will ever know 
Think of life the way it was before 
Imagine what the future has in store for you Take the time to waste a thousand years 
Touch the face and wipe away the tears 
Speak the truth and break the heart that bleeds 
Stab the back and bite the hand that feeds
