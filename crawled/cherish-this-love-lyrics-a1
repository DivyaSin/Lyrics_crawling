Sorry for making you cry 
For turning away as you walk on by 
Baby, I need to be strong 
And I need to move on with my life You know it's not that I don't care 
So don't make me feel bad, it's not fair 
Baby, you know all the reasons 
I made my decisions in life Now a girl's gotta do, what a girl's gotta do 
And a boy has to become a man 
And I'm sorry for saying but it's love that I need 
And the love I just can't get from you It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost then I'm found 
It happened so fast, I knew it would last 
From the first time I first looked in your eyes Although it's so soon, this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears, she buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more You know it's not easy to do 
Turning my back on me and you 
Baby I need someone there 
Who will love me and care for my life Smiles they turned into tears 
And all of my dreams they all disappeared 
Baby this cannot be right 
So, I'll turn down the light on our love Now a boy's gotta do, what a boy's gotta do 
And a girl has to do what she can 
And I'm sorry for saying but it's love that I need 
And the love I just can't get from you It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost then I'm found 
It happened so fast, I knew it would last 
From the first time I first looked in your eyes Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears, she buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more And everything that could gone wrong 
Has gone wrong at some time 
Now I can see the light, it was love at first sight 
And I'm not gonna let this girl go It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost then I'm found 
It happened so fast, I knew it would last 
From the first time I first looked in your eyes Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears, she buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
Yes, I will with you
