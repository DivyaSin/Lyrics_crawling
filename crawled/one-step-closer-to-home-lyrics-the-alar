Well, back in '75 
When the kid was on the line 
And he felt no pain 
'Cause there was none 
He would bend in the wind 
Take in anything 
Like sniffin' roses 
And it was alright 
Until he fell 
And cut his hand 
He just could not understand 
He'd run away 
Blame pretense 
For defence 
Or plain innocence Say that's alright 
The harder it fights 
I'm one step closer to home 
The deeper it bites 
I'm one step closer to home 
And you can tie my hands 
Or whip my back 
I can't give in 
'Til the sky turns black 
I may get lost I'm ONE STEP CLOSER TO HOME Oh yeah he ran 
Hitched, rides 
Travelled light 
Left his bags behind 
Said he'd lost them 
He said that's O.K. 
I get money and a smile 
From place to place 
And they don't mind 
I've had the heads of business men and I just gave them 
Right back again 
I've got no need 
For device, disguise 
Or for their compromise Said that's airight The tougher it gets 
I'm one step closer to home 
The more that I sweat 
I'm one step closer to home 
And you can tie my hands 
Or whip my back 
I can't give in 
'Til the sky turns black 
I may get lost 
I'm ONE STEP CLOSER TO HOME There ain't no need for this at all, at all 
Surely you can help me out 
Say, I know a lot of people just like you 
Plently to live for and nothing to lose 
So tear it all down 
Smash it all up 
Break it all down and then just Build it up Build it up 
Ah now build it up 
Oh you build it up (Build it up) 
Ah now build it up (Build it up) 
Ah build it up 
Build it up, Build it up, Build it up, up, up, up And the tougher it gets 
And the more that I sweat 
And the harder it fights 
And the deeper it bites 
I'm one step closer to home 
And the harder it fights 
I'm one step closer to home 
And you can tie my hands 
Or whip my back 
I can't give in 
'Til the sky turns black 
I may get lost 
I'm ONE STEP CLOSER TO HOME
