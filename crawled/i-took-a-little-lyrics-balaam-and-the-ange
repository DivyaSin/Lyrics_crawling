I've been bad so I've been told 
Easy tempted easy sold 
Been persuaded once too much 
Can't resist can't get enough 
Past the limits of desire 
Off the edge into the fire 
I took a little 
But the little took alot 
I took a little 
And I really oughta stop 
Passion pleasure fantasy 
Standing there right next to me 
One more taste of something sweet 
One more taste of ecstasy
