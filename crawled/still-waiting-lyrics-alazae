Chorus (2 times) 
Im still waiting if it take two weeks two months two years Im still Im waiting 
I done shed a lot of blood a lot of sweat a lot of tears Im still, still waiting 
if it take two weeks two months two years Im still Im waiting 
I done shed a lot of blood a lot of sweat lot of tears Im still, still waiting Verse 1 
Still waiting on the day ima get that high five 
Still waiting on the day I hear them say that shit live 
I know I been working hard and I done did a lot 
But everyday Im still in the lab boiling the pot 
My destiny is certain but my time still a mystery 
So when it finally happen all you haters dont say shit to me 
You aint done shit for me except for try to be 
My downfall then when I make it wanna ball with me 
Man what you smoking on cuz you aint nothing better 
Fake ass friends still waiting on that cheddar 
Only God know my route so I know Im never late 
After everybody gave up and left ima still wait Chorus (2 times) 
Im still waiting if it take two weeks two months two years Im still Im waiting 
I done shed a lot of blood a lot of sweat a lot of tears Im still, still waiting 
if it take two weeks two months two years Im still Im waiting 
I done shed a lot of blood a lot of sweat lot of tears Im still, still waiting Verse 2 
They say if it aint hard to get it, it aint worth having it 
I guess my strife worth a lot I got a future dating on it 
Im still waiting on it dont know what the future holds 
I know its great I can sell it better than its told 
How long will it take I feel like its under my nose 
After sweat and tears I gotta be the next one chose 
All I can do is footwork one step at a time 
Baby steps big steps til its my time 
Yea its my rhyme and you cant take that 
You can try hard but cant duplicate that 
Dedication strong as oak you cant shake that 
Take a glimpse in my future they screaming Zaes back Chorus 
Im still waiting if it take two weeks two months two years Im still Im waiting 
I done shed a lot of blood a lot of sweat a lot of tears Im still, still waiting 
if it take two weeks two months two years Im still Im waiting 
I done shed a lot of blood a lot of sweat lot of tears Im still, still waiting Im making goals ooutta other peoples dreams 
Im entertaining you while the next bitch sings 
She disappear when she hear the hook and fade to black 
Alazae show up like triple A and save them on a track 
Perseverance what you lack so hit the road jack 
Eliminate dead weight for positive feedback 
When you done all that then patiently sit back 
I stay ready when they call my bags already packed 
Matter face Im ahead of the game 
Ahead of my time so no room for shame 
Stay in your lane, Im on the road to success 
Maybe not now but.. (Im waiting) Chorus 
Im still waiting if it take two weeks two months two years Im still Im waiting 
I done shed a lot of blood a lot of sweat a lot of tears Im still, still waiting 
if it take two weeks two months two years Im still Im waiting 
I done shed a lot of blood a lot of sweat lot of tears Im still, still waiting
