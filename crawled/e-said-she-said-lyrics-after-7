Aw Randy ran what's up. 
We talkin bout girlies 
If you think you're wrong, then you know you're right 
Gettin into my business, just ain't satisfied 
Better stop dippin girl 
It don't become of you 
You got too much time on your hand oh baby If your lovin me 
Keep on lovin me 
Don't let this silly girl distract you from me 
All she wants is 
To get you away from me, don't fall into that trap [Chorus:] 
He said, she said, we said, we don't need it 
He said, she said, we said we don't need it. I know you want me 
But you can't have me 
My love is tied up with my girl right now 
You told her you saw me 
Just the other day, kickin it with the invisible woman How could you try such a silly willy game 
The two of us we're not havin it no way 
My sweet heart is my only lover 
Don't play me like a sho nuff fool nooooo (Aw Kevon here they come talkin that mess) 
(Wait a minute, can I say somethin, 
The girlie ain't got no business in my business) 
(that's right) [Chorus x 2]
