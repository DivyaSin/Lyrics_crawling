They say men and women are worlds apart 
And neither one are willing to travel that far 
But I never bought in to psychological stuff 
And never claimed to be a bonafide genius 
But if men are from Mars and women are from Venus 
I'm going to Venus Strap me in, ship me out, beam me up Scotty 
Take me to the land of those heavenly bodies 
Stay here if you want to but just between us 
If men are from Mars and women are from Venus 
I'm going to Venus Women want a man ain't afraid to commit 
Take 'em out to dinner it's a candle lit 
So I'm giving in to the battle of the sexes 
And calling up ahead to make a reservation 
But if men are from mars and women are from Venus 
I'm going to Venus If you come by the house and I'm not in 
You can call me long long long distance 
Got better things to do than sit around and talk 
'Cause I'm blasting off this big red rock
