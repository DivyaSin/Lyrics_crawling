There's no place I'd rather be 
Than on this blanket here with you 
Watching that big red sunset 
Into a Caribbean blue 
We're sure it's hot down here 
Or maybe it's just you Baby let's get sand 
In places sand just don't belong 
Let's let the ocean waves 
Gently serenade us 
With a sexy island song 
There's no one around 
And you keep turning me on and on and on 
Baby let's get sand 
In places sand just don't belong Well I'm glad we stole that bottle 
From a hotel tiki bar 
And I'm glad the moon ain't out tonight 
So we can hide out in the dark 
Let's show off our tan lines 
To that endless sea of stars Baby let's get sand 
In places sand just don't belong 
Let's let the ocean waves 
Gently serenade us 
With a sexy island song 
There's no one around 
And you keep turning me on and on and on 
Baby let's get sand 
In places sand just don't belong Instr. Baby let's get sand 
In places sand just don't belong 
By tomorrow morning 
Baby we'll be boarding 
That plane and flyin' home 
There's no one around 
God you're turning me on and on and on 
Baby let's get sand 
In places sand just don't belong 
Baby let's get sand 
In places sand just don't belong
