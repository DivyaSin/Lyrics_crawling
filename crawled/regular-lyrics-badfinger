Give him all he wants, anything he wants 
Lady, he's a regular 
Give it all for free, leave the bill for me to pay 
Help him all you can, any way you can 
Lady, he's a regular 
If you do it right, you'll be coming home tonight 
CHORUS: Lady have you ever been here (once or twice)You know I'm always in here (is it nice?)And any time you're passing, please feel free 
Give him all he wants, anything he wants 
Lady, he's a regular, like me [guitar solo (Joey Molland)] CHORUSGive him all he wants, anything he wants 
Lady, he's a regular, like me 
Oh, he's a regular 
I say, he's a regular, like me, oh 
Oh, do you like to be beside the seaside? Do I like to be beside the sea?
