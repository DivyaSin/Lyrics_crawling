words and music: Steven Rhodes 
I'm so blocked 
I can't write 
I try and think 
every night 
my tied up brain 
tries to free 
itself from mental captivity 
sit in my room 
stare at the light 
it burns my eyes 
300 bright 
I'm so bored 
I'm good to start 
I never thought this'ed be my part 
Chorus: 
I stare and I wonder and I ponder and I blink 
Wave my hand before my eyes find a crucial dream 
If any of this has made sense so far 
Just raise your hand and I'll begin again 
I walk down the street 
Hot city night 
Here comes the sleet 
I have no beat 
In my head it comes to me 
Reflections of what 
I'll never be 
Chorus 
But that crucial dream, I need so bad 
Is what I always get, but what I never had
