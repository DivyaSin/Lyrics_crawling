Locusts are coming I am the funeral dancer on the outer wave... Spine will twist, heads will cave the outer wave I am the funeral dancer on the outer wave... Spine will twist, heads will cave the outer wave Plastic heads with painted sockets and death rode through the sky like a rocket So this is it Everything dies so fast With dust on your lips You're a dead motherfucker Wading through a world of shit You were born to die like this The fiends nod off after bloodsex and blasphemy Tell me do you exist? You were born to die like this for me Chin smeared red with conspiracy Chins smeared red with conspiracy With dust on your lips Tell me do you exist? You were born to die like this -?- Pale spirits laughing into the abyss You were born to die like this With dust on your lips Pale spirits laughing into the abyss You were born to die like this, baby Tell me do you exist? You were born to die like this Naked and tripping, killing flowers Empty is the urge to devour I'm dead bored with your deathless blues Scream for me, and I'll die for you Scream for me, I'll die for you I'm dead bored with your deathless blues Devour...(12x)
