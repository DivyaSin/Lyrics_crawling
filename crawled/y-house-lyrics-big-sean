Bitch, do I even gotta ask now? 
Who the fuck are you? Do you even got you a pass? 
I don't know why you cuffin' yo girl, she ain't even got her no ass 
Middle fingers to all of the nonbelievers 
Not only did I beat the odds, I also got even 
Took a spot up on the throne, I see myself see myself 
Said it twice 'cause history repeats itself 'peats itself 
Man I can't even lie, I be high I be high 
Mother fuck drinkin' and drivin', I'd rather get high and fly 
I'm out of here, like outer wear 
We are not the same, you are not a player 
My house is somewhere off in the woods, girls in my bed like I'm papa bear 
They say hard work pays off, wrong it pays good as hell

But you don't know nothin' about that, shit I start my mornin' with the paper 
Bitch I'm rich free press, hundreds on all the pages 
And you can't slow me down, I'm sorry there's no delay 
Me and my committee run the city, you just tryin' to join the relay 
Leader of the new school, reportin' from the PA 
These niggas call me 'cause but I don't know why, 'cause we can't relate 
I got yo sister doin' thangs on camera I can't replay 
But she's a waste of time, fuck I could've had a V-8 
I turn thousands to milli's, it's time to renovate the ceiling 
I'm turning houses to buildings, hustle while you out here chilling 
What's the wordy I'm certainly getting rich in a hurry 
I swear I fuck 'til I'm tired, I'm getting high 'til it's blurry 
I'm from the dirty glove, where hammers turn crews into jury's 
They'll make you sit down, but as long as you with me ain't no worries 
Man I'm puttin' on for my crew, never for these hoes 
I'm puttin' on for my city, she puttin' on her clothes Shit, whose house is this? 
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit 
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit 
They told me a nigga wouldn't amount to, shit 
Nigga, whose house is this? 
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit 
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit 
But you don't know nothin' about that, shit Bow down
