Shifting the chair on the porch 
For a better position to enjoy the warmth 
Of the sun to keep warm And working the needle and twine 
Lost in the furthest recess of the mind 
It is calm 
There is peace 
A cat on his lap and a dog at her feet But oh the heart of a man 
The secrets they bury within 
And oh the causes that force his poor hand 
Lead to be misled at those deceiving hand And it's a night among easily described 
Misunderstanding our thoughts by and by 
I'm barely here if even at all A fear of the misunderstood 
Invites the violence right in chasing off all the good 
We brought all on ourselves 
Let it straight by the words of somebody else And oh the life of a man 
His head above the water and pushed under again 
And oh I've seen it one too many times 
It's a test of the spirit versus 
The health of the mind Oh bring relief to him now 
And the people he loves 
Oh I know the feeling's the feeling but 
Not what it's called oh Oh the will of a man 
And all his well meaning intent 
And oh the thought of it all 
As far as we've come we're still further to go Oh all the years we lost 
They don't mean nothing at all 
Oh lifting the spirit impression of a son 
Oh bring some peace to his heart and a wondering thought 
Bring some peace to this world and keep passin' it on
