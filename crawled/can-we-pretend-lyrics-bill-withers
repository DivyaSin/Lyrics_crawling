Can We Pretend 
Can we pretend 
That from now on 
There is no yesterday 
Paint a portrait of tomorrow 
With no colors from today [Chorus] 
There's a light that shine in your face sometimes 
That takes my feeling wraps them around your need 
But there's shadow hiding in your heart sometimes 
That makes my feelings turn back in on me Can we pretend 
The pain is gone 
And go our merry way 
Paint a portrait of tomorrow 
With the colors bright and gay [Chorus]
