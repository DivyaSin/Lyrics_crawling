[First Verse] 
Oh, well, I light a cigarette 
To choke on the smoke 
My cough laughs so loudly 
But I'm broke like a joke 
The man in the tie 
Keeps his dress pants clean 
But his wife doesn't know 
Of the women he has seen 
He says now "True love 
It rarely shows 
But you ain't never been on 
American Road" [Second Verse] 
Well, I keep on clappin' 
But I'm not quite sure what for 
I wipe and drag my feet 
Only to find dirt on the floor 
Susie plays a waitress 
Bottom wage at the bar 
She claims she's an actress 
And that dreams don't get you far 
She says,"Life, yeah 
It's pretty cold 
But you can finding meaning on 
American Road" [Third Verse] 
And I square dance down the street 
To the singing of a mime 
He's stuck in some French ice box 
And frozen for all time 
There's some hipsters hating hobos 
And beatniks blaming bums 
Until the NRA comes waltzing down 
Waving all my guns 
And Charlton Heston 
He says, "Hello! Welcome son to 
American Road!" [Instrumental] [Fourth Verse] 
And there's a presidential fool 
Preaching at the crowd 
But the congregation's deaf 
Because his ego's much too loud 
I walk a fine line 
And the gypsies love to dance 
I read the Bible 
And the abide to Kerouac 
They say, "The rhetoric, it's getting bold! 
But the truth lies on 
American Road!" [Fifth Verse] 
The smoke begins to rise 
As my cigarette subsides 
It's the changing of the guard 
And the rising of the tide 
It's some lazy revolution 
That'll probably never be 
They claim it's evolution 
Or the creation story 
"Yeah, whatever it is, it fits the mold! 
But I'll keep on riding this American Road!"
