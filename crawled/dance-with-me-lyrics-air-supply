Dance with me 
Let me put my arms around you 
Step into the sound 
Close your eyes 
You will see Dance with me 
I don't have an explanation 
I only want to feel part of you next to me I thought about it for so long 
That it could never be 
I ran away from every song 
And wait until the final one 
If you would only dance with me Let me pull your body closer 
Read your lips 
Speak your mind 
When you say... Dance with me 
Don't wait until the music's over 
I don't want to watch as the night slips away I thought about it for so long 
That it could never be 
I ran away from every song 
And wait until the final one 
If you would only dance with me Dance with me 
Dance with me I'm standing here and I confess 
The way you look inside that dress 
Is bringing life unto this wooden floor 
For one last time the band will play 
And I am only steps away 
From feeling like I've never felt before Dance with me 
Let me pull your body closer 
Let me read your lips 
Speak your mind 
When you say... Dance with me 
Don't wait until the music's over 
I don't want to watch as the night slips away I thought about it for so long 
That it could never be 
I ran away from every song 
And wait until the final one 
If you would only dance with me Dance with me 
Let me put my arms around you
