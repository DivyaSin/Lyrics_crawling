Ah, tell me 
What did I dream? 
Cause nothing's as it seems 
On the way back down, for me What did I dream? 
Cause nothing's as it seems 
On the way back round, for me Nothing's gonna keep me from my 
What did I dream? 
No one's gonna keep me from my 
What did I dream? We're on the one road 
Maybe the wrong road 
It's the road to fuck knows where 
We're on the one road 
Maybe the wrong road 
But we're together now so I don't care Nothing's gonna keep me from my 
What did I dream? 
No one's gonna keep me from my 
No one'll fucking keep me from my 
No one's gonna keep me from my 
What did I dream? And if I confide in you today 
I know you don't believe a single word I say 
I found solace in the flood 
And everybody knew that I would 
Cause I'm alright 
And there's a slight crack in my chimney So tell me 
What did I dream? 
What did I dream? 
What did I dream? 
Nothing's as it seems 
On the way back round for me What did I? 
What did I? 
What did I? 
What did I dream?
