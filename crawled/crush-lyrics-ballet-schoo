She's happening like a bolf of lightning 
On a night of drinking that's been serious Sharp tongue, little knife 
I want to k-k-kiss you in a million places 
Harridan be gracious Like you got a crush 
Another weekend of fun 
I am the one who's laughing 
And you have your crush 
Wait on a wafer-thin mattress 
I know, I know, I've been there before Even the ground, a hundred fast 
Floor's down, couldn't hear 
Hit me hard, hit me hard 
As you hurt me now But I need a little boredom 
Comparing hands 
On the bus, the bus home 
It's bad luck you know Like you got a crush 
Another weekend of fun 
I am the one who's laughing 
And you have your crush 
Wait on a wafer-thin mattress 
I know, I know, I've been there before Never wanted, never wanted 
I just chase you 'round the block Ooooh... got a crush 
Another weekend effort 
I'm not the one who's counting 
Like you the same 
Try to remember my name 
Want what you never had
