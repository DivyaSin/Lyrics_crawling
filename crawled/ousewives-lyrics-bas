We ain't 'bout none of that, none of that Look at 'em sippin' the sauce 
You niggas been rippin' us off 
You niggas just talking the most like 
Housewives 
Pockets is full of the hope homie 
Tell 'em we came for the dope only 
For the dope only 
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me Word to Soulo my nigga 
I got the loud and it's lit 
Went to college a bit 
Pissed off my scholarship quick 
Now I'm back in the town 
I'm back in the town A nigga been searching for purpose, there's nothin' around 
Back in there makin' my old moves, wrong move 
Play the game and nigga no rules, poor you 
You could probably lose your soul too, dancing with the devil 
The seeds were planted back in '02, I guess I learned my lesson 
'Cause now a nigga at the O2, London on tilt 
With the G's, ballin' like we watch film 
If you talking Queens, nigga please 
Them niggas reach you, we sould put em on stilts 
I know we cool and all but cool it y'all, they pullin' off him 
My nigga who are y'all? Don't get my crew involved Look at 'em sippin' the sauce 
You niggas been rippin' us off 
You niggas just talking the most like 
Housewives 
Pockets is full of the hope homie 
Tell 'em we came for the dope only 
For the dope only 
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me 
Don't worry about none of that shit 
(You niggas just talking the most like housewives) Millions sold, just get a re-deployment 
'Cause ain't no leader here that we appointed 
We the only one's that matter now 
Cut the chatter down 
Fuck your style, this ain't dappered down 
Wear my own shit, still hittin' bitches like it's batter round 
Call me spring training 
I've been whiling but I'm maintaining 
Young burrow Bassy 
Dawg, whole borough watch me 
Fiends, boys from the block 
But we got hoes in the lobby 
A tree grows from the concrete 
Like he rose to the top 
Cocky, them boys finna flop 
But not me, your boy been alive 
Bas Look at 'em sippin' the sauce 
You niggas been rippin' us off 
You niggas just talking the most like
