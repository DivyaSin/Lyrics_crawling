1992, 1992, 1992, 1992 
I feel like it used to before 
I feel like before to the booth 
The future is over you, over you 
I feel like it's 1992 
I want just to play with the guns 
I found good ways to go 
The past now is over you, over you 
I feel like it's 1992 (x2) 
We are the oyster's flag 
We're taking the world and we're taking the world 
So we've never been lost, just say say 
You've never been lost I feel like it used to before 
What is this we keep running from 
Frustration is over you, over you 
I feel like it's 1992 
Like children we hide from the sun 
We play like we've already won 
The light down are over you, over you 
It feels like it's 1992 (x2) 
We are the oyster's flag 
We're taking the world and we're taking the world 
So we've never been lost, just say say 
You've never been lost I feel like it used to be before 
Now it's gone, it's over you, over you 
It's 1992 
I want just to play with the guns 
I found good ways to go 
The past now is over you, over you 
It feels like it's 1992 (x2) 
We are the oyster's flag 
We're taking the world and we're taking the world 
So we've never been lost, just say say 
You've never been lost
