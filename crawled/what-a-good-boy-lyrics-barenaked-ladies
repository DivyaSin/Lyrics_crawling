When I was born 
They looked at me and said 
What a good boy 
What a smart boy 
What a strong boy And when you were born 
They looked at you and said 
What a good girl 
What a smart girl 
What a pretty girl We've got these chains 
Hanging 'round our necks 
People want to strangle us with them 
Before we take our first breath 
Afraid of change 
Afraid of staying the same 
When temptation calls 
We just look away This name is the hair shirt I wear 
And this hair shirt is woven from your brown hair 
This song is the cross that I bear 
Bear with me 
Bear with me 
Bear with me 
Be with me tonight 
I know that it isn't right 
But be with me tonight I go to school 
I write exams 
If I pass, if I fail, if I drop out 
Does anyone give a damn? And if they do 
They'll soon forget 
'Cause it won't take much for me 
To show my life ain't over yet I wake up scared 
I wake up strange 
I wake up wondering if anything in my life 
Is ever gonna change 
I wake up scared 
I wake up strange 
And everything around me stays the same It's the hair shirt I wear 
And this hair shirt is woven from 
It's woven from your brown hair 
This song is the cross that I bear 
Bear with me 
Bear with me 
Bear with me 
Be with me tonight 
I know that it isn't right 
But be with me tonight I couldn't tell you 
That I was wrong 
I chickened out grabbed a pen and a paper 
Sat down and I wrote this song I couldn't tell you 
That you were right 
So instead I looked in the mirror 
Watched TV, laid awake all night We've got these chains 
Hanging round our necks 
People want to strangle us with them 
Before we take our first breath 
Afraid of change 
Afraid of staying the same 
When temptation calls, yeah This name is the hair shirt I wear 
And this hair shirt is woven from 
Woven from your brown hair 
This song is the cross that I bear 
Bear with me 
Bear with me 
Bear with me 
Be with me tonight And when I was born 
They looked at me and said 
What a good boy 
What a smart boy 
What a strong boy And when you were born 
They looked at you and said 
What a good girl 
What a smart girl 
What a pretty girl, yeah What a pretty girl, hey yeah
