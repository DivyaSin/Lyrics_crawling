Last Sunday Mornin', Lord, Lord Lord (my recollection is that every line repeats) 
Yeaah, Last Sunday Mornin' Lord Lord 
I went huntin for the grey goose, Lord, Lord Lord 
I went huntin for the grey goose, Lord, Lord Lord 
missing bits ? 
Well I took along my shotgun, Lord, Lord, Lord 
repeat 
And along come the grey goose Lord, Lord, Lord 
repeat 
So i raised up my shotgun (sic.) 
and the gun went cabooloo, Lord, Lord, Lord 
repeat 
missing bits 
He was six weeks afallin' 
repeat 
He was nine months a cookin' 
repeat 
and the knife wouldn't cut him 
and the fork wouldn't stick him 
and the last time I seen him 
He was flyin' o'er the ocean 
with a long string of goslin's, 
Lord, Looord, Loooorrrrrd.
