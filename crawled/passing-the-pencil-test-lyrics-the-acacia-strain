She woke up this morning with a bad hangover. Tonight she will be going to bed without her insides. Never cross me. This just in; this is the scene of a crime. Murder victims rarely play their own defense. So you have no chance at winning that. If I cant hear you scream, then no one can. Because I'm right here and my hearing is perfect. I'll say hello to your family in court. And nothing can stop me. And no one can save you. I'll turn your world upside down. There is a reason for my actions. There is a reason I raise my voice. This isn't going to be long term. I'll fuck you, kill you, and leave you.
