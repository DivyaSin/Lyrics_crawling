Loss of life there's no reason why. 
Again and again the bottled death suicide. 
Brain dead in your world of straight lies. 
Bullet in your head shot by the high life. 
Cock the hammer pull the trigger. 
Slow death at the tips of your fingers. 
Smoked your hopes drank your dreams. 
Lost your life it's not hard to believe. 
Your god gave you the right to do nothing. 
Your god gave you the right to do nothing. 
You've been abusing that right too long. 
Your god given right is wrong. 
Your god gave you drug addiction. 
You god made it your religion. 
He's been leading your life along. 
Your god given right is wrong. 
He gave you so much. 
He showed you the way. 
Did much too much. 
You threw it away.
