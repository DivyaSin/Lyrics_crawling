I'm a sinner with a broken heart 
It's not easy but we made it (in)to an art. 
Joy until the morning do us apart 
Without love, without names [Chorus] 
One day, one day of my time 
That's what it takes for you to love me 
One day, one day of my time 
And again and again that melody 
You're never gonna reach that part of me, oh 
One day, one day of my time. All forgotten with the break of dawn 
But our story lingers on 
I'm leaving with my passion full withdrawn 
With your essence already gone [Chorus] Maybe cos I'm a gambler. 
Tired of this Bodegas 
Some say I'm a rambler 
Searching for my Vegas (searching for my Vegas) 
One day is all I need (is all I need) [Chorus x2]
