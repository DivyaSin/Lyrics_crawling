You have seen my ends 
And You know my beginnings 
Like a fashion my heart has come and gone I would never stray 
But I am prone to wander 
Though grace has kept me coming back for me You are just like gravity 
You come in close and pull me back to You 
I would never run away 
No matter where I go You stay with me 
Yeah, You're just like gravity I have raised this wall 
And built up my defenses 
But You always know how to break me down And despite how hard I fall 
You look past my secrets 
And search me till I finally am found You are just like gravity 
You come in close and pull me back to You 
I would never run away 
No matter where I go You stay with me 
Yeah, You're just like gravity
