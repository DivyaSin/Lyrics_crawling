Kill the lights 
We're losing time 
We won't win this fight 
Until our hearts collide We were running away from nothing fast 
Falling down until we finally crashed 
My god, oh my god, can you help me feel anything? 
I'm lost in a city of vultures, moths, and pigs 
Eating away at everything, oh well, yeah, oh well Sometimes I wish I was never born in Hollywood 
I get so scared 
I don't know how to walk 
I'm always running unprepared I'm losing my hope 
I'll sell myself for an hour of fame, I know, it's a shame 
But I don't care 
'Cause you forget who you are when you come to Hollywood This party never seems to end 
When the drugs that kill are our best friends 
Keep showing up and acting out 
Even though we thought we threw them out Hello, hello hospital 
Look up to the sky 
It's time to go I wanna be buried by your side 
Underneath a tree that's hard to find, oh well, yeah, oh well Sometimes I wish I was never born in Hollywood 
I get so scared 
I don't know how to walk 
I'm always running unprepared I'm losing my hope 
I'll sell myself for an hour of fame, I know, it's a shame 
But I don't care 
'Cause you forget who you are when you come to Hollywood (Hollywood) I been dreamin' about a world out there that's just so beautiful 
I been thinkin' about a world out there that's just so beautiful 
It's just so beautiful to me, to me Sometimes I wish I was never born in Hollywood 
I get so scared 
I don't know how to walk 
I'm always running unprepared I'm losing my hope 
I'll sell myself for an hour of fame, I know, it's a shame 
But I don't care 
'Cause you forget who you are when you come to Hollywood I don't care 
'Cause you forget who you are when you come to Hollywood
